PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP TO ENACT COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY POLICY.\n\n    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The United States increasingly depends on foreign \n        nations to supply its energy needs.\n            (2) That dependence leaves the United States increasingly \n        vulnerable to the whims of foreign nations and constitutes a \n        grave and worsening threat to our national security and our \n        economy.\n            (3) Lessening this dependence is not easy, and it cannot be \n        done in a short period of time.\n            (4) The United States can lessen its dependence over a \n        longer period of time by enacting a comprehensive energy policy \n        designed to address the numerous elements of the problem. Those \n        elements include: increased domestic energy production \n        consistent with reasonable environmental guidelines, increased \n        domestic refining and transportation capacity consistent with \n        reasonable environmental guidelines, increased diplomatic \n        pressure on foreign nations that produce oil, increased energy \n        efficiency of engines and generation facilities, increased use \n        of renewable energy sources throughout our economy, and a \n        reformed excise tax structure.\n            (5) Because the elements of a comprehensive energy policy \n        are so varied--involving many groups within society and the \n        jurisdiction of many government agencies and congressional \n        committees--Congress can only enact such a policy with \n        committed leadership from the President.\n            (6) In the meantime, Congress and the President should \n        provide some minimal relief for consumers hit by high gasoline \n        prices.\n    (b) Sense of Congress Resolution.--It is the sense of Congress that \nthe President should take immediate and appropriate action to lead the \nUnited States in developing and enacting a comprehensive energy policy \nto lessen our dependence on foreign nations to supply our energy needs.\n\nSEC. 3.
