FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The maintenance of the Russian HEU Agreement and the \n        timely and satisfactory acquisition of Russian highly enriched \n        uranium (referred to as ``HEU'') under that Agreement by the \n        Department of Energy and the United States Executive Agent is \n        essential to the national security and foreign policy interests \n        of the United States.\n            (2) Implementation of the Russian HEU Agreement will result \n        in the import of a total of 500 metric tons of weapons-grade \n        enriched uranium into the United States, and commencing in \n        1999, the Russian HEU under the agreement will be imported at a \n        rate of 30 metric tons per year. When converted into low \n        enriched uranium (referred to as ``LEU'') for use in nuclear \n        reactors to generate electricity, it will equal a substantial \n        portion of United States utility demand for nuclear fuel.\n            (3) The United States Enrichment Corporation is required at \n        the time of privatization to meet the statutory requirements \n        set out in subsection (b)(2) of this section and, except for \n        subparagraphs (A) and (H), following privatization. The \n        execution of the Russian HEU Agreement will significantly \n        increase the supply of LEU fuel available in the United States \n        marketplace; and, as a result and in order to balance supply \n        with demand, the privatized United States Enrichment \n        Corporation may have to take actions contrary to or \n        inconsistent with maintaining long-term viability, continued \n        operation of the gaseous diffusion plants, and a reliable and \n        economical domestic source of uranium mining, enrichment, and \n        conversion services, and other statutory requirements referred \n        to in subsection (b)(2).\n            (4) The principal responsibility for ensuring the faithful \n        implementation of the United States obligations under the \n        Russian HEU Agreement, which is a government-to-government \n        agreement, lies with the Department of Energy; and the \n        execution of those obligations is an inherently governmental \n        function under the foreign policy of the United States.\n            (5) Therefore, the Department of Energy shall, subject to \n        appropriations, acquire directly or from the United States \n        Executive Agent such amounts of the Russian HEU converted to \n        LEU under the Russian HEU Agreement, and withhold such amounts \n        from resale into the private market for such period of time, as \n        may be necessary to fully achieve the national security goals \n        of the United States under the Russian HEU Agreement and to \n        allow a privatized United States Enrichment Corporation to meet \n        the statutory requirements of the privatization.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) To achieve the national security objectives of the \n        Russian HEU Agreement.\n            (2) To achieve the requirements for privatization of the \n        United States Enrichment Corporation set out in the Energy \n        Policy Act of 1992 and the United States Enrichment Corporation \n        Privatization Act, as follows:\n                    (A) Assure that privatization will result in a \n                return to the United States at least equal to the net \n                present value of the Corporation.\n                    (B) Assure that privatization will not result in \n                the Corporation being owned, controlled, or dominated \n                by an alien, a foreign corporation, or a foreign \n                government.\n                    (C) Assure that the privatization will not be \n                inimical to the health and safety of the public or the \n                common defense and security.\n                    (D) Provide reasonable assurance that adequate \n                enrichment capacity will remain available to meet the \n                demands of the domestic electric utility industry.\n                    (E) Assure that privatization will provide for the \n                long-term viability of the Corporation.\n                    (F) Assure that privatization will provide for the \n                continuation by the Corporation of the operation of the \nDepartment of Energy's gaseous diffusion plants.\n                    (G) Assure that privatization will provide for the \n                protection of the public interest in maintaining a \n                reliable and economical domestic source of uranium \n                mining, enrichment, and conversion services.\n                    (H) To the extent not inconsistent with \n                requirements of subparagraphs (E), (F), and (G), assure \n                that privatization will secure the maximum proceeds to \n                the United States.\n            (3) To monitor and determine the effect the LEU delivered \n        under the Russian HEU Agreement is having on the domestic \n        uranium mining, conversion, and enrichment industries and the \n        operation of the gaseous diffusion plants, and to prevent or \n        mitigate any material adverse impact on such industries or any \n        loss of employment at the gaseous diffusion plants as a result \n        of the Russian HEU Agreement.\n\nSEC. 4. STANDBY AUTHORIZATION.\n\n    Section 3112(b) of the United States Enrichment Corporation \nPrivatization Act (42 U.S.C. 2297h-10) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n    ``(11) The Secretary is authorized to purchase and hold any amount \nof any contract obligation of the United States Executive Agent to \nacquire Russian HEU converted to LEU under the Russian HEU Agreement \nduring any year in which the Russian HEU Agreement is in force, and \nresell such material, upon the following terms and conditions:\n            ``(A) At the end of any month, the United States Enrichment \n        Corporation shall certify to the Secretary when enrichment of \n        uranium at the gaseous diffusion plants, measured in SWU, for \n        the previous 12 months, is determined to be 25 percent below \n        the average annual enrichment in SWU for the years 1992 through \n        1997.\n            ``(B) In its certification under subparagraph (A), the \n        United States Enrichment Corporation shall indicate the effects \n        that the purchase and resale of the converted Russian HEU by \n        the United States Executive Agent under the Russian HEU \n        Agreement are having on its long-term viability, including its \n        operations, costs, sales and profitability, and in particular \n        any reduction in the levels of enrichment services and \n        employment at the gaseous diffusion plants or threat thereof. \n        The United States Enrichment Corporation shall also certify \n        what actions it has taken or may be required to take to \n        mitigate such effects of the purchases and resales of the \n        converted Russian HEU under the Russian HEU Agreement when \n        combined with other effects and causes in the marketplace.\n            ``(C) Within 30 days of the certification by the United \n        States Enrichment Corporation under subparagraphs (A) and (B), \n        the Secretary shall review that certification and make a report \n        to the President which shall include any recommendation for the \n        Secretary to purchase directly, or from the United States \n        Executive Agent, and hold a sufficient amount of converted \n        Russian HEU under the Russian HEU Agreement to assure that the \n        national security objectives of the Russian HEU Agreement are \n        met and that the United States Enrichment Corporation is able \n        to meet its obligations under this Act to provide for the long-\n        term viability of the Corporation, the continuation by the \n        Corporation of the operation of the Department of Energy's \n        gaseous diffusion plants, and for the protection of the public \n        interest in maintaining a reliable and economical domestic \n        source of uranium mining, conversion, and enrichment services. \n        The Secretary shall deliver a copy of the report to the Senate \n        Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House of \n        Representatives Committee on Commerce and shall publish it in \n        the Federal Register. The Secretary shall not publicly disclose \n        essential proprietary information of the United States \n        Enrichment Corporation or the United States Executive Agent, as \n        determined by regulations promulgated by the Secretary, \n        consistent with providing the greatest amount of information to \n        the public, particularly in the communities directly affected, \n        and to all parties in interest in the enrichment of uranium at \n        the gaseous diffusion plants and shareholders or stakeholders \n        in the United States Enrichment Corporation and the United \n        States Executive Agent.\n            ``(D) The President shall thereafter direct the Secretary \n        to acquire such amounts of converted Russian HEU under the \n        Russian HEU Agreement as the President determines necessary for \n        these purposes from funds available for such purposes. The \n        President shall also request appropriations from the Congress \n        for current and future acquisitions of such amount of such \n        converted Russian HEU as the President determines necessary for \n        these purposes. Within 10 days of receipt of the report by the \n        Secretary, the President shall request an investigation under \n        section 332 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332) of the \n        impact of the Russian HEU Agreement on the operations and \nemployment at the gaseous diffusion plants and the uranium mining, \nenrichment, and conversion industries in the United States. Such \ninvestigation shall be completed within 3 months of such request and \nthe Commission shall report the results to the President and the \nCongress.\n            ``(E) As directed by the President, the Secretary shall \n        acquire such amounts of converted Russian HEU under the Russian \n        HEU Agreement in such manner and at such prices as authorized \n        under the Russian HEU Agreement and shall withhold such amounts \n        from resale into the private markets of the United States or \n        elsewhere until such time as it is determined, pursuant to \n        regulations promulgated by the Secretary, that the United \n        States Enrichment Corporation is producing enrichment services \n        measured in SWU at the gaseous diffusion plants for a \n        consecutive 12-month period that equals or exceeds 110 percent \n        of the average annual enrichment in SWU for the period 1992 \n        through 1997.\n            ``(F) Upon the determination referred to in subparagraph \n        (E), the Secretary may then, pursuant to regulations \n        promulgated by the Secretary, auction for resale an amount of \n        converted Russian HEU acquired under this Act which is not more \n        than the amount in excess of 100 percent of the average annual \n        enrichment in SWU for the period 1992 through 1997. Such \n        amounts of converted Russian HEU shall not be sold in any \n        manner that would have a material adverse impact on the \n        domestic uranium mining, conversion, or enrichment industry and \n        shall not be sold directly to end-users in direct competition \n        with the United States Enrichment Corporation. Such amounts of \n        converted Russian HEU shall not be sold at prices less than \n        current market prices for comparable sales, but in no event may \n        such sale prices by the Secretary be less than the amount paid \n        for any such lot or lots, plus the expenses of holding and sale \n        by the Secretary. Purchasers at such auction may not sell to \n        end-users at any price that is less than the price, including \n        expenses of the Secretary, paid to the Secretary at such \n        auction. The term `material adverse impact', as used in this \n        Act, shall have the same meaning as `material injury' under \n        section 771(7) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677(7)) \n        and the Secretary shall consider the impacts and relevant \n        factors affecting the domestic industry as enumerated in \n        subparagraphs (B) and (C) of such section.\n            ``(G) The regulations required to be promulgated by the \n        Secretary under subparagraphs (E) and (F) shall be subject to \n        the administrative procedures required by chapter 5 of title 5, \n        United States Code, shall be proposed within 90 days of the \n        date of the enactment of the Assisting Acquisition of Russian \n        Material Act, allow not less than a 90-day comment period, and \n        shall become final no less than one year from the date of the \n        enactment of such Act.
