FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that, according to a report by the Federal \nCommunications Commission entitled ``Connecting America: The National \nBroadband Plan'', dated March 2010, the Commission recommends that--\n            (1) ``To fully implement next-generation technology within \n        its operations, the SBA should also appoint a broadband and \n        emerging IT coordinator. This individual would ensure that SBA \n        programs maintain the requisite broadband expertise, tools and \n        training courses to serve small businesses.'';\n            (2) ``Congress should consider ways to leverage existing \n        assistance provided through'' entrepreneurial development \n        programs, ``to focus training on advanced IT and broadband \n        applications'';\n            (3) ``Congress could also consider ways to support \n        technology training among women entrepreneurs through'' women's \n        business centers;\n            (4) ``The training programs should include an entry-level \n        `Broadband 101' course to give small businesses an introduction \n        to how to capitalize on broadband connectivity, as well as more \n        advanced applications for IT staff.'';\n            (5) small and medium enterprise ``IT training should \n        include resources for non-IT staff, such as how to use e-\n        commerce tools for sales, streamline finance with online \n        records or leverage knowledge management across an \n        organization.''; and\n            (6) ``To facilitate the development of broadband networks, \n        Congress should consider allowing all agencies to set the fees \n        for access to rights-of-way for broadband services on the basis \n        of a direct cost recovery approach, especially in markets \n        currently underserved or unserved by any broadband service \n        provider. The Executive Branch should also develop one or more \n        master contracts for all federal property and buildings \n        covering the placement of wireless towers.''.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the terms ``Administration'' and ``Administrator'' mean \n        the Small Business Administration and the Administrator \n        thereof, respectively; and\n            (2) the term ``small business concern'' has the meaning \n        given that term under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 \n        U.S.C. 632).\n\nSEC. 4.
