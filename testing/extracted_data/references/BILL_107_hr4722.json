FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The western basin of Lake Erie, as part of the Great \n        Lakes ecosystem, the largest freshwater ecosystem on the face \n        of the Earth, is vitally important to the economic and \n        environmental future of the United States.\n            (2) Over the past three decades, the citizens and \n        governmental institutions of both the United States and Canada \n        have devoted increasing attention and resources to the \n        restoration of the water quality and fisheries of the Great \n        Lakes, including the western basin. This increased awareness \n        has been accompanied by a gradual shift to a holistic \n        ``ecosystem approach'' that highlights a growing recognition \n        that shoreline areas--the nearshore terrestrial ecosystems--are \n        an integral part of the western basin and the Great Lakes \n        ecosystem as a whole.\n            (3) The Great Lakes account for more than 90 percent of the \n        surface freshwater in the nation. The western basin receives \n        approximately 90 percent of its flow from the Detroit River and \n        only approximately 10 percent from tributaries.\n            (4) The western basin of Lake Erie is an important \n        ecosystem that includes a number of distinct islands, channels, \n        rivers, and shoals that support dense populations of fish, \n        wildlife, and aquatic plants.\n            (5) The coastal wetlands of Lake Erie support the largest \n        diversity of plant and wildlife species in the Great Lakes. The \n        moderate climate of Lake Erie and its more southern latitude \n        allow for many species that are not found in or along the \n        northern Great Lakes. More than 300 species of plants, \n        including 37 significant species, have been identified in the \n        aquatic and wetland habitats of the western basin.\n            (6) The shallow western basin, from the Lower Detroit River \n        to Sandusky Bay, is home to the largest concentration of \n        marshes in Lake Erie, including Mouille, Metzger, and Magee \n        marshes, the Maumee Bay wetland complex, the wetland complexes \n        flanking Locust Point, and the wetlands in Sandusky Bay. The \n        larger United States islands in western Lake Erie have wetlands \n        in the small ebayments.\n            (7) The wetlands in the western basin of Lake Erie comprise \n        as some of the most important waterfowl habitat in the Great \n        Lakes. Waterfowl, wading birds, shore birds, gulls and terns, \n        raptors, and perching birds all use the western basin wetlands \n        for migration, nesting, and feeding. Hundreds of thousands of \n        diving ducks stop to rest in the Lake Erie area on their fall \n        migration from Canada to the east and south. The wetlands of \n        the western basin provide a major stopover for sea ducks such \n        as migrating bufflehead, common goldeneye, common mergansers, \n        and ruddy duck.\n            (8) The international importance of Lake Erie is manifested \n        in the United States congressional designation of the Ottawa \n        and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuges.\n            (9) Lake Erie has an international reputation for walleye, \n        perch, and bass fishing, recreational boating, birding, \n        photography, and duck hunting. On an economic basis, Lake Erie \n        tourism accounts for an estimate $1,500,000,000 in retail sales \n        and more than 50,000 jobs.\n            (10) Many of the 417,000 boats that are registered in Ohio \n        are used in the western basin of Lake Erie, in part to fish for \n        the estimated 10,000,000 walleye that migrate from the lake to \n        spawn. This internationally renowned walleye fishery drives \n        much of Ohio's $2,000,000,000 sport fishing industry.\n            (11) Coastal wetlands in the western basin have been \n        subjected to intense pressure for 150 years. Prior to 1850, the \nwestern basin was part of an extensive coastal marsh and swamp system \nof approximately 122,000 hectares that comprised a portion of the Great \nBlack Swamp. By 1951, only 12,407 wetland hectares remained in the \nwestern basin. Half of that acreage was destroyed between 1972 and \n1987. Therefore, today only approximately 5,000 hectares remain. Along \nthe Michigan shoreline, coastal wetlands were reduced by 62 percent \nbetween 1916 and the early 1970s. The development of the city of Monroe \nhas had a particularly significant impact on the coastal wetlands at \nthe mouth of the Raisin River: only approximately 100 hectares remain \nphysically unaltered today in an area where 70 years ago marshes were \n10 times more extensive. In addition to the actual loss of coastal \nwetland acreage along the shores of Lake Erie, the quality of many \nremaining wetlands has been degraded by numerous stressors, especially \nexcessive loadings of sediments and nutrients, contaminants, shoreline \nmodification, exotic species, and the diking of wetlands. Protective \npeninsula beach systems, such as the former Bay Point and Woodtick, at \nthe border of Ohio and Michigan near the mouth of the Ottawa River and \nMaumee Bay, have been eroded over the years, exacerbating erosion along \nthe shorelines and impacting the breeding and spawning grounds.\n\n SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Refuge'' means the Lake Erie Western Basin \n        International Wildlife Refuge established by section 5.\n            (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n        Interior.\n            (3) The term ``Lake Erie Western Basin'' means those lands \n        and waters within the area described in section 5(a).\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes for which the Refuge is established and shall be \nmanaged are as follows:\n            (1) To protect the remaining high-quality fish and wildlife \n        habitats of the western basins of Lake Erie before they are \n        lost to further development and to restore and enhance degraded \n        wildlife habitats associated with the western basin of Lake \n        Erie.\n            (2) To assist in international efforts to conserve, \n        enhance, and restore the native aquatic and terrestrial \n        community characteristics of the western basin of Lake Erie \n        (including associated fish, wildlife, and plant species), both \n        in the United States and Canada in partnership with \n        nongovernmental and private organizations, as well as private \n        individuals dedicated to habitat enhancement.\n            (3) To facilitate partnerships among the United States Fish \n        and Wildlife Service, Canadian national and provincial \n        authorities, State and local governments, local communities in \n        the United States and in Canada, conservation organizations, \n        and other non-Federal entities to promote public awareness of \n        the resources of the western basin of Lake Erie.\n            (4) To advance the collective goals and priorities \n        established in the ``Great Lakes Strategy 2002--A Plan for the \n        New Millennium'', by the United States Policy Committee \n        comprised of various Federal agencies, including the United \n        States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection \n        Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, the National Oceanic and \n        Atmospheric Administration, the United States Geological \n        Survey, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, \n        the Forest Service, and the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, as \n        well as the State governments and tribal governments in the \n        Great Lakes.
