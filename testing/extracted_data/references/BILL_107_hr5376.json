Chapter 1, 28.103-2, 28.103-3), in an \namount that the contracting officer considers sufficient to protect the \ngovernment's interest in the estimated value of the products to be \nremoved under contract under subsection (a).\n    (g) Authorities.--In carrying out this section, the Secretary of \nAgriculture and the Secretary of the Interior may use existing \ncontracting authorities and procedures or may develop by regulation new \nauthorities and procedures.\n    (h) Reporting Requirements.--To ensure accountability and a full \ncost accounting of work completed under this authority, the Secretaries \nshall be required to separately track the full costs of individual \ncontracts and the value of the forest products exchanged for such work. \nThe Secretaries shall report annually to the Congress on--\n            (1) the status of development, execution, and \n        administration of contracts authorized under subsection (a);\n            (2) the specific accomplishments that have resulted; and\n            (3) the full cost of projects completed under contracts \n        entered into under subsection (a) including a separate \n        accounting of--\n                    (A) the value of services received;\n                    (B) payments received from the sale of timber and \n                forest products; and\n                    (C) the difference between the payments received \n                for such timber and forest products and the fair market \n                value for such timber and forest products.\n\nSEC. 3. REPEAL.\n\n    Section 322 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 1993, Public Law 102-381 (commonly known as the \n``Appeals Reform Act''; 16 U.S.C. 1612 note), is repealed.\n\nSEC. 4. BALANCE OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) past land management practices, particularly fire \n        suppression, have severely altered many fire-adapted forest and \n        rangeland ecosystems;\n            (2) such severely altered ecosystems are less resilient and \n        more vulnerable to long-term harm by fire, drought, insects, \n        disease, loss of biological diversity, and by exotic or \n        invasive species;\n            (3) such degradation and replacement of native fire-adapted \n        forest and rangeland ecosystems causes irreparable harm to the \n        public interest by increasing risk to public health, safety, \n        property, and diminishing the biological productivity of the \n        land and natural resources of the Nation, including loss of \n        forest and rangeland resources, native species, habitat for \n        threatened and endangered species, recreation opportunities, \n        watershed protection, soils, and the economic and social values \n        that depend upon such resources;\n            (4) mechanical thinning of forests and rangeland, reduction \n        of natural fuels through prescribed fire, and similar land \n        management practices are necessary to restore the diversity and \n        resilience of native fire-adapted forests and rangelands; and\n            (5) the public interest in such restoration, including \n        avoiding irreparable harm to forest and rangeland ecosystems if \n        restorative action is not taken, typically outweighs the short-\n        term effects of restoration projects on the quality of the \n        water, air, soils, and habitat of threatened and endangered \n        species.\n    (b) Standard for Injunctive Relief.--In any action under section \n703 of title 5, United States Code or any other law for writs of \nprohibitory or mandatory injunction against agency action in which the \nagency has found that such action is necessary to restore fire-adapted \nforest or rangeland ecosystems, the reviewing court shall consider the \npublic interest in avoiding long-term harm to such ecosystems and shall \ngive deference to any agency finding, based upon information in its \nadministrative record, that the public interest in avoiding the short-\nterm effects of such action is outweighed by the public interest in \navoiding long-term harm to such ecosystems."
