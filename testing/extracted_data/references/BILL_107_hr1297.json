FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous \n        potential for finding a cure or effective treatment, the \n        Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension must be expanded, \n        and coordination among the national research institutes of the \n        National Institutes of Health must be strengthened.\n            (2) Primary, or unexplained, pulmonary hypertension \n        (``PPH'') is a rare lung disorder which occurs for no apparent \n        reason. It has been historically chronic and incurable with a \n        poor survival rate.\n            (3) In the United States it has been estimated that 300 new \n        cases of PPH are diagnosed each year, or about two persons per \n        million population per year; the greatest number are reported \n        in women between the ages of 21 and 40. While at one time the \n        disease was thought to occur among young women almost \n        exclusively; we now know, however, that men and women in all \n        age ranges, from very young children to elderly people, can \n        develop PPH. It also affects people of all racial and ethnic \n        origins equally.\n            (4) The low prevalence of PPH makes learning more about the \n        disease extremely difficult. Studies of PPH also have been \n        difficult because a good animal model of the disease has not \n        been available.\n            (5) In about 6 to 10 percent of cases, PPH is familial.\n            (6) In the more advanced stages of PPH, the patient is able \n        to perform only minimal activity and has symptoms even when \n        resting. The disease may worsen to the point where the patient \n        is completely bedridden.\n            (7) PPH remains a diagnosis of exclusion and is rarely \n        picked up in a routine medical examination. Even in its later \n        stages, the signs of the disease can be confused with other \n        conditions affecting the heart and lungs.\n            (8) In 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \n        established the first PPH-patient registry in the world. The \n        registry followed 194 people with PPH over a period of at least \n        1 year and, in some cases, for as long as 7.5 years. Much of \n        what we know about the illness today stems from this study.\n            (9) Because we still do not understand the cause or have a \n        cure for PPH, basic research studies are focusing on the \n        possible involvement of immunologic and genetic factors in the \n        cause and progression of PPH, looking at agents that cause \n        narrowing of the pulmonary blood vessels, and identifying \n        factors that cause growth of smooth muscle and formation of \n        scar tissue in the vessel walls.\n            (10) During the period January 1996 through December 1997 \n        almost 6,000,000 Americans took anorexic drugs, which can cause \n        PPH in some people. Thousands now have PPH and are in terminal \n        stages or have already succumbed to the disease. It is \n        anticipated that many more cases of PPH from diet drugs will be \n        diagnosed within the coming years.\n            (11) Secondary pulmonary hypertension (``SPH'') means the \n        cause is known. Common causes of SPH are the breathing \n        disorders emphysema and bronchitis. Other less frequent causes \n        are the inflammatory or collagen vascular diseases such as \n        scleroderma, CREST syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus \n        (``SLE''). Other causes include congenital heart diseases that \n        cause shunting of extra blood through the lungs like \n        ventricular and atrial septal defects, chronic pulmonary \n        thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease and certain diet \n        drugs.\n\nSEC. 3.
