FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A growing body of research shows that, where markets \n        are inclusive and income gaps are relatively small, growth \n        translates into poverty reduction much more quickly, \n        efficiently, and sustainably.\n            (2) Microenterprises, including smallholder and pastoral \n        farms, are important actors in most developing economies and \n        contribute significantly to employment generation, food \n        security, and family financial stability.\n            (3) Microfinance institutions and providers have played an \n        increasingly important role in enabling micro-entrepreneurs to \n        graduate from extreme poverty to sustainable living patterns \n        through financial services such as micro-credit, savings, and \n        micro-insurance, as well as skills development, business \n        mentoring, value-chain linkages, and facilitation of producer \n        groups.\n            (4) Congress has demonstrated its support for \n        microenterprise development assistance programs through the \n        enactment of three comprehensive microenterprise laws. Support \n        for microenterprise and microfinance remains a key tenet of \n        foreign assistance programs under the Foreign Assistance Act of \n        1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), including pursuant to the \n        following Acts:\n                    (A) The Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of \n                2000 (title I of Public Law 106-309; 114 Stat. 1079).\n                    (B) Public Law 108-31 (117 Stat. 775).\n                    (C) The Microenterprise Results and Accountability \n                Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-484; 118 Stat. 3922).\n            (5) Microcredit alone is insufficient to sustainably reduce \n        poverty and facilitate inclusive economic growth. In addition \n        to access to credit, poor households need savings tools to \n        build assets, mitigate risks, increase social capital, enhance \n        skills, and integrate into competitive, growing value-chains, \n        as well as to access good-quality health and education \n        services.\n            (6) Over the last three decades, the United States Agency \n        for International Development has made microenterprise \n        development an important feature of its programming and has \n        continually sought to enhance the positive impact of \n        investments on poor households. In fiscal year 2010, the United \n        States Agency for International Development provided not less \n        than $262,000,000 in funding for microenterprise development in \n        at least 64 countries through at least 145 diverse implementing \n        partners, including private voluntary organizations, \n        nongovernmental organizations, banks and enterprise development \n        service providers, benefitting over 1,600,000 \n        microentrepreneurs and 1,900,000 savers.\n            (7) New approaches are essential to keep pace with global \n        technology, not only to alleviate poverty, but also to \n        sustainably reduce poverty by linking poor households to \n        economic opportunities so that they can contribute to and \n        benefit from economic growth in their countries.\n            (8) Public funding for microfinance and microenterprise \n        should be available to benefit the poor in all countries, and, \n        in particular, among countries with a high concentration of the \n        very poor.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TARGETED AND EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the United States Agency for \nInternational Development should continue and expand programming in \nmicrofinance that adheres to the following principles and basic \nconsiderations:\n            (1) The United States Agency for International Development \n        should advance access to economic opportunities for very poor \n        and vulnerable populations, including orphans and vulnerable \n        children, single mothers, those affected by HIV/AIDS, those \n        affected by regional conflict, and the food insecure to ensure \n        that the poorest are included and benefit from broad-based \n        economic growth.\n            (2) To the greatest extent possible, the United States \n        Agency for International Development should set clear country \n        or regional funding targets based on greatest need, as \n        evidenced by poverty indicators and should strive to fill a gap \n        in unmet demand by the very poor for financial services.\n            (3) The United States Agency for International Development \n        should place special emphasis on aiding poor women, who \n        constitute a substantial portion of microentrepreneurs and who \n        face a wide range of disadvantages, as a means of promoting \n        financial self-reliance, empowering gender equality, including \n        land rights and access, and bringing a host of development \n        benefits to families through improved nutrition, health, and \n        education.\n            (4) The United States Agency for International Development \n        should ensure that providers of financial services benefitting \n        from United States Agency for International Development \n        assistance adhere to client protection principles, such as the \n        Client Protection Principles of the ``Smart Campaign'', and \n        take concrete steps to protect clients from potentially harmful \n        financial products and to support equitable and fair treatment, \n        including--\n                    (A) avoidance of over-indebtedness;\n                    (B) transparent and responsible pricing;\n                    (C) appropriate collection practices;\n                    (D) mechanisms for redress of grievances; and\n                    (E) privacy of client data.\n            (5) The United States Agency for International Development \n        should encourage providers of financial services benefitting \n        from assistance programs to provide cost-effective services and \n        make steady progress toward full financial sustainability as a \n        means to achieve large-scale impact and institutional \n        viability, while also maintaining focus on their target \n        population of poor micro-entrepreneurs and smallholder farmers.\n            (6) The United States Agency for International Development \n        should strive to increase access to financial services to poor \n        and very poor, rural, and other underserved populations by \n        supporting a diverse range of financial intermediaries, \n        including nongovernmental organizations and private and state-\n        owned banks; postal and savings banks and savings and credit \n        cooperatives; voluntary savings associations; member-owned \n        community organizations; and other non-bank intermediaries, \n        such as mobile network operators, finance, and insurance \n        companies.\n            (7) The United States Agency for International Development \n        should promote and make use of existing technologies that show \n        promise for lowering costs, managing risks, and rapidly scaling \n        up access to financial products and services, including mobile \n        phones, smart phones, tablets, point-of-sale devices linked to \n        smart cards, automatic teller machines (ATMs), geographic \n        information system (GIS) mapping, and cloud computing, among \n        other information and communication technologies (ICT).\n            (8) The United States Agency for International Development \n        should make efforts to identify and support smaller, community-\n        led partner organizations, including local collectives and \n        consortia.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EXPANDED INTEGRATED APPROACHES.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the next generation of programming \nin microfinance and microenterprise development should advance \nholistic, integrated strategies that focus on the myriad financial and \nnon-financial needs, including nutrition, health, and education, of \nhouseholds, as well as the functioning of enterprises, markets, and \ntheir inter-relationships in the economy.\n\nSEC. 5. HOUSEHOLD-BASED APPROACHES.\n\n    (a) Responsive Financial Services.--The Administrator of the United \nStates Agency for International Development shall promote responsive \nfinancial services to meet the diverse needs of poor households for \ncash flow management and asset accumulation by supporting the \ndevelopment of savings, remittances, and money transfer services.\n    (b) Consumption Smoothing, Risk Aggregation, and Mitigation.--The \nAdministrator of the United States Agency for International Development \nshall promote tools that aggregate risks, mitigate shocks, and smooth \nconsumption, such as insurance and savings deposit services, so that \nthe poor can better manage, cope with, and recover from expected and \nunexpected income fluctuations and crises like family emergencies and \ncrop failures.\n    (c) Partners.--The Administrator of the United States Agency for \nInternational Development shall identify and support partners that \nsupport informal savings-led and asset building approaches to \nmicrofinance, including organizations that work to provide linkages \nbetween savings-led groups to institutions in the formal financial \nsector.\n    (d) Social Protection Programs.--Because some people are too poor \nor otherwise unable to make use of microfinance or microenterprise \ndevelopment services without special assistance to prepare them for \nparticipation, the Administrator of the United States Agency for \nInternational Development should identify and support organizations \nthat link social protection programs, including food assistance, cash \nor asset transfers, life and livelihood skills development, and health \nand nutrition education, with microfinance services, savings services, \nand business development services. Such linkages should attempt to \nenable poor people to stabilize food consumption, survive extreme \npoverty, develop sustainable livelihoods, and take advantage of \neconomic opportunities.\n\nSEC. 6.

The Agency should consider issues \nsuch as the business enabling environment, market competitiveness, \ninter-firm cooperation, firm-level upgrading, and the relationships \nbetween firms that create incentives or disincentives for investing in \nimproved performance or upgrading.\n    (e) Support for Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises.--The \nAdministrator of the United States Agency for International Development \nshould consider support for small- and medium-sized enterprises as a \nmeans to improve productivity and competitiveness in key subsectors in \nwhich large numbers of poor micro-entrepreneurs participate, as well as \nto strengthen the channels, such as employment, by which the benefits \nof growth are transmitted to the poor.\n\nSEC. 7.
