FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress hereby finds:\n            (1) The value added by workers in the United States and in \n        other countries is increasingly a function of the aggregate \n        knowledge acquired by workers through the aggregate educational \n        and training investments of both governments and businesses.\n            (2) The aggregate investment by governments of many of the \n        United States's trading partners in the education and training \n        of knowledge workers in those countries has exceeded the \n        aggregate per-worker investment by Federal, State, and local \n        governments in the United States.\n            (3) The disparity is evidenced by the declining educational \n        performance of students in the United States compared to their \n        counterparts in other countries.\n            (4) In an increasingly global and competitive marketplace \n        it is becoming increasingly difficult for United States-based \n        businesses to fund worker education and training that is \n        provided at no cost for similar workers in other countries by \n        their governments.\n            (5) The current global workforce environment creates \n        increasing competitive pressures on domestic companies to \n        utilize highly educated knowledge workers in other countries.\n            (6) It is in the interest of the United States government, \n        national security, the preservation of a strong middle class, \n        and the welfare of our Nation's workers to reverse this trend \n        in a fashion that is consistent with trade obligations and the \n        ability of domestic companies to compete globally.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to encourage businesses \nand individuals to support the educational development of knowledge \nworkers in the United States by providing incentives for information \nand communications technology education and training investments, for \nworkers requiring the use of those skills in professions such as \ninformation or communications technology, engineering, manufacturing \nand other fields, and for other purposes.\n\nSEC. 3.
