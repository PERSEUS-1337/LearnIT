    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bison Management Improvement Act of \n1995''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The natural resources of Yellowstone National Park are \n        unique to the world, and the free-ranging wildlife found within \n        and adjacent to the park, including bison and elk, are of \n        significant economic, recreational, and esthetic value to the \n        American people.\n            (2) The livestock industry is vital to the economy, \n        culture, and lifestyle of the Yellowstone area.\n            (3) The ability of livestock producers in Montana, Wyoming, \n        and Idaho to freely market cattle is jeopardized by uncertainty \n        concerning the application of the Uniform Methods and Rules of \n        the National Brucellosis Eradication Program and by actions of \n        other States.\n            (4) The containment and eventual elimination of the disease \n        brucellosis in the Yellowstone area is important to the \n        maintenance of State livestock-dependent economies.\n            (5) Better scientific information is needed regarding the \n        etiology of Brucella abortus in wildlife, the potential for \n        containment and eventual elimination of the disease, and the \n        potential for transmission between wildlife and domestic \n        livestock.\n            (6) Bison are of significant cultural and spiritual value \n        to Native Americans, and preservation and restoration of \n        buffalo to tribal lands is important.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) provide a comprehensive framework to address plans for \n        the containment and eventual elimination of brucellosis from \n        the Yellowstone area by the year 2010;\n            (2) recognize the cultural, spiritual, and economic value \n        of bison to Native Americans and to promote the restoration of \n        these animals to tribal lands;\n            (3) to support, promote, and coordinate scientific research \n        related to the management necessary to achieve containment and \n        eventual elimination of brucellosis from the Yellowstone area;\n            (4) to provide economic stability to the livestock \n        producers in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming by establishing \n        criteria and regulatory guidelines for such management;\n            (5) assure that brucellosis related management \n        recommendations and decisions are based on defensible and \n        factual scientific information; and\n            (6) to ensure that Yellowstone wildlife are managed in a \n        manner that allows bison and other ungulates to range across \n        jurisdictional boundaries on public lands in the Yellowstone \n        area.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Yellowstone area'' means the area consisting \n        of the lands, water, and interests therein within the area \n        generally depicted on the map entitled ``Boundary Map'', \n        numbered             , and dated             . The map shall be \n        on file and available for public inspection in the offices of \n        the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, United States \n        Department of Agriculture and the National Park Service, \n        Department of the Interior. The Secretaries may from time to \n        time make minor revisions in the boundary of the natural area \n        to promote management effectiveness and efficiency in the \n        furtherance of this Act.\n            (2) The term ``brucellosis'' means a disease which causes \n        abortion in cattle and some other ungulates as a result of \n        infection by Brucella abortus.\n            (3) The term ``Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis \n        Committee'' means the committee established by States of \n        Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana, and the United States Department \n        of Agriculture and the United States Department of the \n        Interior, signatories to a Memorandum of Understanding.\n            (4) The term ``surplus bison'' means populations, \n        subpopulations, or individual bison that are located on or may \n        enter on to private property against the wishes of the \n        landowner, come into contract with or intermingle with the \n        lawfully present livestock on public lands, or that have \n        exceeded the numbers allowed under planning documents for \n        discrete geographic areas.\n            (5) The term ``Secretaries'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nSEC. 5. YELLOWSTONE BRUCELLOSIS FREE MANAGEMENT AREA.\n\n    For the purposes of protecting exceptional wildlife and \nagricultural values, providing for better management of Yellowstone \nNational Park bison herds, and providing a comprehensive approach to \nthe management, containment, and eventual elimination of brucellosis \nfrom the Yellowstone area, there is hereby established the Yellowstone \nBrucellosis Free Management Area.
