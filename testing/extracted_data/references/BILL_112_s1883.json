FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is interest in providing direct public access \n        between the Wasatch Range front and back in the State of Utah \n        by linking ski resorts in the area by means of a skier \n        transport, lift, or tramway;\n            (2) the primary ski resorts in the Wasatch Range in Utah \n        are situated within a 5 mile radius, but currently there is no \n        convenient transportation link between the resorts;\n            (3) The Canyons Ski Resort and Solitude Mountain Resort \n        have proposed a public access transportation connection through \n        construction of a minimally invasive transportation \n        alternative, called ``SkiLink'', which would cross \n        approximately 30 acres of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National \n        Forest from private land at The Canyons Ski Resort in Summit \n        County, Utah, to private land at Solitude Mountain Resort in \n        Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah;\n            (4) the land and resource management plan for the Uinta-\n        Wasatch-Cache National Forest prohibits new alpine ski lifts on \n        National Forest System land;\n            (5) despite efforts by the Utah Department of \n        Transportation, the Wasatch Front Regional Council, and the \n        Utah Transit Authority to increase transit and carpool access \n        in Big Cottonwood Canyon, daily traffic on winter weekends \n        ranges between 8,000 and 9,000 vehicles per day;\n            (6) studies show that the establishment of the SkiLink \n        would reduce ski season vehicle traffic between The Canyons \n        Resort and Solitude Mountain Resort by as many as 18,000 cars \n        per year or 1,000,000 fewer miles driven per year, and the \n        amount of the reduction is expected to increase over time;\n            (7) SkiLink would produce immediate traffic benefits, \n        including a reduction in PM 2.5 and other emissions in Parley's \n        Canyon and Big Cottonwood Canyons;\n            (8) a preliminary environmental review of the proposed \n        SkiLink corridor assessed the potential impact of SkiLink on \n        special status species, water quality and watershed resources, \n        and visual resources and found that no federally listed species \n        or critical habitat would be affected and that any water, \n        plant, and wildlife issues could be addressed through \n        mitigation;\n            (9) minimally invasive, environmentally sound construction \n        techniques would be used to construct SkiLink, including the \n        use of helicopters for concrete placement and tower \n        installations;\n            (10) the winter sport industry in Utah is a significant \n        contributor to the economy of Utah, with the ski/snowboarding \n        industry bringing $1,260,000,000 to Utah during the 2009/2010 \n        ski season and resulting in 20,000 jobs; and\n            (11) economic analysis of SkiLink shows it would infuse \n        another $50,000,000 a year into Utah's economy and create 500 \n        new jobs in the tourism and hospitality industries by creating \n        the largest interconnected ski network in the United States and \n        providing access to more than 6,000 acres of ski terrain.\n\nSEC. 3. CONVEYANCE OF NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM LAND, UINTA-WASATCH-CACHE \n              NATIONAL FOREST, SALT LAKE COUNTY, UTAH.\n\n    (a) Conveyance Required; Purpose.--Subject to subsection (e), the \nSecretary of Agriculture shall convey, by sale, to Canyons-SkiLink, \nLLC, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to a \nparcel of National Forest System Land in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache \nNational Forest in Salt Lake County, Utah, consisting of approximately \n30 acres, as identified on the map entitled ``SkiLink parcels, November \n2011'', for the purpose of permitting Canyons-SkiLink, LLC, to \nconstruct a ski-lift, gondola, or tramway to serve as a public-access \ntransportation interconnection of the Wasatch Front and the Wasatch \nBack Mountains.\n    (b) Consideration.--As consideration for the conveyance of the \nNational Forest System land under subsection (a), Canyons-SkiLink, LLC, \nshall pay to the Secretary of Agriculture an amount equal to at least \nthe fair market value of the Federal land as of the date of enactment \nof this Act.\n    (c) Determination of Fair Market Value.--\n            (1) In general.--The fair market value of the National \n        Forest System land to be conveyed under subsection (a) shall be \n        based on an appraisal acceptable to the Secretary of \n        Agriculture.\n            (2) Deadline.--The appraisal shall be completed not later \n        than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (d) Reversionary Interest.--\n            (1) In general.--If the Secretary of Agriculture determines \n        at any time that the National Forest System land conveyed under \n        subsection (a) has not been used for a period of 10 years or \n        longer in accordance with the purpose of the conveyance all \n        right, title, and interest in and to the conveyed land, \n        including any improvements thereto shall, at the option of the \n        Secretary of Agriculture, revert to and become the property of \n        the United States, the United States shall have the right of \n        immediate entry onto the land.\n            (2) Determination.--A determination by the Secretary of \n        Agriculture under this subsection shall be made on the record \n        after an opportunity for a hearing.\n    (e) Environmental Compliance.--In making the conveyance under this \nsection, the Secretary of Agriculture shall complete all actions that \nmay be required under--\n            (1) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n        U.S.C. 4321 et seq.);\n            (2) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n        seq.); and\n            (3) any other applicable laws."
