SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge \nComplex Expansion and Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge \nExpansion Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the western basin of Lake Erie, as part of the Great \n        Lakes ecosystem--\n                    (A) is the largest freshwater ecosystem in the \n                world; and\n                    (B) is vitally important to the economic and \n                environmental future of the United States;\n            (2) over the 30-year period preceding the date of enactment \n        of this Act, the citizens and governmental institutions of the \n        United States and Canada have devoted increasing attention and \n        resources to the restoration of the water quality and fisheries \n        of the Great Lakes, including the western basin;\n            (3) that increased awareness has been accompanied by a \n        gradual shift toward a holistic ecosystem approach that \n        highlights a growing recognition that shoreline areas, commonly \n        referred to as nearshore terrestrial ecosystems, are an \n        integral part of the western basin and the Great Lakes \n        ecosystem;\n            (4) the Great Lakes account for more than 90 percent of the \n        surface freshwater in the United States;\n            (5) the western basin of Lake Erie receives approximately \n        90 percent of its flow from the Detroit River and only \n        approximately 10 percent from tributaries;\n            (6) the western basin is an important ecosystem that \n        includes a number of distinct islands, channels, rivers, and \n        shoals that support dense populations of fish, wildlife, and \n        aquatic plants;\n            (7) coastal wetland of Lake Erie supports the largest \n        diversity of plant and wildlife species in the Great Lakes;\n            (8) because Lake Erie is located at a more southern \n        latitude than other Great Lakes, the moderate climate of Lake \n        Erie is appropriate for many species that are not found in or \n        along the northern Great Lakes;\n            (9) more than 300 species of plants, including 37 \n        significant species, have been identified in the aquatic and \n        wetland habitats of the western basin;\n            (10) the shallow western basin of Lake Erie, extending from \n        the Lower Detroit River to Sandusky Bay, is home to the \n        greatest concentration of marshes in Lake Erie, including--\n                    (A) Mouille, Metzger, and Magee marshes;\n                    (B) the Maumee Bay wetland complex;\n                    (C) the wetland complexes flanking Locust Point; \n                and\n                    (D) the wetland in Sandusky Bay;\n            (11) the larger islands of the United States in western \n        Lake Erie have wetland in small embayments;\n            (12) the wetland in the western basin comprises some of the \n        most important waterfowl habitat in the Great Lakes;\n            (13) waterfowl, wading birds, shore birds, gulls and terns, \n        raptors, and perching birds use the wetland in the western \n        basin for migration, nesting, and feeding;\n            (14) hundreds of thousands of diving ducks stop to rest in \n        the Lake Erie area during autumn migration from Canada to \n        points east and south;\n            (15) the wetland of the western basin provides a major \n        stopover for sea ducks, such as migrating common goldeneye, \n        common mergansers, and ruddy duck;\n            (16) the international importance of Lake Erie is indicated \n        in the United States by congressional designation of the Ottawa \n        and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuges;\n            (17)(A) Lake Erie has an international reputation for \n        walleye, perch, and bass fishing, recreational boating, \n        birding, photography, and duck hunting; and\n            (B) on an economic basis, tourism in the Lake Erie area \n        accounts for an estimated $1,500,000,000 in retail sales and \n        more than 50,000 jobs;\n            (18)(A) many of the 417,000 boats that are registered in \n        the State of Ohio are used in the western basin, in part to \n        fish for the estimated 10,000,000 walleye that migrate from the \n        lake to spawn; and\n            (B) that internationally renowned walleye fishery drives \n        much of the $2,000,000,000 sport fishing industry in the State \n        of Ohio;\n            (19) coastal wetland in the western basin has been \n        subjected to intense pressure for 150 years;\n            (20) prior to 1850, the western basin was part of an \n        extensive coastal marsh and swamp system consisting of \n        approximately 122,000 hectares that comprised a portion of the \n        Great Black Swamp;\n            (21) by 1951, only 12,407 wetland hectares remained in the \n        western basin;\n            (22) 50 percent of that acreage was destroyed between 1972 \n        and 1987, leaving only approximately 5,000 hectares in \n        existence today;\n            (23) along the Michigan shoreline, coastal wetland was \n        reduced by 62 percent between 1916 and the early 1970s;\n            (24) the development of the city of Monroe, Michigan, has \n        had a particularly significant impact on the coastal wetland at \n        the mouth of the Raisin River;\n            (25) only approximately 100 hectares remain physically \n        unaltered today in an area in which, 70 years ago, marshes were \n        10 times more extensive;\n            (26) in addition to the actual loss of coastal wetland \n        acreage along the shores of Lake Erie, the quality of much \n        remaining dike wetland has been degraded by numerous stressors, \n        especially excessive loadings of sediments and nutrients, \n        contaminants, shoreline modification, exotic species, and the \n        diking of wetland; and\n            (27) protective peninsula beach systems, such as the former \n        Bay Point and Woodtick, at the border of Ohio and Michigan near \n        the mouth of the Ottawa River and Maumee Bay, have been eroded \n        over the years, exacerbating erosion along the shorelines and \n        negatively affecting breeding and spawning grounds.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a national wildlife refuge \ncomplex in the State of Ohio--\n            (1)(A) to protect the remaining high-quality fish and \n        wildlife habitats of the western basin before those habitats \n        are lost to further development; and\n            (B) to restore and enhance degraded wildlife habitats \n        associated with the western basin;\n            (2) in partnership with nongovernmental and private \n        organizations and private individuals dedicated to habitat \n        enhancement, to conserve, enhance, and restore the native \n        aquatic and terrestrial community characteristics of the \n        western basin (including associated fish, wildlife, and plant \n        species);\n            (3) to facilitate partnerships among the United States Fish \n        and Wildlife Service, Canadian national and provincial \n        authorities, State and local governments, local communities in \n        the United States and Canada, conservation organizations, and \n        other non-Federal entities to promote public awareness of the \n        resources of the western basin; and\n            (4) to advance the collective goals and priorities that--\n                    (A) were established in the report entitled ``Great \n                Lakes Strategy 2002--A Plan for the New Millennium'', \n                developed by the United States Policy Committee, \n                comprised of Federal agencies (including the United \n                States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic \n                and Atmospheric Administration, the United States \n                Geological Survey, the Forest Service, and the Great \n                Lakes Fishery Commission) and State governments and \n                tribal governments in the Great Lakes basin; and\n                    (B) include the goals of cooperating to protect and \n                restore the chemical, physical, and biological \n                integrity of the Great Lakes basin ecosystem.\n\nSEC. 4.
