FINDINGS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Women are a vital part of American society and culture \n        and possess the same fundamental human rights and civil rights \n        as men.\n            (2) United States law prohibits the dissimilar treatment of \n        males and females who are similarly situated and prohibits sex \n        discrimination in various contexts, including the provision of \n        employment, education, housing, health insurance coverage, and \n        athletics.\n            (3) A ``sex-selection abortion'' is an abortion undertaken \n        for purposes of eliminating an unborn child of an undesired \n        sex. Sex-selection abortion is described by scholars and civil \n        rights advocates as an act of sex-based or gender-based \n        violence, predicated on sex discrimination. By definition, sex-\n        selection abortions do not implicate the health of the mother \n        of the unborn, but instead are elective procedures motivated by \n        sex or gender bias.\n            (4) The targeted victims of sex-selection abortions \n        performed in the United States and worldwide are overwhelmingly \n        female.\n            (5) Sex-selection abortions are not expressly prohibited by \n        United States law, and only 7 States ban abortions for reason \n        of sex selection at some point in pregnancy. Sex is an \n        immutable characteristic ascertainable at the earliest stages \n        of human development through existing medical technology and \n        procedures commonly in use, including maternal-fetal \n        bloodstream DNA sampling, amniocentesis, chorionic villus \n        sampling or ``CVS'', and obstetric ultrasound.\n            (6) Sex-selection abortions have the effect of diminishing \n        the representation of women in the American population, and \n        therefore, the American electorate.\n            (7) Sex-selection abortion reinforces sex discrimination \n        and has no place in a civilized society.\n            (8) The history of the United States includes many examples \n        of sex discrimination. The people of the United States \n        ultimately responded in the strongest possible legal terms by \n        enacting a constitutional amendment correcting an element of \n        this discrimination. Women, once subjected to sex \n        discrimination that denied them the right to vote, now have \n        suffrage guaranteed by the 19th Amendment. The elimination of \n        discriminatory practices has been and is among the highest \n        priorities and greatest achievements of American history.\n            (9) Implicitly approving the discriminatory practices of \n        sex-selection abortion by choosing not to prohibit them will \n        reinforce sex discrimination, and coarsen society to the value \n        of females. Thus, Congress has a compelling interest in \n        acting--indeed it must act--to prohibit sex-selection abortion.\n    (b) Constitutional Authority.--In accordance with the above \nfindings, Congress enacts the following pursuant to Congress' power \nunder--\n            (1) the Commerce Clause;\n            (2) section 5 of the 14th Amendment, including the power to \n        enforce the prohibition on government action denying equal \n        protection of the laws; and\n            (3) section 8 of article I to make all laws necessary and \n        proper for the carrying into execution of powers vested by the \n        Constitution in the Government of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE UNBORN ON THE BASIS OF SEX.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 250.
