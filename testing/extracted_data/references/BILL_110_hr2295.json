FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (referred to in this \n        section as ``ALS'') is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative \n        disease that affects motor nerve cells in the brain and the \n        spinal cord.\n            (2) The average life expectancy for a person with ALS is 2 \n        to 5 years from the time of diagnosis.\n            (3) The cause of ALS is not well understood.\n            (4) There is only one drug currently approved by the Food \n        and Drug Administration for the treatment of ALS, which has \n        thus far shown only modest effects, prolonging life by just a \n        few months.\n            (5) There is no known cure for ALS.\n            (6) More than 5,000 individuals in the United States are \n        diagnosed with ALS annually and as many as 30,000 individuals \n        may be living with ALS in the United States today.\n            (7) Studies have found relationships between ALS and \n        environmental and genetic factors, but those relationships are \n        not well understood.\n            (8) Scientists believe that there are significant ties \n        between ALS and other motor neuron diseases.\n            (9) Several ALS disease registries and databases exist in \n        the United States and throughout the world, including the SOD1 \n        database, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and \n        Stroke repository, and the Department of Veterans Affairs ALS \n        Registry.\n            (10) A single national system to collect and store \n        information on the prevalence and incidence of ALS in the \n        United States does not exist.\n            (11) In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2007, Congress \n        directed $887,000 to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention to begin a nationwide ALS registry.\n            (12) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the \n        Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have \n        established three pilot projects, beginning in fiscal year \n        2006, to evaluate the science to guide the creation of a \n        national ALS registry.\n            (13) The establishment of a national registry will help--\n                    (A) to identify the incidence and prevalence of ALS \n                in the United States;\n                    (B) to collect data important to the study of ALS;\n                    (C) to promote a better understanding of ALS;\n                    (D) to collect information that is important for \n                research into the genetic and environmental factors \n                that cause ALS;\n                    (E) to strengthen the ability of a clearinghouse--\n                            (i) to collect and disseminate research \n                        findings on environmental, genetic, and other \n                        causes of ALS and other motor neuron disorders \n                        that can be confused with ALS, misdiagnosed as \n                        ALS, and in some cases progress to ALS;\n                            (ii) to make available information to \n                        patients about research studies for which they \n                        may be eligible; and\n                            (iii) to maintain information about \n                        clinical specialists and clinical trials on \n                        therapies; and\n                    (F) to enhance efforts to find treatments and a \n                cure for ALS.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 399R.
