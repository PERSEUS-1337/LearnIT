FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since 1988, three cost-sharing payment programs that \n        provide certain low-income elderly and disabled individuals \n        with financial assistance in covering Medicare beneficiary \n        costs have been established by law.\n            (2) While eligibility for Medicare cost-sharing assistance \n        has expanded, and while the Social Security Administration, the \n        Health Care Financing Administration, and State agencies are \n        working cooperatively to identify and implement reforms to cure \n        the chronic deficiencies associated with the programs described \n        in paragraph (1), reports have shown that gaps in beneficiary \n        knowledge and deficiencies in program administration by Federal \n        and State agencies present persistent barriers to enrolling \n        eligible beneficiaries in such programs.\n            (3) The financial plight of Social Security and Medicare \n        beneficiaries who experience critical income shifts due to the \n        death of a spouse is of particular concern. Statistics \n        furnished by the Social Security Administration show that 40 \n        percent of nonmarried women (a category that includes widows) \n        rely on Social Security benefits for 90 percent of their income \n        in comparison to only 18 percent of married couples. Further, \n        nearly \\1/4\\ of nonmarried women rely on Social Security \n        retirement benefits as their sole source of income.\n            (4) While current reform proposals concentrate on reaching \n        potential eligible beneficiaries upon initial enrollment in \n        Social Security or Medicare, the financial vulnerability of \n        widowed spouses can arise at any time after a senior has begun \n        to receive retirement benefits.\n\nSEC. 2.
