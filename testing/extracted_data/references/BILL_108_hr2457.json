SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Castillo de San Marcos National \nMonument Boundary Adjustment Act of 2004''.\n\nSEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The early defense lines for Fort Marion, Florida, today \n    known as the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, included \n    defenses extending in a line due west to the Sebastian River, a \n    distance of about one half mile.\n        (2) In the 1830's, during the Seminole Wars in Florida, these \n    defensive lines were maintained, but as Florida became more settled \n    they fell into disrepair and/or became obsolete.\n        (3) In 1908 the War Department deeded much of the property \n    running west to the Sebastian River to the St. Johns County Board \n    of Public Instruction. The portion of this property remaining in \n    federal ownership today is occupied by Orange Street, a City of St. \n    Augustine, Florida street.\n        (4) For nearly a century, the City of St. Augustine has \n    maintained and managed Orange Street, a modern city street, and \n    associated utilities in the Orange Street corridor.\n        (5) Any archeological remains that are still present on the \n    property overlaid by Orange Street are adequately protected by the \n    City's archeological ordinances, and by the City having an \n    archeologist on staff.\n        (6) Although the city currently operates Orange Street under a \n    right-of-way from the National Park Service, from a management \n    perspective it is appropriate for the City of St. Augustine to own \n    Orange Street.\n\nSEC. 203. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT.\n\n    (a) Conveyance of Land.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \nconvey, without consideration, to the City of St. Augustine, Florida, \nall right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the lands \nknown as Orange Street, a portion of the Castillo de San Marcos \nNational Monument (Monument), consisting of approximately 3.1 acres, as \nshown on the map entitled Castillo de San Marcos National Monument \nBoundary Adjustment and Correction, numbered 343/80060, and dated April \n2003. Upon completion of the conveyance, the Secretary shall revise the \nboundary of the Monument to exclude the land conveyed.\n    (b) Boundary Revision.--Effective on the date of the enactment of \nthis Act, the boundary of the Monument is revised to include an area of \napproximately 0.45 acres, as shown on the map identified in subsection \n(a). The Secretary shall administer the lands included in the boundary \nas part of the national monument in accordance with applicable laws and \nregulations.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
