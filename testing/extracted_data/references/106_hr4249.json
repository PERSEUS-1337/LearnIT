FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n        (1) Northern Europe is an increasingly vital part of Europe and \n    one that offers great opportunities for United States investment.\n        (2) Northern Europe offers an excellent opportunity to make \n    progress toward the United States vision of a secure, prosperous, \n    and stable Europe, in part because of--\n            (A) historical tradition of regional cooperation;\n            (B) the opportunity to engage Russia in positive, \n        cooperative activities with its neighbors to the west;\n            (C) commitment by the Baltic states to regional cooperation \n        and integration into western institutions; and\n            (D) longstanding, strong ties with the United States.\n        (3) The United States Northern Europe Initiative (NEI) provides \n    the conceptual and operational framework for United States policy \n    in the region, focused on developing a regional network of \n    cooperation in the important areas of business and trade promotion, \n    law enforcement, the environment, energy, civil society, and public \n    health.\n        (4) A central objective of the United States Northern Europe \n    Initiative is to promote cross-border cooperation among the \n    countries in the region.\n        (5) A wide variety of regional and cross-border projects have \n    been initiated under the United States Northern Europe Initiative \n    since the Initiative was established in 1997, including the \n    following:\n            (A) A United States-Lithuanian training program for \n        entrepreneurs from Belarus and Kaliningrad.\n            (B) The Great Lakes-Baltic Sea Partnership program that is \n        being implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (C) A Center of Excellence for Treatment of Multidrug-\n        Resistant Tuberculosis in Riga, Latvia.\n            (D) A regional HIV/AIDS strategy being developed under \n        United States and Finnish leadership.\n            (E) Multiple efforts to combat organized crime, including \n        regional seminars for police officers and prosecutors.\n            (F) Programs to encourage reform of the Baltic electricity \n        market and encourage United States investment in such market.\n            (G) Language and job training programs for Russian-speaking \n        minorities in Latvia and Estonia to promote social integration \n        in those countries.\n            (H) A mentoring partnership program for woman entrepreneurs \n        in the northwest region of Russia and the Baltic states, as \n        part of broader efforts to promote women's participation in \n        political and economic life.\n        (6) Norway, Sweden, and Finland have made considerable efforts \n    to provide assistance to the newly independent Baltic states and to \n    the Northwest region of Russia. In particular, the United States \n    notes the request placed before the European Union by Finland in \n    1999 for the creation and extensive funding by the European Union \n    of a ``Northern Dimension'' Initiative to substantially address the \n    problems that now exist in Northern Europe with regard to economic \n    development, protection of the environment, the safety and \n    containment of nuclear materials, and other issues.\n        (7) The United States commends the endorsement of the \n    ``Northern Dimension'' Initiative by the European Council at its \n    meeting in Helsinki, Finland in December 1999 and calls on the \n    European Union to act on that endorsement through the provision of \n    substantial funding for the Initiative.\n        (8) While the European Union, its member states, and other \n    European countries should clearly take the lead in addressing the \n    challenges posed in Northern Europe, in particular through \n    appropriate yet substantial assistance provided by the European \n    Union, the United States Northern Europe Initiative, and this Act \n    are intended to supplement such efforts and build on the \n    considerable assistance that the United States has already provided \n    to the Baltic states and the Russian Federation. Partnership with \n    other countries in the region means modest United States investment \n    can have significant impact.\n        (9) The United States Northern Europe Initiative's focus on \n    regional environmental challenges is particularly important. \n    Northern Europe is home to significant environmental problems, \n    particularly the threat posed by nuclear waste from Russian \n    submarines, icebreakers, and nuclear reactors.\n        (10) In particular, 21,000 spent fuel assemblies from Russian \n    submarines are lying exposed near Andreeyeva Bay, nearly 60 \n    dangerously decrepit nuclear submarines, many in danger of sinking, \n    are languishing in the Murmansk area of Northwest Russia, whole \n    reactors and radioactive liquid waste are stored on unsafe floating \n    barges, and there are significant risks of marine and atmospheric \n    contamination from accidents arising from loss of electricity or \n    fire on deteriorating, poorly monitored nuclear submarines.\n        (11) This waste poses a threat to the safety and stability of \n    Northern Europe and to countries of the Eurasian continent.\n        (12)(A) In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has \n    facilitated the expansion and upgrading of a facility for the \n    treatment of low-level liquid radioactive waste from the \n    decommissioning of nuclear submarines docked at naval facilities in \n    the Arctic region of Russia.\n        (B) The Environmental Protection Agency has also initiated a \n    project to construct an 80-ton prototype cask for the storage and \n    transport of civilian-controlled spent nuclear fuel, much of it \n    damaged and currently stored onboard an aging vessel anchored in \n    Murmansk Harbor. Currently in the design phase, this project is \n    scheduled for completion in 2000.\n        (13) Working with the countries in the region to address these \n    environmental problems remains vital to the long-term national \n    interest of the United States.\n        (14) The United States and other countries are currently \n    negotiating a number of agreements with Russia which will provide \n    internationally accepted legal protections for the United States \n    and other countries that provide nuclear waste management \n    assistance to Russia. Regrettably, it has not yet been possible to \n    resolve remaining differences over liability, taxation of \n    assistance, privileges and immunities for foreign contractors, and \n    audit rights.\n        (15) Concluding these agreements is vital to the continued \n    provision of such assistance and to the possible development of new \n    programs.\n        (16) With the election of Russian President Vladamir Putin, the \n    opportunity presents itself to surmount these problems, to conclude \n    these outstanding agreements, and to allow assistance programs to \n    move forward to alleviate this problem.\n        (17) The United States Government is currently studying whether \n    dismantlement of multi-purpose submarines is in the national \n    interest.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to demonstrate concrete \nsupport for continued cross-border cooperation in Northern Europe and \nimmediate efforts to assist in the clean up of nuclear waste in that \nregion.\n\n SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n        (1) the United States Northern Europe Initiative is a sound \n    framework for future United States involvement in Northern Europe;\n        (2) the European Union should move expeditiously to authorize \n    and fund the proposed ``Northern Dimension'' Initiative at \n    appropriate yet substantial levels of assistance;\n        (3) the United States should continue to support a wide-ranging \n    strengthening of democratic and civic institutions on a regional \n    basis to provide a foundation for political stability and \n    investment opportunities, including cross-border exchanges, in \n    Northern Europe;\n        (4) the United States should demonstrate continued commitment \n    to address environmental security challenges in Northwest Russia, \n    in cooperation with partners in the region;\n        (5) recently-elected Russian President Vladamir Putin should \n    rapidly conclude pending nuclear waste management agreements to \n    enable assistance programs to go forward; and\n        (6) assistance to Russia on nuclear waste management should \n    only be provided after issues related to liability, taxation of \n    assistance, privileges and immunities for foreign contractors, and \n    audit rights have been resolved.\n\nSEC. 4. SUPPORT FOR UNITED STATES NORTHERN EUROPE INITIATIVE PROJECTS.\n\n    (a) Availability of Amounts From East European and the Baltic \nStates Assistance.--Of the amounts available for fiscal year 2001 to \ncarry out the provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the \nSupport for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 for \nassistance and for related programs for Eastern Europe and the Baltic \nstates, not less than $2,000,000 shall be used for projects described \nin subsection (c).\n    (b) Availability of Amounts From Independent States of the Former \nSoviet Union Assistance.--Of the amounts available for fiscal year 2001 \nto carry out the provisions of chapter 11 of part I of the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961 and the Freedom for Russia and Emerging Eurasian \nDemocracies and Open Markets Support Act of 1992 for assistance for the \nindependent states of the former Soviet Union and related programs, not \nless than $2,000,000 shall be used for the projects described in \nsubsection (c).\n    (c) Projects Described.--The projects described in this subsection \nare United States Northern Europe Initiative projects relating to \nenvironmental cleanup, law enforcement, public health, energy, business \nand trade promotion, and civil society.\n\nSEC. 5.
