If \n        the five fiscal years used in determining the average includes \n        a fiscal year that began before the date of the enactment of \n        the Emergency Wildland Fire Response Act of 2008, the \n        Secretaries concerned shall prepare an estimate for that fiscal \n        year of what the costs would have been for declared emergency \n        wildland fire incidents had this section been in effect.\n            ``(2) Notice of insufficient funds.--The Secretaries \n        concerned shall notify the appropriate congressional committees \n        whenever only an estimated two months worth of funding remains \n        in the Fund or for wildland fire operations of the Secretaries.\n            ``(3) Limitation on transfers from non-fire program \n        accounts.--In addition to other requirements applicable to the \n        reprogramming of funds, the Secretary concerned shall not \n        transfer funds from non-fire program accounts to cover wildland \n        fire suppression expenses unless the Fund or amounts available \n        for wildland fire operations for that fiscal year have been \n        depleted and a formal request to replenish the Fund or provide \n        additional amounts for wildland fire operations, whichever has \n        been depleted, has been submitted to the Committee on \n        Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n    ``(g) Promotion of Cost Containment in Wildland Fire Suppression.--\n            ``(1) Transfer of excess funds for reforestation.--Subject \n        to such limitations as may be provided in appropriation Acts, \n        the Secretary concerned may transfer any funds of the Secretary \n        concerned for wildland fire operations that remain available at \n        the end of a fiscal year to support reforestation and \n        rehabilitation of forests following wildland fires. Such funds \n        may only be expended in those areas where the wildland fire \n        suppression expenditures were below the stratified cost index, \n        or equivalent measure, as determined by the Secretary \n        concerned. In this paragraph, the term `stratified cost index' \n        means a measure that compares actual expenditures in connection \n        with a wildfire incident to the expenditures one would expect \n        given certain characteristics of the wildland fire, such as \n        size, conditions, fuel type, or proximity to communities.\n            ``(2) Review of certain fires.--The Secretary concerned \n        shall conduct a review, using independent panels, of each \n        wildfire incident that results in expenses to the Secretary \n        concerned of greater than $10,000,000.
