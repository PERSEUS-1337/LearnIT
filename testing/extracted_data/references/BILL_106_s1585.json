FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Congress has responsibility under the Constitution for \n        international commerce.\n            (2) Congressional oversight of trade policy has often been \n        hampered by a lack of resources.\n            (3) The United States has entered into numerous trade \n        agreements with foreign trading partners, including bilateral, \n        regional, and multilateral agreements.\n            (4) The purposes of the trade agreements are--\n                    (A) to achieve a more open world trading system \n                which provides mutually advantageous market \n                opportunities for trade between the United States and \n                foreign countries;\n                    (B) to facilitate the opening of foreign country \n                markets to exports of the United States and other \n                countries by eliminating trade barriers and increasing \n                the access of United States industry and the industry \n                of other countries to such markets; and\n                    (C) to reduce diversion of third country exports to \n                the United States because of restricted market access \n                in foreign countries.\n            (5) Foreign country performance under certain agreements \n        has been less than contemplated, and in some cases rises to the \n        level of noncompliance.\n            (6) The credibility of, and support for, the United States \n        Government's trade policy is, to a significant extent, a \n        function of the belief that trade agreements made are trade \n        agreements enforced.\n\nSEC. 2.
