FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The current nurse workforce is aging, and the average \n        age of practicing registered nurses is 43.3 years, representing \n        an increase of 5.9 years since 1983. This means that the \n        nursing workforce is aging at twice the rate of other \n        occupations in the United States, and the enrollment in nursing \n        programs has decreased in the past 5 years. Many hospitals \n        around the country are reporting vacancy rates for nursing \n        positions.\n            (2) Studies have shown a correlation between higher nurse \n        staffing levels and reduction in adverse patient outcomes, \n        including risk of infection, shock, upper gastrointestinal \n        bleeding, and increased length of stay.\n            (3) Retention problems are contributing to the nursing \n        shortage problem. According to a 2001 survey, 50 percent of \n        nurses say they have recently considered leaving the nursing \n        profession for reasons other than retirement.\n            (4) A majority of those individuals who are considering \n        leaving nursing express a low level of overall job \n        satisfaction, and their lack of participation in decisionmaking \n        is a major factor contributing to dissatisfaction.\n            (5) Magnet hospitals are hospitals that have reorganized \n        care to be more participatory, collaborative, and patient-\n        centered and as a result are able to attract more nurses.\n            (6) Even in times of nursing shortages, magnet hospitals \n        enjoy low turnover. The average length of employment for \n        registered nurses in magnet hospitals is 8.35 years, which is \n        twice the length of employment in hospitals generally, and \n        magnet hospital nurses consistently report greater job \n        satisfaction than other nurses.\n            (7) Magnet hospitals report lower mortality rates, higher \n        patient satisfaction, and greater cost-efficiency, with \n        patients experiencing shorter stays in hospitals and intensive \n        care units.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT.\n\n    Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 296 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``PART H--INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE NURSE RETENTION, THE NURSING \n                   WORKPLACE, AND THE QUALITY OF CARE\n\n``SEC. 851.
