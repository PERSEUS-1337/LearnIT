The previous \n        question on the Federal election bill shall be considered as \n        ordered to final passage without intervening motion. It shall \n        not be in order to move to reconsider the vote by which a \n        Federal election bill is agreed to or disagreed to.\n    (g) Floor Consideration in the Senate.--\n            (1) A motion in the Senate to proceed to the consideration \n        of a Federal election bill shall be privileged and not \n        debatable.

The time shall be \n        equally divided between, and controlled by, the majority leader \n        and the minority leader or their designees.\n            (3) Debate in the Senate on any debatable motion or appeal \n        in connection with a Federal election bill shall be limited to \n        not more than one hour, to be equally divided between, and \n        controlled by, the mover and the manager of the bill, except \n        that in the event the manager of the bill is in favor of any \n        such motion or appeal, the time in opposition thereto, shall be \n        controlled by the minority leader or his designee. Such \n        leaders, or either of them, may, from time under their control \n        on the passage of a Federal election bill, allot additional \n        time to any Senator during the consideration of any debatable \n        motion or appeal.\n\nSEC. 8.
