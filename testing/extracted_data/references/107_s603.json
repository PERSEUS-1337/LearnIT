    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``No Taxation Without Representation \nAct of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The residents of the District of Columbia are the only \n        Americans who pay Federal income taxes but are denied voting \n        representation in the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n            (2) The principle of one person, one vote requires that \n        residents who have met every element of American citizenship \n        should have every benefit of American citizenship, including \n        voting representation in the House and the Senate.\n            (3) The residents of the District of Columbia are twice \n        denied equal representation, because they do not have voting \n        representation as other taxpaying Americans do and are \n        nevertheless required to pay Federal income taxes unlike the \n        Americans who live in the territories.\n            (4) Despite the denial of voting representation, Americans \n        in the Nation's capital are second among the residents of all \n        States in per capita income taxes paid to the Federal \n        Government.\n            (5) Unequal voting representation in our representative \n        democracy is inconsistent with the founding principles of the \n        Nation and the strongly held principles of the American people \n        today.\n\nSEC. 3. REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the community of \nAmerican citizens who are residents of the District constituting the \nseat of government of the United States shall have full voting \nrepresentation in the Congress.\n\nSEC. 4.
