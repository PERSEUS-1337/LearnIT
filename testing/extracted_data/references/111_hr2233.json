FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Numerous studies and reports, including the National \n        Healthcare Disparities Report and Unequal Treatment, the 2002 \n        Institute of Medicine Report, document the extensiveness to \n        which health disparities exist across the country.\n            (2) These studies have found that, on average, racial and \n        ethnic minorities are disproportionately afflicted with chronic \n        and acute conditions--such as cancer, diabetes, and \n        hypertension--and suffer worse health outcomes, worse health \n        status, and higher mortality rates than their White \n        counterparts.\n            (3) Several recent studies also show that health \n        disparities are a function of not only access to health care, \n        but also the social determinants of health--including the \n        environment, the physical structure of communities, nutrition \n        and food options, educational attainment, employment, race, \n        ethnicity, geography, and language preference--that directly \n        and indirectly affect the health, health care, and wellness of \n        individuals and communities.\n            (4) Integrally involving and fully supporting the \n        communities most affected by health inequities in the \n        assessment, planning, launch, and evaluation of health \n        disparity elimination efforts is among the leading \n        recommendations made to adequately address and ultimately \n        reduce health disparities.\n            (5) Recommendations also include supporting the efforts of \n        community stakeholders from a broad cross section--including, \n        but not limited to local businesses, local departments of \n        commerce, education, labor, urban planning, and transportation, \n        and community-based and other nonprofit organizations--to find \n        areas of common ground around health disparity elimination and \n        collaborate to improve the overall health and wellness of a \n        community and its residents.\n\nSEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF HEALTH EMPOWERMENT ZONES.\n\n    (a) In General.--At the request of an eligible community \npartnership, the Secretary may designate an eligible area as a health \nempowerment zone.\n    (b) Eligibility Criteria.--\n            (1) Eligible community partnership.--A community \n        partnership is eligible to submit a request under this section \n        if the partnership--\n                    (A) demonstrates widespread public support from key \n                individuals and entities in the eligible area, \n                including State and local governments, nonprofit \n                organizations, and community and industry leaders, for \n                designation of the eligible area as a health \n                empowerment zone; and\n                    (B) includes representatives of--\n                            (i) a broad cross section of stakeholders \n                        and residents from communities in the eligible \n                        area experiencing disproportionate disparities \n                        in health status and health care; and\n                            (ii) organizations, facilities, and \n                        institutions that have a history of working \n                        within and serving such communities.\n            (2) Eligible area.--An area is eligible to be designated as \n        a health empowerment zone under this section if one or more \n        communities in the area experience disproportionate disparities \n        in health status and health care.
