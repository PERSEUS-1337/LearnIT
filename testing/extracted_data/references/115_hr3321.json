    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Strategy for Combating \nTerrorist, Underground, and Other Illicit Financing Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit \n        finance present a direct threat to national security and a \n        threat to global stability.\n            (2) New terrorist groups or threats can form quickly, and \n        other groups change tactics to adapt, creating a constantly \n        changing terrorist environment, presenting ever-changing risks \n        and challenges to programs to disrupt the financing of \n        terrorism and related forms of illicit finance.\n            (3) Terrorists in some instances have formed symbiotic \n        relationships with, or are taking over, transnational crime \n        syndicates, so that funding for both terrorism and profits from \n        crime flow in the same fashion and often are indistinguishable.\n            (4) Methods of concealing the movement of illicit funding \n        change quickly in a globalized economy, and rapid technological \n        changes and financial innovation pose new risks that may be \n        increasingly difficult for governments to stay abreast of \n        without an agile, constantly adjusted strategy to spot, \n        disrupt, and prevent the financing of terrorism and related \n        forms of illicit finance.\n            (5) A bipartisan requirement to create a national anti-\n        money laundering strategy enacted in 1998 expired in 2007. \n        Given the rapid globalization and rapid technology changes of \n        the financial sector, an updated strategy focused on the \n        financing of terrorism is necessary.\n            (6) It is important for the Government to have a unified \n        strategy to fight financial crime and to update it annually, \n        both to accommodate new and developing threats and to help \n        Congress develop legislative and funding priorities.\n            (7) An effective strategy to counter terrorism financing is \n        a critical component of the broader counter terrorism strategy \n        of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL STRATEGY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The President, acting through the Secretary shall, \nin consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, \nand the appropriate Federal banking agencies, develop a national \nstrategy for combating the financing of terrorism and related forms of \nillicit finance.\n    (b) Transmittal to Congress.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the \n        appropriate congressional committees a comprehensive national \n        strategy developed in accordance with subsection (a).\n            (2) Updates.--Every 2 years following the initial \n        submission under paragraph (1), the President shall submit to \n        the appropriate congressional committees updated versions of \n        the national strategy.\n    (c) Separate Presentation of Classified Material.--Any part of the \nnational strategy that involves information that is properly classified \nunder criteria established by the President shall be submitted to the \nCongress separately in a classified annex and, if requested by the \nchairman or ranking Member of one of the appropriate congressional \ncommittees, as a briefing at an appropriate level of security.\n\nSEC. 4.
