FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Secretary of Education has recognized that \n        ``[r]ural schools have unique challenges and benefits'', but a \n        recent report by the Rural School and Community Trust refers to \n        the ``paucity of rural education research in the United \n        States''.\n            (2) Rural education is becoming an increasingly large and \n        important part of the United States public school system. \n        According to the Digest of Education Statistics reported \n        annually by the National Center for Education Statistics, the \n        number of students attending rural schools increased by more \n        than 11 percent, from 10,500,000 to nearly 11,700,000, between \n        the 2004-2005 and 2008-2009 school years. The share of the \n        Nation's public school enrollment attending rural schools \n        increased from 21.6 percent to 23.8 percent. In school year \n        2008-2009, these students attended 31,635 rural schools, nearly \n        one-third of all schools in the United States.\n            (3) Despite the overall growth of rural education, rural \n        students represent a demographic minority in all but 3 States, \n        according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n            (4) Rural education is becoming increasingly diverse. \n        According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the \n        increase in rural enrollment between the 2004-2005 and 2008-\n        2009 school years was disproportionally among students of \n        color. Enrollment of children of color in rural schools \n        increased by 31 percent, and the proportion of students \n        enrolled in rural schools who are children of color increased \n        from 23.0 to 26.5 percent. More than one-third of rural \n        students in 12 States are children of color, according to \n        research by the Rural School and Community Trust (Why Rural \n        Matters 2009).\n            (5) Rural education is varied and diverse across the \n        Nation. In school year 2007-2008, the national average rate of \n        student poverty in rural school districts, as measured by the \n        rate of participation in federally subsidized meals programs, \n        was 39.1 percent, but ranged from 9.7 percent in Connecticut to \n        71.9 percent in New Mexico, according to the National Center \n        for Education Statistics.\n            (6) Even policy measures intended to help rural schools can \n        have unintended consequences. In awarding competitive grants \n        under the Investing in Innovation Fund program under section \n        14007 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \n        (Public Law 111-5), the Secretary of Education attempted to \n        encourage and support rural applicants by providing additional \n        points for proposals to serve at least 1 rural local \n        educational agency. But according to research by the Rural \n        School and Community Trust (Taking Advantage, 2010), this \n        ``rural preference'' mainly had the effect of inducing urban \n        applicants to include rural participation merely in order to \n        gain additional scoring points for primarily urban projects.\n            (7) Rural schools generally utilize distance education more \n        often for both students and teachers. A fall 2008 survey of \n        public schools by the National Center for Education Statistics \n        found that rural schools were 1\\1/2\\ times more likely to \n        provide students access for online distance learning than \n        schools in cities. A September 2004 study from the Government \n        Accountability Office reported that rural school districts used \n        distance learning for teacher training more often than non-\n        rural school districts.\n            (8) The National Center for Education Statistics reports \n        that base salaries of both the lowest and highest paid teachers \n        are lower in rural schools than any other community type.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish an Office of Rural Education Policy in the \n        Department of Education; and\n            (2) to provide input to the Secretary of Education \n        regarding the impact of proposed changes in law, regulations, \n        policies, rules, and budgets on rural schools and communities.\n\nSEC. 3.
