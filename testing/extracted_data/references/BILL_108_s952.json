FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Government, through the medicare program, \n        pays approximately $8,000,000,000 per year solely to train \n        resident-physicians in the United States, and as a result, has \n        an interest in assuring the safety of patients treated by \n        resident-physicians and the safety of resident-physicians \n        themselves.\n            (2) Resident-physicians spend as much as 30 to 40 percent \n        of their time performing activities not related to the \n        educational mission of training competent physicians.\n            (3) The excessive numbers of hours worked by resident-\n        physicians is inherently dangerous for patient care and for the \n        lives of resident-physicians.\n            (4) The scientific literature has consistently demonstrated \n        that the sleep deprivation of the magnitude seen in residency \n        training programs leads to cognitive impairment.\n            (5) A substantial body of research indicates that excessive \n        hours worked by resident-physicians lead to higher rates of \n        medical error, motor vehicle accidents, depression, and \n        pregnancy complications.\n            (6) The medical community has not adequately addressed the \n        issue of excessive resident-physician work hours.\n            (7) The Federal Government has regulated the work hours of \n        other industries when the safety of employees or the public is \n        at risk.\n            (8) The Institute of Medicine has found that as many as \n        98,000 deaths occur annually due to medical errors and has \n        suggested that 1 necessary approach to reducing errors in \n        hospitals is reducing the fatigue of resident-physicians.\n\nSEC. 3. REVISION OF MEDICARE HOSPITAL CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION \n              REGARDING WORKING HOURS OF MEDICAL RESIDENTS, INTERNS, \n              AND FELLOWS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1866 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395cc) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(1)--\n                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph \n                (R);\n                    (B) by striking the period at the end of \n                subparagraph (S) and inserting ``, and'';
