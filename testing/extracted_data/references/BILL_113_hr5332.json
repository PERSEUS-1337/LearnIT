SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Serving America's \nVeterans Effectively Act of 2014'' or the ``SAVE Act of 2014''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Veterans often have unique health needs that may be \n        related to their service to the American people and may be more \n        at risk for certain conditions, including cancer, infectious \n        diseases, musculoskeletal problems, post-traumatic stress \n        disorder, traumatic brain injury, dermatological problems, \n        reproductive health issues, and other conditions.\n            (2) As part of a detailed patient history, knowing whether \n        or not a patient is a veteran helps a physician to make \n        accurate treatment recommendations or carry out needed \n        screenings.\n            (3) If a physician is not aware that a patient is a \n        veteran, the physician may not think to perform recommended \n        screenings or be able to diagnose symptoms that at first seemed \n        unconnected. As a result, the patient and the patient's family \n        may suffer as medical problems go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.\n            (4) Physicians routinely ask about similar types of patient \n        history that can affect current health status, such as whether \n        a patient has a family history of certain conditions or was \n        exposed to certain environmental factors. Questions about \n        veteran status give patients the opportunity to voluntarily \n        answer with information that can help their physicians better \n        establish a course of treatment.\n            (5) Making the question of whether a patient served in the \n        Armed Forces part of consistently used frameworks, such as the \n        ``Welcome to Medicare'' physical examination and Medicare \n        Electronic Health Record program, ensures that it will become \n        part of clinicians' routine for new patients.\n            (6) While many physicians, such as those working at \n        Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, may already be aware \n        of their patients' experiences in the Armed Forces, there are \n        indications that as much as 70 percent of veterans seek care \n        from other facilities.\n            (7) Many organizations serving both veterans and health \n        care professionals currently work to educate health providers \n        on the health needs of veterans and appropriate medical care \n        that should be provided. Additional Federal support is needed \n        to ensure that all physicians are properly prepared to diagnose \n        and treat patients upon learning that they have served in the \n        Armed Forces.\n\nSEC. 2. ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE IDENTIFICATION AND AWARENESS OF VETERANS \n              HEALTH NEEDS IN FURNISHING ITEMS AND SERVICES UNDER \n              MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND OTHER PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Inclusion of Veteran Status in Patient Information for \nMeaningful Use of Electronic Health Records Under Medicare and \nMedicaid.--In establishing regulations regarding what constitutes \nmeaningful use with respect electronic health records in applying \nsections 1848(o), 1853(m), 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix), and 1886(n)(3) of the \nSocial Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4(o), 1395w-23(m), \n1395ww(b)(3)(B)(ix), 1395ww(n)(3)) and related provisions of title XIX \nof such Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall include \nin the patient information required for meaningful use whether or not \nthe patient served in the Armed Forces.\n    (b) Identification of Veterans as Part of Individual History in \nWelcome to Medicare Visit.--In carrying out section 1861(ww) of the \nSocial Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(ww)), the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services shall include, as a component of reviewing an \nindividual's medical and social history under an initial preventive \nphysical examination under section 410.16 of title 42, Code of Federal \nRegulations, an inquiry as to whether the individual served in the \nArmed Forces and any relevant circumstances relating to that \nindividual's service that may bear on the medical or social condition \nof that individual.\n    (c) Additional Activities To Improve Awareness of Veterans' Health \nCare Needs.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take such \nadditional actions, otherwise authorized under law, as may be \nappropriate to promote awareness, among non-governmental physicians in \ntheir furnishing services, of the special circumstances and health care \nneeds of veterans.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS FOR PROVIDER EDUCATION ON HEALTH TREATMENT FOR VETERANS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services may \nmake grants to organizations for the purpose of educating health care \nproviders on appropriate health care treatment for patients who have \nserved in the Armed Forces. Such grants shall be awarded under such \nterms and conditions as the Secretary shall specify.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated $10,000,000 to carry out this section, which shall remain \navailable until expended."
