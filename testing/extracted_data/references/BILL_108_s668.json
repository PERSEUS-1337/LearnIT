FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Recent research on early brain development reveals that \n        much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and \n        nurturing care. Research also shows that quality early care and \n        education leads to increased cognitive abilities, positive \n        classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of long-term \n        school success, and greater likelihood of long-term economic \n        and social self-sufficiency.\n            (2) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including \n        6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day in \n        child care. However, a study in 4 States found that only 1 in 7 \n        child care centers provide care that promotes healthy \n        development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care that \n        threatens the safety and health of children.\n            (3) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $12,000 per \n        year.\n            (4) Although Federal assistance is available for child \n        care, funding is severely limited. Even with Federal subsidies, \n        many families cannot afford child care. For families with young \n        children and a monthly income under $1,200, the cost of child \n        care typically consumes 25 percent of their income.\n            (5) Payment (or reimbursement) rates, which determine the \n        maximum the State will reimburse a child care provider for the \n        care of a child who receives a subsidy, are too low to ensure \n        that quality care is accessible to all families.\n            (6) Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care \n        children get and whether families can find quality child care \n        in their communities. In many instances, low payment rates \n        force child care providers serving low-income children to cut \n        corners in ways that impact the quality of care for the \n        children, including reducing the number of staff, eliminating \n        professional development opportunities, and cutting enriching \n        educational activities and services.\n            (7) Children in low-quality child care are more likely to \n        have delayed reading and language skills, and display more \n        aggression toward other children and adults.\n            (8) Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child \n        care as child care providers are able to attract and retain \n        qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional \n        training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and purchase \n        basic supplies, children's literature, and developmentally \n        appropriate educational materials.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the quality of, \nand access to, child care by increasing child care payment rates.\n\nSEC. 3. PAYMENT RATES.\n\n    Section 658E(c)(4) of the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858c(c)(4)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C);\n            (2) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``to comparable child \n        care services'' and inserting ``to child care services that are \n        comparable (in terms of quality and types of services provided) \n        to child care services''; and\n            (3) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:\n                    ``(B) Payment rates.--\n                            ``(i) Surveys.--In order to provide the \n                        certification described in subparagraph (A), \n                        the State shall conduct statistically valid and \n                        reliable market rate surveys (that reflect \n                        variations in the cost of child care services \n                        by locality), in accordance with such \n                        methodology standards as the Secretary shall \n                        issue.
