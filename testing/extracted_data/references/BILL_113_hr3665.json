FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Newborns are screened for inborn errors of metabolism, \n        but treatment for such conditions is not uniformly covered by \n        insurance.\n            (2) Each year approximately 2,550 children in the United \n        States are diagnosed with an inborn error of metabolism \n        disorder, requiring foods modified to be void of the nutrient \n        or nutrients the child's body is incapable of processing, or \n        requiring supplementation with vitamins or amino acids.\n            (3) More than 35 States have passed laws to at least \n        partially address the inequity in coverage for medically \n        necessary foods, critical treatment for such disorders.\n            (4) The cost associated with providing medically necessary \n        foods presents a large financial burden for many families.\n            (5) There is no current cure for inborn errors of \n        metabolism disorders and treatment is necessary during the \n        entire lifespan of the individual.\n\nSEC. 3.
