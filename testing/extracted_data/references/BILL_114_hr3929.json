FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was America's \n        first effort to implement a system of strategic intelligence \n        during World War II and provided the basis for the modern-day \n        American intelligence and special operations communities. The \n        U.S. Special Operations Command and the National Clandestine \n        Service chose the OSS spearhead as their insignias.\n            (2) OSS founder General William J. Donovan is the only \n        person in American history to receive our Nation's four highest \n        decorations, including the Medal of Honor. Upon learning of his \n        death in 1959, President Eisenhower called General Donovan the \n        ``last hero''. In addition to founding and leading the OSS, \n        General Donovan was also selected by President Roosevelt, who \n        called him his ``secret legs'', as an emissary to Great Britain \n        and continental Europe before the United States entered World \n        War II.\n            (3) All the military branches during World War II \n        contributed personnel to the OSS. The present-day Special \n        Operations Forces trace their lineage to the OSS. Its Maritime \n        Unit was a precursor to the U.S. Navy SEALs. The OSS \n        Operational Groups and Jedburghs were forerunners to U.S. Army \n        Special Forces. The 801st/492nd Bombardment Group \n        (``Carpetbaggers'') were progenitors to the Air Force Special \n        Operations Command. The Marines who served in the OSS, \n        including the actor Sterling Hayden (a Silver Star recipient), \n        Col. William Eddy (a Distinguished Service Cross recipient who \n        was described as the ``nearest thing the United States has had \n        to a Lawrence of Arabia''), and Col. Peter Ortiz (a two-time \n        Navy Cross recipient), were predecessors to the Marine Special \n        Operations Command. U.S. Coast Guard personnel were recruited \n        for the Maritime Unit and its Operational Swimmer Group.\n            (4) The OSS organized, trained, supplied, and fought with \n        resistance organizations throughout Europe and Asia that played \n        an important role in America's victory during World War II. \n        General Eisenhower credited the OSS's covert contribution in \n        France to the equivalent to having an extra military division. \n        General Eisenhower told General Donovan that if it did nothing \n        else, the photographic reconnaissance conducted by the OSS \n        prior to the D-Day Invasion justified its creation.\n            (5) Four future directors of central intelligence served as \n        OSS officers: William Casey, William Colby, Allen Dulles, and \n        Richard Helms.\n            (6) Women comprised more than one-third of OSS personnel \n        and played a critical role in the organization. They included \n        Virginia Hall, the only civilian female to receive a \n        Distinguished Service Cross in World War II, and Julia Child.\n            (7) OSS recruited Fritz Kolbe, a German diplomat who became \n        America's most important spy against the Nazis in World War II.\n            (8) America's leading scientists and scholars served in the \n        OSS Research and Analysis Branch, including Ralph Bunche, the \n        first African-American to receive the Nobel Peace Prize; \n        Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.; \n        Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg; Sherman Kent; John King \n        Fairbank; and Walt Rostow. Its ranks included seven future \n        presidents of the American Historical Association, five of the \n        American Economic Association, and two Nobel laureates.\n            (9) The U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence \n        and Research traces its creation to the OSS Research and \n        Analysis Branch.\n            (10) James Donovan, who was portrayed by Tom Hanks in the \n        Steven Spielberg movie ``Bridge of Spies'' and negotiated the \n        release of U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, served as General \n        Counsel of the OSS.\n            (11) The OSS invented and employed new technology through \n        its Research and Development Branch, inventing new weapons and \n        revolutionary communications equipment. Dr. Christian \n        Lambertsen invented the first underwater rebreathing apparatus \n        that was first utilized by the OSS and is known today as SCUBA.\n            (12) OSS Detachment 101 operated in Burma and pioneered the \n        art of unconventional warfare. It was the first United States \n        unit to deploy a large guerrilla army deep in enemy territory. \n        It has been credited with the highest kill/loss ratio for any \n        infantry-type unit in American military history and was awarded \n        a Presidential Unit Citation.\n            (13) Its X-2 branch pioneered counterintelligence with the \n        British and established the modern counterintelligence \n        community. The network of contacts built by the OSS with \n        foreign intelligence services led to enduring Cold War \n        alliances.\n            (14) Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North \n        Africa in November 1942, was aided by the networks established \n        and information acquired by the OSS to guide Allied landings.\n            (15) OSS Operation Halyard rescued more than 500 downed \n        airmen trapped behind enemy lines in Yugoslavia, one of the \n        most daring and successful rescue operations of World War II.\n            (16) OSS ``Mercy Missions'' at the end of World War II \n        saved the lives of thousands of Allied prisoners of war whom it \n        was feared would be murdered by the Japanese.\n            (17) The handful of surviving men and women of the OSS whom \n        General Donovan said performed ``some of the bravest acts of \n        the war'' are members of the ``Greatest Generation''. They have \n        never been collectively recognized for their heroic and \n        pioneering service in World War II.\n\nSEC. 3.
