    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury-Safe Seafood Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants, waste \n        incinerators, and other anthropogenic sources continues to \n        contaminate inland waterways and territorial waters of the \n        United States;\n            (2) mercury accumulates in fish as methylmercury and is \n        passed on to humans that eat those fish;\n            (3) methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin that, even in \n        small quantities--\n                    (A) can cause serious damage to the human central \n                nervous system and adverse effects on many other \n                systems in the human body;\n                    (B) is especially harmful to pregnant women and \n                young children; and\n                    (C) puts an estimated 60,000 newborns at risk for \n                adverse neurodevelopmental effects each year in the \n                United States from in utero exposure;\n            (4) certain commercial seafood species can have dangerously \n        high levels of methylmercury, as evidenced by Food and Drug \n        Administration data acquired in the 1990's, up to the time that \n        the agency discontinued domestic sampling in 1998;\n            (5) the Food and Drug Administration's long-standing action \n        level of 1.0 parts per million for methylmercury in fish--\n                    (A) is out of date; and\n                    (B) according to scientific evidence, does not \n                adequately protect pregnant women and young children;\n            (6) the comprehensive Mercury Study Report to Congress \n        issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in December 1997 \n        recommended a methylmercury consumption limit of 0.1 micrograms \n        per kilogram of body weight per day, which is 5 times lower \n        than the Food and Drug Administration's current action level;\n            (7) the report entitled ``Toxicological Effects of \n        Methylmercury'', issued by the National Academy of Sciences in \n        July 2000, confirmed that the Environmental Protection Agency's \n        limit is ``scientifically justifiable for the protection of \n        public health'';\n            (8) the report entitled ``Food Safety: Federal Oversight of \n        Seafood Does Not Sufficiently Protect Consumers'', issued by \n        the General Accounting Office in February 2001, highlights the \n        inadequacies of Food and Drug Administration guidance regarding \n        methylmercury in commercial seafood;\n            (9) many States have been forced to issue mercury \n        advisories for inland waterways and health warnings regarding \n        the fish that may be caught in those waterways; and\n            (10) some States have also issued mercury advisories for \n        commercial seafood.\n\nSEC. 3. TOLERANCE FOR METHYLMERCURY IN SEAFOOD.\n\n    Chapter IV of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n341 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) in section 402(a)(2), by inserting after ``section 512; \n        or'' the following: ``(D) if it is seafood that bears or \n        contains methylmercury that is unsafe within the meaning of \n        section 406A(a); or''; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 406 the following:\n\n``SEC. 406A.
