    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Aviation and Flight Enhancement \nAct of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The events of September 11, 2001, demonstrated that the \n        United States needs to do more to ensure the survivability and \n        quick retrieval of critical flight data and cockpit voice \n        recording units aboard commercial aircraft.\n            (2) Increased national security threats to commercial \n        airliners demand that the United States do everything possible \n        to better secure the safety of our passengers by ensuring the \n        quick and complete recovery of critical flight data from \n        commercial air disasters for immediate analysis of potential \n        terrorism and to avoid unnecessary grounding of our commercial \n        air fleet.\n            (3) In light of new commercial aviation advances, including \n        increased polar flights, increased air traffic overwater, and \n        the onset of free flight, there is increased potential for more \n        difficult location and recovery of fixed flight recorder and \n        cockpit voice recorder units.\n            (4) Hundreds of millions of dollars are unnecessarily \n        expended to locate and recover ``black boxes'', especially in \n        underwater investigations, despite existing deployable recorder \n        technology currently used by the United States Armed Forces, \n        which would allow us to avoid such unnecessary and wasteful \n        costs.\n            (5) It is in the public's best interest to accomplish these \n        improvements by installing a second set of cockpit voice and \n        digital flight data recorders that utilize a combined cockpit \n        voice recorder, digital flight data recorder, and emergency \n        locator transmitter system designed to eject from the rear of \n        the aircraft at the moment of an accident, so that the system \n        will avoid the direct impact forces of the crash, avoid \n        becoming ensnarled in the wreckage or fire intensity of the \n        crash site, and float indefinitely on water.\n            (6) The Navy's successful experience since 1993 with \n        deployable technology indicates that transfer of the commercial \n        version of this technology into the commercial sector provides \n        an obvious way to help us meet our goals to increase the \n        survivability and retrieval of recorders while reducing the \n        time and cost of a mishap, investigation, search, rescue, and \n        recovery.\n            (7) Valuable time is lost searching for fixed flight data \n        recorders in the wreckage of a crash site, especially at the \n        bottom of the ocean, and critical data is unnecessarily lost in \n        incidents in which the black boxes do not survive the crash \n        circumstances, as is evident in reviewing some of our most \n        recent and devastating air incidents, including the following:\n                    (A) Neither the flight data or cockpit voice \n                recorder was recovered from American Airlines Flight 11 \n                and United Airlines Flight 175 that were used in the \n                World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001.\n                    (B) It took 3 days to recover the flight data and \n                cockpit voice recorders from American Airlines Flight \n                77 that was used in the Pentagon attack on September \n                11, 2001. In addition, the cockpit voice recorder was \n                damaged beyond repair, rendering no information.\n                    (C) It took 13 days to locate the cockpit voice \n                recorder and 9 days to recover the flight data recorder \n                from the air disaster involving Egypt Air Flight 990 in \n                the vicinity of Nantucket, Massachusetts, air disaster \n                on October 31, 1999.\n                    (D) With respect to Swiss Air Flight 111 \n                International in Halifax, Canada, on September 2, 1998, \n                it took search teams 9 days to locate the cockpit voice \n                recorder and 4 days to recover the flight data \n                recorder.\n                    (E) In the case of Valuejet Flight 592, which \n                crashed on its way back to the Miami, Florida, airport \n                on May 11, 1996, it took 15 days to recover the cockpit \n                voice recorder, and 2 days to recover the flight data \n                recorder from such flight because the underwater \n                locator beacon failed.\n                    (F) With respect to TWA Flight 800 which exploded \n                and crashed in the ocean in the vicinity of Moriches, \n                New York, on July 17, 1996, it took 7 days to recover \n                the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.\n\nSEC. 3. REGULATIONS REQUIRING DEPLOYABLE RECORDERS AND OTHER PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 447 of title 49, United States Code is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 44729.
