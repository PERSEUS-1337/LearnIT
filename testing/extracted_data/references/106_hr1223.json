    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Teachers for the 21st Century Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The dawn of the 21st century will place increased \n        demands upon our Nation's students that can only be met with \n        the proper instruction from qualified, experienced, and well-\n        trained teachers. The teachers of the 21st century must not \n        only be well-versed in increasingly complex subject matters and \n        technologies, but also highly trained in the best techniques to \n        impart these skills to their students.\n            (2) Teacher development resources are severely lacking in \n        the majority of school districts across the Nation, leaving \n        many teachers ill-prepared to meet the growing, modern \n        challenges of educating children in the age of a global \n        workforce. Spending less than 3 percent of their resources on \n        teacher development, many American schools have fallen far \n        behind the curve of most corporations and schools in other \n        industrialized nations.\n            (3) Over the next 10 years, the Nation will face a \n        tremendous demand for 2,000,000 additional teachers resulting \n        from increased student enrollments and teacher attrition, which \n        will place many school districts in the precarious position of \n        choosing between quantity and quality. Already, the National \n        Commission on Teaching and America's Future has reported that \n        50,000 unqualified teachers have been hired annually on \n        emergency or substandard licenses to meet this growing demand.\n            (4) Teacher shortages will unevenly impact high-need urban \n        and rural communities that have the most difficulty attracting \n        and retaining qualified teachers. The National Center for \n        Education Statistics reports that 39 percent of teachers in \n        these communities have neither a college major or minor in \n        their primary field of coursework.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to establish or expand 10 National \nTeachers Academies, one in each of the 10 regions established by the \nDepartment of Education and serving at least 1 high-need local \neducation agency. The Academies will establish models for local \neducational agencies to improve teaching and learning by meeting the \n21st century challenges of recruiting and retaining qualified teachers, \nand giving teachers the tools they need to prepare their students for \ncompetition in a global workforce by--\n            (1) assembling a team of ``master'' teachers to mentor and \n        train student teachers on how to provide quality instruction;\n            (2) increasing the pool of ``master'' teachers by \n        partnering with education institutions that offer a range of \n        professional development opportunities including seminars, \n        institutes, or mini-research sabbaticals focused on the \n        knowledge and skills required in the 21st century;\n            (3) providing 1 or more demonstration sites for research-\n        based ``best practices'' in increasing student achievement, \n        classroom management and instruction, teacher mentoring, \n        training, and professional staff development;\n            (4) increasing collaboration between elementary, secondary, \n        and university faculty to improve the intensity and quality of \n        clinical experiences for prospective teachers;\n            (5) working with the regional national educational labs to \n        provide information obtained throughout the research and \n        development process to the Secretary for dissemination to \n        school districts across the Nation;\n            (6) entering into a partnership between local educational \n        agencies, State educational agencies, institutions of higher \n        education, education foundations, professional development and \n        recruitment centers, parent groups, corporations, and community \n        organizations;\n            (7) providing an opportunity for mid-career professionals \n        to obtain alternative teaching certification;\n            (8) offering ongoing professional development opportunities \n        and support and providing opportunities for teachers to engage \n        in research on specific issues of teaching and learning, and \n        developing test curriculum, instruction, and assessment; and\n            (9) providing students from disadvantaged communities with \n        challenging curriculum, quality instruction, and an overall \n        outstanding elementary and secondary education experience.\n\nSEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary is authorized to provide grants to \nnot more than 10 high-need local educational agencies or eligible \nconsortium, one in each of the 10 regions established by the Department \nof Education, to establish or expand National Teachers Academies.\n    (b) National Teachers Academy.--Each National Teachers Academy \nshall promote teacher training, professional development and \nrecruitment, and curriculum development.\n\nSEC. 5.
