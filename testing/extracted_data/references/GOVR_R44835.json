    "content": "Paid family leave (PFL) refers to partially or fully compensated time away from work for specific and generally significant family caregiving needs, such as the arrival of a new child or serious illness of a close family member. Although the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA; P.L. 103-3 ) provides eligible workers with a federal entitlement to unpaid leave for a limited set of family caregiving needs, no federal law requires private-sector employers to provide paid leave of any kind.  Currently, employees may access PFL if offered by an employer. In addition, some states have created family leave insurance (FLI) programs, which provide cash benefits to eligible workers who engage in certain (state-identified) family caregiving activities. In these states, workers can access PFL by combining an entitlement to unpaid leave with state-provided insurance benefits. Some Congressional proposals to expand national access to paid family leave expand upon these existing mechanisms. A new tax credit, created in December 2017 ( P.L. 115-97 ), seeks to expand voluntary employer-provided PFL, and\u2014similar to the state insurance approach\u2014the Family and Medical Insurance (FAMILY Act; S. 463 / H.R. 1185 ), which proposes to create a national wage insurance program for persons engaged in family caregiving activities or who take leave for their own serious health condition. The New Parents Act ( S. 920 / H.R. 1940 ) would allow parents of a new child to receive Social Security benefits, to be repaid at a later date, for the purposes of financing parental leave. Others proposals, such as the Working Parents Flexibility Act of 2019 ( H.R. 1859 ) and the Freedom for Families Act ( H.R. 2163 ), would amend the tax code to provide tax-advantages to individuals with caregiving responsibilities. Members of Congress who support increased access to paid leave generally cite as their motivation the significant and growing difficulties some workers face when balancing work and family responsibilities, and the financial challenges faced by many working families that put unpaid leave out of reach. In general, expected benefits of expanded access to PFL include stronger labor force attachment for family caregivers and greater income stability for their families, and improvements to worker morale, job tenure, and other productivity-related factors. Potential costs include the financing of payments made to workers on leave, other expenses related to periods of leave (e.g., hiring a temporary replacement or productivity losses related to an absence), and administrative costs. The magnitude and distributions of costs and benefits will depend on how the policy is implemented, including the size and duration of benefits, how benefits are financed, and other policy factors. This report provides an overview of paid family leave in the United States, summarizes state-level family leave insurance programs, notes PFL policies in other advanced-economy countries, and notes recent federal legislative action to increase access to paid family leave.  Throughout their careers, many workers encounter a variety of family caregiving obligations that conflict with work time. Some of these are broadly experienced by working families but tend to be short in duration, such as episodic child care conflicts, school meetings and events, routine medical appointments, and minor illness of an immediate family member. Others are more significant in terms of their impact on families and the amount of leave needed, but occur less frequently in the general worker population, such as the arrival of a new child or a serious medical condition that requires inpatient care or continuing treatment. Although all these needs for leave may be consequential for working families, the term family leave is generally used to describe the latter, more significant, group of needs that tend to require longer periods of time away from work. As defined in state law and federal proposals, family caregiving activities that are eligible for PFL or leave insurance benefits generally include caring for and bonding with a newly arrived child and attending to the serious medical needs of certain close family members; some also allow leave or benefits for workers with certain military family needs. In practice, day-to-day needs for leave to attend to family matters (e.g., a school conference or lapse in child care coverage), minor illness (e.g., common cold), or preventive care are not included among family leave categories. Employer-provided PFL in the private sector is voluntary. According to a national survey of employers conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 16% of private-industry employees had access to PFL (separate from other leave categories) through their employer in March 2018. These statistics, displayed in Table 1 , further show that PFL was more prevalent among managerial and professional occupations; information, financial, and professional and technical service industries; high-paying occupations; full-time workers; and workers in large companies (as measured by number of employees). Recent announcements by several large companies suggest that access may be increasing among certain groups of workers. Among new company policies announced in recent years, some emphasize parental leave (i.e., leave taken by mothers and fathers in connection with the arrival of a new child), and others offer broader uses of family leave. A 2017 study by the Pew Research Center (Pew) examined U.S. perceptions of and experiences with paid family and medical leave; its results provide insights into the need for such leave among U.S. workers and its availability for those who need it. Pew reports, for example, that 27% of persons who were employed for pay between November 2014 and November 2016 took leave (paid and unpaid) for family caregiving reasons or their own serious health condition over that time period, and another 16% had a need for such leave but were not able to take it. Among workers who were able to use leave, 47% received full pay, 36% received no pay, and 16% received partial pay. Consistent with BLS data, the Pew study indicates that lower-paid workers have less access to paid leave; among leave takers, 62% of workers in households with less than $30,000 in annual earnings reported they received no pay during leave, whereas this figure was 26% among those with annual household incomes at or above $75,000.  Some states have enacted legislation to create state paid FLI programs, which provide cash benefits to eligible workers who engage in certain caregiving activities. Four states\u2014California, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island\u2014have active programs. Three additional programs\u2014those in the District of Columbia (DC), Washington State, and Massachusetts\u2014await implementation.   Table 2 summarizes key provisions of state FLI laws and shows the following: The maximum weeks of benefits available to workers and wage replacement rates vary across states. Existing state FLI programs offer between 4 weeks (Rhode Island) and 10 weeks (New York) of benefits. Starting July 1, 2020, New Jersey is to increase benefit weeks from 6 to 12. When its plan is implemented, DC is to offer 8 weeks of paid family leave in 2020, and Washington State is to offer 12 weeks of paid family leave in the same year. New York's entitlement is to increase to 12 weeks of benefits when its plan is fully implemented in 2021. Massachusetts is to provide up to 12 weeks for family leave, unless leave is used to provide care to a seriously ill or injured military service member, when up to 26 weeks may be used. Program eligibility typically involves in-state employment of a minimum duration, minimum earnings in covered employment, or contributions to the insurance funds. All state FLI programs currently in operation are financed entirely by employee payroll tax receipts; however, when implemented, the DC program is set to be financed by employers. Massachusetts' and Washington State's programs are to be jointly financed by employers and employees, with some exceptions. Some FLI programs (e.g., Rhode Island) provide job protection directly to workers who receive FLI benefits, meaning that employers must allow a worker to return to his or her job after leave has ended. Workers in other states may receive job protection if they are entitled to leave under federal or state family and medical leave laws, and coordinate such job-protected leave and FLI benefits. Many advanced-economy countries entitle workers to some form of paid family leave. Whereas some provide leave to employees engaged in family caregiving (e.g., of parents, spouse, and other family members), many emphasize leave for new parents, mothers in particular.  As of 2016, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) family leave database counts 34 of its 35 members as providing some paid parental leave (i.e., to care for children) and maternity leave, with wide variation in the number of weeks and rate of wage replacement across countries. This is shown in Figure 1 , which plots the OECD's estimates of weeks of full-wage equivalent leave available to mothers. Weeks of full-wage equivalent leave are calculated as the number of weeks of leave available multiplied by the average wage payment rate. For example, a country that offers 12 weeks of leave at 50% pay would be said to offer 6 full-wage equivalent weeks of leave (i.e., 12 weeks x 50% = 6 weeks).  A smaller share (27 of 35) of OECD countries provides paid leave to new fathers. In some cases, fathers are entitled to less than a week of leave, often at full pay (e.g., Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands), whereas others provide several weeks of full or partial pay (e.g., Portugal provides five weeks at full pay, and the United Kingdom provides two weeks at an average payment rate of 20.2%). Some countries provide a separate entitlement to fathers for child caregiving purposes. This type of parental leave can be an individual entitlement for fathers or a family entitlement that can be drawn from by both parents. In the latter case, some countries (e.g., Japan, Luxembourg, and Finland) set aside a portion of the family entitlement for fathers' use, with the goal of encouraging fathers' participation in caregiving. Figure 2 summarizes paid leave entitlements reserved for fathers in OECD countries in 2016; it plots the OECD's estimates of weeks of full-wage equivalent paternity leave and parental leave reserved for fathers.  The OECD examined the availability of family caregiver leave among its member countries in 2011 and found that of the 25 countries for which it could identify information, 14 had polices providing paid leave to workers with ill or dying family members; these are summarized in Table 3 . Qualifying needs for leave, leave entitlement durations, benefit amounts, and eligibility conditions varied considerably across the countries included in the OECD study. The overarching goal of PFL legislative activity in the 116 th Congress has been to increase access to leave by reducing the costs associated with providing or taking leave. The Strong Families Act, which became law in December 2017 ( P.L. 115-97 ), allows employers to claim tax credits for a portion of wages paid to certain employees taking family or medical leave; this approach potentially increases access to PFL for workers while reducing the costs to employers of providing the leave. A second approach addresses costs incurred by workers taking leave. For example, the establishment of a national family leave insurance program, such as that proposed in the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act (FAMILY Act; S. 463 / H.R. 1185 ), would provide cash benefits to eligible individuals who are engaged in certain caregiving activities, potentially making the use of unpaid leave (e.g., as provided by FMLA or voluntarily by employers) affordable for some workers. Proposals such as the New Parents Act ( S. 920 / H.R. 1940 ) would allow eligible new parents to receive to up to three months of Social Security benefits, in return for deferring retirement (or early retirement) by a period of time determined by the Social Security Administration to cover the costs of the parental benefit. Other approaches include proposals to create tax-advantaged parental leave savings accounts (e.g., the Working Parents Flexibility Act of 2019, H.R. 1859 ) and tax-advantaged distributions from health savings accounts for family and medical leave purposes (e.g., the Freedom for Families Act, H.R. 2163 ). In addition, the President's FY2020 budget proposes to provide six weeks of financial support to new parents through state unemployment compensation (UC) programs. A similar approach was taken in 2000 by the Clinton Administration, which\u2014via Department of Labor regulations\u2014allowed states to use their UC programs to provide UC benefits to parents who take unpaid leave under the FMLA, other approved unpaid leave, or otherwise take time off from employment after the birth or adoption of a child. The Birth and Adoption Unemployment Compensation rule took effect in August 2000, and it was later removed from federal regulations in November 2003."
