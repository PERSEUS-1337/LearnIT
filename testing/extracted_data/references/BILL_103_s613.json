FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Principle 9 of the Declaration of the Rights of the \n        Child proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations \n        on November 20, 1959, states that ``. . . the child shall not \n        be admitted to employment before an appropriate minimum age; he \n        shall in no case be caused or permitted to engage in any \n        occupation or employment which would prejudice his health or \n        education, or interfere with his physical, mental or moral \n        development . . .''.\n            (2) Article 2 of the International Labor Convention No. 138 \n        Concerning Minimum Age For Admission to Employment states that, \n        ``The minimum age specified in pursuance of paragraph 1 of this \n        article shall not be less than the age of compulsory schooling \n        and, in any case, shall not be less than 15 years.''.\n            (3) According to the International Labor Organization, \n        worldwide an estimated 200,000,000 children under age 15 are \n        working, many of them in dangerous industries like mining and \n        fireworks.\n            (4) Children under the age 15 constitute approximately 11 \n        percent of the workforce in some Asian countries, 17 percent in \n        parts of Africa, and a reported 12-26 percent in many countries \n        in Latin America.\n            (5) The number of children under age 15 who are working, \n        and the scale of their suffering, increase every year, despite \n        the existence of more than 20 International Labor Organization \n        conventions on child labor and laws in many countries which \n        purportedly prohibit the employment of under age children\n            (6) In many countries, children under the age 15 lack \n        either the legal standing or means to protect themselves from \n        exploitation in the workplace.\n            (7) The employment of children under the age of 15 commonly \n        deprives the children of the opportunity for basic education \n        and also denies gainful employment to millions of adults.\n            (8) The employment of children under the age of 15, often \n        at pitifully low wages, undermines the stability of families \n        and ignores the importance of increasing jobs, aggregated \n        demand, and purchasing power among adults as a catalyst to the \n        development of internal markets and the achievement of broad-\n        based, self-reliant economic development in many developing \n        countries.\n            (9) Adult workers in the United States and other developed \n        countries should not have their jobs imperiled by imports \n        produced by child labor in developing countries.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to curtail the employment \nof children under age 15 in the production of goods for export by--\n            (1) eliminating the role of the United States in providing \n        a market for foreign products made by underage children; and\n            (2) encouraging other nations to join in a ban on trade in \n        such products.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES INITIATIVE TO CURTAIL INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN \n              PRODUCTS OF CHILD LABOR.\n\n    In pursuit of the policy set forth in this Act, the President is \nurged to seek an agreement with governments that conduct trade with the \nUnited States for the purpose of securing an international ban on trade \nin the products of child labor.\n\nSEC. 4.
