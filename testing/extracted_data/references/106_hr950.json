    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Beaches Environmental Assessment, \nClosure, and Health Act of 1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Nation's beaches and coastal recreation waters are \n        valuable public resources used for recreation by millions of \n        people annually;\n            (2) the beaches of coastal States are hosts to many out-of-\n        State and international visitors;\n            (3) tourism in the coastal zone generates billions of \n        dollars annually;\n            (4) increased population and urbanization of the watershed \n        have contributed to the decline in the environmental quality of \n        coastal waters;\n            (5) pollution in coastal waters is not restricted by State \n        and other political boundaries;\n            (6) coastal States have different methods of testing, and \n        parameters for evaluating, the quality of coastal recreation \n        waters, providing varying degrees of protection to the public;\n            (7) the adoption of consistent criteria by coastal States \n        for monitoring and evaluating the quality of coastal recreation \n        waters, and the posting of signs at beaches notifying the \n        public during periods when the standards are exceeded, would \n        enhance public health and safety; and\n            (8) while the adoption of such criteria will enhance public \n        health and safety, exceedances of such criteria should be \n        addressed (for example, as part of a watershed approach to \n        effectively identify and eliminate sources of pollution).\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require uniform \ncriteria and procedures for testing, monitoring, and notifying users of \nthose coastal recreation waters and beaches open for use by the public \nin order to protect public safety and improve environmental quality.\n\nSEC. 3. BEACH AND COASTAL RECREATION WATER QUALITY.\n\n    The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n\n        ``TITLE VII--BEACH AND COASTAL RECREATION WATER QUALITY\n\n``SEC. 701. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    ``In this title, the following definitions apply:\n            ``(1) Coastal recreation waters.--The term `coastal \n        recreation waters' means waters adjacent to public beaches of \n        the Great Lakes and other marine coastal waters (including \n        bays, lagoon mouths, and coastal estuaries within the tidal \n        zone) used by the public for swimming, bathing, surfing, or \n        other similar water contact activities.\n            ``(2) Floatable materials.--The term `floatable materials' \n        means any foreign matter that may float or remain suspended in \n        the water column and includes plastic, aluminum cans, wood, \n        bottles, paper products, and fishing gear.\n\n``SEC. 702.

Such water quality criteria shall be developed and promulgated \nin accordance with the requirements of section 303(c). A State shall \nincorporate such criteria into all appropriate programs into which such \nState would incorporate other water quality criteria adopted under \nsection 303(c) and revise such criteria not later than 3 years \nfollowing the date of publication of revisions by the Administrator \nunder section 703(b).\n    ``(b) Failure of States To Adopt.--If a State has not complied with \nsubsection (a) by the last day of the 3\\1/2\\-year period beginning on \nthe date of the enactment of this title, the water quality criteria \nissued by the Administrator under section 304(a)(1) shall become \napplicable as the water quality criteria for coastal recreational \nwaters for the State, and shall be deemed to have been promulgated by \nthe Administrator pursuant to section 303(c)(4).\n\n``SEC. 703.
