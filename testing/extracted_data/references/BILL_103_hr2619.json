FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Foreign language proficiency will help Americans to \n        understand other customs and cultures, conduct effective \n        foreign policy, expand international trade, ensure the \n        integrity of national defense and security, and develop a truly \n        broad-based education for all citizens.\n            (2) The business community suffers from United States \n        educational deficiencies, including inadequate foreign language \n        instruction. To compete, Americans must know more about their \n        economic partners and competitors. To do business overseas, \n        Americans must understand the customer's language and customs.\n            (3) Of the world's 10 most populous languages, representing \n        potential markets, 6 of them, Malay-Indonesian, Bengali, Hindi, \n        Portuguese, and some dialects of Arabic and Chinese, are not \n        widely taught in the United States.\n            (4) In Europe, there are dozens of universities with \n        schools of practical interpretation and translation. In the \n        United States, very few institutions of higher education offer \n        training in translation and interpretation, and only one offers \n        an undergraduate degree program.\n            (5) Most professional interpreters and translators working \n        in the United States are foreign-born or received their \n        professional training in other countries.\n            (6) Only 8 percent of our universities require foreign \n        languages for admission, and only 5 percent of our college \n        graduates are fluent in any language other than English. \n        American colleges and universities must place a new emphasis on \n        improving the teaching of foreign languages, regional studies, \n        and international studies to help meet such challenges.\n            (7) Many teachers lack adequate international preparation. \n        Only 5 percent of current elementary and secondary teachers \n        ever took international relations, or geography courses while \n        in school.\n            (8) Fewer than 5 percent of the elementary school students \n        in this country receive foreign language instruction, and only \n        17 percent of United States public elementary schools offer any \n        form of language instruction.\n            (9) As new and increased language instruction becomes \n        necessary, educators to teach these languages are becoming \n        increasingly difficult to find. 35 States are currently \n        reporting a shortage in foreign language teachers.\n\nSEC. 3.
