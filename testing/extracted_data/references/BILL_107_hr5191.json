FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Oral and general health are inseparable, and good \n        dental care is critical to our overall physical health and \n        well-being, yet 108 million Americans have no public or private \n        dental insurance.\n            (2) Although oral health in America has improved \n        dramatically over the last 50 years, dental caries (cavities) \n        are presently the single most common chronic childhood disease, \n        five times more likely than asthma and seven times more common \n        than hay fever.\n            (3) According to the Surgeon General, low-income, minority \n        children experience significant disparities in oral health \n        status and access to basic dental care. In a year-long study, \n        the Surgeon General found that fewer than one in five Medicaid-\n        covered children received a single dental visit during that \n        period and that 25 percent of poor and minority children never \n        visit a dentist before entering kindergarten.\n            (4) Poor children are more than twice as likely than their \n        more affluent peers to have dental caries, which cause a \n        significant amount of pain to children and cause difficulty \n        eating, playing and learning, as well as many missed days of \n        school, and which are more likely to go untreated. Surveys have \n        shown that children miss nearly 52 million hours of school each \n        year because of dental problems.\n            (5) Low-income adults face similar problems with pain and \n        limitations on daily activities and are more likely than those \n        with higher incomes to lose permanent teeth and have untreated \n        dental disease. Among adult workers, more than 164 million work \n        hours are lost annually because of dental problems.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENT FOR DENTAL BENEFITS UNDER SCHIP.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 2103(c)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1397cc(c)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsubparagraph:\n                    ``(E) Dental services.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall \ntake effect on January 1, 2003.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE DENTAL COVERAGE UNDER SCHIP AS A \n              SUPPLEMENT TO OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE.\n\n    (a) Authority To Provide Coverage.--\n            (1) SCHIP.--\n                    (A) In general.--Section 2105(a)(1)(C) of the \n                Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397ee(a)(1)(C)) is \n                amended--\n                            (i) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(C)''; and\n                            (ii) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(ii) notwithstanding clause (i), in the case of a \n                State that satisfies the conditions described in \n                subsection (c)(8) and at the option of a State, for \n                child health assistance that consists only of coverage \n                of dental services for a child who would be considered \n                a targeted low-income child if--\n                            ``(I) that portion of subparagraph (C) of \n                        section 2110(b)(1) relating to coverage of the \n                        child under a group health plan or under health \n                        insurance coverage did not apply, and such \n                        child has such coverage that does not include \n                        coverage of dental services;
