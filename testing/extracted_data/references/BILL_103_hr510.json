FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Deteriorating Situation Facing Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.--\nThe Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The situation of indigenous and tribal peoples in \n        developing countries is deteriorating world-wide.\n            (2) Many of these populations face severe discrimination, \n        denial of human rights, loss of cultural and religious \n        freedoms, or in the worst cases, cultural or physical \n        destruction.\n            (3) If current trends in many parts of the world continue \n        the cultural, social, and linguistic diversity of humankind \n        will be radically and irrevocably diminished.\n            (4) In addition, immense, undocumented repositories of \n        ecological, biological, and pharmacological knowledge will be \n        lost, as well as an immeasurable wealth of cultural, social, \n        religious, and artistic expression, which together constitute \n        part of the collective patrimony of the human species.\n            (5) The pressures on indigenous and tribal peoples, about \n        10 percent of the world's population, include denial of \n        political and civil rights and of opportunities for self-\n        determination, destruction of natural resources necessary for \n        survival, and ethnic, racial, and economic marginalization.\n            (6) In many cases, unsound development policy that results \n        in destruction of natural resources seriously jeopardizes \n        indigenous and tribal peoples' physical survival and their \n        cultural autonomy, frequently also undermining the possibility \n        for long-term sustainable economic development.\n            (7) The loss of the cultural diversity for indigenous and \n        tribal peoples is not an inevitable or natural process.\n            (8) In light of United States concern and respect for human \n        rights and basic human freedoms, including rights to express \n        cultural and religious preferences, as well as the United \n        States desire for sustainable economic development, it is \n        incumbent on the United States to take a leadership role in \n        addressing indigenous and tribal peoples' rights to physical \n        and cultural survival.\n    (b) Definition of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.--Indigenous and \ntribal peoples in developing countries are those populations that are \nethnically, culturally, or socially distinct from the politically \ndominant society on the regional or national level. These peoples are \noften (but not invariably) minorities, and invariably have little, if \nany, political representation or influence in governments. Many such \npeoples are marginally integrated into market economies and practice \ntraditional, partially or wholly subsistence-based forms of economic \nactivity. Examples of indigenous or tribal peoples include lowland \nSouth American Indians, Basarwa of Botswana and Namibia, Mayan Indians \nin Central America, and registered tribes in India.\n\nSEC. 3. PROMOTING AND PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS AND TRIBAL \n              PEOPLES.\n\n    The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the Agency for \nInternational Development shall ensure--\n            (1) that United States foreign policy and foreign \n        assistance vigorously promote the rights of indigenous and \n        tribal peoples throughout the world; and\n            (2) that United States foreign assistance is not provided \n        for any project or program detrimental to the rights of \n        indigenous or tribal peoples or to their livelihood.\nThe rights of indigenous and tribal peoples to be promoted and \nprotected pursuant to this section include the right to maintain their \ncultural, religious, and other traditions, customs, and institutions.\n\nSEC. 4.
