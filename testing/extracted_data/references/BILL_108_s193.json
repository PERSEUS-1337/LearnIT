FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the possibility of a terrorist group using a dirty bomb \n        as a weapon against the United States is 1 of the greatest \n        threats to national security;\n            (2) it is not difficult to transport dirty bomb material \n        and conventional explosives into the United States in a sea \n        freight container or bulk material cargo;\n            (3) because of the threat of dirty bombs to national \n        security and the limitations of the current radiation detection \n        system with respect to detecting dirty bombs, the Secretary of \n        Energy should carry out a program to demonstrate the operation \n        of a large-scale radiation detection system that uses advanced \n        scanning technologies to enable more sea freight containers and \n        bulk material cargo to be inspected at seaports and places of \n        entry by land;\n            (4) in selecting a system for demonstration, the Secretary \n        should give priority to existing radiation detection \n        technologies that--\n                    (A) have proven to be effective nationally and \n                internationally;\n                    (B) may be quickly implemented; and\n                    (C) are capable of detecting radioactive sources in \n                sea freight containers and bulk material cargo to a \n                reasonable depth;\n            (5) the selected system should--\n                    (A) screen sea freight containers and bulk material \n                cargo without, to the maximum extent practicable, \n                inhibiting the flow of commerce at seaports and places \n                of entry by land;\n                    (B) operate at a level capable of detecting a \n                heavily shielded, concealed, radioactive source; and\n                    (C) have the capability of distinguishing between--\n                            (i) a nonthreatening radioactive source; \n                        and\n                            (ii) a radioactive source that is being \n                        used, or capable of being used, as a dirty \n                        bomb;\n            (6) any information that is obtained during the scanning of \n        sea freight containers and bulk material cargo should be \n        maintained in a central data collection system to be archived \n        in real-time and made available to the appropriate Federal, \n        State, and local agencies for use in tracking and analyzing \n        trends and alarm conditions and operating radiation detection \n        systems;\n            (7) pilot projects for monitoring sea freight containers \n        and bulk material cargo that are carried out under this Act \n        should incorporate information obtained from all other national \n        and international projects pertaining to inspection of sea \n        containers and cargo shipped across places of entry by land; \n        and\n            (8) in developing the final procedures and protocols for \n        monitoring sea freight containers and bulk material cargo for \n        radiation, the Secretary should ensure that the procedures and \n        protocols--\n                    (A) address situations that seaport and land \n                authorities may confront during the scanning of \n                incoming cargoes; and\n                    (B) provide the seaport and land authorities with \n                the necessary guidance to adequately respond to the \n                situations.\n\nSEC. 3.
