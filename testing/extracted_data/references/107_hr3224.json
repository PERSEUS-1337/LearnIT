    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Drinking Water Assistance \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) drinking water standards proposed and in effect as of \n        the date of enactment of this Act will place a large financial \n        burden on many public water systems, especially those public \n        water systems in rural communities serving small populations;\n            (2) the limited scientific, technical, and professional \n        resources available in small communities complicate the \n        implementation of regulatory requirements;\n            (3) small communities often cannot afford to meet water \n        quality standards because of the expenses associated with \n        upgrading public water systems and training personnel to \n        operate and maintain the public water systems;\n            (4) small communities do not have a tax base for dealing \n        with the costs of upgrading their public water systems;\n            (5) small communities face high per capita costs in \n        improving drinking water quality;\n            (6) small communities would greatly benefit from a grant \n        program designed to provide funding for water quality projects;\n            (7) as of the date of enactment of this Act, there is no \n        Federal program in effect that adequately meets the needs of \n        small, primarily rural communities with respect to public water \n        systems; and\n            (8) since new, more protective arsenic drinking water \n        standards proposed by the Clinton and Bush administrations, \n        respectively, are expected to be implemented in 2006, the grant \n        program established by the amendment made by this Act should be \n        implemented in a manner that ensures that the implementation of \n        those new standards is not delayed.\n\nSEC. 3.
