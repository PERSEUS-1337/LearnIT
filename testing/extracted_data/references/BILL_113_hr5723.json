FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Medicaid plays a key role in providing coverage for \n        millions of working families.\n            (2) Medicaid enrollees include families, pregnant women, \n        children, individuals with disabilities, and other low-income \n        individuals. Without Medicaid coverage, many enrollees would be \n        uninsured or lack coverage for services they need.\n            (3) In 2013, the Medicaid program covered 62,000,000 \n        individuals, or 1 in every 5 Americans. This number will \n        continue to grow, particularly since the Affordable Care Act \n        significantly expanded eligibility to millions of uninsured \n        adults. Enrollment in Medicaid and the Children's Health \n        Insurance Program is projected to increase by 12,800,000 by \n        2016.\n            (4) If all States expand their Medicaid programs, an \n        estimated 7,000,000 women ages 18 to 64 would gain coverage \n        under Medicaid.\n            (5) In 47 States and in the District of Columbia, Medicaid \n        pays up to 67 percent less than Medicare for the same primary \n        care services.\n            (6) Multiple studies have concluded that higher Medicaid \n        payment rates would increase the probability of primary care \n        providers accepting new Medicaid patients, and would further \n        support current Medicaid providers.\n            (7) Congress has recognized that low provider participation \n        in Medicaid decreases access to health care. To address this \n        problem, Congress acted to increase Medicaid payments for \n        certain primary care services to be not less than the Medicare \n        payment rates for 2013 and 2014.\n            (8) As more Americans become insured and empowered \n        participants in their own health care, demand for primary care \n        services is expected to increase over the next few years.\n            (9) Six in 10 women ages 18 to 44 (58 percent) report they \n        see an obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physician on a \n        regular basis. They are more likely to see their OB/GYN \n        physician on a regular basis than any other type of provider. \n        Given that women comprise the majority of Medicaid enrollees, \n        it is critical that primary care providers, including OB/GYN \n        physicians, receive sufficient reimbursement to participate in \n        Medicaid.\n            (10) Nurse practitioners and other mid-level health \n        professionals deliver many primary care services. Applying \n        Medicare's rates for nurse practitioners and mid-level health \n        professionals encourages greater participation in Medicaid, \n        thereby increasing access to primary care, particularly in \n        underserved areas.\n            (11) The enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rate ensures \n        providers have the financial capability to serve their \n        patients' primary care needs. Furthermore, adding nurse \n        practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse-midwives, \n        and OB/GYN physicians serving in primary care settings \n        increases access to critical health care services for women and \n        children nationwide.\n\nSEC. 3. EXTENSION OF APPLICATION OF MEDICARE PAYMENT RATE FLOOR TO \n              PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FURNISHED UNDER MEDICAID AND \n              APPLICATION TO ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1902(a)(13) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)) is amended by striking subparagraph (C) and \ninserting the following:\n                    ``(C) payment for primary care services (as defined \n                in subsection (jj)) at a rate that is not less than 100 \n                percent of the payment rate that applies to such \n                services and physician under part B of title XVIII (or, \n                if greater, the payment rate that would be applicable \n                under such part if the conversion factor under section \n                1848(d) for the year involved were the conversion \n                factor under such section for 2009), and that is not \n                less than the rate that would otherwise apply to such \n                services under this title if the rate were determined \n                without regard to this subparagraph, and that are--\n                            ``(i) furnished in 2013 and 2014, by a \n                        physician with a primary specialty designation \n                        of family medicine, general internal medicine, \n                        or pediatric medicine;
