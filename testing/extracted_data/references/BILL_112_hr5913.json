FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, \nand Management of the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \nRepresentatives held a series of four hearings related to the \nmanagement of the Department of Homeland Security. The key findings \nfrom such hearings were the following:\n            (1) The Department of Homeland Security has not prioritized \n        the missions outlined in its key strategic planning documents. \n        This lack of prioritization may hinder the Department's efforts \n        to effectively manage risks to the United States. Since 2003, \n        the Government Accountability Office designated the \n        transformation of the Department as high risk because the \n        Department had to transform 22 agencies--several with major \n        management challenges--into one department, and failure to \n        effectively address the Department's management and mission \n        risks could have serious consequences to United States national \n        and economic security. The Government Accountability Office \n        continues to designate the transformation of the Department as \n        high risk.\n            (2) The Department has considerable work ahead to achieve \n        actions and outcomes critical to addressing persistent \n        management challenges. For example, a significant number of \n        acquisition programs proceeded without component or \n        departmental approval of essential planning documents. These \n        reviews are important to ensure the success of an acquisition \n        program. The Department also continues to face challenges \n        implementing key human capital initiatives. Integrating \n        financial data essential to effectively managing the Department \n        also remains a challenge.\n            (3) Areas of duplicative effort have also been identified \n        within the Department. For example, some Federal Government \n        agencies are paying fees to the Department's Federal Protective \n        Service for facility risk assessments that are not being \n        performed, while at the same time performing their own risk \n        assessments. The Department also lacks robust acquisition \n        practices in place to position programs for success. Federal \n        Government auditors questioned U.S. Customs and Border \n        Protection's plan to secure the Arizona border because the \n        agency could not justify the specific types, quantities, cost, \n        and deployment locations of its surveillance technologies.\n            (4) Investigators continue to identify cases of employee \n        corruption within the Department. Investigations by the \n        Department's Inspector General led to over 400 arrests of \n        employees in 2011. Examples include Border Patrol agents \n        accepting bribes, thefts by airport screeners, and immigration \n        officers complicit in fraud. In addition, overall employee \n        morale in the Department remains one of the lowest in the \n        Federal Government.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established in the legislative branch an independent \nadvisory panel to--\n            (1) comprehensively assess the management structure and \n        capabilities related to the Department of Homeland Security; \n        and\n            (2) make recommendations to improve the efficiency and \n        effectiveness of the management of the Department.\n\nSEC. 4.
