FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is in the best interest of the United States to \n        develop clean renewable geothermal energy;\n            (2) development of that energy should be promoted on \n        appropriate Federal land;\n            (3) under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801 et \n        seq.), the Bureau of Land Management is authorized to issue 3 \n        different types of noncompetitive leases for production of \n        geothermal energy on Federal land, including--\n                    (A) noncompetitive geothermal leases to mining \n                claim holders that have a valid operating plan;\n                    (B) direct use leases; and\n                    (C) leases on parcels that do not sell at a \n                competitive auction;\n            (4) Federal geothermal energy leasing activity should be \n        directed toward persons seeking to develop the land as opposed \n        to persons seeking to speculate on geothermal resources and \n        artificially raising the cost of legitimate geothermal energy \n        development;\n            (5) developers of geothermal energy on Federal land that \n        have invested substantial capital and made high risk \n        investments should be allowed to secure a discovery of \n        geothermal energy resources; and\n            (6) successful geothermal development on Federal land will \n        provide increased revenue to the Federal Government, with the \n        payment of production royalties over decades.\n\nSEC. 3. NONCOMPETITIVE LEASING OF ADJOINING AREAS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF \n              GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES.\n\n    Section 4(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. \n1003(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(4) Adjoining land.--\n                    ``(A) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n                            ``(i) Fair market value per acre.--The term \n                        `fair market value per acre' means a dollar \n                        amount per acre that--\n                                    ``(I) except as provided in this \n                                clause, shall be equal to the market \n                                value per acre as determined by the \n                                Secretary under regulations issued \n                                under this paragraph;\n                                    ``(II) shall be determined by the \n                                Secretary with respect to a lease under \n                                this paragraph, by not later than the \n                                end of the 90-day period beginning on \n                                the date the Secretary receives an \n                                application for the lease;
