    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``College Literacy in Finance and \nEconomics Act of 2011'' or the ``College LIFE Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Student borrowing is widespread in higher education, \n        and more than $100,000,000,000 in Federal education loans are \n        originated each year. In 2008, 62 percent of recipients of a \n        baccalaureate degree graduated with student debt.\n            (2) Forty-eight percent of students at 4-year public \n        institutions of higher education borrow money to pay for \n        college, as do 57 percent of students at 4-year private \n        institutions of higher education, and 96 percent of students at \n        for-profit institutions of higher education.\n            (3) In 2008, 92 percent of Black students, 85 percent of \n        Hispanic students, 85 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native \n        students, 82 percent of multi-racial students, 80 percent of \n        Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students, 77 percent of White \n        students, and 68 percent of Asian students received financial \n        aid.\n            (4) Students depart from institutions of higher education \n        with significant debt. In 2008, the average student loan debt \n        among graduates of institutions of higher education was \n        $23,186, and 1 in 10 recipients of a baccalaureate degree \n        graduated with at least $40,000 in debt. In 2008, 57 percent of \n        recipients of a baccalaureate degree from a for-profit \n        institution of higher education owed more than $30,000, and the \n        median amount of debt was $32,700. Since 2003, the average \n        cumulative debt among students at institutions of higher \n        education has increased by 5.6 percent each year.\n            (5) Students enrolled in for-profit institutions of higher \n        education account for 47 percent of all student loan defaults, \n        despite representing approximately 10 percent of all students \n        enrolled in institutions of higher education. Since 2003, the \n        national cohort default rate has increased from 4.5 percent to \n        7 percent.\n            (6) Students rely on access to credit. Fifty-six percent of \n        dependent students at institutions of higher education had a \n        credit card in their own name in 2004. The average credit card \n        balance among such students who were carrying a balance on \n        their cards was $2,000.\n            (7) According to the National Foundation for Credit \n        Counseling, the majority of adults (56 percent of adults in the \n        United States, or 127,000,000 people) do not have a budget or \n        keep close track of expenses or spending.\n            (8) According to a 2009 National Bankruptcy Research Center \n        study, consumers who received financial education through pre-\n        bankruptcy counseling had 27.5 percent fewer delinquent \n        accounts and remained current on their accounts for 29 percent \n        longer than consumers who did not receive such counseling.\n            (9) According to the Financial Industry Regulatory \n        Authority Investor Education Foundation, less than \\1/3\\ of \n        young adults (ages 18 to 29) set aside emergency savings to \n        weather unexpected financial challenges.\n            (10) According to a Jump$tart Coalition for Personal \n        Financial Literacy survey, 62 percent of high school students \n        cannot pass a basic personal finance exam, and financial \n        literacy scores among future higher education students are low.\n            (11) According to research by the National Endowment for \n        Financial Education and the University of Arizona, schools are \n        the institutions that students trust most to help increase \n        their knowledge of personal finance.\n\nSEC. 3.
