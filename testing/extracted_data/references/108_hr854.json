FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) The United States supports the promotion of democracy, \n    respect for human rights, and the rule of law in the Republic of \n    Belarus consistent with its commitments as a participating state of \n    the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\n        (2) The United States has a vital interest in the independence \n    and sovereignty of the Republic of Belarus and its integration into \n    the European community of democracies.\n        (3) In November 1996, Lukashenka orchestrated an illegal and \n    unconstitutional referendum that enabled him to impose a new \n    constitution, abolish the duly-elected parliament, the 13th Supreme \n    Soviet, install a largely powerless National Assembly, and extend \n    his term of office to 2001.\n        (4) Democratic forces in Belarus have organized peaceful \n    demonstrations against the Lukashenka regime in cities and towns \n    throughout Belarus which led to beatings, mass arrests, and \n    extended incarcerations.\n        (5) Victor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovsky, and Yuri Zakharenka, who \n    have been leaders and supporters of the democratic forces in \n    Belarus, and Dmitry Zavadsky, a journalist known for his critical \n    reporting in Belarus, have disappeared and are presumed dead.\n        (6) Former Belarus Government officials have come forward with \n    credible allegations and evidence that top officials of the \n    Lukashenka regime were involved in the disappearances.\n        (7) The Belarusian authorities have mounted a major systematic \n    crackdown on civil society through the closure, harassment, and \n    repression of nongovernmental organizations, and independent trade \n    unions.\n        (8) The Belarusian authorities actively suppress freedom of \n    speech and expression, including engaging in systematic reprisals \n    against independent media.\n        (9) The Lukashenka regime has reversed the revival of \n    Belarusian language and culture, including through the closure of \n    the National Humanities Lyceum, the last remaining high school \n    where classes were taught in the Belarusian language.\n        (10) The Lukashenka regime harasses the autocephalic Belarusian \n    Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Jewish community, \n    the Hindu Lights of Kalyasa community, evangelical Protestant \n    churches (such as Baptist and Pentecostal groups), and other \n    minority religious groups.\n        (11) The Law on Religious Freedom and Religious Organizations, \n    passed by the National Assembly and signed by Lukashenka on October \n    31, 2002, establishes one of the most repressive legal regimes in \n    the OSCE region, severely limiting religious freedom and placing \n    excessively burdensome government controls on religious practice.\n        (12) The parliamentary elections of October 15, 2000, and the \n    presidential election of September 9, 2001, were determined to be \n    fundamentally unfair and nondemocratic.\n        (13) The Government of Belarus has made no substantive progress \n    in addressing criteria established by the OSCE in 2000, ending \n    repression and the climate of fear, permitting a functioning \n    independent media, ensuring transparency of the elections process, \n    and strengthening of the functions of parliament.\n\nSEC. 3.
