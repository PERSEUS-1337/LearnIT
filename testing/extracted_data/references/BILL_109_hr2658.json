STATEMENT OF PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to clarify the jurisdiction of the Federal Government \n        over waters of the United States in light of the decision of \n        the Supreme Court in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County \n        v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159 (2001), so that, \n        consistent with the States' traditional and primary power over \n        land and water use, waters such as isolated wetlands that do \n        not have a significant nexus with traditional navigable waters \n        are not subject to Federal jurisdiction, but remain subject to \n        regulation by the States;\n            (2) to provide consistency throughout the Nation in \n        determining the jurisdiction of the Federal Government over \n        waters of the United States;\n            (3) to consolidate in one Federal agency the administrative \n        authority of the Federal Government to determine, in accordance \n        with this Act, the waters of the United States subject to the \n        jurisdiction of the permitting program established by section \n        404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \n        1344); and\n            (4) to protect the right of States to regulate wetlands and \n        other waters within their jurisdiction.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL JURISDICTION.\n\n    Section 404(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \nU.S.C. 1344(a)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``(a) The Secretary'' and inserting the \n        following:\n    ``(a) Issuance of Permits.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(2) Jurisdiction.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Waters of the United States, \n                including the territorial seas, shall be subject to the \n                jurisdiction of the permitting program established by \n                this section if the waters are--\n                            ``(i) navigable;\n                            ``(ii) connected to navigable waters \n                        through a continuous, naturally occurring \n                        surface water connection; or\n                            ``(iii) wetlands adjacent to waters \n                        described in clause (i) or (ii).\n                    ``(B) Included waters.--For purposes of \n                subparagraph (A)(ii) waters shall be considered to be \n                connected to navigable waters by a continuous, \n                naturally occurring surface water connection if the \n                waters are connected by perennial or intermittent \n                streams that contribute flow to navigable waters, \n                including perennial or intermittent streams that have \n                been restored, relocated, or channelized on the surface \n                or that flow through culverts.\n                    ``(C) Excluded waters.--\n                            ``(i) In general.--For purposes of \n                        subparagraph (A)(ii), waters shall not be \n                        considered to be connected to navigable waters \n                        by a continuous, naturally occurring surface \n                        water connection if the waters are connected \n                        by--\n                                    ``(I) sheet flow;\n                                    ``(II) ephemeral waters, ground \n                                water, manmade ditches, or pipelines; \n                                or\n                                    ``(III) a municipal separate storm \n                                sewer system or any other point source \n                                regulated under section 402, including \n                                a State program approved under section \n                                402(b).\n                            ``(ii) Treatment of connecting waters.--The \n                        connecting waters described in clause (i) shall \n                        not be subject to the jurisdiction of the \n                        permitting program established by this section.\n                            ``(iii) Fastlands.--Fastlands shall not be \n                        subject to the jurisdiction of the permitting \n                        program established by this section.''.\n\nSEC. 4. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act, shall be \nconstrued to preclude or deny the right of any State or interstate \nagency to control the discharge of dredged or fill material in any \nportion of the wetlands or other waters within the jurisdiction of such \nState, including any activity of any Federal agency.\n\nSEC. 5.
