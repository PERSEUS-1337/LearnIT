GEOGRAPHY EDUCATION.\n\n    Title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1021 et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                     ``PART C--GEOGRAPHY EDUCATION\n\n``SEC. 231. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress makes the following findings:\n            ``(1) Geographic literacy is essential to a well-prepared \n        citizenry in the 21st Century because geographic factors assume \n        greater importance as the world's economies, societies, and \n        political structures grow more global in scale.\n            ``(2) In a recent National Geographic-Roper 9-country \n        survey of geographic literacy among young adults aged 18 \n        through 24, Americans ranked second to last. Only 13 percent of \n        young adults aged 18 through 24 in the United States were able \n        to correctly identify Iraq on a map of Asia and the Middle \n        East.\n            ``(3) The economic stature and competitiveness of the \n        United States requires increasingly sophisticated levels of \n        geographic knowledge and mastery of geographic tools.\n            ``(4) United States Department of Labor data identifies \n        geotechnology as one of the 3 fastest growing employment fields \n        serving industries such as insurance, banking, real estate, \n        forestry, and agriculture as well as Federal, State, and local \n        Governments.\n            ``(5) The National Academy of Sciences urged creation of a \n        national program to improve the geographic competence of the \n        United States general population and the school age population.\n            ``(6) Geography is defined as a `core academic subject' \n        within the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.\n            ``(7) A recent National Geographic Society survey found \n        that all 50 States and the District of Columbia recognize \n        geography in their curricula or content standards, and an \n        increasing number require geography for graduation and include \n        geography in mandated statewide assessments.\n            ``(8) Seven of 10 educators responding to a National \n        Geographic survey felt their professional development \n        opportunities in geography were inadequate and half believed \n        their schools had inadequate basic materials for teaching \n        geography.\n            ``(9) The National Geographic Society has spent over 15 \n        years pioneering an extraordinarily effective national program \n        for improving the teaching of geography by engaging university \n        faculty geographers and highly trained teachers in State \n        Geographic Alliances dedicated to providing high quality \n        professional development opportunities for kindergarten through \n        grade 12 teachers.\n            ``(10) More than 60 colleges and universities in all 50 \n        States have received grants from the National Geographic \n        Society to support State Geographic Alliances and their \n        professional development programs. Alliance-trained \n        kindergarten through grade 12 teachers and their higher \n        education partners conduct workshops, develop localized \n        teaching materials, and facilitate communication among \n        thousands of teachers whose responsibilities include teaching \n        of geography in various formats and grade levels.\n            ``(11) A study by Mid-continent Research for Education and \n        Learning that assessed student academic achievement in \n        geography on the National Assessment of Educational Progress \n        showed that students taught by Alliance-trained teachers \n        outperformed other students by almost 10 percent.\n\n``SEC. 232.
