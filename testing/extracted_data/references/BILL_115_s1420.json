FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) During the so-called ``Lavender Scare'', at least 1,000 \n        people were wrongfully dismissed from the Department of State \n        for alleged homosexuality during the 1950s and well into the \n        1960s.\n            (2) According to the Department of State's Bureau of \n        Diplomatic Security, Department of State employees were forced \n        out of the Department on the grounds that their sexual \n        orientation ostensibly rendered them vulnerable to blackmail \n        and made them security risks.\n            (3) In addition to those wrongfully dismissed, many other \n        patriotic Americans were prevented from joining the Department \n        due to a screening process that was put in place to prevent the \n        hiring of those who, according to the findings of the Bureau of \n        Diplomatic Security, ``seemed like they might be gay or \n        lesbian''.\n            (4) Congress bears a special measure of responsibility as \n        the Department's actions were in part in response to \n        congressional investigations into ``sex perversion of Federal \n        employees'', reports on the employment of ``moral perverts by \n        Government Agencies'', hearings and pressure placed on the \n        Department through the appropriations process and congressional \n        complaints that Foggy Bottom was ``rampant with homosexuals who \n        were sympathetic to Communism and vulnerable to blackmail''.\n            (5) Between 1950 and 1969, the Department of State was \n        required to report on the number of homosexuals fired each year \n        as part of their annual appeals before Committees on \n        Appropriations.\n            (6) Although the worst effects of the ``Lavender Scare'' \n        are behind us, as recently as the early 1990s, the Department \n        of State's security office was investigating State personnel \n        thought to be gay and driving them out of government service as \n        ``security risks''.\n            (7) In 1994, Secretary of State Warren Christopher issued a \n        prohibition against discrimination in the Department of State, \n        including that based on sexual orientation.\n            (8) In 1998, President William Jefferson Clinton signed \n        Executive Order 13087 barring discrimination on the basis of \n        sexual orientation.\n            (9) On January 9, 2017, Secretary of State John Kerry \n        issued a statement regarding the ``Lavender Scare'', saying, \n        ``On behalf of the Department, I apologize to those who were \n        impacted by the practices of the past and reaffirm the \n        Department's steadfast commitment to diversity and inclusion \n        for all our employees, including members of the LGBTI \n        community.''.\n\nSEC. 3.

The report shall include \nhistorical statements made by officials of the Department of State and \nCongress encouraging and implementing policies and tactics that led to \nthe termination of employees due to their sexual orientation.\n\nSEC. 4.

Each report shall include any comments or \nrecommendations for continued actions.\n\nSEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF RECONCILIATION BOARD.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of State shall establish, within \nthe Office of Civil Rights of the Department of State, an independent \nReconciliation Board to review the reports released by the Director \nGeneral of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Services under \nsection 3(b).\n    (b) Duties.--The Reconciliation Board shall--\n            (1) consistent with applicable privacy regulations, contact \n        all employees found to be fired due to the ``Lavender Scare'' \n        or, in the case of deceased former employees, the family \n        members of the employees, to inform them that their termination \n        from the Department of State has been deemed inappropriate and \n        that, if they wish, their employment record can be changed to \n        reflect these findings;\n            (2) designate a point of contact at a senior level position \n        within the Office of the Director General of the Foreign \n        Service and Director of Human Resources to receive oral \n        testimony of any employees or family members of deceased \n        employees mentioned in the report who personally experienced \n        discrimination and termination because of the actual or \n        perceived sexual orientation in order that such testimony may \n        serve as an official record of these discriminatory policies \n        and their impact on United States lives; and\n            (3) provide an opportunity for any former employee not \n        mentioned in the report to bring forth a grievance to the Board \n        if they believe they were terminated due to their sexual \n        orientation.\n    (c) Review of Claims.--\n            (1) In general.--The Board shall review each claim \n        described in subsection (b) within 150 days of receiving the \n        claim.

ISSUANCE OF APOLOGY.\n\n    (a) Finding.--Secretary of State Kerry delivered the following \napology on January 9, 2017:\n    ``Throughout my career, including as Secretary of State, I have \nstood strongly in support of the LGBTI community, recognizing that \nrespect for human rights must include respect for all individuals. \nLGBTI employees serve as proud members of the State Department and \nvalued colleagues dedicated to the service of our country. For the last \nseveral years, the Department has pressed for the families of LGBTI \nofficers to have the same protections overseas as families of other \nofficers. In 2015, to further promote LGBTI rights throughout the \nworld, I appointed the first ever Special Envoy for the Human Rights of \nLGBTI Persons.\n    ``In the past--as far back as the 1940s, but continuing for \ndecades--the Department of State was among many public and private \nemployers that discriminated against employees and job applicants on \nthe basis of perceived sexual orientation, forcing some employees to \nresign or refusing to hire certain applicants in the first place. These \nactions were wrong then, just as they would be wrong today.\n    ``On behalf of the Department, I apologize to those who were \nimpacted by the practices of the past and reaffirm the Department's \nsteadfast commitment to diversity and inclusion for all our employees, \nincluding members of the LGBTI community.''\n    (b) Congressional Apology.--Congress hereby offers a formal apology \nfor its responsibility in encouraging the ``Lavender Scare'' and \nsimilar policies at the Department of State, as these policies were in \npart a response to congressional investigations into ``sex perversion \nof Federal employees'', reports on the employment of ``moral perverts \nby Government Agencies'', and hearings or pressure otherwise placed on \nthe Department of State through the appropriations process.\n\nSEC. 7. ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT EXHIBIT ON THE LAVENDER SCARE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of State shall work with the current \npublic-private partnership associated with the Department of State's \nnew United States Diplomacy Center to establish a permanent exhibit on \nthe ``Lavender Scare'' in the museum to assure that the history of this \nunfortunate episode is not brushed aside.\n    (b) Specifications.--The exhibit--\n            (1) shall be installed at the museum not later than one \n        year after the date of enactment of this Act;\n            (2) should provide access to the reports compiled by the \n        Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human \n        Resources under section 3(b); and\n            (3) shall readily display material gathered from oral \n        testimony received pursuant to section 5(b)(2) from employees \n        or family members of deceased employees who were subject to \n        these discriminatory policies during the ``Lavender Scare''.\n\nSEC. 8. GUIDANCE ON ISSUING VISAS.\n\n    To demonstrate the Department of State's commitment to ensuring \nfairness for current employees, not later than 100 days after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \nCongress a report on countries not issuing visas to the spouses of all \nForeign Service personnel posted overseas due to their sexual \norientation. This report shall include any comments or recommendations \nfor actions, including eliminating visa reciprocity with countries \nfound to be instituting these practices against the spouses of Foreign \nService personnel, that will lead to ensuring that all spouses of \nForeign Service personnel receive visas for the country their spouse is \nassigned, regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nSEC. 9. ESTABLISHMENT OF ADVANCEMENT BOARD.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of State shall establish, within \nthe Office of the Director General of the Department of State, a board \ncomprised of senior-level officials to address the issues faced by \nLGBTQI Foreign Service employees and their families.\n    (b) Hearing of Testimony.--The Advancement Board shall hear \ntestimony from any willing LGBTQI Foreign Service employees and their \nfamilies regarding any discrimination they have faced due to their \nsexual orientation.\n    (c) Report.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 100 days after completing \n        collection of testimony described under subsection (b), and \n        annually thereafter for 5 years, the Advancement Board shall \n        submit to Congress a report based on the testimony.\n            (2) Content.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall \n        include any comments or recommendations for continued actions \n        to improve the Department of State to ensure that no employee \n        or their family members experience discrimination due to their \n        sexual orientation.\n            (3) Privacy.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall \n        remain private and will only be accessible to Members of \n        Congress, their appropriate staff, and members of the \n        Advancement Board."
