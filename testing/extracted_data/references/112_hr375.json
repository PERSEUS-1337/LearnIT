    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fix United States Government \nContracting Deficit with China Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The purchase of government goods and services is an \n        important means through which the government fulfills its \n        constitutional duties to provide for the common defense and \n        promote the general welfare of the United States.\n            (2) American taxpayers expect that government procurement \n        serves the interests of all Americans.\n            (3) The United States and several of its trading partners \n        are signatories to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement, \n        which holds that signatories agree to certain restraints with \n        regard to government procurement.\n            (4) However, the People's Republic of China is not a \n        signatory to the Agreement on Government Procurement, and that, \n        accordingly, it is not a violation of that agreement for the \n        Congress to establish procurement policies as best suit the \n        American public interest with regard to Chinese goods.\n            (5) China has structured its government procurement law to \n        favor its domestic goods, as noted in article 10 of such law.\n            (6) China has also recently announced a plan to favor so-\n        called ``indigenous innovation'' under which the Chinese \n        Government would expressly favor locally developed products and \n        technologies.\n            (7) American companies have had little or no success in \n        accessing Chinese Government procurement contracts, while \n        Chinese companies have had great success in selling goods for \n        United States Government projects.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--Accordingly, it shall be the policy of \nthe United States to limit the total value of Chinese goods that may be \nprocured by the United States Government during a calendar year to not \nmore than the total value of United States goods procured by the \nChinese Government if any during the preceding calendar year.\n\nSEC. 3.
