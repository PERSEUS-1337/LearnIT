FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The discovery in the 1940s of antimicrobial drugs, such \n        as penicillin and streptomycin, led to ground breaking \n        treatment of day-to-day illnesses and fatal diseases.\n            (2) Drug-resistant pathogens have developed because many \n        physicians and other health professionals have historically \n        overprescribed antimicrobial drugs.\n            (3) Antimicrobial resistance can be spurred by patients \n        seeking antibiotics for viruses rather than bacterial \n        infections. Antibiotics are effective only for bacterial \n        infections, not viral infections.\n            (4) Patients who fail to finish their prescribed doses of \n        antibiotics leave themselves vulnerable to certain bacteria, \n        strengthening antibiotic resistance.\n            (5) Microbes that have increasingly built up resistance to \n        antibiotics include the microbes involved in pneumonia; ear \n        infections and meningitis; skin, bone, lung, and bloodstream \n        infections; urinary tract infections; food borne infections; \n        and infections transmitted in health care settings.\n            (6) Many other pathogens are also becoming resistant to \n        conventional treatments, including the bacteria that cause \n        tuberculosis and gonorrhea; the fungi that cause yeast \n        infections; and the parasites that cause malaria.\n            (7) A substantial but as yet undetermined percentage of all \n        antibiotics produced in the United States are used in animals, \n        with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 percent. A substantial \n        percentage of these antibiotics are used nontherapeutically in \n        feed or in the water of farm animals to make them grow faster, \n        while only about 20 percent of antibiotic feed additives are \n        used to treat established infections.\n            (8) This usage of antibiotics in farm animals, at levels \n        too low to cure bacterial diseases but high enough to control \n        them, is creating selective pressure on bacteria, causing them \n        to develop resistance to the antibiotics.\n            (9) Antibiotic resistant bacteria selected in animals can \n        reach humans and pass their resistance to bacteria pathogenic \n        to humans or, if pathogenic themselves, can cause disease that \n        is not easily treatable, prolonging recovery.\n            (10) Statistics have shown that antibiotic resistance can \n        cause the total costs of inpatient care to be more than double \n        the direct costs of such care.\n            (11) Expenses incurred by hospitals around the Nation have \n        risen to nearly $1.3 billion per year as a result of six \n        ordinary types of resistant bacteria.\n            (12) The Institute of Medicine, the American Society for \n        Microbiology, the World Health Organization, the Congressional \n        Office of Technology Assessment, and the General Accounting \n        Office each have found that the Nation should improve \n        surveillance for mounting antimicrobial resistance problems; \n        prolong the useful life of antimicrobial drugs; develop new \n        drugs; and utilize other measures, such as improved vaccines, \n        diagnostics, and infection control measures, to prevent and \n        control antimicrobial resistance.\n\nSEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; FUNDING FOR TOP \n              PRIORITY ACTION ITEMS UNDER PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION PLAN TO \n              COMBAT ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE.\n\n    (a) In General.--For the purpose of carrying out the top priority \naction items designated in the Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan, \nbut only to the extent that the activities involved are within the \njurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services (as \ndetermined under Federal laws other than this Act), there are \nauthorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for each of \nthe fiscal years 2002 through 2006.
