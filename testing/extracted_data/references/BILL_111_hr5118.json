FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Flint Hills Region of Kansas and Oklahoma contains \n        the world's largest share of the remaining tallgrass prairie, \n        and is the only place where that habitat is in landscape \n        proportions. Only 4 percent of North America's presettlement \n        tallgrass prairie survives to this day, and 80 percent is \n        located in Kansas.\n            (2) The Flint Hills Region is also home to certain \n        declining avian species such as the greater prairie chicken and \n        Henslow's sparrow that cannot continue to exist without large \n        expanses of native tallgrass prairie in an original state. \n        Further, it is a significant corridor for migrating shorebirds \n        such as the American golden plover, the buff-breasted sand-\n        piper, and the upland sandpiper.\n            (3) Beginning in the mid-19th century, cattlemen understood \n        that the richness of the Flint Hills grasses depended on a good \n        spring burn--something they learned from the Native Americans. \n        Fire still thrives in the Flint Hills because the ranchers, and \n        others using the land, know that the natural ecosystem depends \n        on fire.\n            (4) Ranchers, landowners, and conservation groups use \n        prescribed burns to mimic the seasonal fires that have shaped \n        the tallgrass prairie for thousands of years. Areas not burned \n        for several years develop mature grasses and thicker, thatch-\n        like vegetation, which habitat is preferred by invasive \n        species.\n            (5) The Flint Hills Region is one of the few places in the \n        United States where the prevailing agricultural system works \n        essentially in tandem with an ancestral native ecosystem, \n        preserving most of its complexity and the dynamic processes \n        that helped shape it.\n            (6) Due to the uniqueness of the Flint Hills tallgrass \n        prairie and the historic manner in which the tallgrass prairie \n        has been managed by fire, existing prescribed burn practices \n        should be allowed to continue and ambient air data resulting \n        from fires used to manage the Flint Hills tallgrass prairie \n        should be not be included in determinations of compliance with \n        the Clean Air Act.\n\nSEC. 3. PRESCRIBED FIRES.\n\n    The Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) is amended by inserting \nafter section 329 the following:\n\n``SEC. 330. PRESCRIBED FIRES IN THE FLINT HILLS REGION.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--In determining whether, with respect to a \nspecific air pollutant, an exceedance or violation of a national \nambient air quality standard has occurred for purposes of this Act, a \nState and the Administrator shall exclude data from a particular air \nquality monitoring location if emissions from one or more prescribed \nfires in the Flint Hills Region cause a concentration of the air \npollutant at the location to be in excess of the standard.\n    ``(b) Specific Limitations.--If emissions data is excluded under \nsubsection (a) from a particular air quality monitoring station because \nof emissions from one or more prescribed fires in the Flint Hills \nRegion--\n            ``(1) the Administrator shall not, as a result of such \n        emissions, find under section 113 that a State has failed to \n        enforce, or that a person has violated, a State implementation \n        plan (for national primary or secondary ambient air quality \n        standards) under section 110; and\n            ``(2) a State shall not, as a result of such emissions, \n        find that a person has violated, or bring an enforcement action \n        for violation of, a State implementation plan (for national \n        primary or secondary ambient air quality standards) under \n        section 110.\n    ``(c) Prohibition Against Smoke Management Plans.--The \nAdministrator shall not require, and a State shall not adopt, a smoke \nmanagement plan under this Act in connection with any prescribed fire \nin the Flint Hills Region.\n    ``(d) Not a Stationary Source.--No building, structure, facility, \nor installation may be treated as a stationary source under section 111 \nas a result of one or more prescribed fires in the Flint Hills Region.\n    ``(e) No Title V Permit Required.--No person shall be required to \nobtain or modify a permit under title V in connection with a prescribed \nfire in the Flint Hills Region.\n    ``(f) Definition.--In this section:\n            ``(1) The term `Flint Hills Region'--\n                    ``(A) means the band of hills in eastern Kansas \n                that stretch into north-central Oklahoma; and\n                    ``(B) includes--\n                            ``(i) Butler, Chase, Chautauqua, Clay, \n                        Cowley, Dickinson, Elk, Geary, Greenwood, \n                        Harvey, Jackson, Lyon, Marion, Marshall, \n                        Morris, Ottawa, Pottawatomie, Riley, Saline, \n                        Shawnee, Wabaunsee, Washington, and Woodson \n                        Counties in Kansas; and\n                            ``(ii) Osage, Tulsa, and Washington \n                        counties in Oklahoma.\n            ``(2) The term `prescribed fire' means a fire that is set \n        or managed by a person with the goal of enhancing a fire-\n        dependent ecosystem or enhancing the productivity of \n        agricultural grazing land, irrespective of the frequency with \n        which the burn occurs.''."
