FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Marine Fisheries Service was created in \n        the Department of Commerce under Reorganization Plan Number 4 \n        of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 1511 note). Before creation of the Service, \n        the programs that are administered by the Service were \n        administered by the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries within the \n        United States Fish and Wildlife Service in the Department of \n        Interior.\n            (2) The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et. \n        seq.) currently delegates authority to both the Secretary of \n        the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to conduct \n        activities related to the listing and recovery of threatened \n        species and endangered species.\n            (3) The National Marine Fisheries Service is responsible \n        for the recovery of 33 species of marine mammals and fish, \n        while the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has \n        jurisdiction over 1,800 species of plants, mammals, birds, and \n        fish, including several species that have been co-listed and \n        managed by both the National Marine Fisheries Service and the \n        United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n            (4) In order to better coordinate Federal agency functions \n        relating to the listing and recovery of threatened species and \n        endangered species, eliminate duplication of efforts in the \n        performance of those functions, and ensure that the maximum \n        amount of resources are focused on the objectives of the \n        Endangered Species Act 1973, one Federal agency should be given \n        exclusive responsibility for those functions with respect to \n        anadromous species and catadromous species.\n\nSEC. 3.
