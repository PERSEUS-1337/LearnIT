FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares the following:\n        (1) The public lands within the Otay Mountain region of \n    California are one of the last remaining pristine locations in \n    western San Diego County, California.\n        (2) This rugged mountain adjacent to the United States-Mexico \n    border is internationally known for its diversity of unique and \n    sensitive plants.\n        (3) This area plays a critical role in San Diego's multi-\n    species conservation plan, a national model made for maintaining \n    biodiversity.\n        (4) Due to its proximity to the international border, this area \n    is the focus of important law enforcement and border interdiction \n    efforts necessary to curtail illegal immigration and protect the \n    area's wilderness values.\n        (5) The illegal immigration traffic, combined with the rugged \n    topography, also presents unique fire management challenges for \n    protecting lives and resources.\n\nSEC. 3. DESIGNATION.\n\n    In furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. \n1131 et seq.), certain public lands in the California Desert District \nof the Bureau of Land Management, California, comprising approximately \n18,500 acres as generally depicted on a map entitled ``Otay Mountain \nWilderness'' and dated May 7, 1998, are hereby designated as wilderness \nand therefore as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation \nSystem, which shall be known as the Otay Mountain Wilderness.\n\nSEC. 4. MAP AND LEGAL DESCRIPTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--As soon as practicable after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, a map and a legal description for the Wilderness \nArea shall be filed by the Secretary with the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Resources of the \nHouse of Representatives. Such map and legal description shall have the \nsame force and effect as if included in this Act, except that the \nSecretary, as appropriate, may correct clerical and typographical \nerrors in such legal description and map. Such map and legal \ndescription for the Wilderness Area shall be on file and available for \npublic inspection in the offices of the Director and California State \nDirector, Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior.\n    (b) United States-Mexico Border.--In carrying out this section, the \nSecretary shall ensure that the southern boundary of the Wilderness \nArea is 100 feet north of the trail depicted on the map referred to in \nsubsection (a) and is at least 100 feet from the United States-Mexico \ninternational border.\n\nSEC. 5. WILDERNESS REVIEW.\n\n    The Congress hereby finds and directs that all the public lands not \ndesignated wilderness within the boundaries of the Southern Otay \nMountain Wilderness Study Area (CA-060-029) and the Western Otay \nMountain Wilderness Study Area (CA-060-028) managed by the Bureau of \nLand Management and reported to the Congress in 1991, have been \nadequately studied for wilderness designation pursuant to section 603 \nof the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1782), \nand are no longer subject to the requirements contained in section \n603(c) of that Act pertaining to the management of wilderness study \nareas in a manner that does not impair the suitability of such areas \nfor preservation as wilderness.\n\nSEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION OF WILDERNESS AREA.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subject to valid existing rights and to subsection \n(b), the Wilderness Area shall be administered by the Secretary in \naccordance with the provisions of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et \nseq.), except that--\n        (1) any reference in such provisions to the effective date of \n    the Wilderness Act is deemed to be a reference to the effective \n    date of this Act; and\n        (2) any reference in such provisions to the Secretary of \n    Agriculture is deemed to be a reference to the Secretary of the \n    Interior.\n    (b) Border Enforcement, Drug Interdiction, and Wildland Fire \nProtection.--Because of the proximity of the Wilderness Area to the \nUnited States-Mexico international border, drug interdiction, border \noperations, and wildland fire management operations are common \nmanagement actions throughout the area encompassing the Wilderness \nArea. This Act recognizes the need to continue such management actions \nso long as such management actions are conducted in accordance with the \nWilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.) and are subject to such \nconditions as the Secretary considers appropriate.\n\nSEC. 7. FURTHER ACQUISITIONS.\n\n    Any lands within the boundaries of the Wilderness Area that are \nacquired by the United States after the date of the enactment of this \nAct shall become part of the Wilderness Area and shall be managed in \naccordance with all the provisions of this Act and other laws \napplicable to such a wilderness.\n\nSEC. 8. NO BUFFER ZONES.\n\n    The Congress does not intend for the designation of the Wilderness \nArea by this Act to lead to the creation of protective perimeters or \nbuffer zones around the Wilderness Area. The fact that nonwilderness \nactivities or uses can be seen or heard from areas within the \nWilderness Area shall not, of itself, preclude such activities or uses \nup to the boundary of the Wilderness Area.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n        (1) Public lands.--The term ``public lands'' has the same \n    meaning as that term has in section 103(e) of the Federal Land \n    Policy and Management Act of 1976.\n        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n    the Interior.\n        (3) Wilderness area.--The term ``Wilderness Area'' means the \n    Otay Mountain Wilderness designated by section 3.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
