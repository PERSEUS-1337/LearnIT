FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) From the $2,400,000,000 in total United States \n        multilateral funding for the Syrian humanitarian crisis, the \n        United States Government has provided $268,000,000 to the \n        Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\n            (2) As of August 2014, the United Nations High Commissioner \n        for Refugees estimates there are more than 600,000 registered \n        Syrian refugees in Jordan.\n            (3) Jordan estimates that more than 800,000 unregistered \n        refugees are in Jordan living outside of refugee camps, \n        assimilated into local communities, which would bring the total \n        to approximately 1,400,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan.\n            (4) In February 2014, President Obama announced that the \n        United States and Jordan will renew the non-binding memorandum \n        of understanding that was signed in 2008 to provide assistance \n        to Jordan over a 5-year period that reinforces the commitment \n        to broaden cooperation and dialogue between the two countries \n        in a variety of areas.\n            (5) In 2000, the United States and Jordan signed a free-\n        trade agreement that went into force in 2001.\n            (6) In 1996, the United States granted Jordan major non-\n        NATO ally status.\n            (7) Jordan is suffering from the Syrian refugee crisis and \n        the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\n            (8) The Government of Jordan was elected as a non-permanent \n        member of the United Nations Security Council beginning in \n        January 2014 and terminating in December 2015.\n            (9) Enhanced support for defense cooperation with Jordan is \n        important to the national security of the United States, \n        including through creation of a status in law for Jordan \n        similar to the countries in the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization, Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, Israel, \n        and New Zealand, with respect to consideration by Congress of \n        foreign military sales to Jordan.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It should be the policy of the United States to support the \nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan in its response to the Syrian refugee \ncrisis, provide necessary assistance to alleviate the domestic burden \nto provide basic needs for the assimilated Syrian refugees, cooperate \nwith Jordan to combat the terrorist threat from the Islamic State of \nIraq and the Levant (ISIL) or other terrorist organizations, and help \nsecure the border between Jordan and its neighbors Syria and Iraq.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that expeditious consideration of \ncertifications of letters of offer to sell defense articles, defense \nservices, design and construction services, and major defense equipment \nto the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan under section 36(b) of the Arms \nExport Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2776(b)) is fully consistent with United \nStates security and foreign policy interests and the objectives of \nworld peace and security.\n\nSEC. 5.
