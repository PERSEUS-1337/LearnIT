FINDING.\n\n    The Congress finds that it is appropriate to exercise congressional \nenforcement authority under section 5 of the 14th amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States and Congress' plenary power under \narticle I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States \n(commonly known as the ``commerce clause'') in order to ensure that \nStates and political subdivisions thereof do not discriminate against \nproviders and consumers of digital goods and digital services by \nimposing multiple, excessive and discriminatory taxes and other burdens \non such providers and consumers.\n\nSEC. 3. MULTIPLE AND DISCRIMINATORY TAXES PROHIBITED.\n\n    No State or local jurisdiction shall impose multiple or \ndiscriminatory taxes on or with respect to the sale or use of digital \ngoods or digital services.\n\nSEC. 4. RETAIL, SOURCING, AND OTHER LIMITATIONS AND RULES.\n\n    (a) Retail Limitation.--Taxes on or with respect to the sale of \ndigital goods or digital services may only be imposed on or with \nrespect to a sale to a customer.\n    (b) Taxpayer Limitation.--Taxes on or with respect to the sale of \ndigital goods or digital services may only be imposed on and collected \nonly from a customer or a seller.\n    (c) Sourcing Limitation.--\n            (1) In general.--Taxes on or with respect to the sale of \n        digital goods or digital services may be imposed only by the \n        State and local jurisdictions whose territorial limits \n        encompass the customer's tax address.\n            (2) Multiple locations.--If the sale of digital goods or \n        digital services is made to multiple locations of a customer, \n        whether simultaneously or over a period of time, the seller may \n        determine the customer's tax address or addresses using the \n        address or addresses of use as provided by the customer.\n            (3) Seller held harmless.--A seller that relies in good \n        faith on information provided by a customer to determine the \n        customer's tax address or addresses shall not be held liable \n        for any additional tax based on a different determination of \n        the customer's tax address or addresses.\n    (d) Limitation on Expansive Interpretation.--No tax on or with \nrespect to the sale or use of tangible personal property, \ntelecommunications service, Internet access service, or audio or video \nprogramming service may be construed by any regulation, administrative \nruling, or otherwise, to be imposed on or with respect to the sale or \nuse of a digital good or a digital service. For purposes of this Act, a \ntransaction involving a digital good shall be characterized solely as a \ntransaction involving the provision of a digital service unless the \ntransaction results in the transfer or delivery of a complete copy, \nwith the right to use permanently or for a specified period, of the \ndigital good that is the subject of the transaction. No tax on or with \nrespect to the sale or use of a digital good may be construed by any \nregulation, administrative ruling, or otherwise, to be imposed on or \nwith respect to the sale or use of a digital service. The limitations \nprovided by this subsection shall not apply to any construction of a \nstatute that was approved by a judicial interpretation of that statute \non or before the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (e) Treatment of Bundled Goods and Services.--\n            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), if charges for \n        digital goods or digital services are aggregated with, and not \n        separately stated from, charges for other goods or services, \n        then the charges for digital goods or digital services may be \n        taxed for purposes of this Act at the same rate and on the same \n        basis as charges for the other goods or services unless the \n        seller can reasonably identify the charges for the digital \n        goods or digital services from its books and records kept in \n        the regular course of business.\n            (2) Charges for delivery and transport.--If the charge for \n        a digital good or digital service is aggregated with, and not \n        separately stated from, a charge for electronically delivering \n        or transporting the digital good, or providing the digital \n        service, to the customer, then the seller may either apply \n        paragraph (1) or treat the service of electronic delivery or \n        transport as a non-severable and incidental component of the \n        digital good or digital service.\n    (f) Treatment of Digital Code.--The tax treatment of the sale of a \ndigital code shall be the same as the tax treatment of the sale of the \ndigital good or digital service to which the digital code relates. The \nsale of the digital code shall be considered the sale transaction for \npurposes of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.
