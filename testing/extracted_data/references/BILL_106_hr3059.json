FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More than \\2/3\\ of Earth's surface is covered by \n        oceans.\n            (2) The oceans and marine waters contain a greater variety \n        of forms of life than exists on land, and scientists are \n        continually discovering new forms of life in previously \n        unexplored, unique habitats.\n            (3) The earth's human population is dependent upon the \n        products of the oceans for income, nutrition, medicines, raw \n        materials, and valuable natural services such as climate \n        regulation, flood control, and storm surge protection.\n            (4) The practice and technology of bottom trawling and use \n        of other mobile fishing gear on the seabed has increased to the \n        point that an area of seabed twice the size of the contiguous \n        United States is affected by these practices each year.\n            (5) These practices result in a loss of biological \n        diversity, which is detrimental not only to the ocean \n        environment itself but also to the industries and people that \n        depend on that environment.\n            (6) Little is known about the recoverability of the seabed \n        from the effects of bottom trawling and use of other mobile \n        fishing gear on the seabed. However, due to the slow rates of \n        growth and reproduction of some marine species, it is believed \n        that full recovery in some areas may take decades or centuries.\n\nSEC. 3. MORATORIUM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any provision of the Magnuson-\nStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et \nseq.), no person may engage in bottom trawling or use of other mobile \nfishing gear on the seabed in any marine area described in subsection \n(b), until--\n            (1) the National Marine Fisheries Service has completed a \n        study and determined the effects of those practices in those \n        areas;\n            (2) the Secretary of Commerce has determined, based on \n        findings of such a study and other pertinent scientific \n        information, that the impacts of bottom trawling and such other \n        mobile fishing gear on biodiversity, marine habitat, and \n        productivity of fish stocks is negligible; and\n            (3) the Secretary of Commerce has approved and implemented \n        fishery management plans for those areas, that--\n                    (A) are developed by the appropriate regional \n                fishery management councils in accordance with that \n                Act;\n                    (B) encourage the use of fishing gears that are \n                less destructive of habitat than bottom trawling and \n                other mobile fishing gear on the seabed; and\n                    (C) prohibit use of bottom trawling and other \n                mobile fishing gear practices that threaten the \n                continued sustainability of ecosystems in those areas.\n    (b) Marine Areas Described.--\n            (1) In general.--The marine areas referred to in subsection \n        (a) are the following:\n                    (A) The Heceta Banks, located off the coast of \n                Oregon, 125 00' w-124 45' w / 43 55' n-44 15' n.\n                    (B) Cordell Bank, located off the coast of central \n                California, 123 20' w-123 38' w/ 37 55' n-30 05' n.\n                    (C) The Gulf of the Farallones outside of the line \n                that is three miles from the coastline, located off the \n                coast of California, 122 35' w-123 15''w/ 37 30' n-38 \n                05' n.\n                    (D) Tanner and Cortez Banks, located off the coast \n                of southern California, 119 00' w-119 25' w/ 32 50 n-32 \n                20' n.\n                    (E) Punta Gorda, located off the coast of northern \n                California, 124 23' w-124 50' w/ 4-20' n-40 10' n.\n                    (F) Cape Blanco, located off the coast of Oregon, \n                124 42' w-124 55' w/ 42 40' n-43 00n.\n                    (G) Florida Middle Grounds located in the Gulf of \n                Mexico off the coast of Florida, 84 40'w-85 15' w/ 28 \n                10'n-28 55n.\n                    (H) Dry Tortugas, located in the Gulf of Mexico off \n                the coast of Florida, 82 40'2w-83 10'w/ 24 30'n 24 \n                50'n.\n                    (I) Nantucket Shoals, located off the coast of Cape \n                Cod, Massachusetts, 69 00'w-70 20'w/ 40 30'n-41 00'n.\n                    (J) Jeffrey's Ledge, Tillies Bank, and Stellwagon \n                Bank, located in the Gulf of Maine, 69 50'w-70 30'w/42 \n                08'n-43 15'n.\n                    (K) Cashes Ledge, located in the Gulf of Maine, 68 \n                40'w-69 15'w/42 30'n-43 15'n.\n                    (L) Stonewall Bank of the central Oregon coast, 124 \n                20'w-124 28'w/44 27'n-44 39'n.\n                    (M) Rogue River Reef off the southern Oregon coast, \n                124 35'w-124 50'w/42 25'n-42 35'n.\n            (2) Further description by secretary.--For purposes of this \n        Act, the Secretary of Commerce may more particularly describe \n        the areas listed in paragraph (1).\n    (c) Report.--The Secretary of Commerce shall report annually to the \nCommittee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the \nCommittee on Commerce of the Senate regarding the recovery of areas \ndescribed in subsection (b) from the effects of bottom trawling and use \nof other mobile fishing gear on the seabed.\n    (d) Limitation on Application.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to \nan area after the date the Secretary publishes a finding that there are \nin effect, under State law or a fishery management plan under the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. \n1801 et seq.), measures that are at least as effective as subsection \n(a) in maintaining the sustainability of ecosystems in that area.\n    (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Negligible.--The term ``negligible'' means--\n                    (A) insufficient to diminish the productivity of \n                fish stocks;
