FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2000, there were 70,400,000 children under age 18 in \n        the United States, and children made up 26 percent of the \n        United States population. The percentage of the population that \n        consists of children is expected to be stable. Children are \n        expected to comprise 24 percent of the population by 2020.\n            (2) There are 11,400,000 infants and toddlers and \n        12,000,000 preschool-age children in the United States.\n            (3) Nationwide, at least 200,000 infants and toddlers, \n        600,000 preschool-age children, 2,700,000 children age 6 \n        through 11, and 2,300,000 children age 12 through 17 are served \n        under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n            (4)(A) Child health often varies by family income. Children \n        in families with incomes below the poverty line (referred to in \n        this Act as ``low-income families'') are less likely than \n        children in other families (referred to in this Act as \n        ``higher-income families'') to be in very good or excellent \n        health.\n            (B) Children from low-income families are more likely to \n        have disabilities or other special needs. They are twice as \n        likely to have a significant disability, nearly twice as likely \n        have serious mental or physical disabilities, and 1.3 times as \n        likely to have learning disabilities, as children from higher-\n        income families.\n            (5)(A) Children (including youth) in low-income families \n        have significantly higher rates of activity limitation than \n        children in higher-income families.\n            (B) In 1998, 11 percent of children age 5 through 17 in \n        low-income families had activity limitations due to chronic \n        conditions. By comparison, 7 percent of such children in \n        higher-income families had such limitations. Children under age \n        5 in low-income families had a higher rate of activity \n        limitation than such children in higher-income families.\n            (6) Child care can easily cost more than $4,000 a year per \n        child, and high quality child care typically costs much more. \n        The cost of child care is a significant part of a working \n        family's budget, and can force a family to compromise on the \n        quality of care. The expense of child care, relative to income, \n        often keeps family members from being able to afford to work.\n            (7) Forty-five percent of mothers with an infant who is a \n        child with a disability or other special needs do not work \n        outside the home because they cannot find child care. Those \n        mothers are less likely to reenter the labor force by the time \n        their children reach age 1, and those mothers work fewer hours, \n        than mothers with typically developing children.\n            (8) The vast majority of working families who are \n        struggling to afford the high cost of child care are not \n        getting any help in covering that cost. Only 1 out of 10 \n        children who are eligible for child care assistance through the \n        program carried out under the Child Care and Development Block \n        Grant Act of 1990 are receiving any help through that program.\n            (9) A survey found that parents who were using paid child \n        care and whose children had emotional or behavioral \n        disabilities had great difficulty making child care \n        arrangements. Those parents were 20 times more likely than \n        other parents to report that their caregivers had quit or \n        otherwise stopped serving their children, because of those \n        disabilities.\n            (10) The General Accounting Office, the Institute of \n        Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, and the National \n        Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences have all \n        documented the national shortage of child care options for \n        children with disabilities or other special needs.\n            (11)(A) In a national survey of families who have children \n        with disabilities, \\1/5\\ of the respondents indicated that a \n        family member had to quit working or work fewer hours because \n        of a child's health.\n            (B) In a Florida survey of a similar group of families, 40 \n        percent of the respondents reported that a family member does \n        not work, 33 percent reported that a family member turned down \n        a job, and 20 percent reported that a family member works fewer \n        hours, because of the need to care for a child's special needs.\n            (C) The shortage of specialized child care is 1 major \n        factor that makes it difficult for parents of children with \n        disabilities to work.\n            (12) In a survey by the General Accounting Office, 6 out of \n        7 States surveyed indicated a shortage of child care suitable \n        for children with disabilities or other special needs.\n            (13) Research shows that providing support to children with \n        disabilities or other special needs in their early years \n        reduces their need for special education and support later in \n        life.\n\nSEC. 3.
