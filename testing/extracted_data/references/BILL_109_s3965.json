FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As of 2006, there are 18,000,000 Latinas residing in \n        the United States. The number of Latinas is expected to grow \n        considerably. It is estimated that by the year 2050, 1 out of \n        every 4 women in the United States will be a Latina.\n            (2) Latinas are particularly at risk for being uninsured. \n        37 percent of Latinas are uninsured, almost double the national \n        average.\n            (3) With respect to sexually transmitted diseases--\n                    (A) the HIV infection rate is 7 times more for \n                Latinas than their white counterparts, and Latinas \n                represent 18 percent of new HIV infections among women;\n                    (B) the AIDS case rate for Latinas is more than 5 \n                times more than the rate for white women;\n                    (C) the rate of chlamydia for Latinas is 4 times \n                more than the rate for white women; and\n                    (D) among Latinas, the gonorrhea incidence is \n                nearly double that of white women.\n            (4) With respect to cancer--\n                    (A) The national incidence rate for cervical cancer \n                in Latinas over the age of 30 is nearly double that of \n                non-Latinas;\n                    (B) 1 in 12 Latinas nationwide will develop breast \n                cancer; and\n                    (C) while white women have the highest rates of \n                breast cancer, Latinas have among the lowest rates of \n                breast cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment and, \n                as a result, are more likely to die from breast cancer \n                compared to white women.\n            (5) The prevalence of diabetes is at least 2 to 4 times \n        more among Latinas than among white women. More than 25 percent \n        of Latinas aged 65 to 74 have Type II diabetes.\n            (6) Heart disease is the main cause of death for all women, \n        and heart disease risk and death rates are higher among Latinas \n        partly because of higher rates of obesity and diabetes.\n            (7) Therefore, despite their growing numbers, Latinas \n        continue to face serious health concerns (including sexually \n        transmitted diseases, diabetes, and cancer) that are otherwise \n        preventable, or treatable, with adequate health access.\n\nSEC. 3.
