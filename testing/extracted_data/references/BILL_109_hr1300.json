FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n        citizenship and regaining the right to vote reintegrates \n        offenders into free society. The right to vote may not be \n        abridged or denied by the United States or by any State on \n        account of race, color, gender or previous condition of \n        servitude. Basic constitutional principles of fairness and \n        equal protection require an equal opportunity for Americans to \n        vote in Federal elections. Congress has ultimate supervisory \n        power over Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly \n        been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n            (2) Congress finds three areas where discrepancies in State \n        laws regarding felony convictions lead to unfairness in Federal \n        elections: (A) there is no uniform standard for voting in \n        Federal elections which leads to an unfair disparity and \n        unequal participation in Federal elections based solely on \n        where a person lives; (B) laws governing the restoration of \n        voting rights after a felony conviction are unequal throughout \n        the country and persons in some States can easily regain their \n        voting rights while in other States persons effectively lose \n        their right to vote permanently; and (C) State \n        disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact ethnic \n        minorities.\n            (3) Although State law determines the qualifications for \n        voting, Congress must ensure that those laws are in accordance \n        with the Constitution. Current laws vary throughout the country \n        resulting in discrepancies regarding which citizens may vote in \n        Federal elections.\n            (4) An estimated 4,700,000 Americans, or one in 44 adults, \n        currently cannot vote as a result of a felony conviction. Women \n        represent 676,730 of this total. Disenfranchisement results \n        from varying State laws that restrict voting while under some \n        form of criminal justice supervision or after the completion of \n        a felony sentence in some States. Two States do not \n        disenfranchise felons at all (Maine and Vermont). Forty-eight \n        States and the District of Columbia have disenfranchisement \n        laws that deprive convicted offenders of the right to vote \n        while they are in prison. In thirty-five States, convicted \n        offenders may not vote while they are on parole and in thirty-\n        one States probationers may not vote. Six States disenfranchise \n        ex-offenders who have fully served their sentences, regardless \n        of the nature or seriousness of the offense. 1,700,000 of the \n        4,700,000 disqualified voters are not in prison, but are on \n        probation, parole or are ex-offenders.\n            (5) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders, the \n        right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice this \n        possibility is often illusory. In fourteen States, a pardon or \n        order from the Governor or a parole or pardon board is \n        required. Offenders convicted of a Federal offense often have \n        additional barriers to regaining voting rights. In some States, \n        Federal offenders cannot use the State procedure for restoring \n        their civil rights. The only method provided by Federal law for \n        restoring voting rights to ex-offenders is a Presidential \n        pardon. Few persons who seek to have their right to vote \n        restored have the financial and political resources needed to \n        succeed.\n            (6) Thirteen percent of the African American adult male \n        population, or 1,400,000 African American men, are \n        disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, three in \n        ten of the next generation of black men will be disenfranchised \n        at some point during their lifetime. Hispanic citizens are also \n        disproportionately disenfranchised since they are \n        disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system.\n            (7) These discrepancies should be addressed by Congress. \n        Basic concepts of fundamental fairness and equal protection \n        require an equal opportunity for Americans to vote in Federal \n        elections. This Act will restore fairness in the Federal \n        election process and promote reintegration of former offenders \n        into a life as law abiding citizens of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.\n\n     The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United States \nto vote in any election for Federal office shall not be denied or \nabridged because that individual has been convicted of a criminal \noffense unless such individual is serving a felony sentence in a \ncorrectional institution or facility at the time of the election.\n\nSEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    (a) Attorney General.--The Attorney General may, in a civil action, \nobtain such declaratory or injunctive relief as is necessary to remedy \na violation of this Act.\n    (b) Private Right of Action.--(1) A person who is aggrieved by a \nviolation of this Act may provide written notice of the violation to \nthe chief election official of the State involved.\n    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the violation is not \ncorrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice under paragraph (1), \nor within 20 days after receipt of the notice if the violation occurred \nwithin 120 days before the date of an election for Federal office, the \naggrieved person may, in a civil action obtain declaratory or \ninjunctive relief with respect to the violation.\n    (3) If the violation occurred within 30 days before the date of an \nelection for Federal office, the aggrieved person need not provide \nnotice to the chief election official of the State under paragraph (1) \nbefore bringing a civil action to obtain declaratory or injunctive \nrelief with respect to the violation.\n\nSEC. 5.
