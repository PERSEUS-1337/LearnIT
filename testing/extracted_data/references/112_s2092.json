    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Religious Freedom Protection Act of \n2012''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) religious freedom and liberty of conscience are \n        inalienable rights enshrined in the Declaration of Independence \n        and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n            (2) on August 1, 2011, the Department of Health and Human \n        Services issued a mandate requiring individual and group health \n        plans to cover sterilization and all Food and Drug \n        Administration approved contraceptives, including drugs that \n        could be used to induce abortions;\n            (3) the mandate's exemption for ``religious employers'' is \n        unprecedented in Federal law and excludes thousands of \n        religious organizations, including religiously affiliated \n        charities, health care providers, and schools; and\n            (4) despite receiving thousands of comments protesting the \n        extremely narrow exemption, the Department of Health and Human \n        Services nonetheless announced on January 20, 2012, that it \n        would not broaden the exemption but would instead give \n        religious institutions an additional year to ``adapt'' their \n        consciences to the mandate.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (42 \nU.S.C. 300gg-13) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Conscience Protections.--\n            ``(1) In general.--No guideline, regulation, or other \n        requirement issued by any Federal, State, or local government \n        pursuant to subsection (a)(4), or any other provision of the \n        Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) \n        or the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 \n        (Public Law 111-152), or the amendments made by those Acts, \n        shall--\n                    ``(A) require any individual or entity to offer, \n                provide, or purchase health insurance coverage for a \n                contraceptive or sterilization service, or related \n                education or counseling, to which that individual or \n                entity is opposed on the basis of religious belief or \n                moral conviction;\n                    ``(B) require any individual or entity that is \n                opposed on the basis of religious belief or moral \n                conviction to providing health insurance coverage of a \n                contraceptive or sterilization service to engage in \n                government-mandated speech regarding such a service; or\n                    ``(C) prohibit any group health plan or health \n                insurance issuer from offering or providing individual \n                or group health insurance coverage that excludes \n                coverage for a contraceptive or sterilization service, \n                or related education or counseling, which the \n                individual or entity purchasing the plan or coverage \n                opposes on the basis of religious belief or moral \n                conviction.\n            ``(2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in the Patient \n        Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) or the \n        Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public \n        Law 111-152), or the amendments made by those Acts, and no \n        regulations, guidelines, or other requirement issued under such \n        Acts (or amendments) shall be construed to authorize the \n        imposition of a fine, penalty, or other sanction, or to \n        otherwise disadvantage any individual or entity on the basis of \n        a religiously based or morally based decision not to offer, \n        provide, or purchase health insurance coverage for a \n        contraceptive or sterilization service, or to engage in \n        government mandated speech regarding such services.\n            ``(3) Private right of action.--The protections of \n        conscience contained in this subsection constitute the \n        protection of individual rights and create a private cause of \n        action for those individuals or entities protected.
