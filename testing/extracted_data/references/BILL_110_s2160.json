FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Acute and chronic pain are prevalent conditions within \n        the population of veterans.\n            (2) Methods of modern warfare, including the use of \n        improvised explosive devices, produce substantial numbers of \n        battlefield casualties with significant damage to both the \n        central and peripheral nervous systems.\n            (3) The successes of military health care, both on and off \n        the battlefield, result in high survival rates of severely \n        injured military personnel who will be afflicted with \n        significant pain disorders on either an acute or chronic basis.\n            (4) Failure to treat pain appropriately at the time of \n        transition from receipt of care from the Department of Defense \n        to receipt of care from the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        contributes to the development of long-term chronic pain \n        syndromes, in some cases accompanied by long-term mental health \n        and substance use disorders.\n            (5) Pain is a leading cause of short-term and long-term \n        disability among veterans.\n            (6) The Department of Veterans Affairs has implemented \n        important pain care programs at some facilities and in some \n        areas, but comprehensive pain care is not consistently provided \n        on a uniform basis throughout the health care system of the \n        Department to all patients in need of such care.\n            (7) Inconsistent and ineffective pain care provided by the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs leads to pain-related \n        impairments, occupational disability, and medical and mental \n        complications for veterans with acute and chronic pain, with \n        long-term costs for the health care and disability systems of \n        the Department and for society at large.\n            (8) Research, diagnosis, treatment, and management of acute \n        and chronic pain for veterans constitute health care priorities \n        of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
