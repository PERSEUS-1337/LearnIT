FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Injury remains 1 of the top killers in America, \n        effecting over 2,400,000 children who needlessly die each year. \n        Fifty percent of these lives could have been saved if prompt \n        aid were administered prior to the arrival of emergency medical \n        services.\n            (2) Part of any comprehensive emergency preparedness plan \n        must include educating the public on how to prepare for and \n        react in an emergency situation.\n            (3) The need for citizen-based emergency preparedness \n        training at the community level has never been greater. The \n        Citizen Corps and mayors from across the country agree that \n        educating children in age-appropriate life supporting first \n        aid, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the Heimlich \n        maneuver, and blood-borne and biohazardous precautions, is an \n        important component of meeting this need. On June 5, 2006, the \n        United States Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution urging \n        mayors to form a Community Response System Initiative Committee \n        to address this issue.\n            (4) Studies have shown that providing children with life \n        supporting first aid skills training increases their \n        willingness to assist others in a medical emergency by 57 \n        percent.\n            (5) Eighty percent of schools surveyed stated that \n        cardiopulmonary resuscitation training is best provided in a \n        school setting.\n            (6) In 2001, 101,537 Americans died of ``unintentional \n        injury deaths''.\n            (7) In 2003, 479,305 Americans died due to heart attacks, \n        which was 1 of every 5 deaths in the United States overall.\n            (8) In the United States, 1,200,000 new and recurrent \n        coronary attacks occur each year.\n            (9) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \n        concluded that if members of the public learned life supporting \n        first aid, there would be ``significant potential'' for \n        reducing the more than 22,000 preventable highway deaths that \n        occur in the United States each year.\n\nSEC. 3.
