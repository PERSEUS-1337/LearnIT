FINDINGS.\n\n    The Senate finds the following:\n            (1) Older people have the highest rate of suicide of any \n        population in the United States, and the suicide rate of that \n        population increases with age, with individuals 65 and older \n        accounting for 20 percent of all suicide deaths in the United \n        States, while comprising only 13 percent of the population of \n        the United States.\n            (2) Disability due to mental illness in individuals over 65 \n        years old will become a major public health problem in the near \n        future because of demographic changes. In particular, dementia, \n        depression, schizophrenia, among other conditions, will all \n        present special problems for this age group.\n            (3) Major depression is strikingly prevalent among older \n        people, with between 8 and 20 percent of older people in \n        community studies and up to 37 percent of those seen in primary \n        care settings experiencing symptoms of depression.\n            (4) Almost 20 percent of the population of individuals age \n        55 and older, experience specific mental disorders that are not \n        part of normal aging.\n            (5) Unrecognized and untreated depression, Alzheimer's \n        disease, anxiety, late-life schizophrenia, and other mental \n        conditions can be severely impairing and may even be fatal.\n            (6) Substance abuse, particularly the abuse of alcohol and \n        prescription drugs, among adults 65 and older is one of the \n        fastest growing health problems in the United States, with 17 \n        percent of this age group suffering from addiction or substance \n        abuse. While addiction often goes undetected and untreated \n        among older adults, aging and disability makes the body more \n        vulnerable to the effects of alcohol and drugs, further \n        exacerbating other age-related health problems. Medicare \n        coverage for addiction treatment of the elderly needs to \n        recognize these special vulnerabilities.\n            (7) The disabled are another population receiving \n        inadequate mental health care through medicare. According to \n        the Health Care Financing Administration, medicare is the \n        primary health care coverage for the 5,000,000 non-elderly, \n        disabled people on Social Security Disability Insurance. Up to \n        40 percent of these individuals have a diagnosis of mental \n        illness, and also face severe discrimination in mental health \n        coverage.\n\nSEC. 3. DECREASE IN MEDICARE BENEFICIARY COPAYMENT FOR OUTPATIENT \n              MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1833(c) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395l(c)) is repealed.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1866(a)(2)(A) of such Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395cc(a)(2)(A)) is amended by striking the second sentence.\n    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) \nshall apply to items and services furnished on or after the date of \nenactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
