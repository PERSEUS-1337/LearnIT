FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) probabilistic methods have wide applicability in \n        improving process efficiency and eliminating overdesign in \n        government programs and purchases;\n            (2) the integration of probabilistic methods into business \n        practices has contributed significantly to the success of \n        industry quality programs and has saved billions of dollars for \n        companies;\n            (3) Federal use of probabilistic methods is less advanced \n        than it is in industry;\n            (4) probabilistic methods hold out the promise of better \n        understanding of safety and environmental risks, and if \n        properly applied can lead to more business-friendly \n        regulations;\n            (5) if made an integral part of federally funded design \n        efforts, probabilistic methods could lead to a better \n        understanding of the specifications a product must meet and \n        reduce overdesign and associated costs; and\n            (6) appropriate use of probabilistic methods within the \n        programs of the Department of Transportation could lead through \n        quantification of uncertainties to more reliable, less costly \n        components of our transportation system, including roads, \n        bridges, and automotive, aerospace, and mass transit systems, \n        and could also benefit the programs of other Federal agencies \n        such as the Department of Defense, the Department of Commerce, \n        and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs \nAdministration of the Department of Transportation (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Administrator'') shall establish a commission to \nbe known as the ``Commission on Probabilistic Methods'' (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4. DUTIES OF COMMISSION.\n\n    The Commission shall--\n            (1) identify where and how probabilistic methods can help \n        the Department of Transportation;\n            (2) assess the extent to which probabilistic methods can \n        help the Department of Transportation maximize return on \n        investment and increase public safety;\n            (3) evaluate the state of probabilistic methods technology;\n            (4) identify the probabilistic techniques that are ready \n        for practical use and recommend guidelines that can help a user \n        decide what technique to use;\n            (5) establish models for quantifying uncertainties in major \n        Department of Transportation programs that affect cost, \n        operation, and performance;\n            (6) identify key technology areas that must be further \n        developed;\n            (7) recommend guidelines for implementation of \n        probabilistic technology;\n            (8) recommend how to set reliability levels that can ensure \n        public safety and be achievable by industry;\n            (9) recommend probabilistic-based guidelines for safety \n        tests;\n            (10) recommend guidelines for creating required database;\n            (11) determine appropriate means of expediting technology \n        transfer and ensuring that the principles of probabilistic \n        methods are used appropriately in decisions involving funds \n        under the control of the Department of Transportation;\n            (12) identify legal and cultural barriers to the effective \n        use of probabilistic methods at the Department of \n        Transportation;\n            (13) make recommendations for the use of probabilistic \n        methods in Department of Transportation programs;\n            (14) make recommendations for institutionalizing \n        probabilistic methods values at the Department of \n        Transportation after the termination of the Commission; and\n            (15) recommend pilot projects for evaluation of \n        probabilistic methods technology.\n\nSEC. 5.
