FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Sickle Cell Disease (in this section referred to as \n        ``SCD'') is an inherited disease of red blood cells that is a \n        major health problem in the United States.\n            (2) Approximately 70,000 Americans have SCD and \n        approximately 1,800 American babies are born with the disease \n        each year. SCD also is a global problem with close to 300,000 \n        babies born annually with the disease.\n            (3) In the United States, SCD is most common in African-\n        Americans and in those of Hispanic, Mediterranean, and Middle \n        Eastern ancestry. Among newborn American infants, SCD occurs in \n        approximately 1 in 300 African-Americans, 1 in 36,000 \n        Hispanics, and 1 in 80,000 Caucasians.\n            (4) More than 2,500,000 Americans, mostly African-\n        Americans, have the sickle cell trait. These Americans are \n        healthy carriers of the sickle cell gene who have inherited the \n        normal hemoglobin gene from 1 parent and the sickle gene from \n        the other parent. A sickle cell trait is not a disease, but \n        when both parents have the sickle cell trait, there is a 1 in 4 \n        chance with each pregnancy that the child will be born with \n        SCD.\n            (5) Children with SCD may exhibit frequent pain episodes, \n        entrapment of blood within the spleen, severe anemia, acute \n        lung complications, and priapism. During episodes of severe \n        pain, spleen enlargement, or acute lung complications, life \n        threatening complications can develop rapidly. Children with \n        SCD are also at risk for septicemia, meningitis, and stroke. \n        Children with SCD at highest risk for stroke can be identified \n        and, thus, treated early with regular blood transfusions for \n        stroke prevention.\n            (6) The most feared complication for children with SCD is a \n        stroke (either overt or silent) occurring in 30 percent of the \n        children with sickle cell anemia prior to their 18th birthday \n        and occurring in infants as young as 18 months of age. Students \n        with SCD and silent strokes may not have any physical signs of \n        such disease or strokes but may have a lower educational \n        attainment when compared to children with SCD and no strokes. \n        Approximately 60 percent of students with silent strokes have \n        difficulty in school, require special education, or both.\n            (7) Many adults with SCD have acute problems, such as \n        frequent pain episodes and acute lung complications that can \n        result in death. Adults with SCD can also develop chronic \n        problems, including pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, \n        degenerative changes in the shoulder and hip joints, poor \n        vision, and kidney failure.\n            (8) The average life span for an adult with SCD is the mid-\n        40s. While some patients can remain without symptoms for years, \n        many others may not survive infancy or early childhood. Causes \n        of death include bacterial infection, stroke, and lung, kidney, \n        heart, or liver failure. Bacterial infections and lung injuries \n        are leading causes of death in children and adults with SCD.\n            (9) As a complex disorder with multisystem manifestations, \n        SCD requires specialized comprehensive and continuous care to \n        achieve the best possible outcome. Newborn screening, genetic \n        counseling, and education of patients and family members are \n        critical preventative measures that decrease morbidity and \n        mortality, delaying or preventing complications, in-patient \n        hospital stays, and increased overall costs of care.\n            (10) Stroke in the adult SCD population commonly results in \n        both mental and physical disabilities for life.\n            (11) Currently, one of the most effective treatments to \n        prevent or treat an overt stroke or a silent stroke for a child \n        with SCD is at least monthly blood transfusions throughout \n        childhood for many, and throughout life for some, requiring \n        removal of sickle blood and replacement with normal blood.\n            (12) With acute lung complications, transfusions are \n        usually required and are often the only therapy demonstrated to \n        prevent premature death.\n\nSEC. 3.
