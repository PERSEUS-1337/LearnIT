FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Fort Peck Lake, Montana, is in need of a warm water \n        fish hatchery;\n            (2) the burden of carrying out efforts to raise and stock \n        warm water fish species in the State of Montana has been \n        disproportionately borne by the State despite the existence of \n        many Federal projects on waterways in the State;\n            (3)(A) as of the date of enactment of this Act, eastern \n        Montana has only 1 warm water fish hatchery, which is \n        inadequate to meet the demands of the region; and\n            (B) a disease or infrastructure failure at that hatchery \n        could imperil fish populations throughout the region;\n            (4) although the multipurpose project at Fort Peck, \n        Montana, authorized by the first section of the Act of August \n        30, 1935 (49 Stat. 1034, chapter 831), was intended to include \n        irrigation projects and other activities designed to promote \n        economic growth, many of those projects were never completed, \n        to the detriment of the local communities flooded by the Fort \n        Peck Dam;\n            (5) the process of developing an environmental impact \n        statement for the update of the Corps of Engineers Master \n        Manual for the operation of the Missouri River recognized the \n        need for greater support of recreation activities and other \n        authorized purposes of the Fort Peck project;\n            (6)(A) although fish stocking is included among the \n        authorized purposes of the Fort Peck project, the State of \n        Montana has funded the stocking of Fort Peck Lake since 1947; \n        and\n            (B) the obligation to fund the stocking constitutes an \n        undue burden on the State; and\n            (7) a viable warm water fishery would spur economic \n        development in the region.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to authorize and provide funding for the design and \n        construction of a warm water fish hatchery at Fort Peck Lake, \n        Montana; and\n            (2) to ensure stable operation and maintenance of the fish \n        hatchery.\n\nSEC. 4.
