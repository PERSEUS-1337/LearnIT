FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) great ape populations have declined to the point that \n        the long-term survival of the species in the wild is in serious \n        jeopardy;\n            (2) the chimpanzee, gorilla, bonobo, and orangutan are \n        listed as endangered species under section 4 of the Endangered \n        Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) and under Appendix I of \n        the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of \n        Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 8249);\n            (3) because the challenges facing the conservation of great \n        apes are so immense, the resources available to date have not \n        been sufficient to cope with the continued loss of habitat due \n        to human encroachment and logging and the consequent diminution \n        of great ape populations;\n            (4) because great apes are flagship species for the \n        conservation of the tropical forest habitats in which they are \n        found, conservation of great apes provides benefits to numerous \n        other species of wildlife, including many other endangered \n        species;\n            (5) among the threats to great apes, in addition to habitat \n        loss, are population fragmentation, hunting for the bushmeat \n        trade, and live capture;\n            (6) great apes are important components of the ecosystems \n        they inhabit, and studies of their wild populations have \n        provided important biological insights; and\n            (7) the reduction, removal, or other effective addressing \n        of the threats to the long-term viability of populations of \n        great apes in the wild will require the joint commitment and \n        effort of countries that have within their boundaries any part \n        of the range of great apes, the United States and other \n        countries, and the private sector.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to perpetuate viable populations of great apes in the \n        wild; and\n            (2) to assist in the conservation and protection of great \n        apes by supporting conservation programs of countries in which \n        populations of great apes are located and by supporting the \n        CITES Secretariat.\n\nSEC. 3.
