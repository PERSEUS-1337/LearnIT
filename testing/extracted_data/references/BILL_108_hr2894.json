FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta, located in Holmes, \n        Humphreys, Issaquena, Leflore, Sharkey, Warren, Washington, and \n        Yazoo Counties, Mississippi, popularly known as the Lower \n        Delta, is of critical importance to the Louisiana Black Bear, \n        over 350 species of birds (including migratory and resident \n        waterfowl, shore birds, and neotropical migratory birds), \n        aquatic life, and a wide array of other species associated with \n        river basin ecosystems.\n            (2) The bottomland hardwood forests of the Lower Delta have \n        been significantly cleared. Reforestation and restoration of \n        native habitat will benefit a host of species.\n            (3) The Lower Delta is part of a major continental \n        migration corridor for migratory birds funneling through the \n        midcontinent from as far north as the Arctic Circle and as far \n        south as South America.\n            (4) The Lower Delta offers extraordinary recreational, \n        research, and educational opportunities for students, \n        scientists, bird watchers, wildlife observers, hunters, \n        anglers, trappers, hikers, and nature photographers.\n            (5) The Lower Delta is an internationally significant \n        environmental resource that has been neglected and requires \n        active restoration and management to protect and enhance the \n        value of the region as a habitat for fish and wildlife.\n            (6) The Lower Delta's existing natural, historical, and \n        cultural assets and environmental restoration potential may \n        provide for a large component of the economic revitalization of \n        this area.\n            (7) The Lower Delta has the Nation's highest potential \n        carbon sequestration storage capacity.\n\nSEC. 3.
