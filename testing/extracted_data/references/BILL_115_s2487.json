DATA ON CONSERVATION PRACTICES.\n\n    Subtitle E of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. \n3841 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 1247. DATA ON CONSERVATION PRACTICES.\n\n    ``(a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to increase the \nknowledge of how covered conservation practices or suites of covered \nconservation practices impact farm and ranch profitability (such as \ncrop yields, soil health, and other risk-reducing factors) by using an \nappropriate collection, review, and analysis of data.\n    ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) Covered conservation practice.--The term `covered \n        conservation practice' means a specific conservation practice \n        or enhancement that is designed to protect soil health, farm \n        and ranch productivity, or both (including the protection of \n        wildlife habitat) while maintaining or enhancing crop yields in \n        an economically sustainable manner (including such a \n        conservation practice or enhancement that is supported by the \n        Department or used independently by a producer), as determined \n        by the Secretary.\n            ``(2) Department.--The term `Department' means the \n        Department of Agriculture.\n    ``(c) Data Collection, Review, Analysis, and Technical \nAssistance.--The Secretary, acting through the one or more applicable \nUnder Secretaries that head mission areas relating to farm and ranch \nproductivity and conservation, in coordination with the Chief Economist \nand the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics, shall \ncarry out the following activities:\n            ``(1) Not less frequently than once each year, review, and \n        publish a summary of, existing research of the Department, \n        institutions of higher education, and other organizations \n        relating to the impacts of covered conservation practices on \n        enhancing crop yields, soil health, and otherwise reducing risk \n        and improving farm and ranch profitability.\n            ``(2) Identify currently collected data relating to the \n        impacts of covered conservation practices on enhancing crop \n        yields, soil health, and otherwise reducing risk and improving \n        farm and ranch profitability generated or collected by the \n        Department, including the Farm Service Agency, the Risk \n        Management Agency, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, \n        the National Agricultural Statistics Service, the Economic \n        Research Service, the Forest Service, and any other relevant \n        agency, as determined by the Secretary.\n            ``(3) Collect any additional producer data, baseline data, \n        or other data relating to the impacts of covered conservation \n        practices on enhancing crop yields, soil health, and otherwise \n        reducing risk and improving farm and ranch profitability \n        necessary to achieve the purpose described in subsection (a).\n            ``(4) Ensure that producer data identified or collected \n        under paragraph (2) or (3), respectively, are collected in a \n        compatible format at the field- and farm-level and in a manner \n        that places the lowest practicable burden on producers and \n        improves the interoperability of the data collected by the \n        Department for the purposes of this section and optimizes the \n        interoperability to the extent practicable with conservation \n        practice-related data generated by other organizations and \n        other activities of the Department.\n            ``(5) Establish procedures for producers to voluntarily \n        elect to be contacted to participate in or submit additional \n        research and to provide supplemental data that may be useful in \n        analyzing the impacts of covered conservation practices on \n        enhancing crop yields, soil health, and otherwise reducing risk \n        and improving farm and ranch profitability.\n            ``(6) Integrate and analyze the data identified or \n        collected under this subsection to consider the impacts of \n        covered conservation practices on enhancing crop yields, soil \n        health, and otherwise improving farm and ranch profitability.\n            ``(7) To the extent practicable, integrate, collate, and \n        link data identified in this subsection with other external \n        data sources that include crop yields, soil health, and \n        conservation practices.\n            ``(8) Establish a conservation and farm productivity data \n        warehouse in order to make the results of the data collection \n        and analysis under this subsection available to academic \n        institutions and researchers determined appropriate by the \n        Secretary under subsection (d)(1).\n            ``(9) Widely disseminate the research, analyzed data, and \n        other information obtained through carrying out this section \n        that demonstrates the impacts of covered conservation practices \n        on enhancing crop yields, soil health, and otherwise reducing \n        risk and improving farm and ranch profitability in a manner \n        that makes it easily used and implemented by producers and \n        other stakeholders.\n    ``(d) Collaboration With Research Academic Institutions or \nResearchers.--\n            ``(1) In general.--To carry out this section, the Secretary \n        may enter into one or more agreements with one or more academic \n        institutions or researchers determined appropriate by the \n        Secretary--\n
