FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2007, traffic congestion in the top 437 urban areas \n        resulted in major chokepoints and bottlenecks, causing \n        Americans to lose 4.2 billion hours and 2.9 billion gallons of \n        fuel sitting in traffic jams.\n            (2) At the most traffic congested chokepoints, each rush \n        hour traveler ``pays'' an annual virtual congestion tax of \n        between $600 and $1,600 in lost time and fuel and spends the \n        equivalent of almost eight work days each year stuck in \n        traffic.\n            (3) Traffic congestion threatens business productivity \n        through the loss of efficient delivery cycles, the need for \n        increased inventory, and the cost of congestion-related fuel \n        emissions.\n            (4) Traffic congestion causes highway crashes that can kill \n        drivers, their passengers and other motorists. As highway \n        crowding grows and motorists jockey for position at exits and \n        entryways, the potential for highway crashes increases.\n            (5) Traffic congestion chokepoints hinder the Nation's \n        progress in improving air quality. Vehicles caught in stop-and-\n        go traffic emit far more pollutants, particularly carbon \n        monoxide and volatile organic compounds, than they do when \n        operating without frequent braking and acceleration.\n            (6) In the largest cities of the Nation, highway congestion \n        impacts 67 percent of travel, lasts seven hours per day in \n        duration, and increases by 37 percent the length of the average \n        rush hour driver's trip.\n            (7) Traffic congestion is no longer simply a problem in the \n        central areas of large cities. In fact, the rate of congestion \n        has increased dramatically in medium-sized cities and suburban \n        areas.\n            (8) In a 2005 National League of Cities survey, traffic \n        congestion led all other categories, including education and \n        healthcare, when respondents were asked to identify the most \n        deteriorated conditions in their cities over the last five \n        years.\n            (9) In December 2007, the National Surface Transportation \n        Policy and Revenue Study Commission noted that certain \n        chokepoints impede national and regional movements and \n        recommended that a distinct program be established to fund \n        projects that reduce traffic congestion.\n\nSEC. 3. CHOKEPOINT CONGESTION RELIEF PROGRAM.\n\n    Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations that establish \na chokepoint congestion relief program pursuant to the requirements of \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL CHOKEPOINT REGIONS.\n\n    Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Secretary shall develop criteria for designating national \nchokepoint regions in a State, or more than one State if the States are \ncontiguous, based on factors, including--\n            (1) daily vehicle-miles of travel;\n            (2) estimates of annual hours of delay per traveler;\n            (3) comparisons of peak period travel time to free-flow \n        travel time (travel time index);\n            (4) percentage of trucks in traffic stream;\n            (5) estimates of wasted fuel per traveler;\n            (6) estimates of extra costs due to travel delay and fuel \n        consumption;\n            (7) percentage of daily travel in congested conditions;\n            (8) proximity to shipping ports, airports, commuter rail, \n        tourist destinations, and freight transportation corridors;\n            (9) estimates of incident-related travel delay, including \n        roadside distractions and ``rubbernecking'';\n            (10) abrupt changes in highway alignment such as sharp \n        curves and hills;\n            (11) intended interruption to highway flow such as \n        tollbooths and freeway ramp meters; and\n            (12) vehicle merging maneuvers such as ``lanedrop,'' lane-\n        blocking incidents, ``weaving areas'', freeway on-ramps, and \n        freeway-to-freeway interchanges.\n\nSEC. 5. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary may make a grant for capital \nimprovements under this Act to a State department of transportation \nhaving jurisdiction over an area within a national chokepoint region.\n    (b) Secretarial Approval.--A grant may only be made under this Act \nfor an eligible project described in section 7.\n    (c) Coordination With Existing Programs.--The Secretary shall \ncoordinate the chokepoint congestion relief program with existing \nprograms, including the corridors of the future program.\n    (d) Construction Standards.--A project to be carried out with \nassistance under this Act that is for a highway that is on a Federal-\naid system (as defined in section 101 of title 23, United States Code) \nshall be constructed to the same standards that would apply if such \nproject was being carried out with assistance under chapter 1 of title \n23, United States Code.\n    (e) Federal Share.--\n            (1) In general.--The Federal share of the cost of an \n        eligible project for which a grant is made under this Act shall \n        be 80 percent.\n            (2) Non-federal share.--The non-Federal share of the cost \n        of an eligible project for which a grant is made under this Act \n        may not be provided from Federal funds made available under any \n        other law.\n\nSEC. 6. APPORTIONMENT OF FUNDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary is authorized to carry out the \nchokepoint congestion relief program described in section 5 by \napportioning amounts to State departments of transportation, in the \nform of capital improvement grants, for carrying out eligible projects \nin the national chokepoint regions.\n    (b) Formula for Apportionment.--The Secretary shall develop a \nformula for apportioning amounts to eligible projects in national \nchokepoint regions based on--\n            (1) estimates of annual hours of delay per traveler;\n            (2) daily vehicle-miles of travel on Federal-aid highways; \n        and\n            (3) comparisons of peak period travel time to free-flow \n        travel time (travel time index).\n    (c) Apportionments to More Than One State.--If a national \nchokepoint region is within the boundaries of more than one State, the \nSecretary shall apportion the funds apportioned under subsection (a) \nfor carrying out eligible projects in such national chokepoint regions \namong such States as follows:\n            (1) 50 percent of the apportionment in the ratio that--\n                    (A) the total lane miles of Federal-aid highways in \n                the national chokepoint region in each of such States; \n                bears to\n                    (B) the total lane miles of Federal-aid highways in \n                the national chokepoint region in all of such States.\n            (2) 50 percent of the apportionments in the ratio that--\n                    (A) the total vehicle miles traveled on lanes on \n                Federal-aid highways in the national chokepoint region \n                in each of such States; bears to\n                    (B) the total vehicle miles traveled on lanes on \n                Federal-aid highways in the national chokepoint region \n                in all of such States.\n    (d) Period of Availability.--Amounts granted to a State department \nof transportation for carrying out an eligible project, from amounts \napportioned under this subsection, shall remain available for \nobligation for a period of 6 years after the last day of the fiscal \nyear for which the funds are authorized to be appropriated.
