SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``American Solution \nfor Simplifying the Estate Tax Act of 2014''.\n    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Congressional findings.\nSec. 3. Elective simplified estate tax.\nSec. 4. Carry-over basis.\nSec. 5. Returns.\nSec. 6. Special rule for revocation of trusts in connection with \n                            election.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The current method of collecting Federal estate tax \n        often cripples American family owned businesses, farms, and \n        ranches by forcing the sale of ongoing concerns in order to pay \n        tax liability arising from the death of an owner, creating \n        inefficiencies, dislocation, and often job losses.\n            (2) From farmers and ranchers to urban business owners, the \n        Federal estate tax looms heavily and has a counterproductive \n        effect on our Nation's family owned businesses that costs \n        numerous jobs.\n            (3) The job losses, economic dislocation, and excessive \n        compliance costs are not justified given the fact that the \n        estate tax has averaged one percent of total IRS collections \n        since 1960, with $14 billion collected in Fiscal Year 2013 \n        (less than \\1/2\\ percent of total IRS collections).\n            (4) The Joint Economic Committee in its May 2006 study \n        concluded that in order to avoid wealth transfer taxes, \n        individuals' costs of complying with the estate tax roughly \n        equals the revenue yield of the estate tax for the U.S. \n        Treasury.\n            (5) The current method of collection of the estate tax \n        leads many wealthy Americans to lock up capital in trusts to \n        minimize or eliminate tax liability, meaning that billions of \n        dollars are left idle instead of facilitating the creation of \n        new business ventures that could stimulate the economy.\n            (6) As recently as 2009, of the 34,000 estate tax returns \n        filed that year, only half owed any estate tax, indicating that \n        many wealthy Americans have found means to avoid paying this \n        tax. In 2012, 9,400 Americans still had to file estate tax \n        returns, even with the higher $5 million threshold.\n            (7) It is in the national interest to modify the mechanism \n        for collection of revenues from those Americans who have the \n        largest estates, provided that it is done in a revenue neutral \n        manner that ensures the ongoing collection of an appropriate \n        percentage of the historical average of 1 percent of total IRS \n        tax receipts that reflects the lower amount of estate tax \n        revenues generated under the 2010 and 2012 amendments due to a \n        higher exemption amount.\n\nSEC. 3. ELECTIVE SIMPLIFIED ESTATE TAX.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \namended by adding at the end the following new subchapter:\n\n                 ``Subchapter D--Simplified Estate Tax\n\n``Sec. 2301.
