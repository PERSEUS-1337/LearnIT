FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Based on article I, section 8 of the United States \n        Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and court decisions, \n        the United States has a unique historical and legal \n        relationship with American Indian and Alaska Native people, \n        which serves as the basis for the Federal Government's trust \n        responsibility and obligations.\n            (2) There are 564 federally recognized Indian tribes in the \n        United States, with some 40 percent of Indian tribes located in \n        the State of Alaska.\n            (3) Indian tribes have principal responsibility for lands \n        and people within their jurisdiction.\n            (4) This responsibility extends to educating their students \n        and providing adequate educational facilities in which their \n        students can learn.\n            (5) Because of this responsibility, Indian schools should \n        be eligible for the funding available under this Act.\n            (6) Elementary and secondary schools all over the Nation \n        use words and symbols representing their schools that are \n        offensive to Native Americans.\n            (7) Nationally, more than 1,200 schools inappropriately use \n        such offensive names or nicknames. Often, these names or \n        symbols become mascots and are used at athletic games for \n        mascot characters, chants, and other antics.\n            (8) Although these school communities do not intend \n        disrespect toward Native Americans, that is the end result of \n        allowing these offensive terms to continue in these educational \n        institutions. Therefore, Federal funding should be available to \n        schools to assist them to discontinue use of offensive names \n        and symbols on equipment and apparel, including team jerseys, \n        signs, stationery, walls, fields, and gymnasium floors.\n\nSEC. 3.
