Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by these limitations and the need for protecting that interest:\nIn order for food and agriculture marketing order advisory boards and agricultural and seafood industry councils and commissions to hold meetings and make timely decisions, it is in the state\u2019s interest to revise the requirements for teleconferences for these boards, councils, and commissions in order to encourage participation by directors. Many of these directors are located in remote locations in the state that are difficult for the public to access and the directors may need to participate from a nonstationary location."
