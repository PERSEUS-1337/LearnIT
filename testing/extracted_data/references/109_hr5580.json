    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``United States-India Energy Security \nCooperation Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) The December 2004 National Intelligence Council report \n        entitled ``Mapping the Global Future in 2020'' states that the \n        single most important factor affecting the demand for energy \n        will be global economic growth, especially that of China and \n        India. It is estimated that the current economic growth rate in \n        India is approximately 7 percent of gross domestic product. \n        India will need to double its energy consumption within the \n        next 15 years to maintain steady rates of economic growth.\n            (2) The United States and India launched an energy dialogue \n        on May 31, 2005, aimed at building upon a broad range of \n        existing energy cooperation and developing new avenues of \n        collaboration on energy. These efforts will promote increased \n        trade and investment in the energy sector by utilizing \n        resources in the public and private sectors, focusing on oil \n        and gas, power and energy efficiency, new technologies and \n        renewable energy, coal and clean coal technology, and civil \n        nuclear cooperation. In his testimony before the Committee on \n        Foreign Relations of the Senate on July 26, 2005, Under \n        Secretary of Energy David Garman said, ``The United States and \n        India recognize their mutual interests are best served by \n        working together in a collaborative fashion to ensure stability \n        in global energy markets.''.\n            (3) As the sixth largest energy consumer in the world, \n        India satisfies 70 percent of its oil demand with imports and \n        has embarked on an aggressive oil and gas exploration program. \n        The largest discovery of natural gas in the world in 2002 \n        occurred in India. In 2003, the largest discovery of oil in the \n        world occurred in the state of Rajasthan in India. External \n        funding and investment in the oil and gas industry in India is \n        necessary to maximize recovery from oil fields, but an improved \n        investment environment in India is needed to attract such \n        investment.\n            (4) India is the world's third largest producer of coal and \n        will continue to rely on coal as a major energy source to \n        support expanding industrial and electric power generation \n        needs. However, many of India's coal-fired plants are \n        inefficient and lack adequate pollution control equipment. In \n        his address to a joint session of the United States Congress on \n        July 19, 2005, Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh noted the \n        importance of allowing greater access for developing countries \n        to clean coal technologies and of exploring partnerships that \n        encourage more efficient use of hydrocarbon resources.\n            (5) India provides a market for United States technologies \n        that promote the clean and efficient use of energy.\n            (6) India has announced plans to develop a 5,000,000 ton \n        strategic crude oil reserve, which is expected to be completed \n        by 2009.\n            (7) United States energy experts have emphasized the need \n        for the United States to increase collaboration with other \n        countries--\n                    (A) to develop and deploy energy technologies that \n                will not be pursued absent greater Federal support;\n                    (B) to increase investment in cooperative \n                international energy research; and\n                    (C) to expand the global network of strategic \n                petroleum reserves.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to cooperate with India to address common energy \n        challenges, to ensure future global energy security, and to \n        increase the world-wide availability of clean energy;\n            (2) to promote dialogue and increased understanding between \n        the United States and India on our respective national energy \n        policies and strategies as an integral part of the expanding \n        strategic partnership between the two countries; and\n            (3) to collaborate with India in energy research that \n        fosters market-based approaches to energy security and offers \n        the promise of technological breakthroughs that reduce oil \n        dependency globally.\n\nSEC. 4. ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT ENERGY COOPERATION.\n\n    (a) Authorization.--The President is authorized to establish \nprograms in support of greater energy cooperation between the United \nStates and India.\n    (b) Activities.--Assistance may be provided under this section for \ncooperation related to--\n            (1) research, development, and deployment of clean coal and \n        emission reduction technologies and carbon sequestration \n        projects;\n            (2) research, development, and deployment of alternative \n        fuel sources, such as ethanol, bio-mass, and coal-based fuels;\n            (3) research, development, and deployment of energy \n        efficiency projects;\n            (4) research related to commercially available technologies \n        that promote the clean and efficient use of energy in India; \n        and\n            (5) technical assistance in support of the development by \n        the Government of India of a strategic oil reserve to allow \n        India to cope with short-term disruptions to global oil \n        supplies without causing shocks to India's market or the global \n        market.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT ON ENERGY COOPERATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall, in coordination \nwith the Secretary of Energy, submit to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the \nSenate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on \nInternational Relations of the House of Representatives a report on \nenergy security cooperation between the United States and India.\n    (b) Content.--The report required under subsection (a) shall \ndescribe--\n            (1) the ways in which the United States and India have \n        cooperated on energy research and development activities;\n            (2) joint projects that have been initiated using \n        assistance authorized under section 4, and the contribution \n        such assistance has made to improving global energy security; \n        and\n            (3) plans for future energy cooperation and joint projects \n        between the United States and India."
