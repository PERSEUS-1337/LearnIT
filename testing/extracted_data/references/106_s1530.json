SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Family and Medical \nLeave Clarification Act''.\n    (b) References.--Except as otherwise expressly provided, wherever \nin this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an \namendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference \nshall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.).\n    (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents is as follows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; references; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Definition of serious health condition.\nSec. 4. Intermittent leave.\nSec. 5. Request for leave.\nSec. 6. Substitution of paid leave.\nSec. 7. Regulations.\nSec. 8. Effective date.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (referred to \n        in this section as the ``Act'') is not working as Congress \n        intended when Congress passed the Act in 1993. Many employers, \n        including those employers that are nationally recognized as \n        having generous family-friendly benefit and leave programs, are \n        experiencing serious problems complying with the Act.\n            (2) The Department of Labor's overly broad regulations and \n        interpretations have caused many of these problems by greatly \n        expanding the Act's coverage to apply to many nonserious health \n        conditions.\n            (3) Documented problems generated by the Act include \n        significant new administrative and personnel costs, loss of \n        productivity and scheduling difficulties, unnecessary paperwork \n        and recordkeeping, and other compliance problems.\n            (4) The Act often conflicts with employers' paid sick leave \n        policies, prevents employers from managing absences through \n        their absence control plans, and results in most leave under \n        the Act becoming paid leave.\n            (5) The Commission on Leave, established in title III of \n        the Act (29 U.S.C. 2631 et seq.), which reported few \n        difficulties with compliance with the Act, failed to identify \n        many of the problems with compliance because the study on which \n        the report was based was conducted too soon after the date of \n        enactment of the Act and the most significant problems with \n        compliance arose only when employers later sought to comply \n        with the Act's final regulations and interpretations.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION.\n\n    Section 101(11) (29 U.S.C. 2611(11)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n        (i) and (ii), respectively;\n            (2) by aligning the margins of those clauses with the \n        margins of clause (i) of paragraph (4)(A);\n            (3) by inserting before ``The'' the following:\n                    ``(A) In general.--''; and\n            (4) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(B) Exclusions.--The term does not include a \n                short-term illness, injury, impairment, or condition \n                for which treatment and recovery are very brief.\n                    ``(C) Examples.--The term includes an illness, \n                injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition \n                such as a heart attack, a heart condition requiring \n                extensive therapy or a surgical procedure, a stroke, a \n                severe respiratory condition, a spinal injury, \n                appendicitis, pneumonia, emphysema, severe arthritis, a \n                severe nervous disorder, an injury caused by a serious \n                accident on or off the job, an ongoing pregnancy, a \n                miscarriage, a complication or illness related to \n                pregnancy, such as severe morning sickness, a need for \n                prenatal care, childbirth, and recovery from \n                childbirth, that involves care or treatment described \n                in subparagraph (A).''.\n\nSEC. 4. INTERMITTENT LEAVE.\n\n    Section 102(b)(1) (29 U.S.C. 2612(b)(1)) is amended by striking the \nperiod at the end of the second sentence and inserting the following: \n``, as certified under section 103 by the health care provider after \neach leave occurrence. An employer may require an employee to take \nintermittent leave in increments of up to \\1/2\\ of a workday. An \nemployer may require an employee who travels as part of the normal day-\nto-day work or duty assignment of the employee and who requests \nintermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule to take leave for the \nduration of that work or assignment if the employer cannot reasonably \naccommodate the employee's request.''.\n\nSEC. 5. REQUEST FOR LEAVE.\n\n    Section 102(e) (29 U.S.C. 2612(e)) is amended by inserting after \nparagraph (2) the following:\n            ``(3) Request for leave.--If an employer does not exercise, \n        under subsection (d)(2), the right to require an employee to \n        substitute other employer-provided leave for leave under this \n        title, the employer may require the employee who wants leave \n        under this title to request the leave in a timely manner. If an \n        employer requires a timely request under this paragraph, an \n        employee who fails to make a timely request may be denied leave \n        under this title.\n            ``(4) Timeliness of request for leave.--For purposes of \n        paragraph (3), a request for leave shall be considered to be \n        timely if--\n                    ``(A) in the case of foreseeable leave, the \n                employee--\n                            ``(i) provides the applicable advance \n                        notice required by paragraphs (1) and (2); and\n                            ``(ii) submits any written application \n                        required by the employer for the leave not \n                        later than 5 working days after providing the \n                        notice to the employer; and\n                    ``(B) in the case of unforeseeable leave, the \n                employee--\n                            ``(i) notifies the employer orally of the \n                        need for the leave--\n                                    ``(I) not later than the date the \n                                leave commences; or\n                                    ``(II) during such additional \n                                period as may be necessary, if the \n                                employee is physically or mentally \n                                incapable of providing the \n                                notification; and\n                            ``(ii) submits any written application \n                        required by the employer for the leave--\n                                    ``(I) not later than 5 working days \n                                after providing the notice to the \n                                employer; or\n                                    ``(II) during such additional \n                                period as may be necessary, if the \n                                employee is physically or mentally \n                                incapable of submitting the \n                                application.''.\n\nSEC. 6.
