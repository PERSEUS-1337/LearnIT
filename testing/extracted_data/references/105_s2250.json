    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of \n1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in most areas of governmental concern, State \n        governments possess both the constitutional authority and the \n        competence to discern the needs and the desires of the people \n        and to govern accordingly;\n            (2) Federal laws and agency regulations, which have \n        interfered with State powers in areas of State jurisdiction, \n        should be restricted to powers delegated to the Federal \n        Government by the United States Constitution;\n            (3) the framers of the United States Constitution intended \n        to bestow upon the Federal Government only limited authority \n        over the States and the people;\n            (4) under the Tenth Amendment of the United States \n        Constitution, the powers not delegated to the United States by \n        the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n        reserved to the States respectively, or to the people; and\n            (5) the courts, which have in general construed the Tenth \n        Amendment not to restrain the Federal Government's power to act \n        in areas of State jurisdiction, should be directed to strictly \n        construe Federal laws and regulations which interfere with \n        State powers with a presumption in favor of State authority and \n        against Federal preemption.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--On or after January 1, 1999, any statute enacted \nby Congress shall include a declaration--\n            (1) that authority to govern in the area addressed by the \n        statute is delegated to Congress by the United States \n        Constitution, including a citation to the specific \n        constitutional authority relied upon;\n            (2) that Congress specifically finds that Congress has a \n        greater degree of competence than the States to govern in the \n        area addressed by the statute; and\n            (3) if the statute interferes with State powers or preempts \n        any State or local government law, regulation or ordinance, \n        that Congress specifically intends to interfere with State \n        powers or preempt State or local government law, regulation, or \n        ordinance, and that such preemption is necessary.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress shall make specific factual findings in \nsupport of the declarations described under this section.\n\nSEC. 4. POINT OF ORDER.\n\n    (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in either the Senate or \nHouse of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution, or \namendment that does not include a declaration of congressional intent \nas required under section 3.\n    (b) Rulemaking.--This section is enacted--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n        and House of Representatives, and as such, it is deemed a part \n        of the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives, but is \n        applicable only with respect to the matters described in \n        section 3 and subsection (a) of this section and supersedes \n        other rules of the Senate or House of Representatives only to \n        the extent that such sections are inconsistent with such rules; \n        and\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n        the Senate or House of Representatives to change such rules at \n        any time, in the same manner as in the case of any rule of the \n        Senate or House of Representatives.\n\nSEC. 5. EXECUTIVE PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, is \namended by inserting after section 559 the following new section:\n``Sec. 559a. Preemption of State law\n    ``(a) No agency shall construe any statutory authorization to issue \nrules as authorizing preemption of State law or local ordinance by \nrulemaking or other agency action unless--\n            ``(1) the statute expressly authorizes issuance of \n        preemptive rules; and\n            ``(2) the agency concludes that the exercise of State power \n        directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal power under the \n        Federal statute, such that the State statutes and the Federal \n        rule promulgated under the Federal statute cannot be reconciled \n        or consistently stand together.\n    ``(b) Any regulatory preemption of State law shall--\n            ``(1) be narrowly written to achieve the objectives of the \n        statute under which the rules are promulgated; and\n            ``(2) explicitly describe the scope of preemption.\n    ``(c)(1) When an agency proposes to act through rulemaking or other \nagency action to preempt State law, the agency shall provide all \naffected States notice and an opportunity for comment by duly elected \nor appointed State and local government officials or their designated \nrepresentatives in the proceedings.\n    ``(2) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall be forwarded to the \nGovernor, the Attorney General and the presiding officer of each \nchamber of the Legislature of each State setting forth the extent and \npurpose of the preemption.\n    ``(3) In the table of contents of each Federal Register, there \nshall be a separate list of preemptive rules contained within that \nRegister.\n    ``(d) Unless a final agency rule contains an explicit provision \ndeclaring the Federal Government's intent to preempt State or local \ngovernment powers and an explicit description of the extent and purpose \nof that preemption, the rule shall not be construed to preempt any \nState or local government law, ordinance or regulation.\n    ``(e)(1) Each agency shall publish in the Federal Register a plan \nfor periodic review of the rules issued by the agency that preempt, in \nwhole or in part, State or local government powers. Such plan may be \namended by the agency at any time by publishing a revision in the \nFederal Register.\n    ``(2) The purpose of the review under this subsection shall be to \ndetermine whether and to what extent such rules are to continue without \nchange, consistent with the stated objectives of the applicable \nstatutes, or are to be altered or repealed to minimize the effect of \nthe rules on State or local government powers.''.\n    (b) Nonbinding Regulations.--Any Federal rule or regulation \npromulgated after January 1, 1999, that is promulgated in a manner \ninconsistent with section 559a of title 5, United States Code (as added \nby this section), shall not be binding on any State or local \ngovernment, and shall not preempt any State or local government law, \nordinance, or regulation.\n    (c) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 5 of \ntitle 5, United States Code, is amended by adding after the item \nrelating to section 559 the following:\n\n``559a. Preemption of State law.''.\n\nSEC. 6.
