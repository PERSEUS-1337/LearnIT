FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) diesel fuel prices have increased more than 50 percent \n        during the 1-year period between May 2007 and May 2008;\n            (2) laws governing Federal highway funding effectively \n        impose a limit of 80,000 pounds on the weight of vehicles \n        permitted to use highways on the Interstate System;\n            (3) the administration of that provision in many States has \n        forced heavy tractor-trailer and tractor-semitrailer \n        combination vehicles traveling in those States to divert onto \n        small State and local roads on which higher vehicle weight \n        limits apply under State law;\n            (4) the diversion of those vehicles onto those roads \n        increases fuel costs because of increased idling time and total \n        travel time along those roads; and\n            (5) permitting heavy commercial vehicles, including tanker \n        trucks carrying hazardous material and fuel oil, to travel on \n        Interstate System highways when fuel prices are high would \n        provide significant savings in the transportation of goods \n        throughout the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
