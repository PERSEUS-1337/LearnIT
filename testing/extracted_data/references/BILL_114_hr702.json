FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy \n        production, establishing the United States as the world's \n        leading oil producer.\n            (2) By authorizing crude oil exports, the Congress can spur \n        domestic energy production, create and preserve jobs, help \n        maintain and strengthen our independent shipping fleet that is \n        essential to national defense, and generate State and Federal \n        revenues.\n            (3) An energy-secure United States that is a net exporter \n        of energy has the potential to transform the security \n        environment around the world, notably in Europe and the Middle \n        East.\n            (4) For our European allies and Israel, the presence of \n        more United States oil in the market will offer more secure \n        supply options, which will strengthen United States strategic \n        alliances and help curtail the use of energy as a political \n        weapon.\n            (5) The 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet is a vital element \n        of our military's strategic sealift and global response \n        capability. It assures United States-flag ships and United \n        States crews will be available to support the United States \n        military when it needs to mobilize to protect our allies, and \n        is the most prudent and economical solution to meet current and \n        projected sealift requirements for the United States.\n            (6) The Maritime Security Fleet program provides a labor \n        base of skilled American mariners who are available to crew the \n        United States Government-owned strategic sealift fleet, as well \n        as the United States commercial fleet, in both peace and war.\n            (7) The United States has reduced its oil consumption over \n        the past decade, and increasing investment in clean energy \n        technology and energy efficiency will lower energy prices, \n        reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase national \n        security.\n\nSEC. 2. REPEAL.\n\n    Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. \n6212) and the item relating thereto in the table of contents of that \nAct are repealed.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL POLICY ON OIL EXPORT RESTRICTION.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to promote the \nefficient exploration, production, storage, supply, marketing, pricing, \nand regulation of energy resources, including fossil fuels, no official \nof the Federal Government shall impose or enforce any restriction on \nthe export of crude oil.\n\nSEC. 4.
