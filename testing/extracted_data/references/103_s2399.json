    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Railroad Grade Crossing Safety and \nResearch Act of 1994''.\n\nSEC. 2. INSTITUTE FOR RAILROAD AND GRADE CROSSING SAFETY.\n\n    The Secretary of Transportation (hereinafter Secretary), in \nconjunction with a university or college having expertise in highway \ndriver and railroad safety, shall establish within one year of \nenactment of this Act, an Institute for Railroad and Grade Crossing \nSafety (hereinafter Institute). The Institute shall research, develop, \nfund, or test measures for reducing the number of fatalities and \ninjuries in rail operations. The Institute shall focus on improvements \nin railroad grade crossing safety, railroad trespass prevention, \nprevention of railroad vandalism and the improved enforcement of laws \nin such areas. There is hereby authorized to be appropriated an \nadditional $1,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1996 through 2000 \nfor the Institute, which will make periodic reports to the Secretary of \nTransportation and the Congress.\n\nSEC. 3. RAILROAD GRADE CROSSING, TRESPASSING AND VANDALISM PREVENTION \n              STRATEGY.\n\n    (a) Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this \nAct, and in consultation with affected parties, the Secretary shall \nevaluate and review current local, State and Federal codes regarding \ntrespass on railroad property and vandalism affecting railroad safety \nand develop model prevention and enforcement codes and enforcement \nstrategies for the consideration of State and local legislatures and \ngovernmental entities.\n    (b) Within one year of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \ndevelop and maintain a comprehensive outreach program to improve \ncommunications among Federal railroad safety inspectors, Federal Rail \nAdministration-certified State inspectors, railroad police, and State \nand local law enforcement, for the purpose of addressing trespass and \nvandalism dangers on railroad property, and strengthening relevant law \nenforcement strategies. This program shall increase public and police \nawareness of the legality of, dangers inherent in, and the extent of, \ntrespassing on railroad rights-of-way, to develop strategies to improve \nthe prevention of trespass and vandalism, and to improve the \nenforcement of laws relating to railroad trespass, vandalism and grade \ncrossing safety.\n    (c) For purposes of this Act, a trespasser is defined as a person \nwho is on that part of railroad property used in railroad operations \nand whose presence is prohibited, forbidden or unlawful.\n\nSEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTY FOR VANDALISM.\n\n    Not later than six months after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Secretary shall amend the Secretary's regulations under section 202 \nof the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 431) to make \nsubject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000.00 under such Act any person \nwho defaces, disables, damages, vandalizes or commits any act that \nadversely affects the function of any railroad grade crossing related \nsignal system, sign, gate, device, sensor, or equipment.\n\nSEC. 5. CIVIL PENALTY FOR TRESPASS ON RAILROAD PROPERTY.\n\n    Not later than six months after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Secretary of Transportation shall amend the Secretary's regulations \nunder section 202 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. \n431) to make subject to a civil penalty of up to $2,500.00 under such \nan Act any person who trespasses on a railroad owned or railroad leased \nright-of-way, road or bridge.\n\nSEC. 6.

WHISTLE BAN PROHIBITION.\n\n    Upon the date of enactment, no state or political subdivision \nthereof shall impose a whistle ban with respect to any railroad grade \ncrossing or series of railroad grade crossings unless one of the \nfollowing actions has been taken:\n            (1) The affected crossing is closed during the pendency of \n        the ban.\n            (2) Crossing gates and median barriers have been installed \n        and are operational at the affected crossing.\n            (3) Four quadrant gates have been installed and are in \n        operation at the affected crossing.\n            (4) An automated horn system crossing device has been \n        installed.\n            (5) The Federal rail administrator has granted specific, \n        time-limited permission for such ban.\n\nSEC. 8. RAIL CAR VISIBILITY.\n\n    (a) The Secretary shall conduct a review of the Department of \nTransportation's rules with respect to rail car visibility. As part of \nthis review, the Secretary shall collect relevant data from operational \nexperience of railroads having enhanced visibility measures in service.\n    (b) Not later than June 30, 1996, the Secretary shall initiate a \nrulemaking proceeding to issue regulations requiring substantially \nenhanced visibility standards for newly manufactured and remanufactured \nrail cars. In such rulemaking proceedings the Secretary shall consider \nat a minimum--\n            (1) visibility from the perspective of automobile drivers;\n            (2) whether certain rail car paint colors should be \n        prohibited or required;\n            (3) the use of reflective materials;\n            (4) the visibility of lettering on rail cars;\n            (5) the effect of any enhanced visibility measures on the \n        health and safety of train crew members; and\n            (6) the ratio of cost to benefit of any new regulations.\n    (c) In issuing regulations under paragraph (b), the Secretary may \nexclude from any specific visibility requirement any category of trains \nor rail operations if the Secretary determines that such an exclusion \nis in the public interest and is consistent with rail safety including \nrailroad grade crossing safety.\n    (d) As used in this subsection, the term ``railcar visibility'' \nmeans the enhancement of driver, pedestrian and railroad worker ability \nto observe trains consistent with public safety with particular \nconsideration of enhancing safety at railroad grade crossings.\n\nSEC. 9.

RESEARCH PRIORITIES.\n\n    The Secretary of Transportation shall incorporate the enhancement \nof railroad grade crossing safety, the prevention of trespassing on \nrailroad property and the prevention of vandalism to railroad grade \ncrossing safety devices, signs and equipment into the research, \ntechnology development and testing priorities of the Department of \nTransportation.
