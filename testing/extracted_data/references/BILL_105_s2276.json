FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) El Camino Real de los Tejas (the Royal Road to the \n        Tejas), served as the primary route between the Spanish \n        viceregal capital of Mexico City and the Spanish provincial \n        capital of Tejas at Los Adaes (1721-1773) and San Antonio \n        (1773-1821);\n            (2) the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth \n        century rivalries among the European colonial powers of Spain, \n        France, and England and after their independence, Mexico and \n        the United States, for dominion over lands fronting the Gulf of \n        Mexico, were played out along the evolving travel routes in \n        this immense area;\n            (3) the future of several American Indian nations, whose \n        prehistoric trails were later used by the Spaniards for \n        exploration and colonization, was tied to these larger forces \n        and events and the nations were fully involved in and affected \n        by the complex cultural interactions that ensued;\n            (4) the Old San Antonio Road was a series of routes \n        established in the early 19th century sharing the same corridor \n        and some routes of El Camino Real, and carried American \n        immigrants from the east, contributing to the formation of the \n        Republic of Texas, and its annexation to the United States;\n            (5) the exploration, conquest, colonization, settlement, \n        migration, military occupation, religious conversion, and \n        cultural exchange that occurred in a large area of the \n        borderland was facilitated by El Camino Real de los Tejas as it \n        carried Spanish and Mexican influences northeastward, and by \n        its successor, the Old San Antonio Road, which carried American \n        influence westward, during a historic period which extended \n        from 1689 to 1850; and\n            (6) the portions of El Camino Real de los Tejas in what is \n        now the United States extended from the Rio Grande near Eagle \n        Pass and Laredo, Texas and involved routes that changed through \n        time, that total almost 2,600 miles in combined length, \n        generally coursing northeasterly through San Antonio, Bastrop, \n        Nacogdoches, and San Augustine in Texas to Natchitoches, \n        Louisiana, a general corridor distance of 550 miles.\n\nSEC. 3.
