CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States needs to take action, and support \n        actions taken by States, to be better prepared for and better \n        protected from natural catastrophes;\n            (2) the hurricane seasons of 2004, 2005, and 2008 were \n        startling reminders of both the human and economic devastation \n        that natural catastrophes can cause;\n            (3) if the deadly 1900 Galveston hurricane were to occur \n        again, it could cause over $36,000,000,000 in insured losses;\n            (4) if the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire were to \n        occur again, it could cause over $400,000,000,000 in insured \n        losses;\n            (5) if a Category 5 hurricane were to hit Miami, it could \n        cause over $50,000,000,000 in insured loss;\n            (6) if the 1938 Long Island Express Hurricane were to occur \n        again, it could cause over $30,000,000,000 in insured losses, \n        and if a hurricane that powerful were to hit Manhattan directly \n        it could cause over $150,000,000,000 in insured losses and \n        cause irreparable harm to our Nation's economy;\n            (7) the inability of private insurers to build adequate \n        capital in a short amount of time and the resulting lack of \n        sufficient insurance capacity threaten to increase the number \n        of uninsured residential properties, which, in turn, will \n        increase the risk of mortgage and other credit defaults and \n        increase the strain on the Nation's banking system;\n            (8) it is appropriate that efforts to improve insurance \n        availability be designed and implemented at the State level, \n        but even active and experienced State catastrophe insurance \n        programs struggle with issues of capital adequacy and financial \n        strength;\n            (9) some States have acted to ensure the continued \n        availability or affordability, or both, of residential property \n        insurance for their residents;\n            (10) while State catastrophe insurance programs may be well \n        designed and adequate to cover insured losses from most natural \n        disasters, a small but significant number of catastrophic \n        events are likely to exceed the combined financial capacity of \n        such State programs and the local insurance markets;\n            (11) the Government Accountability Office has found that, \n        of the approximately $90 billion in Federal emergency \n        appropriations in the wake of the 2005 hurricanes, \n        approximately $26 billion was used by the Federal Emergency \n        Management Agency, the Small Business Administration, and the \n        Department of Housing and Urban Development to make payments to \n        homeowners or renters who lacked adequate insurance; and\n            (12) the recent and historic turmoil in the financial \n        markets calls into question the ability of even the most \n        creditworthy State catastrophe insurance programs to secure \n        adequate financing following a catastrophic event.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF DEBT GUARANTEE PROGRAM.\n\n    The Secretary of the Treasury shall carry out a program under this \nAct to guarantee, and to enter into commitments to guarantee, holders \nof debt obligations issued by eligible State programs against loss of \nprincipal or interest on such obligations, or both.\n\nSEC. 4. ELIGIBLE STATE PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Requirements.--A State program shall be considered an \n``eligible State program'' for purposes of this Act only if the State \nprogram, or other State entity authorized to make such determinations, \ncertifies to the Secretary, in accordance with the procedures \nestablished pursuant to subsection (b), that the State program complies \nwith the following requirements:\n            (1) Program design.--The State program shall be established \n        and authorized by State law--\n                    (A) as an insurance program that--\n                            (i) offers residential property insurance \n                        coverage for insured losses to property, \n                        contents, and additional living expenses;

PAYMENT OF LOSSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--If any portion of the principal of or interest on \nany debt obligation guaranteed under this Act becomes due for payment \nbut is unpaid by the eligible State program issuing such obligation as \na result of such program having provided insufficient funds to the duly \nappointed paying agent or trustee (in this section referred to as the \n``fiscal agent'') for the eligible State program, the Secretary shall \npay to the fiscal agent an amount equal to such portion.\n    (b) Timing.--The Secretary shall make such payments on the later \nof--\n            (1) the date such principal or interest becomes due for \n        payment; or\n            (2) the first business day after the day on which the \n        Secretary receives notice, in such form and manner as the \n        Secretary may require, of failure by the eligible State program \n        to provide sufficient funds to the fiscal agent to make such \n        payments.\n    (c) Subrogation.--Upon making such payment, the Secretary shall be \nsubrogated to all the rights of the ultimate recipient of the payment. \nThe Secretary shall be entitled to recover from the eligible State \nprogram the amount of any payments made pursuant to any guarantee \nentered into under this Act.\n    (d) Role of the Attorney General.--The Attorney General will take \nsuch action as may be appropriate to enforce any right accruing to the \nUnited States as a result of the issuance of any guarantee under this \nAct.\n    (e) Forbearance.--Nothing in this section may be construed to \npreclude any forbearance for the benefit of the eligible State program \nthat is agreed to by the parties to any debt obligation guaranteed \nunder this Act and is approved by the Secretary, subject to the \navailability of budget authority for any resulting costs (as such term \nis defined in section 502 of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 \nU.S.C. 661a)).\n    (f) Authority of Secretary.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of property by \nthe United States, the Secretary may, in the discretion of the \nSecretary, complete, recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, \nmaintain, operate, or sell any property acquired by the Secretary \npursuant to the provisions of this Act.\n\nSEC. 9.
