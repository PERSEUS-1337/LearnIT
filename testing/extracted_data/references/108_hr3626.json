The \n                        owner's approval of a certification agreement \n                        satisfies the consent requirement. \n                        Certification agreements are not legally \n                        binding and may be terminated at any time. \n                        Should land ownership change at a certified \n                        site, the certification will cease to be valid \n                        unless the new owner consents to a new \n                        agreement.\n                    ``(C) Private property rights protection.--Nothing \n                in this Act or in the establishment of any portion of \n                the national historic trail authorizes any person to \n                enter private property without the consent of the \n                owner.

Authorization of \n                El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail \n                under this Act does not itself confer any additional \n                authority to apply other Federal laws and regulations \n                on non-Federal lands along the trail.
