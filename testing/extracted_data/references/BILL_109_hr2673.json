FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Complex seafloor habitats created by geologic \n        structures and structure-forming organisms are essential to the \n        maintenance of marine biodiversity and to numerous fish \n        species, including commercially and recreationally targeted \n        species, which rely on them for spawning, food, and shelter \n        from predation.\n            (2) The diverse fish and other marine species that are \n        associated with three-dimensional, structurally complex \n        seafloor habitats within the exclusive economic zone of the \n        United States--\n                    (A) constitute valuable and renewable natural \n                resources;\n                    (B) are an essential component of marine \n                biodiversity;\n                    (C) contribute to the food supply, economy, and \n                health of the United States;\n                    (D) support the economies of coastal communities; \n                and\n                    (E) provide recreational opportunities.\n            (3) Living organisms, such as deep-sea corals and sponges, \n        which create complex habitat, have not been adequately studied \n        for their potential benefit to society or for their ecological \n        importance to fish species and other forms of marine life.\n            (4) Scientists now recognize deep-sea corals to be as \n        diverse as, and more widely distributed than, shallow, reef-\n        forming tropical corals.\n            (5) Deep-sea corals typically exhibit slow growth, extreme \n        longevity, and highly patchy distribution, predominating along \n        continental margins, sea mounts, and ridges.\n            (6) Deep-sea coral habitats are subject to growing human \n        pressures, particularly as a result of the rapid spread of \n        deep-sea trawl fisheries into new regions and new grounds, \n        aided by the explosive development of navigational, fish-\n        finding, and other technologies.\n            (7) The exceptional diversity, uniqueness, and \n        vulnerability of deep-sea corals necessitates that their \n        mapping and conservation be given a high priority.\n            (8) Bottom trawling reduces habitat complexity and \n        biological diversity by leveling geologic bedforms and by \n        killing, removing, crushing, burying, and exposing benthic \n        organisms, including deep-sea corals and sponges, to predators \n        and scavengers, thereby significantly reducing their value for \n        economically and ecologically important fishes and other marine \n        life. The resultant reduction in biodiversity is detrimental to \n        many commercially and recreationally important species and to \n        the industries and people that depend on them.\n            (9) In the past, the practice of bottom trawling was \n        conducted mainly on soft bottom areas, and was rarely used in \n        three-dimensional, structurally complex habitats.\n            (10) Technological modifications to bottom trawls, \n        including the creation of large rockhopper and roller gear and \n        chafing gear, facilitate the use of bottom trawls in rocky and \n        other complex marine habitats that were once refuges for fishes \n        and other marine life.\n            (11) The expansion in the use of bottom trawls from soft \n        bottom areas to three-dimensional, structurally complex \n        habitats over the past 25 years has had and continues to have \n        significant, adverse effects on the diversity and habitat \n        complexity of these areas, particularly on deep-sea corals and \n        sponges which, due to their fragility, slow growth, and \n        longevity, may take decades to centuries to recover from a \n        single pass of a trawl. With repeated trawling in the same \n        area, the damage may be irreversible.\n            (12) Numerous scientific studies show that bottom trawling \n        is especially damaging to three-dimensional, structurally \n        complex habitats such as corals, boulder fields, sponge beds, \n        and gravel bottoms. According to a National Research Council \n        report, ``there is enough information currently available to \n        support efforts to improve the management of the effects of \n        these fishing gears on seafloor habitats.''. (National Research \n        Council Report 2002, page 66).\n            (13) Prohibiting the use of large rockhopper, roller, and \n        other groundgear is a practical, precautionary, and enforceable \n        measure to protect structurally complex, benthic marine \n        habitats from the damaging effects of bottom trawling.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF LARGE FOOTROPE DEVICES ON BOTTOM TRAWL \n              GEAR.\n\n    (a) Policy and Purpose.--\n            (1) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that \n        essential fish habitat, including complexly structured bottom \n        habitats, be protected from damage in order to protect the \n        species that benefit from the habitat.\n            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to restrict \n        access of bottom trawls to complexly structured seafloor \n        habitats, composed of geologic and biogenic structures, that \n        are found scattered throughout the Federal exclusive economic \n        zone.\n    (b) Prohibition.--Section 307 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857) is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``It is \n        unlawful--''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Bottom Trawl Fishing.--\n            ``(1) Prohibition.--It is unlawful for any person to use a \n        bottom trawl with rollers, bobbins, tires, rockhoppers, or any \n        other devices that are affixed to the footrope (also known as \n        the sweep) and that are in excess of 8 inches in diameter, for \n        fishing that is subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n        States, including fishing by a vessel of the United States \n        beyond the equivalent of the exclusive economic zone of all \n        countries.\n            ``(2) Exemption of fishing in certain areas.--Paragraph (1) \n        shall not apply to fishing in an area that is exempted by the \n        Secretary under paragraph (3).\n            ``(3) Exempted fishing areas.--The Secretary may exempt \n        fishing in an area of the exclusive economic zone from the \n        prohibition under paragraph (1) if--\n                    ``(A) the Council having jurisdiction over the area \n                submits to the Secretary--\n                            ``(i) substantial evidence that--\n                                    ``(I) the area is comprised \n                                predominately of sand and mud bottom;
