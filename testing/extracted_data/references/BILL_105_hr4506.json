FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Article 32 of the United Nations Convention on the \n        Rights of the Child recognizes ``the right of the child to be \n        protected from economic exploitation and from performing any \n        work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the \n        child's education or to be harmful to the child's health or \n        physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.''.\n            (2) Article 2 of Convention 138 of the International Labor \n        Organization, the Minimum Age Convention, states that the \n        minimum age for admission to employment or work ``shall not be \n        less than the age of completion of compulsory schooling and, in \n        any case, shall not be less than 15 years.''.\n            (3) Convention 29 of International Labor Organization, the \n        Forced Labor Convention, which has been in effect since 1930, \n        prohibits most forms of ``forced or compulsory labor'', \n        including all forced labor by people under the age of 18.\n            (4) Although it is among the most universally condemned of \n        all human rights abuses, child labor is widely practiced. The \n        International Labor Organization and the United Nations \n        Children's Fund (UNICEF) have estimated the total number of \n        child workers to be between 200,000,000 and 250,000,000. More \n        than 95 percent of those child workers live in developing \n        countries.\n            (5) The International Labor Organization has estimated that \n        13.2 percent of all children 10 to 14 years of age around the \n        world were economically active in 1995. According to UNICEF, 75 \n        percent of the child laborers in the 10 to 14 age group work 6 \n        days a week or more, and 50 percent work 9 hours a day or more. \n        There are no reliable figures on workers under 10 years of age, \n        though their numbers are known to be significant. Reliable \n        child labor statistics are not readily available, in part \n        because many governments in the developing world are reluctant \n        to document those activities, which are often illegal under \n        domestic laws, which violate international standards, and which \n        may be perceived as a failure of internal public policy.\n            (6) Notwithstanding international and domestic \n        prohibitions, many children in developing countries are forced \n        to work as debt-bonded and slave laborers in hazardous and \n        exploitative industries. According to the United Nations \n        Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery and the \n        International Labor Organization, there are tens of millions of \n        child slaves in the world today. Large numbers of those slaves \n        are involved in agricultural and domestic labor, the sex \n        industry, the carpet and textile industries, and quarrying and \n        brick making.\n            (7) In many countries, children lack either the legal \n        standing or the means to protect themselves from cruelty and \n        exploitation in the workplace.\n            (8) The employment of children often interferes with the \n        opportunities of such children for basic education. \n        Furthermore, where it coexists with high rates of adult \n        unemployment, the use of child labor likely denies gainful \n        employment to millions of adults.\n            (9) While child labor is a complex and multifaceted \n        phenomenon that is tied to issues of poverty, educational \n        opportunity, and culture, its most abusive and hazardous forms \n        are repugnant to basic human rights and must be eliminated.\n            (10) Created in 1992, the International Labor \n        Organization's International Program on the Elimination of \n        Child Labor (IPEC) is the world's largest technical cooperation \n        program on child labor, involving more than 50 countries and \n        over 1,000 action programs. Governments take the initiative in \n        seeking IPEC assistance, and demonstrate their commitment to \n        combating child labor by signing a memorandum of understanding \n        with IPEC, which serves as the basis for a long term in-country \n        program that is overseen by a national steering committee \n        comprised of representatives of government, employers' and \n        workers' organizations, and relevant nongovernmental \n        organizations. IPEC activities aim at preventing child labor, \n        withdrawing children from hazardous work, and providing \n        alternatives to child labor as a transitional measure toward \n        its elimination.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPMENTAL ALTERNATIVES FOR \n              UNDERAGE CHILD WORKERS.\n\n    For each of the fiscal years 1999 through 2001 there are authorized \nto be appropriated for the Department of Labor under the heading \n``International Labor Affairs Bureau'' $30,000,000 for a United States \ncontribution to the International Labor Organization for the activities \nof the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives October 8, 1998.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
