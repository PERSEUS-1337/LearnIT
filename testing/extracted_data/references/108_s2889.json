    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``American Bald Eagle Recovery and \nNational Emblem Commemorative Coin Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The bald eagle was designated as the national emblem of \n        the United States on June 20, 1782, by our country's Founding \n        Fathers at the Second Continental Congress.\n            (2) The bald eagle is the greatest visible symbol of the \n        spirit of freedom and democracy in the world.\n            (3) The bald eagle species is unique to North America and \n        represents the American values and attributes of freedom, \n        courage, strength, spirit, loyalty, justice, equality, \n        democracy, quality, and excellence.\n            (4) The bald eagle is the central image used in the Great \n        Seal of the United States and the seal of many branches and \n        departments of the United States Government, including the \n        President and the Vice President of the United States, the \n        United States Congress, the Department of Defense, the \n        Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice, the \n        Department of State, the Department of Commerce, the Department \n        of Homeland Security, and the United States Postal Service.\n            (5) The bald eagle's image and symbolism have played a \n        profound role in establishing and honoring American beliefs and \n        traditions.\n            (6) The bald eagle's image and symbolism have influenced \n        American art, music, history, literature, commerce, and culture \n        since the founding of our Nation.\n            (7) The bald eagle species was once threatened with \n        possible extinction in the lower 48 States, but is now making a \n        gradual, encouraging recovery within America's lands, \n        waterways, and skies.\n            (8) The bald eagle was federally classified as an \n        ``endangered'' species in 1973 under the Endangered Species Act \n        of 1973, and, in 1995, was removed from the ``endangered'' \n        species list and upgraded to the less imperiled ``threatened'' \n        status under such Act.\n            (9) The administration is likely to officially delist the \n        bald eagle from both the ``endangered'' and ``threatened'' \n        species lists under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 by no \n        later than 2008.\n            (10) The initial recovery of the bald eagle population in \n        the United States was accomplished by the vigilant efforts of \n        numerous caring agencies, corporations, organizations, and \n        citizens.\n            (11) The continued caring and concern of the American \n        people and the further restoration and protection of the bald \n        eagle and its habitat are necessary to guarantee the full \n        recovery and survival of this precious national treasure for \n        future generations.\n            (12) Since the Endangered Species Act of 1973 requires that \n        delisted species be administratively monitored for a 5-year \n        period, the bald eagle nests in 49 States will require \n        continual monitoring after the bald eagle is removed from the \n        protection of such Act; and such efforts will require \n        substantial funding to the Federal and State agencies and \n        private organizations that will conduct such monitoring.\n            (13) Due to Federal and State budget cutting and balancing \n        trends, funding for on-going bald eagle care, restoration, \n        monitoring, protection, and enhancement programs has diminished \n        annually.\n            (14) In anticipation of the nationwide observance of the \n        official removal, by 2008, of the bald eagle from the \n        ``threatened'' species list under the Endangered Species Act of \n        1973, and the 35th anniversary, in 2008, of the Endangered \n        Species Act of 1973 and the designation of the bald eagle as an \n        ``endangered'' species under such Act, Congress wishes to offer \n        the opportunity for all persons to voluntarily participate in \n        raising funds for future bald eagle recovery, monitoring, and \n        preservation efforts and to contribute to a special American \n        Eagle Fund endowment managed by the not-for-profit American \n        Eagle Foundation of Tennessee in the United States, in \n        cooperation with fund management experts.\n            (15) It is appropriate for Congress to authorize coins--\n                    (A) celebrating the recovery and restoration of the \n                bald eagle, the living symbol of freedom in the United \n                States, to America's lands, waterways, and skies;\n                    (B) commemorating the removal of the bald eagle \n                from the ``endangered'' and ``threatened'' species \n                lists under the Endangered Species Act of 1973; and\n                    (C) commemorating the 35th anniversary of the \n                enactment of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the \n                designation of the bald eagle as an ``endangered'' \n                species under such Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
