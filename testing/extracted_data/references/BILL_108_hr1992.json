FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Approximately 17.8 million adults in the United States \n        have limited proficiency in English.\n            (2) Approximately 90 million adults in the United States \n        are reading at levels that are insufficient to allow them to \n        participate fully in the economy and to obtain new skills \n        necessary for success.\n            (3) A significant contributor to low literacy is limited \n        English speaking and reading ability.\n            (4) Individuals with limited English proficiency are the \n        fastest growing segment of the adult education, language, and \n        literacy system.\n            (5) Simultaneous courses in English language instruction in \n        combination with civics education goes a long way toward \n        meeting the needs of English language learners.\n            (6) Lack of English proficiency and a lack of understanding \n        of civics and United States institutions are a significant \n        barriers to obtaining training and employment.\n            (7) English language learners make up nearly 50 percent of \n        those enrolled in federally funded adult education programs.\n            (8) The concentration of English language learners across \n        the United States is not uniform, leaving some States with a \n        far greater need to provide English as a second language \n        services than others.\n            (9) New immigrants accounted for 50 percent of the growth \n        in the civilian labor force between 1990 and 2001.\n            (10) Immigrants who are fluent in oral and written English \n        earn approximately 24 percent more than those who lack fluency, \n        regardless of vocational qualifications.\n            (11) Current workforce development policies and programs \n        have been ineffective in serving immigrants and persons who are \n        limited English proficient.\n            (12) Programs that integrate skills and training and \n        language acquisition have demonstrated remarkable employment \n        outcomes.\n\n          TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO WORKFORCE INVESTMENT SYSTEMS\n\nSEC. 101.
