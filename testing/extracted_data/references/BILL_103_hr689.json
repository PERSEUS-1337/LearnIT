If \nthe Board finds that the unit there specified is a unit appropriate for \nthe purposes of collective bargaining under a rule established by the \nBoard pursuant to section 6 or a decision in the applicable industry, \nand if the Board has reasonable cause to believe that a question of \nrepresentation affecting commerce exists and that the other conditions \nspecified in this subsection have been met, the Board shall within \nseven days after the filing of the petition direct an election by \nsecret ballot not more than 15 days after a petition is filed under \nthis subparagraph and shall so notify the representative named in the \npetition and the employer.\n    ``(B) In any proceeding under this subsection in which the Board \ndirects an election by secret ballot, and which is not governed by \nsubparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Board shall direct the election \non a date not more than 45 days after the filing of the petition and \nshall inform the representatives named in the petition, the employer, \nand all other interested parties of the election date not less than 15 \ndays prior to the election except that, where the Board determines that \nthe proceeding presents issues of exceptional novelty or complexity, \nthe Board may direct the election on a date not more than 75 days after \nthe filing of said petition.\n    ``(C) After an election conducted pursuant to subparagraph (A) or \n(B) of this paragraph is completed, the Board shall promptly serve the \nparties with a tally of the ballots.\n    ``(D)(i) Any party to the election conducted pursuant to \nsubparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph may, within five days after \nsuch election, object to the election on the ground that conduct \ncontrary to a rule relating to election declared by the Board pursuant \nto its authority under section 6 or conduct contrary to a rule of \ndecision declared by the Board in a proceeding under section 10 did \naffect the result of the election.\n    ``(ii) With regard to challenged ballots, the Board shall, where \nsuch ballots are sufficient in number to affect the outcome of the \nelection, investigate the challenges and serve a report upon the \nparties on challenges.\n    ``(iii) The Board shall move expeditiously to resolve any issues \nraised by the objections or regarding eligibility and to certify the \nresults of the election: Provided, That an objection that an election \nwas conducted under subparagraph (A) instead of subparagraph (B) shall \nnot be a basis for setting the election aside.''.\n\nSEC. 4.

The failure of the Board to comply with the time \nrequirements set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, or to \ninstitute a rulemaking proceeding with respect to the subject matter \nset forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection, within a reasonable \nperiod of time after a request for such a rulemaking procedure has been \nfiled with the Board pursuant to section 553(e) of title 5, United \nStates Code, or to complete such a procedure within a reasonable period \nafter its institution, may be reviewed at the behest of any aggrieved \nparty only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.
