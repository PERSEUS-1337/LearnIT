FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) 4,000,000 women are battered by their partners each \n        year, of which 4,000 die as a result of such abuse;\n            (2) victims of domestic violence need access to resources \n        which will refer such victims and their children to safe homes \n        and shelters; and\n            (3) there is a need for a national domestic violence \n        hotline to provide information and assistance to victims of \n        domestic violence because a privately-funded national domestic \n        violence hotline which handled more than 65,000 crisis calls \n        annually no longer exists.\n\nSEC. 3.
