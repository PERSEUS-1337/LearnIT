The Government-wide goal for \nparticipation by small business concerns shall be established at not \nless than 20 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards \nfor each fiscal year. The Government-wide goal for participation by \nsmall business concerns owned and controlled by socially and \neconomically disadvantaged individuals shall be established at not less \nthan 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract \nawards for each fiscal year.\n    ``(2) A goal of 5 percent of the amount described in paragraph (5) \nshall be the objective of an executive agency in each of fiscal years \n1994 through 2000 for the total combined amount obligated for contracts \nand subcontracts entered into with--\n            ``(A) small business concerns, including mass media and \n        advertising firms, owned and controlled by socially and \n        economically disadvantaged individuals, the majority of the \n        earnings of which directly accrue to such individuals;\n            ``(B) historically Black colleges and universities, \n        including any nonprofit research institution that was an \n        integral part of such a college or university before November \n        14, 1986; and\n            ``(C) minority institutions (as defined in section 1046(3) \n        of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1135d-5(3)), \n        which, for the purposes of this section, shall include \n        Hispanic-serving institutions (as defined in section 316(b)(1) \n        of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1059c(b)(1)).\n    ``(3) The head of the agency shall establish a specific goal within \nthe overall 5 percent goal for the award of prime contracts and \nsubcontracts to historically Black colleges and universities and \nminority institutions in order to increase the participation of such \ncolleges and universities in the program provided for by this \nsubsection.\n    ``(4) The administration, in consultation with the Administrator of \nthe Office of Federal Procurement Policy, shall provide procedures or \nguidelines for contracting officers to set goals which executive agency \nprime contractors that are required to submit subcontracting plans \nunder subsection (d) in furtherance of the agency's program to meet the \n5 percent goal specified in paragraph (2) should meet in awarding \nsubcontracts, including subcontracts to minority-owned media, to \nentities described in that paragraph.\n    ``(5) The requirements of paragraphs (2) through (4) for any fiscal \nyear apply to the total value of all prime contract awards entered into \nby the executive agency for such fiscal year.\n    ``(6) (A) To attain the goal specified in paragraph (2), the head \nof the agency shall provide technical assistance to the entities \nreferred to in that subsection and, in the case of historically Black \ncolleges and universities and minority institutions, shall also provide \ninfrastructure assistance.\n    ``(B) Technical assistance provided under this section shall \ninclude information about the program, advice about the agency's \nprocurement procedures, instruction in preparation of proposals, and \nother such assistance as the agency head considers appropriate. If the \nresources of the executive agency are inadequate to provide such \nassistance, the agency head may enter into contracts with minority \nprivate sector entities with experience and expertise in the design, \ndevelopment, and delivery of technical assistance services to eligible \nindividuals, business firms and institutions, acquisition agencies, and \nprime contractors. Agency contracts with such entities shall be awarded \nannually, based upon, among other things, the number of minority small \nbusiness concerns, historically Black colleges and universities, and \nminority institutions that each such entity brings into the program.\n    ``(C) The agency head shall, to the maximum extent practical, carry \nout programs under this section at colleges, universities, and \ninstitutions that agree to bear a substantial portion of the cost \nassociated with the programs.\n    ``(7) To attain the goal of paragraph (2),\n            ``(A) The head of the agency shall--\n                    ``(i) ensure that substantial progress is made in \n                increasing awards of agency contracts to entities \n                described in paragraph (2);\n                    ``(ii) exercise his utmost authority, \n                resourcefulness, and diligence; and\n                    ``(iii) actively monitor and assess the progress of \n                prime contractors of the agency in attaining such goal.\n            ``(B) In making the assessment under subparagraph (A)(iii), \n        the agency head shall evaluate the extent to which use of the \n        authority provided in paragraphs (C) and (D) and compliance \n        with the requirement in paragraph (E) is effective for \n        facilitating the attainment of the goal.\n            ``(C) To the extent practicable and when necessary to \n        facilitate achievement of the 5 percent goal described in \n        paragraph (2), the agency head shall make advance payments \n        under section 305 of title III of the Federal Property and \n        Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.) to \n        contractors described in paragraph (2).
