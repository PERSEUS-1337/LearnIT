DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Terms Used in This Act.--For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) Internet.--The term ``Internet'' has the meaning given \n        such term by section 230(e)(1) of the Communications Act of \n        1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(e)(1)).\n            (2) Geographic penalty.--The term ``geographic penalty'' \n        means the imposition of costs on users of the Internet in rural \n        or other locations attributable to the distance of the user \n        from network facilities, the low population density of the area \n        in which the user is located, or other factors, that are \n        disproportionately greater than the costs imposed on users in \n        locations closer to such facilities or on users in locations \n        with significantly greater population density.\n    (b) Definition of Network in High-Performance Computing Act of \n1991.--Paragraph (4) of section 4 of the High-Performance Computing Act \nof 1991 (15 U.S.C. 5503) is amended by striking ``network referred to \nas the National Research and Education Network established under \nsection 102; and'' and inserting ``network, including advanced computer \nnetworks of Federal agencies and departments; and''.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) United States leadership in science and technology has \n        been vital to the Nation's prosperity, national and economic \n        security, and international competitiveness, and there is every \n        reason to believe that maintaining this tradition will lead to \n        long-term continuation of United States strategic advantages in \n        information technology;\n            (2) the United States' investment in science and technology \n        has yielded a scientific and engineering enterprise without \n        peer, and that Federal investment in research is critical to \n        the maintenance of United States leadership;\n            (3) previous Federal investment in computer networking \n        technology and related fields has resulted in the creation of \n        new industries and new jobs in the United States;\n            (4) the Internet is playing an increasingly important role \n        in keeping citizens informed of the actions of their \n        government; and\n            (5) continued inter-agency cooperation is necessary to \n        avoid wasteful duplication in Federal networking research and \n        development programs.\n    (b) Additional Findings for the 1991 Act.--Section 2 of the High-\nPerformance Computing Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 5501) is amended by--\n            (1) striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following:\n            ``(4) A high-capacity, flexible, high-speed national \n        research and education computer network is needed to provide \n        researchers and educators with access to computational and \n        information resources, act as a test bed for further research \n        and development for high-capacity and high-speed computer \n        networks, and provide researchers the necessary vehicle for \n        continued network technology improvement through research.''; \n        and\n            (2) adding at the end thereof the following:\n            ``(7) Additional research must be undertaken to lay the \n        foundation for the development of new applications that can \n        result in economic growth, improved health care, and improved \n        educational opportunities.\n            ``(8) Research in new networking technologies holds the \n        promise of easing the economic burdens of information access \n        disproportionately borne by rural users of the Internet.\n            ``(9) Information security is an important part of \n        computing, information, and communications systems and \n        applications, and research into security architectures is a \n        critical aspect of computing, information, and communications \n        research programs.''.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to serve as the first authorization in a series of \n        computing, information, and communication technology \n        initiatives outlines in the High-Performance Computing Act of \n        1991 (15 U.S.C. 5501 et seq.) that will include research \n        programs related to--\n                    (A) high-end computing and computation;\n                    (B) human-centered systems;\n                    (C) high confidence systems; and\n                    (D) education, training, and human resources; and\n            (2) to provide for the development and coordination of a \n        comprehensive and integrated United States research program \n        which will--\n                    (A) focus on the research and development of a \n                coordinated set of technologies that seeks to create a \n                network infrastructure that can support greater speed, \n                robustness, and flexibility than is currently available \n                and promote connectivity and interoperability among \n                advanced computer networks of Federal agencies and \n                departments;\n                    (B) focus on research in technology that may result \n                in high-speed data access for users that is both \n                economically viable and does not impose a geographic \n                penalty; and\n                    (C) encourage researchers to pursue approaches to \n                networking technology that lead to maximally flexible \n                and extensible solutions wherever feasible.\n    (b) Modification of Purposes of the 1991 Act.--Section 3 of the \nHigh-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 5502) is amended by--\n            (1) striking the section caption and inserting the \n        following:\n\n``SEC. 3.
