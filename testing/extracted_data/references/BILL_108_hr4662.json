SPECIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY FOR ENACTMENT OF LAW.\n\n    This Act is enacted pursuant to the power granted Congress under \narticle I, section 8, clause 3, of the United States Constitution.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The application of numerous and significant variations \n        in State law impacts the ability of insurers to offer, and \n        individuals to obtain, affordable individual health insurance \n        coverage, thereby impeding commerce in individual health \n        insurance coverage.\n            (2) Individual health insurance coverage is increasingly \n        offered through the Internet, other electronic means, and by \n        mail, all of which are inherently part of interstate commerce.\n            (3) In response to these issues, it is appropriate to \n        encourage increased efficiency in the offering of individual \n        health insurance coverage through a collaborative approach by \n        the States in regulating this coverage.\n            (4) The establishment of risk-retention groups has provided \n        a successful model for the sale of insurance across State \n        lines, as the acts establishing those groups allow insurance to \n        be sold in multiple States but regulated by a single State.\n\nSEC. 4. COOPERATIVE GOVERNING OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (42 \nU.S.C. 300gg et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \npart:\n\n``Part D--Cooperative Governing of Individual Health Insurance Coverage\n\n``SEC. 2795.
