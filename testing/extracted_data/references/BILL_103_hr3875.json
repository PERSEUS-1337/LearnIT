FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Our democracy was founded on principles of ownership, \n        use, and control of private property. These principles are \n        embodied in the fifth amendment to the Constitution prohibiting \n        the taking of private property without the payment of just \n        compensation.\n            (2) A number of Federal environmental programs, \n        specifically the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 \n        et seq.) and section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control \n        Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) have been implemented by employees, \n        agents, and representatives of the Federal Government in a \n        manner that deprives private property owners of the use and \n        control of their property.\n            (3) As new Federal programs are proposed that would limit \n        and restrict the use of private property to provide habitat for \n        plant and animal species, the rights of private property owners \n        must be recognized and respected.\n            (4) Private property owners are being forced by Federal \n        policy to resort to extensive, lengthy, and expensive \n        litigation to protect certain basic civil rights guaranteed by \n        the Constitution.\n            (5) Since many private property owners do not have the \n        financial resources or the extensive commitment of time to \n        proceed in litigation against the Federal Government, a clear \n        Federal policy is needed to guide and direct Federal agencies \n        with respect to their implementation of environmental laws that \n        directly impact private property.\n            (6) While all private property owners should and must abide \n        by current nuisance laws and should not use their property in a \n        manner that harms their neighbors, these laws have \n        traditionally been enacted, implemented, and enforced at the \n        State and local levels where they are best able to protect the \n        rights of all private property owners and local citizens.\n            (7) While traditional pollution control laws are intended \n        to protect the general public's health and physical welfare, \n        current habitat protection programs are intended to protect the \n        welfare of plant and animal species, while allowing the \n        recreational and esthetic opportunities for the public.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide a \nconsistent Federal policy to encourage, support, and promote the \nprivate ownership of property and to ensure that the constitutional and \nlegal rights of private property owners are protected by the Federal \nGovernment, its employees, agents, and representatives.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS.\n\n    (a) In implementing and enforcing the Acts, each agency head shall \ncomply with applicable State and tribal government laws, including laws \nrelating to private property rights and privacy; and shall administer \nand implement the Acts in a manner that has the least impact on private \nproperty owners' constitutional and other legal rights.\n    (b) Each agency head shall develop and implement rules and \nregulations for ensuring that the constitutional and other legal rights \nof private property owners are protected when the agency head makes, or \nparticipates with other agencies in the making of, any final decision \nthat restricts the use of private property.\n\nSEC. 4. PROPERTY OWNER CONSENT FOR ENTRY.\n\n    (a) An agency head may not enter privately-owned property to \ncollect information regarding the property, unless the private property \nowner has--\n            (1) consented in writing to that entry;\n            (2) after providing that consent, been provided notice of \n        that entry; and\n            (3) been notified that any raw data collected from the \n        property must be made available at no cost, if requested by the \n        private property owner.\n    (b) Subsection (a) does not prohibit entry onto property for the \npurpose of obtaining consent or providing notice required under \nsubsection (a).\n\nSEC. 5. RIGHT TO REVIEW AND DISPUTE DATA COLLECTED FROM PRIVATE \n              PROPERTY.\n\n    An agency head may not use data that is collected on privately-\nowned property to implement or enforce any of the Acts, unless--\n            (1) the agency head has provided to the private property \n        owner--\n                    (A) access to the information;\n                    (B) a detailed description of the manner in which \n                the information was collected; and\n                    (C) an opportunity to dispute the accuracy of the \n                information; and\n            (2) the agency head has determined that the information is \n        accurate, if the private property owner disputes the \n        information pursuant to subparagraph (C).\n\nSEC. 6. RIGHT TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL OF WETLANDS DECISIONS.\n\n    Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \n1344) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(u) Administrative Appeals.--\n            ``(1) The Secretary or Administrator shall, after notice \n        and opportunity for public comment, issue rules to establish \n        procedures to allow private property owners or their authorized \n        representatives an opportunity for an administrative appeal of \n        the following actions under this section:\n                    ``(A) A determination of regulatory jurisdiction \n                over a particular parcel of property.\n                    ``(B) The denial of a permit.\n                    ``(C) The terms and conditions of a permit.\n                    ``(D) The imposition of an administrative penalty.\n                    ``(E) The imposition of an order requiring the \n                private property owner to restore or otherwise alter \n                the property.\n            ``(2) Rules issued under paragraph (1) shall provide that \n        any administrative appeal of an action described in paragraph \n        (1) shall be heard and decided by an official other than the \n        official who took the action, and shall be conducted at a \n        location which is in the vicinity of the property involved in \n        the action.''.\n\nSEC. 7.
