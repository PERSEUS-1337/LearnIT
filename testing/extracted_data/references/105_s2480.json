FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the importation of unprocessed logs, lumber, and other \n        unmanufactured wood articles into the United States may result \n        in the introduction of nonindigenous pests and pathogens to \n        native North American forests;\n            (2) when environmental conditions are favorable, \n        nonindigenous pests and pathogens may prey on and devastate \n        native North American tree species, devastate habitat, disrupt \n        other native species and the environment, and disrupt the \n        economy of affected forest areas;\n            (3) the Comptroller General of the United States has \n        reported that the potential economic disruption to communities \n        affected by nonindigenous pests and pathogens entering the \n        United States, including forest pests, costs an estimated \n        $41,000,000,000 annually in lost production and expenses for \n        prevention and control;\n            (4) commercial forestry is estimated to lose forest \n        products valued at $4,000,000,000 each year due to infestations \n        of nonindigenous pests and pathogens;\n            (5) once introduced into the United States on unprocessed \n        logs, lumber, and other unmanufactured wood articles, \n        nonindigenous pests and pathogens are unintentionally or \n        unknowingly transported and introduced into inland forests and \n        habitats by truck transport and train shipment to mills, \n        consumers, and producers and by a variety of other means, \n        including wind, water, and wildlife;\n            (6) examples of nonindigenous pests and pathogens infesting \n        forests of the United States that have caused or have the \n        potential to cause adverse economic and ecological effects \n        include--\n                    (A) Dutch Elm disease, which--\n                            (i) was introduced into the United States \n                        in the 1920's with a shipment of European logs \n                        delivered to the Port of New York and then \n                        forwarded to the Midwest by train;\n                            (ii) has spread throughout the United \n                        States, now to an estimated 1,000,000 trees; \n                        and\n                            (iii) has decimated the American and other \n                        native elm species;\n                    (B) the Gypsy Moth, which--\n                            (i) has no natural predators in the United \n                        States;\n                            (ii) spread rapidly and now infests \n                        Northeast forest in approximately 200,000 \n                        square miles, with smaller infestations \n                        occurring in several other areas from the \n                        Carolinas to British Columbia; and\n                            (iii) feeds on hundreds of different tree \n                        species and during outbreaks can defoliate many \n                        hardwood and shrub species in their path, \n                        seriously weakening trees and stunting the \n                        growth of, and eventually killing, many of the \n                        trees;\n                    (C) the Asian Long-Horned Beetle, which--\n                            (i) is a new exotic pest that has been \n                        discovered at ports across the United States;\n                            (ii) has no natural enemies and has \n                        attacked mostly Norway and sugar maples, some \n                        of the most valuable trees in the Northeast; \n                        and\n                            (iii) is considered a serious threat to the \n                        maple sugar industry, lumber industry, \n                        homeowner property values, and tourism in the \n                        Northeast; and\n                    (D) more recent nonindigenous pests and pathogens \n                that have become established in the forests of the \n                United States and are causing economic and ecological \n                degradation with respect to the natural forest \n                resources of the United States, including the Port \n                Orford Cedar Root Rot, the Pine Wilt disease, the \nEurasian poplar rust fungus (discovered on the West Coast), and the \npine shoot beetle (introduced in the Great Lakes area); and\n            (7) if preventive management measures are not taken in a \n        timely manner throughout the United States to prevent \n        nonindigenous pests and pathogens from entering the United \n        States on unprocessed wood products or to control their entry, \n        further introductions and infestations of nonindigenous plants \n        and pathogens will occur.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purpose of this Act are--\n            (1) to prevent the unintentional introduction and \n        dispersion of nonindigenous pests and pathogens into forests of \n        the United States through the importation of unprocessed logs, \n        lumber, and other unmanufactured wood articles;\n            (2) to preserve and protect the health of the forests of \n        the United States, the forest-dependent economy of the United \n        States, native North American tree species, and irreplaceable \n        habitat from the potentially devastating effects of \n        nonindigenous pests and pathogens;\n            (3) to coordinate federally conducted, funded, or \n        authorized research, prevention, control, information \n        dissemination, and other activities regarding forest pests and \n        pathogens; and\n            (4) to understand and minimize the economic and ecological \n        impact of nonindigenous pests and pathogens.\n\nSEC. 4.
