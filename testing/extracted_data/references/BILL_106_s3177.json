FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Part I of the Health Care Financing Administration's \n        Report to Congress: Appropriateness of Minimum Nurse Staffing \n        Ratios in Nursing Homes was completed in August of 2000 and \n        showed the following:\n                    (A) Quality of care may be significantly impaired \n                when staffing thresholds fall below 2.0 nurse aide \n                hours per resident day, 1.0 registered nurse and \n                licensed practical nurse hours per resident day and \n                0.45 registered nurse hours per resident day.\n                    (B) Below this threshold, residents are more likely \n                to suffer life threatening illnesses secondary to \n                pressure sores, weight loss and preventable infections, \n                and rates of avoidable hospitalization increase \n                significantly.\n                    (C) Fifty-four percent of nursing home facilities \n                do not provide 2.0 nurse aide hours per resident day \n                and approximately \\1/2\\ of nursing home facilities \n                would require greater than a 10 percent change in \n                staffing to meet this minimal standard.\n                    (D) The 2.0 nurse aide hours per resident day is a \n                threshold below which residents lives are at risk, not \n                a standard for the provision of appropriate care.\n            (2)(A) A minimum of 2.9 nurse aide hours per resident day \n        are necessary to deliver 5 necessary daily care services.\n            (B) Over 92 percent of nursing home facilities fall below \n        the 2.9 nurse aide hours per resident day standard and would \n        require a 50 percent increase in staffing to meet this \n        standard.\n            (C) The 2.9 nurse aide hours per resident day standard is \n        based on a conservative assumption and understates the real \n        staffing levels necessary for a nurse aide to complete all \n        tasks that constitute adequate care.\n            (3)(A) Facilities that serve residents with more complex \n        medical conditions will require higher staffing levels.\n            (B) Minimum staffing levels that take into account case mix \n        have not yet been established.\n            (C) Part II of the Health Care Financing Administration \n        report, which has not yet been completed, will report to \n        Congress on minimum staffing levels according to the facility's \n        resident acuity level.\n\nSEC. 3.
