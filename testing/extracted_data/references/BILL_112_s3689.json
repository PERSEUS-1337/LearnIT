FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this \n        Act, thousands of members of the Armed Forces and veterans have \n        visual, hearing, or substantial mobility impairments and \n        receive benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n            (2) In fiscal year 2011, 269 veterans received benefits \n        from the Department of Veterans Affairs for guide dogs (visual \n        impairments), hearing dogs, and mobility dogs.\n            (3) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this \n        Act, the number of veterans who need the assistance of guide \n        dogs is expected to increase as more members of the Armed \n        Forces who serve in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi \n        Freedom, and Operation New Dawn are diagnosed with disabilities \n        and veterans who already have assistance dogs need replacement \n        dogs.\n            (4) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this \n        Act, members of the Armed Forces and veterans diagnosed with \n        visual, hearing, or mobility impairments are subject to long \n        waiting periods to receive assistance dogs. Nonprofit \n        organizations train and provide service dogs free of charge to \n        such members and veterans, but rely solely on fundraising and \n        volunteer staff to meet growing demand.\n            (5) According to the annual survey conducted by Assistance \n        Dogs International for 2011, there was a backlog of 188 \n        veterans waiting for dog placement of guide and service dogs. \n        In that same survey, agency members of Assistance Dogs \n        International were able to place dogs with only 72 veterans.\n            (6) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this \n        Act, each guide dog costs approximately $45,000 and takes about \n        two years to raise and train.\n            (7) In fiscal year 2011, the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        spent $243,992 on veterinary care and necessary hardware for \n        266 service dogs, including those trained to aid visually, \n        hearing, or mobility impairments. The average cost per veteran \n        was $917.\n            (8) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this \n        Act, service dogs work on average 10 years, and young veterans \n        can require multiple replacements during the span of their \n        lifetime.\n\nSEC. 3.
