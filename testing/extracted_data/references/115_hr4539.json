FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the arrival of the Pilgrims in Massachusetts in 1620 is \n        an important landmark event in the history of the United \n        States;\n            (2) the United States is poised for an anniversary of \n        national and international significance, in 2020 with the 400th \n        anniversary of the Mayflower's voyage, signing of the Mayflower \n        Compact, and the founding of Plymouth Colony;\n            (3) the Plymouth 400th anniversary will highlight the \n        cultural contributions and United States traditions that began \n        with the interaction of the indigenous Wampanoag and English \n        peoples, a story that significantly shaped the building of the \n        United States;\n            (4) the settlers, now known as the Pilgrims, and their ship \n        the Mayflower, have come to represent national and \n        international symbols of freedom and law;\n            (5) the indigenous Wampanoag people, and their interaction \n        with the Pilgrims, created an important legacy through their \n        assistance and association, including participation in the \n        first shared harvest, which serves as an indelible iconic \n        moment in United States history;\n            (6) the ``Mayflower Compact'', signed near Provincetown \n        before the Pilgrims explored Provincetown and Cape Cod and \n        subsequently landed in Plymouth, was the colonial cornerstone \n        for self-governance in the New World and had a profound \n        influence on later developments related to the Constitution of \n        the United States and the Bill of Rights;\n            (7) the story of the Wampanoag people, the Pilgrims, and \n        the Mayflower are iconic symbols for the world representing \n        freedom, family, law, and justice;\n            (8) today, people from across the 50 States and around the \n        world visit Massachusetts to see the sights of the first \n        landing in Provincetown, early exploration of the New World \n        along Cape Cod, and the ultimate landing and settlement in \n        Plymouth (commemorated by Plymouth Rock), as well as to visit \n        the re-created Mayflower and Plimoth Plantation, trace their \n        ancestry, and learn about the indigenous Wampanoag and their \n        integral role in the history of the United States;\n            (9) there are more than 20,000,000 descendants worldwide \n        who trace their ancestry back to the Mayflower passengers \n        arriving in 1620 and on subsequent ships in the 1620s;\n            (10) there are two federally recognized Indian Tribes in \n        the Commonwealth of Massachusetts--the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay \n        Head (Aquinnah) and the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe--that have \n        tribal members or citizens who descend from the historical \n        Wampanoag Indian people whose sachem Massasoit signed the \n        Wampanoag Treaty of 1621;\n            (11) in 1897, the General Society of Mayflower Descendants \n        was formed with the purpose of creating permanent records of \n        those with lineage to the Mayflower Pilgrims, and to educate \n        the public about the impact the Pilgrims had on Western \n        civilization;\n            (12) in 2009, a nonprofit organization, Plymouth 400, Inc., \n        was established to ensure a suitable national observance of the \n        Plymouth 400th anniversary to include the themes of \n        exploration, innovation, immigration, self-governance, \n        religious freedom, and thanksgiving, which are legacies that \n        were sparked by these historic events and that continue today \n        as cornerstones of the United States;\n            (13) Plymouth 400, Inc. will lead, support, and facilitate \n        legislative and marketing efforts for a commemorative coin \n        series, United States postage stamps, and related activities \n        for the Plymouth 400th anniversary observances and \n        commemorations in 2020;\n            (14) a commemorative coin series will bring national and \n        international attention to the lasting legacy of Plymouth \n        Colony, the indigenous Wampanoag Tribes, and the Pilgrim \n        settlers; and\n            (15) the proceeds from a surcharge on the sale of such \n        commemorative coins will assist the financing of a suitable \n        national observance in 2020 and 2021 of the 400th anniversary \n        of the Pilgrim landing and historic events, including the \n        signing of the Mayflower Compact, the first shared harvest, \n        interaction with the indigenous Wampanoag people, and other \n        significant events of the period.\n\nSEC. 3.
