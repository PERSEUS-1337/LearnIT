FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street, New \n        York, New York, is an outstanding survivor of the vast number \n        of humble buildings in New York City that housed immigrants to \n        the United States during the greatest wave of immigration in \n        American history;\n            (2) the Lower East Side Tenement is well suited to \n        represent a profound social movement involving great numbers of \n        unexceptional but courageous people;\n            (3) between 1880 and 1921, almost three-quarters of the \n        immigrants to the United States entered the country through New \n        York Harbor, most passed through immigration stations at Ellis \n        Island and, earlier, Castle Clinton, both of which have been \n        designated as national monuments, and millions of these \n        immigrants made their way to the Lower East Side of New York \n        City;\n            (4) no other single identifiable neighborhood in the United \n        States absorbed a comparable number of immigrants;\n            (5) the Museum is dedicated to interpreting immigrant life \n        on the Lower East Side and its importance to United States \n        history, and is located within a neighborhood long associated \n        with the immigrant experience in America;\n            (6) the tenement building at 97 Orchard Street has been \n        designated as a National Historic Landmark, has been found to \n        be historically significant, and possesses a historic fabric of \n        exceptional integrity dating from the period of peak \n        immigration to the United States; and\n            (7) the National Park Service has found the Lower East Side \n        Tenement to be nationally significant and to be best protected \n        and interpreted through designation as an affiliated area of \n        the National Park System while remaining under private \n        ownership and management.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to assure the preservation, maintenance, and \n        interpretation of the Lower East Side Tenement and to \n        interpret, in the tenement and the surrounding neighborhood, \n        the themes of early tenement life, the housing reform movement, \n        and tenement architecture in the United States;\n            (2) to assure the continuation at this site of the Lower \n        East Side Tenement, the preservation of which is necessary for \n        the continued interpretation of the nationally significant \n        immigrant phenomenon associated with the Lower East Side of New \n        York City and the role of the phenomenon in the history of \n        immigration to the United States; and\n            (3) to enhance the interpretation of the Castle Clinton \n        National Monument and Ellis Island National Monument through \n        cooperation with the Lower East Side Tenement National Historic \n        Site.\n\nSEC. 4.
