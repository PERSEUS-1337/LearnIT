FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) The Director of Central Intelligence's most recent \n    Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology \n    Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional \n    Munitions, 1 July Through 31 December 2003, states ``Russian \n    entities during the reporting period continued to supply a variety \n    of ballistic missile-related goods and technical know-how to \n    countries such as Iran, India, and China. Iran's earlier success in \n    gaining technology and materials from Russian entities helped \n    accelerate Iranian development of the Shahab-3 MRBM, and continuing \n    Russian entity assistance has supported Iranian efforts to develop \n    new missiles and increase Tehran's self-sufficiency in missile \n    production.''\n        (2) Vice Admiral Lowell E. Jacoby, the Director of the Defense \n    Intelligence Agency, stated in testimony before the Select \n    Committee on Intelligence of the Senate on February 16, 2005, that \n    ``Tehran probably will have the ability to produce nuclear weapons \n    early in the next decade''.\n        (3) Iran has--\n            (A) failed to act in accordance with the Agreement Between \n        Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the \n        Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the \n        Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Vienna June 19, \n        1973 (commonly referred to as the ``Safeguards Agreement'');\n            (B) acted in a manner inconsistent with the Protocol \n        Additional to the Agreement Between Iran and the International \n        Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards, signed \n        at Vienna December 18, 2003 (commonly referred to as the \n        ``Additional Protocol'');\n            (C) acted in a manner inconsistent with its obligations \n        under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n        done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and \n        entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly referred to as the \n        ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''); and\n            (D) resumed uranium conversion activities, thus ending the \n        confidence building measures it adopted in its November 2003 \n        agreement with the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, \n        France, and Germany.\n        (4) On September 24, 2005, the Board of Governors of the \n    International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) formally declared that \n    Iranian actions constituted noncompliance with its nuclear \n    safeguards obligations, and that Iran's history of concealment of \n    its nuclear activities has given rise to questions that are within \n    the purview of the United Nations Security Council.\n        (5) The executive branch has on multiple occasions used the \n    authority provided under section 3 of the Iran Nonproliferation Act \n    of 2000 (Public Law 106-178; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note) to impose \n    sanctions on entities that have engaged in activities in violation \n    of restrictions in the Act relating to--\n            (A) the export of equipment and technology controlled under \n        multilateral export control lists, including under the \n        Australia Group, Chemical Weapons Convention, Missile \n        Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, and the \n        Wassenaar Arrangement or otherwise having the potential to make \n        a material contribution to the development of weapons of mass \n        destruction or cruise or ballistic missile systems to Iran; and\n            (B) the export of other items to Iran with the potential of \n        making a material contribution to Iran's weapons of mass \n        destruction programs or on United States national control lists \n        for reasons related to the proliferation of weapons of mass \n        destruction or missiles.\n        (6) The executive branch has never made a determination \n    pursuant to section 6(b) of the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 \n    that--\n            (A) it is the policy of the Government of the Russian \n        Federation to oppose the proliferation to Iran of weapons of \n        mass destruction and missile systems capable of delivering such \n        weapons;\n            (B) the Government of the Russian Federation (including the \n        law enforcement, export promotion, export control, and \n        intelligence agencies of such government) has demonstrated and \n        continues to demonstrate a sustained commitment to seek out and \n        prevent the transfer to Iran of goods, services, and technology \n        that could make a material contribution to the development of \n        nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, or of ballistic or \n        cruise missile systems; and\n            (C) no entity under the jurisdiction or control of the \n        Government of the Russian Federation, has, during the 1-year \n        period prior to the date of the determination pursuant to \n        section 6(b) of such Act, made transfers to Iran reportable \n        under section 2(a) of the Act.\n        (7) On June 29, 2005, President George W. Bush issued Executive \n    Order 13382 blocking property of weapons of mass destruction \n    proliferators and their supporters, and used the authority of such \n    order against 4 Iranian entities, Aerospace Industries \n    Organization, Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, Shahid Bakeri \n    Industrial Group, and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, that \n    have engaged, or attempted to engage, in activities or transactions \n    that have materially contributed to, or pose a risk of materially \n    contributing to, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n    or their means of delivery (including missiles capable of \n    delivering such weapons), including efforts to manufacture, \n    acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer, or use such items.\n\nSEC. 3.
