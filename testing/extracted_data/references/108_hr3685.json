    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``High-Quality Education Act of \n2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Tennessee's wide-ranging and research-intensive STAR \n        project began in the mid-1980's when the Tennessee legislature \n        funded an initial 4-year study seeking to compare achievements \n        for early grade students who would be assigned randomly to a \n        standard-sized class, a standard-sized class with a teacher \n        aide, or a class with reduced size. Several new analyses of the \n        Tennessee STAR program show that reducing class size has both \n        immediate and long-term benefits.\n            (2) Research shows that the benefits of participating in \n        small classes increase from year to year, both in the early \n        grades when classes are small and in subsequent years when \n        students are placed in larger classes.\n            (3) Further, follow-up studies of the same students show \n        that high-school students who were in small classes in first \n        through third grades beginning in 1985 were less likely to be \n        held back a year or suspended compared with their peers from \n        larger classes.\n            (4) The students from small classes were found to be making \n        better grades in high school and taking more advanced courses.\n            (5) The State of Wisconsin passed legislation in 1995 to \n        phase in reduction of classes to 15 students in low-wealth \n        schools. A January 2003 study of that program, called SAGE, \n        revealed that average test scores in smaller first grade \n        classes increased 12 to 14 percent more than scores of students \n        in regular classes.\n            (6) Research further shows that at the end of fifth grade, \n        students who were in small classes in first through third \n        grades were about half a school year (5 months) ahead of \n        students from larger classes in all core subjects--reading, \n        language arts, math, and science.\n            (7) In 1999, the Department of Education reported that \n        studies have consistently identified a positive relationship \n        between reduced class size and improved student performance. \n        The National Assessment on Educational Progress, the Economic \n        Policy Institute, RAND, the Educational Testing Service, the \n        American Institute of Research, and many other respected \n        organizations have reached similar conclusions.\n            (8) In smaller classes, teachers spend more time on \n        instruction and less time on discipline problems, reporting \n        that they know their students better, know where each child is \n        in the learning process, and can provide more individualized \n        instruction.\n            (9) Smaller classes lead to better identification of \n        students who need special help, increased student participation \n        and engagement, improved student behavior, and reduced \n        retention of students in the same grade.\n            (10) Outcomes associated with small classes are the \n        foundation of safe schools: improved student behavior and human \n        relations skills, increased participation in schooling and \n        school-sanctioned events, increased sense of community in small \n        classes, and generally improved school climate where students, \n        teachers, and parents feel more comfortable.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assist States to \nproactively attempt to lower class size in order to provide students \nand teachers with an educational environment more conducive to optimal \nstudent performance.\n\nSEC. 3. CLASS SIZE REDUCTION MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Grants.--The Secretary of Education may make grants to eligible \nentities to reduce the size of core curriculum classes in public \nelementary and secondary schools.\n    (b) Eligible Entity Defined.--In this section, the term ``eligible \nentity'' means any State, or any local educational agency in a State \nthat is not a grantee under this section, that meets the following:\n            (1) The State or local educational agency has in effect a \n        class size reduction program that--\n                    (A) applies to all public elementary and secondary \n                schools served by the State or local educational \n                agency, respectively; and\n                    (B) may be targeted to specific school populations \n                based on need, socioeconomic factors, or school-age \n                population.\n            (2) The State or local educational agency has funding in \n        its annual budget specifically allocated for the program \n        described in paragraph (1).\n            (3) The average core curriculum class size at schools \n        served by the State or local educational agency--\n                    (A) in kindergarten through third grade, is greater \n                than 18 students;\n                    (B) in fourth through eighth grade, is greater than \n                22 students; or\n                    (C) in ninth through twelfth grade, is greater than \n                25 students.\n    (c) Use of Funds.--The Secretary may not make a grant under this \nsection unless the grantee agrees to use the grant for the following:\n            (1) Constructing new classroom space.\n            (2) Hiring additional teachers.\n            (3) Purchasing portable structures to replace \n        administrative offices converted into classroom space.\n    (d) Restrictions.--The Secretary may not make a grant under this \nsection unless the grantee agrees that funds received under the grant \nwill not be used for any of the following:\n            (1) To pay any long-term financing obligations such as \n        bonding.\n            (2) To pay any administrative costs or fees.\n    (e) Priority.--In awarding grants under this section, the Secretary \nmay give priority to eligible entities that serve schools in which--\n            (1) more than 17 percent of the students older than 4 and \n        younger than 18 years of age are from families with incomes \n        below the poverty line; or\n            (2) the average core curriculum class size is higher, \n        particularly in the primary grades, than the average core \n        curriculum class size at schools served by other grant \n        applicants for the fiscal year.\n    (f) Matching Funds.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary may not make a grant under \n        this section unless the grantee agrees to make available \n        (directly or through donations from public or private entities) \n        non-Federal contributions toward the costs of the activities \n        under the grant in an amount that is not less than $2 for each \n        $1 provided by the Secretary in the grant.\n            (2) Determination of amount contributed.--Non-Federal \n        contributions required in paragraph (1) may be in cash or in \n        kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or \n        services.
