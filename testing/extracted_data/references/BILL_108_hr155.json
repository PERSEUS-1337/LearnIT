FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States domestic shrimping industry is a \n        vital social and economic force for many coastal communities \n        across the United States, affecting not simply those who own \n        and operate shrimp boats but entire community economies \n        including food processors, hoteliers and restaurateurs, grocery \n        markets, and all those who work in and service these industries \n        and others.\n            (2) In addition to the economic importance of the domestic \n        shrimping industry, the industry serves as a key source of safe \n        domestic foods at a time when the nation is engaged in \n        hostilities abroad.\n            (3) Many nations have blocked the importation of shrimp \n        from certain foreign countries because of their contamination \n        with various substances, but the United States Government has \n        yet to take any such action.\n            (4) Existing international trade agreements are ostensibly \n        designed to decrease not just government regulation of trade \n        but also government trade subsidies.\n            (5) The domestic shrimping industry has been highly \n        regulated by the Federal Government through Federal \n        requirements of usage of items, such as by-catch reduction \n        devices and turtle excluder devices (in this Act referred to as \n        ``TEDs''), which result in a significant loss of product per \n        trawl, hence damaging the competitive position and market share \n        of the domestic shrimping fishery.\n            (6) Seven non-NAFTA foreign countries (Thailand, Vietnam, \n        India, China, Ecuador, Indonesia, and Brazil) have taken \n        advantage of this Government-imposed reduction in \n        competitiveness, by each exporting in excess of 20,000,000 \n        pounds of shrimp to the United States in the first 6 months of \n        2002.\n            (7) These foreign countries account for nearly 70 percent \n        of all shrimp consumed in the United States in the first 6 \n        months of 2002 and nearly 80 percent of all shrimp imported to \n        this country in the same period.\n            (8) Since 1999 our Government has provided more than \n        $1,800,000,000 in financing and insurance for these foreign \n        countries through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, \n        and our Government's current exposure relative to these \n        countries through our Export-Import Bank totals some \n        $14,800,000,000, bringing the total subsidy of these countries \n        by the United States to over $16,500,000,000.\n            (9) Many of these countries are not market-oriented, and \n        hence their participation in United States-supported \n        international finance regimes amounts to a direct subsidy by \n        American taxpayers in the shrimping sector of their \n        international competitors.\n            (10) In any case, any national economy that benefits \n        directly from participation in these finance regimes indirectly \n        grants benefits to our foreign shrimping competitors simply \n        because of the fungibility of funds.\n            (11) The level of imports of shrimp by the United States \n        from these countries has compounded the anticompetitive affects \n        of our current Federal regulatory regime in this sector, \n        leading to a depression of the price of shrimp.\n            (12) There is a crisis developing in the domestic shrimping \n        industry, as evidenced by the fact that the National Marine \n        Fisheries Service, the lead Federal agency in regulating the \n        domestic shrimping fishery, held briefings with staff of the \n        House of Representatives and the Senate, and with industry \n        representatives, to discuss this crisis and seek solutions \n        thereto.\n            (13) Despite this meeting, the National Marine Fisheries \n        Service has not announced that it will forego future regulatory \n        encumbrances upon the domestic shrimping industry such as \n        previously proposed TEDs modifications that would further harm \n        competitiveness of the domestic shrimping fishery.\n\nSEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS ON DOMESTIC SHRIMPING \n              INDUSTRY.\n\n     The Secretary of Commerce shall not impose any new restrictive \nregulations on the domestic shrimping industry within the area that is \nunder the jurisdiction of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management \nCouncil, including the proposed regulations modifying requirements \nrelating to turtle excluder devices published on October 2, 2001, \nexcept as authorized by a law enacted after the date of enactment of \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 4. BAN ON OPIC FINANCING AND INSURANCE TO COUNTRIES EXPORTING \n              EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF SHRIMP.\n\n     The Overseas Private Investment Corporation may not issue any \ncontract of insurance or reinsurance or any guaranty, or enter into any \nagreement to provide financing, in connection with a project undertaken \nor to be undertaken in a country which exported more than 20,000,000 \npounds of shrimp to the United States in the first 6 months of calendar \nyear 2002, until 3 months after the foreign country has reduced its \nshrimp exports to the United States to less than 3,000,000 pounds per \nmonth for a period of 3 consecutive months.\n\nSEC. 5. UNITED STATES OPPOSITION TO IMF ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES \n              EXPORTING EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF SHRIMP TO THE UNITED \n              STATES IN THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF 2002.\n\n     The Bretton Woods Agreements Act (12 U.S.C. 635(b)) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 64.
