    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Model Alternative Publicly \nAccountable Schools Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Because of its extensive use of public charter schools \n        and transformation schools, the District of Columbia has become \n        a leading national model for providing children and parents \n        with alternatives to traditional public schools.\n            (2) The District of Columbia has the largest number of \n        public charter schools per capita in the Nation.\n            (3) Despite the unavailability of adequate facilities and \n        play areas at the District of Columbia's public charter \n        schools, they have proved a remarkable success. The \n        attractiveness of these schools to parents has increased \n        exponentially, as demonstrated by the extensive wait lists for \n        admission.\n            (4) By designating certain low-performing schools as \n        transformation schools and providing these schools with \n        increased resources and specialized attention, the District of \n        Columbia is making a significant difference in the performance \n        of low-income and other children who attend these schools.\n            (5) Many school districts have failed to establish charter \n        schools, and many are only beginning to consider removing low-\n        performing schools from the procedures applicable to \n        traditional public schools, as the District of Columbia has \n        done in establishing transformation schools from the low-\n        performing traditional public schools.\n            (6) The District of Columbia experience should be \n        encouraged and further developed so that it can be used by \n        other school districts as a model for offering public school \n        alternatives that provide services similar to the those \n        available to targeted assistance schools under section 1115 of \n        the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n        6315) and charter schools under part B of title V of that Act \n        (20 U.S.C. 7221 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To provide a model for school districts in the United \n        States using and building on the experience of the District of \n        Columbia in establishing fully accountable public alternatives \n        to traditional public schools.\n            (2) To illustrate the range of public education \n        possibilities, including--\n                    (A) public transformation schools that focus on \n                providing low-income children and other children from \n                low-performing schools residing in the District of \n                Columbia and their parents with expanded opportunities \n                and enriched resources; and\n                    (B) public charter schools in the District of \n                Columbia, for children whose parents so choose.\n\nSEC. 4.
