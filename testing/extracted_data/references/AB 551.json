This section shall be construed as establishing the reasonable rental value of the premises recoverable by a landlord upon a holding-over by the tenant upon the termination of a lease under the circumstances specified herein.\nSEC. 3.\nChapter 2.8 (commencing with Section 1954.600) is added to Title 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  2.8 Bed Bug Infestations\n1954.600.\nThe Legislature finds and declares:\n(a) Controlling bed bugs is uniquely challenging, as bed bug resistance to existing insecticidal control measures is significant. Cooperation among landlords, tenants, and pest control operators is required for successful control. With cooperation among landlords, tenants, and pest control operators, most bed bug infestations can be successfully controlled.\n(b) Effective control is more likely to occur when landlords and tenants are informed of the best practices for bed bug control.\n(c) Early detection and reporting of bed bugs is an important component required for preventing bed bug infestations. Tenants should not face retaliation for reporting a problem.\n(d) Lack of cooperation by landlords and tenants can undermine pest control operator efforts to identify the presence of bed bugs and control an infestation. Depending on the treatment strategy, it is often critical that tenants cooperate with pest control operators by reducing clutter, washing clothes, or performing other activities. Likewise, inadequate or untimely response or planning by landlords may exacerbate an infestation.\n(e) Pest control operators with knowledge and education in current best practices for bed bug management, such as those created by the National Pest Management Association (NPMA), are best equipped to help property owners and tenants eradicate bed bugs from their home.\n(f) The Structural Pest Control Board should incorporate training in bed bug management based on the National Pest Management Association (NPMA) best practices for the issuance or renewal of a Branch 2 operator, field representative, or applicator license.\n1954.601.\nFor purposes of this chapter, the term \u201cpest control operator\u201d means an individual holding a Branch 2 operator, field representative, or applicator license from the Structural Pest Control Board.\n1954.602\n(a) A landlord shall not show, rent, or lease to a prospective tenant any vacant dwelling unit that the landlord knows has a current bed bug infestation.\n(b) This section does not impose a duty on a landlord to inspect a dwelling unit or the common areas of the premises for bed bugs if the landlord has no notice of a suspected or actual bed bug infestation. If a bed bug infestation is evident on visual inspection, the landlord shall be considered to have notice pursuant to this section.\n1954.603.\nOn and after July 1, 2017, prior to creating a new tenancy for a dwelling unit, a landlord shall provide a written notice to the prospective tenant as provided in this section. This notice shall be provided to all other tenants by January 1, 2018. The notice shall be in at least 10-point type and shall include, but is not limited to, the following:\n(a) General information about bed bug identification, behavior and biology, the importance of cooperation for prevention and treatment, and the importance of and for prompt written reporting of suspected infestations to the landlord. The information shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n\nInformation about Bed Bugs\nBed bug Appearance: Bed bugs have six legs. Adult bed bugs have flat bodies about\n1/4\nof an inch in length. Their color can vary from red and brown to copper colored. Young bed bugs are very small. Their bodies are about\n1/16\nof an inch in length. They have almost no color. When a bed bug feeds, its body swells, may lengthen, and becomes bright red, sometimes making it appear to be a different insect. Bed bugs do not fly. They can either crawl or be carried from place to place on objects, people, or animals. Bed bugs can be hard to find and identify because they are tiny and try to stay hidden.\nLife Cycle and Reproduction: An average bed bug lives for about 10 months. Female bed bugs lay one to five eggs per day. Bed bugs grow to full adulthood in about 21 days.\nBed bugs can survive for months without feeding.\nBed bug Bites: Because bed bugs usually feed at night, most people are bitten in their sleep and do not realize they were bitten. A person\u2019s reaction to insect bites is an immune response and so varies from person to person. Sometimes the red welts caused by the bites will not be noticed until many days after a person was bitten, if at all.\nCommon signs and symptoms of a possible bed bug infestation:\n\u2022 Small red to reddish brown fecal spots on mattresses, box springs, bed frames, mattresses, linens, upholstery, or walls.\n\u2022 Molted bed bug skins, white, sticky eggs, or empty eggshells.\n\u2022 Very heavily infested areas may have a characteristically sweet odor.\n\u2022 Red, itchy bite marks, especially on the legs, arms, and other body parts exposed while sleeping. However, some people do not show bed bug lesions on their bodies even though bed bugs may have fed on them.\nFor more information, see the Internet Web sites of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the National Pest Management Association.\n\n\n(b) The procedure to report suspected infestations to the landlord.\n1954.604.\nEntry to inspect a tenant\u2019s dwelling unit shall comply with Section 1954. Entry to inspect any unit selected by the pest control operator and to conduct followup inspections of surrounding units until bed bugs are eliminated is a necessary service for the purpose of Section 1954. Tenants shall cooperate with the inspection to facilitate the detection and treatment of bed bugs, including providing requested information that is necessary to facilitate the detection and treatment of bed bugs to the pest control operator.\n1954.605.\nThe landlord shall notify the tenants of those units inspected by the pest control operator pursuant to Section 1954.604 of the pest control operator\u2019s findings. The notification shall be in writing and made within two business days of receipt of the pest control operator\u2019s findings. For confirmed infestations in common areas, all tenants shall be provided notice of the pest control operator\u2019s findings.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 1.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 1942.5 of the Civil Code proposed by both this bill and Assembly Bill 2881. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, (2) each bill amends Section 1942.5 of the Civil Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 2881, in which case Section 1 of this bill shall not become operative."
