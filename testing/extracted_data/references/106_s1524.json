FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century \n        provides for the Secretary of Transportation to work in \n        partnership with States and other political jurisdictions to \n        establish programs to improve motor carrier, commercial motor \n        vehicle, and driver safety, to support a safe and efficient \n        transportation system by focusing resources on strategic safety \n        investments, to promote safe for-hire and private \n        transportation, including transportation of passengers and \n        hazardous materials, to identify high-risk carriers and \n        drivers, and to invest in activities likely to generate maximum \n        reductions in the number and severity of commercial motor \n        vehicle crashes.\n            (2) The Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector \n        General Report on the Federal Highway Administration's Motor \n        Carrier Safety Program found that established policies and \n        procedures do not ensure that motor carrier safety regulations \n        are enforced.\n            (3) The Report also found that the Safety Status \n        Measurement System (known as ``SafeStat''), which was \n        implemented to identify and target motor carriers with high-\n        risk safety records, cannot target all carriers with the worst \n        records because its database is incomplete and inaccurate, and \n        data input is not timely.\n            (4) Testimony by the General Accounting Office before the \n        House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Transportation and \n        Related Agencies indicated that SafeStat's ability to target \n        high-risk carriers is also limited by out-of-date census data.\n            (5) There are no procedures in place to certify Federal, \n        State, and private motor carrier safety specialists and no \n        standards to ensure consistent carrier compliance reviews.\n            (6) There are no established protocols for acceptance of \n        data from third-party or non-Federal or non-State motor carrier \n        safety specialists, which detail the safety factors of motor \n        carriers.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \ncreation of a certification program for Motor Carrier Safety \nSpecialists and to establish certain informational requirements in \norder to promote highway safety through a comprehensive review of motor \ncarriers.\n\nSEC. 3.
