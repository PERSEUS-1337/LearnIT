FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Community-based services play an essential role in \n        keeping individuals healthy.\n            (2) Without community-based long-term services and \n        supports, which are not typically covered by Medicare, seniors \n        frequently experience negative health outcomes and lose their \n        ability to live independently.\n            (3) Seniors who deplete their resources often have no \n        option but to turn to Medicaid for coverage of long-term care \n        expenses.\n            (4) Targeting community-based services and supports to at-\n        risk seniors can help these individuals avoid depleting their \n        assets and becoming Medicaid dependent.\n\nSEC. 3.
