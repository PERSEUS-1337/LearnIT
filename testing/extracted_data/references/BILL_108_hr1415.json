FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Funds derived from the sale of rough diamonds are being \n        used by rebels and state actors to finance military activities, \n        overthrow legitimate governments, subvert international efforts \n        to promote peace and stability, and commit horrifying \n        atrocities against unarmed civilians. During the past decade, \n        more than 6,500,000 people from Sierra Leone, Angola, and the \n        Democratic Republic of the Congo have been driven from their \n        homes by wars waged in large part for control of diamond mining \n        areas. A million of these are refugees eking out a miserable \n        existence in neighboring countries, and tens of thousands have \n        fled to the United States. Approximately 3,700,000 people have \n        died during these wars.\n            (2) The countries caught in this fighting are home to \n        nearly 70,000,000 people whose societies have been torn apart \n        not only by fighting but also by terrible human rights \n        violations.\n            (3) Human rights and humanitarian advocates, the diamond \n        trade as represented by the World Diamond Council, and the \n        United States Government have been working to block the trade \n        in conflict diamonds. Their efforts have helped to build a \n        consensus that action is urgently needed to end the trade in \n        conflict diamonds.\n            (4) The United Nations Security Council has acted at \n        various times under chapter VII of the Charter of the United \n        Nations to address threats to international peace and security \n        posed by conflicts linked to diamonds. Through these actions, \n        it has prohibited all states from exporting weapons to certain \n        countries affected by such conflicts. It has further required \n        all states to prohibit the direct and indirect import of rough \n        diamonds from Sierra Leone unless the diamonds are controlled \n        under specified certificate of origin regimes and to prohibit \n        absolutely the direct and indirect import of rough diamonds \n        from Liberia.\n            (5) In response, the United States implemented sanctions \n        restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone \n        to those diamonds accompanied by specified certificates of \n        origin and fully prohibiting the importation of rough diamonds \n        from Liberia. The United States is now taking further action \n        against trade in conflict diamonds.\n            (6) Without effective action to eliminate trade in conflict \n        diamonds, the trade in legitimate diamonds faces the threat of \n        a consumer backlash that could damage the economies of \n        countries not involved in the trade in conflict diamonds and \n        penalize members of the legitimate trade and the people they \n        employ. To prevent that, South Africa and more than 30 other \n        countries are involved in working, through the ``Kimberley \n        Process'', toward devising a solution to this problem. As the \n        consumer of a majority of the world's supply of diamonds, the \n        United States has an obligation to help sever the link between \n        diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an \n        effective solution.\n            (7) Failure to curtail the trade in conflict diamonds or to \n        differentiate between the trade in conflict diamonds and the \n        trade in legitimate diamonds could have a severe negative \n        impact on the legitimate diamond trade in countries such as \n        Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania.\n            (8) Initiatives of the United States seek to resolve the \n        regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa which facilitate the \n        trade in conflict diamonds.\n            (9) The Interlaken Declaration on the Kimberley Process \n        Certification Scheme for Rough Diamonds of November 5, 2002, \n        states that Participants will ensure that measures taken to \n        implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for Rough \n        Diamonds will be consistent with international trade rules.\n\nSEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Ongoing Process.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nKimberley Process Certification Scheme, officially launched on January \n1, 2003, is an ongoing process. The President should work with \nParticipants to strengthen the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme \nthrough the adoption of measures for the sharing of statistics on the \nproduction of and trade in rough diamonds, and for monitoring the \neffectiveness of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme in stemming \ntrade in diamonds the importation or exportation of which is not \ncontrolled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.\n    (b) Statistics and Reporting.--It is the sense of the Congress that \nunder Annex III to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, \nParticipants recognized that reliable and comparable data on the \ninternational trade in rough diamonds are an essential tool for the \neffective implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. \nTherefore, the executive branch should continue to--\n            (1) keep and publish statistics on imports and exports of \n        rough diamonds under subheadings 7102.10.00, 7102.21, and \n        7102.31.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n        States;\n            (2) make these statistics available for analysis by \n        interested parties and by Participants; and\n            (3) take a leadership role in negotiating a standardized \n        methodology among Participants for reporting statistics on \n        imports and exports of rough diamonds.\n\nSEC. 11. REPORTS.\n\n    (a) Annual Reports.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act and every 12 months thereafter for such period as \nthis Act is in effect, the President shall transmit to the Congress a \nreport--\n            (1) describing actions taken by countries that have \n        exported rough diamonds to the United States during the \n        preceding 12-month period to control the exportation of the \n        diamonds through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme; \n        and\n            (2) identifying each country that, during the preceding 12-\n        month period, exported rough diamonds to the United States and \n        was exporting rough diamonds not controlled through the \n        Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, if the failure to do so \n        has significantly increased the likelihood that those diamonds \n        not so controlled are being imported into the United States.\n    (b) Semiannual Reports.--For each country identified in subsection \n(a)(2), the President, during such period as this Act is in effect, \nshall, every 6 months after the initial report in which the country was \nidentified, transmit to the Congress a report that explains what \nactions have been taken by the United States or such country since the \nprevious report to ensure that diamonds the exportation of which was \nnot controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme are \nnot being imported from that country into the United States. The \nrequirement to issue a semiannual report with respect to a country \nunder this subsection shall remain in effect until such time as the \ncountry is controlling the importation and exportation of rough \ndiamonds through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.\n\nSEC. 12. GAO REPORT.\n\n    Not later than 24 months after the effective date of this Act, the \nComptroller General of the United States shall transmit a report to the \nCongress on the effectiveness of the provisions of this Act in \npreventing the importation or exportation of rough diamonds that is \nprohibited under section 4. The Comptroller General shall include in \nthe report any recommendations on any modifications to this Act that \nmay be necessary.\n\nSEC. 13. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act shall take effect on the date on which the President \ncertifies to the Congress that--\n            (1) an applicable waiver that has been granted by the World \n        Trade Organization is in effect; or\n            (2) an applicable decision in a resolution adopted by the \n        United Nations Security Council pursuant to Chapter VII of the \n        Charter of the United Nations is in effect.\nThis Act shall thereafter remain in effect during those periods in \nwhich, as certified by the President to the Congress, an applicable \nwaiver or decision referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) is in effect."
