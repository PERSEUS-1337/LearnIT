FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) numerous species of fauna and flora in foreign \n        countries have continued to decline to the point that the long-\n        term survival of those species in the wild is in serious \n        jeopardy;\n            (2) many of those species are listed as endangered species \n        or threatened species under section 4 of the Endangered Species \n        Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) or in Appendix I, II, or III of \n        the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of \n        Wild Fauna and Flora;\n            (3) there are insufficient resources available for \n        addressing the threats facing those species, which will require \n        the joint commitment and effort of foreign countries within the \n        range of those species, the United States and other countries, \n        and the private sector;\n            (4) the grant programs established by Congress for tigers, \n        rhinoceroses, Asian elephants, and African elephants have \n        proven to be extremely successful programs that provide Federal \n        funds for conservation projects in an efficient and expeditious \n        manner and that encourage additional support for conservation \n        in the foreign countries where those species exist in the wild; \n        and\n            (5) a new grant program modeled on the existing programs \n        for tigers, rhinoceroses, and elephants would provide an \n        effective means to assist in the conservation of foreign \n        endangered species for which there are no existing grant \n        programs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to conserve endangered and \nthreatened species of fauna and flora in foreign countries, and the \necosystems on which the species depend, by supporting the conservation \nprograms for those species of foreign countries and the CITES \nSecretariat, promoting partnerships between the public and private \nsectors, and providing financial resources for those programs and \npartnerships.\n\nSEC. 3.
