    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense \nAct of 1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On July 10, 1991, the United States adopted a policy \n        suspending all licenses and other approvals to export or \n        otherwise transfer defense articles and defense services to \n        Yugoslavia.\n            (2) On September 25, 1991, the United Nations Security \n        Council adopted Resolution 713, which imposed a mandatory \n        international embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military \n        equipment to Yugoslavia.\n            (3) The United States considered the policy adopted July \n        10, 1991, to comply fully with Resolution 713 and therefore \n        took no additional action in response to that resolution.\n            (4) On January 8, 1992, the United Nations Security Council \n        adopted Resolution 727, which decided that the mandatory arms \n        embargo imposed by Resolution 713 should apply to any \n        independent states that might thereafter emerge on the \n        territory of Yugoslavia.\n            (5) On February 29 and March 1, 1992, the people of Bosnia \n        and Herzegovina voted in a referendum to declare independence \n        from Yugoslavia.\n            (6) On April 7, 1992, the United States recognized the \n        Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n            (7) On May 22, 1992, the Government of Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina was admitted to full membership in the United \n        Nations.\n            (8) Consistent with Resolution 727, the United States has \n        continued to apply the policy adopted July 10, 1991, to \n        independent states that have emerged on the territory of the \n        former Yugoslavia, including Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n            (9) Subsequent to the adoption of Resolution 727 and Bosnia \n        and Herzegovina's independence referendum, the seige of \n        Sarajevo began and fighting spread to other areas of Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina.\n            (10) The Government of Serbia intervened directly in the \n        fighting by providing significant military, financial, and \n        political support and direction to Serbian-allied irregular \n        forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n            (11) In statements dated May 1 and May 12, 1992, the \n        Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe declared that \n        the Government of Serbia and the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav \n        National Army were committing aggression against the Government \n        of Bosnia and Herzegovina and assigned to them prime \n        responsibility for the escalation of bloodshed and destruction.\n            (12) On May 30, 1992, the United Nations Security Council \n        adopted Resolution 757, which condemned the Government of \n        Serbia for its continued failure to respect the territorial \n        integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n            (13) Serbian-allied irregular forces have, over the last \n        year, occupied approximately 70 percent of the territory of \n        Bosnia and Herzegovina, committed gross violations of human \n        rights in the areas they have occupied, and established a \n        secessionist government committed to eventual unification with \n        Serbia.\n            (14) The military and other support and direction provided \n        to Serbian-allied irregular forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina \n        constitutes an armed attack on the Government of Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina by the Government of Serbia within the meaning of \n        Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.\n            (15) Under Article 51, the Government of Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina, as a member of the United Nations, has an inherent \n        right of individual or collective self-defense against the \n        armed attack from the Government of Serbia until the United \n        Nations Security Council has taken measures necessary to \n        maintain international peace and security.\n            (16) The measures taken by the United Nations Security \n        Council in response to the armed attack on Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina have not been adequate to maintain international \n        peace and security.\n            (17) Bosnia and Herzegovina has been unable successfully to \n        resist the armed attack from Serbia because it lacks the means \n        to counter heavy weaponry that Serbia obtained from the \n        Yugoslav National Army upon the dissolution of Yugoslavia, and \n        because the mandatory international arms embargo has prevented \n        Bosnia and Herzegovina from obtaining from other countries the \n        means to counter such heavy weaponry.\n            (18) On December 18, 1992, with the affirmative vote of the \n        United States, the United Nations General Assembly adopted \n        Resolution 47/121, which urged the United Nations Security \n        Council to exempt Bosnia and Herzegovina from the mandatory \n        arms embargo imposed by Resolution 713.\n            (19) In the absence of adequate measures to maintain \n        international peace and security, continued application to the \n        Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the mandatory \n        international arms embargo imposed by the United Nations \n        Security Council prior to the armed attack on Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina undermines that government's right of individual or \n        collective self-defense and therefore contravenes Article 51 of \n        the United Nations Charter.\n            (20) Bosnia and Herzegovina's right of self-defense under \n        Article 51 of the United Nations Charter includes the right to \n        ask for military assistance from other countries and to receive \n        such assistance if offered.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES ARMS EMBARGO OF THE GOVERNMENT OF BOSNIA AND \n              HERZEGOVINA.\n\n    (a) Termination.--The President shall terminate the United States \narms embargo of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina upon receipt \nfrom that government of a request for assistance in exercising its \nright of self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.\n    (b) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``United States \narms embargo of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina'' means the \napplication to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of--\n            (1) the policy adopted July 10, 1991, and published in the \n        Federal Register of July 19, 1991 (58 Fed. Reg. 33322) under \n        the heading ``Suspension of Munitions Export Licenses to \n        Yugoslavia''; and\n            (2) any similar policy being applied by the United States \n        Government as of the date of receipt of the request described \n        in subsection (a) pursuant to which approval is routinely \n        denied for transfers of defense articles and defense services \n        to the former Yugoslavia.\n\nSEC. 4. UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE FOR BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n    (a) Policy.--The President should provide appropriate military \nassistance to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina upon receipt \nfrom that government of a request for assistance in exercising its \nright of self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.\n    (b) Authorization of Military Assistance.--\n            (1) Drawdown authority.--If the Government of Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina requests United States assistance in exercising its \n        right of self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations \n        Charter, the President is authorized to direct the drawdown of \n        defense articles from the stocks of the Department of Defense, \n        defense services of the Department of Defense, and military \n        education and training in order to provide assistance to the \n        Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
