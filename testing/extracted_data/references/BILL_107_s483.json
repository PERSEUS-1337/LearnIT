FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) United States airline traffic is increasing. The number \n        of domestic passengers carried by United States air carriers \n        has nearly tripled since 1978, to over 660 million annually. \n        The number is expected to grow to more than 1 billion by 2010. \n        The number of domestic flights has been steadily increasing as \n        well.\n            (2) The Inspector General of the Department of \n        Transporation has found that with this growth in traffic have \n        come increases in delays, cancellations, and customer \n        dissatisfaction with air carrier service.\n                    (A) The Federal Aviation Administration has \n                reported that, between 1995 and 2000, delays increased \n                90 percent and cancellations increased 104 percent. In \n                2000, over 1 in 4 flights were delayed, canceled, or \n                diverted, affecting approximately 163 million \n                passengers.\n                    (B) At the 30 largest United States airports, the \n                number of flights with taxi-out times of 1 hour or more \n                increased 165 percent between 1995 and 2000. The number \n                of flights with taxi-out times of 4 hours or more \n                increased 341 percent during the same period.\n                    (C) Certain flights, particularly those scheduled \n                during peak periods at the nation's busiest airports, \n                are subject to chronic delays. In December, 2000, 626 \n                regularly-scheduled flights arrived late 70 percent of \n                the time or more, as reported by the Department of \n                Transportation.\n                    (D) Consumer complaints filed with the Department \n                of Transportation about airline travel have nearly \n                quadrupled since 1995. The Department of Transportation \n                Inspector General has estimated that air carriers \n                receive between 100 and 400 complaints for every \n                complaint filed with the Department of Transportation.\n            (3) At the same time as the number of complaints about \n        airline travel has increased, the resources devoted to \n        Department of Transportation handling of such complaints have \n        declined sharply. The Department of Transportation Inspector \n        General has reported that the staffing of the Department of \n        Transportation office responsible for handling airline customer \n        service complaints declined from 40 in 1985 to just 17 in 2000.\n            (4) In June, 1999, the Air Transport Association and its \n        member airlines agreed to an Airline Customer Service \n        Commitment designed to address mounting consumer \n        dissatisfaction and improve customer service in the industry.\n            (5) The Department of Transportation Inspector General has \n        reviewed the airlines' implementation of the Airline Customer \n        Service Commitment. The Inspector General found that:\n                    (A) The Airline Customer Service Commitment has \n                prompted air carriers to address consumer concerns in \n                many areas, resulting in positive changes in how air \n                travelers are treated.\n                    (B) Despite this progress, there continue to be \n                significant shortfalls in reliable and timely \n                communication with passengers about flight delays and \n                cancellations. Reports to passengers about flight \n                status are frequently untimely, incomplete, or \n                unreliable.\n                    (C) Air carriers need to do more, in the areas \n                under their control, to reduce over-scheduling, the \n                number of chronically-late or canceled flights, and the \n                amount of checked baggage that does not show up with \n                the passenger upon arrival.\n                    (D) A number of further steps could be taken to \n                improve the effectiveness and enforceability of the \n                Airline Customer Service Commitment and to improve the \n                consumer protections available to commercial air \n                passengers.\n\nSEC. 3.
