FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The demand for child pornography harms children because \n        it drives production, which involves severe and often \n        irreparable child sexual abuse and exploitation.\n            (2) The harms caused by child pornography are more \n        extensive than the harms caused by child sex abuse alone \n        because child pornography is a permanent record of the abuse of \n        the depicted child, and the harm to the child is exacerbated by \n        its circulation. Every viewing of child pornography is a \n        repetition of the victim's original childhood sexual abuse.\n            (3) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result \n        of knowing that a large, indeterminate number of individuals \n        have viewed and will in the future view images of their \n        childhood sexual abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason \n        that child pornography is outlawed.\n            (4) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who \n        reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a victim's \n        childhood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining and \n        aggravating the harms to that individual victim. Multiple \n        actors independently commit intentional crimes that combine to \n        produce an indivisible injury to a victim.\n            (5) It is the intent of Congress that victims of child \n        pornography be fully compensated for all the harms resulting \n        from each and every perpetrator who contributes to their \n        anguish.\n            (6) Congress intends to adopt and hereby adopts an \n        aggregate causation standard to address the unique crime of \n        child pornography and the unique harms caused by child \n        pornography.\n            (7) Victims should not be limited to receiving restitution \n        from defendants only for losses caused by each defendant's own \n        offense of conviction. Courts must apply a less restrictive \n        aggregate causation standard in child pornography cases, while \n        also recognizing appropriate constitutional limits and \n        protections for defendants.\n\nSEC. 3. MANDATORY RESTITUTION.\n\n    Section 2259 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (b), by striking paragraph (3) and \n        inserting the following:\n            ``(3) Definition.--(A) For purposes of this subsection, the \n        term `full amount of the victim's losses' includes any costs \n        incurred by the victim for--\n                    ``(i) lifetime medical services relating to \n                physical, psychiatric, or psychological care;\n                    ``(ii) lifetime physical and occupational therapy \n                or rehabilitation;\n                    ``(iii) necessary transportation, temporary \n                housing, and child care expenses;\n                    ``(iv) lifetime lost income; and\n                    ``(v) attorneys' fees, as well as other costs \n                incurred.\n            ``(B) For purposes of this subsection, the term `full \n        amount of the victim's losses' also includes any other losses \n        suffered by the victim, in addition to the costs listed in \n        subparagraph (A), if those losses are a proximate result of the \n        offense.\n            ``(C) For purposes of this subsection, the term `full \n        amount of the victim's losses' also includes any losses \n        suffered by the victim from any sexual act or sexual conduct \n        (as those terms are defined in section 2246) in preparation for \n        or during the production of child pornography depicting the \n        victim involved in the offense.'';\n            (2) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d);\n            (3) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n    ``(c) Determining Restitution.--\n            ``(1) Harmed by one defendant.--If the victim was harmed as \n        a result of the commission of an offense under section 2251, \n        2251A, 2252, 2252A, or 2260 by 1 defendant, the court shall \n        determine the full amount of the victim's losses caused by the \n        defendant and enter an order of restitution for an amount that \n        is not less than the full amount of the victim's losses.\n            ``(2) Harmed by more than one defendant.--If the victim was \n        harmed as a result of offenses under section 2251, 2251A, 2252, \n        2252A, or 2260 by more than 1 person, regardless of whether the \n        persons have been charged, prosecuted, or convicted in any \n        Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction within the \n        United States, the court shall determine the full amount of the \n        victim's losses caused by all such persons, or reasonably \n        expected to be caused by such persons, and enter an order of \n        restitution against the defendant in favor of the victim for--\n                    ``(A) the full amount of the victim's losses; or\n                    ``(B) an amount that is not more than the amount \n                described in subparagraph (A) and not less than--\n                            ``(i) $250,000 for any offense or offenses \n                        under section 2251(a), 2251(b), 2251(c), 2251A, \n                        2252A(g), or 2260(a);\n                            ``(ii) $150,000 for any offense or offenses \n                        under section 2251(d), 2252(a)(1), 2252(a)(2), \n                        2252(a)(3), 2252A(a)(1), 2252A(a)(2), \n                        2252A(a)(3), 2252A(a)(4), 2252A(a)(6), \n                        2252A(a)(7), or 2260(b); or\n                            ``(iii) $25,000 for any offense or offenses \n                        under section 2252(a)(4) or 2252A(a)(5).\n            ``(3) Maximum amount of restitution.--No order of \n        restitution issued under this section may exceed the full \n        amount of the victim's losses.\n            ``(4) Joint and several liability.--Each defendant against \n        whom an order of restitution is issued under paragraph (2)(A) \n        shall be jointly and severally liable to the victim with all \n        other defendants against whom an order of restitution is issued \n        under paragraph (2)(A) in favor of such victim.\n            ``(5) Contribution.--Each defendant who is ordered to pay \n        restitution under paragraph (2)(A), and has made full payment \n        to the victim equal to or exceeding the statutory minimum \n        amount described in paragraph (2)(B), may recover contribution \n        from any defendant who is also ordered to pay restitution under \n        paragraph (2)(A). Such claims shall be brought in accordance \n        with this section and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In \n        resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate payments \n        among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court \n        determines are appropriate so long as no payments to victims \n        are reduced or delayed. No action for contribution may be \n        commenced more than 5 years after the date on which the \n        defendant seeking contribution was ordered to pay restitution \n        under this section.'';\n            (4) in subsection (d), as redesignated, by striking ``a \n        commission of a crime under this chapter,'' and inserting ``or \n        by the commission of (i) an offense under this chapter or (ii) \n        a series of offenses under this chapter committed by the \n        defendant and other persons causing aggregated losses,''; and\n            (5) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(e) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \nthe Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act \nof 2014, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report on the \nprogress, if any, of the Department of Justice in obtaining restitution \nfor victims of any offense under section 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, or \n2260.''."
