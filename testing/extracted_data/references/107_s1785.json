FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The vigilance of the United States Armed Forces, past \n        and present, has been instrumental to the preservation of the \n        freedom, security, and prosperity that the United States \n        enjoys.\n            (2) The vigilance and capabilities of the United States \n        Armed Forces depend on the dedicated service of its members, \n        their families, and the civilian employees of the Department of \n        Defense and United States Coast Guard.\n            (3) The role of the United States as a world leader, and \n        the global scope that such role imparts to our Nation's \n        interests, requires a military force that is well-trained, \n        well-equipped, and appropriately sized.\n            (4) For such a force to be fielded, the young men and women \n        of the United States must possess a commitment to military \n        service that is sufficient to achieve the levels of recruitment \n        and retention of enlisted, officer, and civilian personnel \n        necessary for sustaining the strength, vitality, and character \n        of the United States Armed Forces.\n            (5) To foster and sustain such a commitment, it is vital \n        for youth in the United States to understand that the service \n        provided by members of the United States Armed Forces is an \n        honorable legacy that has protected the freedoms that are \n        enjoyed by United States citizens and citizens of many other \n        nations.\n            (6) The Federal Government has a responsibility to raise \n        awareness of and respect for this aspect of our national \n        heritage and to encourage citizens to dedicate themselves to \n        the values and principles for which Americans have served and \n        sacrificed throughout our history.\n            (7) Service in the United States Armed Forces entails \n        special sacrifices and hazards.\n            (8) The special duties required of those who serve in the \n        United States Armed Forces demand special sacrifices from the \n        families of service members, and the support of the families is \n        an essential force multiplier that enhances the effectiveness \n        and capabilities of the United States Armed Forces.\n            (9) The Nation's observance of events recognizing the \n        contributions of the Armed Forces is a tangible and highly \n        effective way of sustaining morale and improving quality of \n        life for the military family.\n            (10) Senate Resolution 33 (106th Congress, 1st session), a \n        resolution entitled ``Senate Resolution Designating May 1999 as \n        `National Military Appreciation Month''', agreed to on April \n        30, 1999, called on the people of the United States, in a \n        symbolic act of unity, to observe a National Military \n        Appreciation Month in May 1999, to honor the service men and \n        women of the United States past and present, including those \n        who have died in the pursuit of freedom and peace.\n            (11) It is important for the relevance of the history and \n        activities of the United States Armed Forces to be emphasized \n        to current and future citizens of the United States through an \n        annual National Military Appreciation Month that includes \n        associated local and national observances and activities.\n\n SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF WHITE HOUSE COMMISSION ON NATIONAL MILITARY \n              APPRECIATION MONTH.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the President should establish a \ncommission known as the ``White House Commission on National Military \nAppreciation Month'' to make recommendations to the President on the \nproclamation of ``National Military Appreciation Month'' to be \ncelebrated in the month of May each year.\n\n SEC. 4.
