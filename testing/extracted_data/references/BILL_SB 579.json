Time off pursuant to this subparagraph shall not exceed eight hours in any calendar month of the year.\n(B) To address a child care provider or school emergency, if the employee gives notice to the employer.\n(2) If more than one parent of a child is employed by the same employer at the same worksite, the entitlement under paragraph (1) of a planned absence as to that child applies, at any one time, only to the parent who first gives notice to the employer, such that another parent may take a planned absence simultaneously as to that same child under the conditions described in paragraph (1) only if he or she obtains the employer\u2019s approval for the requested time off.\n(b) (1) The employee shall utilize existing vacation, personal leave, or compensatory time off for purposes of the planned absence authorized by this section, unless otherwise provided by a collective bargaining agreement entered into before January 1, 1995, and in effect on that date. An employee also may utilize time off without pay for this purpose, to the extent made available by his or her employer. The entitlement of any employee under this section shall not be diminished by any collective bargaining agreement term or condition that is agreed to on or after January 1, 1995.\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in the event that all permanent, full-time employees of an employer are accorded vacation during the same period of time in the calendar year, an employee of that employer may not utilize that accrued vacation benefit at any other time for purposes of the planned absence authorized by this section.\n(c) The employee, if requested by the employer, shall provide documentation from the school or licensed child care provider as proof that he or she engaged in child-related activities permitted in subdivision (a) on a specific date and at a particular time.

Any employer who willfully refuses to rehire, promote, or otherwise restore an employee or former employee who has been determined to be eligible for rehiring or promotion by a grievance procedure, arbitration, or hearing authorized by law shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount equal to three times the amount of the employee\u2019s lost wages and work benefits.\n(e) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n(1) \u201cParent\u201d means a parent, guardian, stepparent, foster parent, or grandparent of, or a person who stands in loco parentis to, a child.\n(2) \u201cChild care provider or school emergency\u201d means that an employee\u2019s child cannot remain in a school or with a child care provider due to one of the following:\n(A) The school or child care provider has requested that the child be picked up, or has an attendance policy, excluding planned holidays, that prohibits the child from attending or requires the child to be picked up from the school or child care provider.\n(B) Behavioral or discipline problems.\n(C) Closure or unexpected unavailability of the school or child care provider, excluding planned holidays.\n(D) A natural disaster, including, but not limited to, fire, earthquake, or flood.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 233 of the Labor Code is amended to read:\n233.\n(a) Any employer who provides sick leave for employees shall permit an employee to use in any calendar year the employee\u2019s accrued and available sick leave entitlement, in an amount not less than the sick leave that would be accrued during six months at the employee\u2019s then current rate of entitlement, for the reasons specified in subdivision (a) of Section 246.5.
