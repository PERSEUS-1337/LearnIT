FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The conceptual framework of the budget, which is \n        central to Federal planning and policy, has not been \n        comprehensively reviewed for over 30 years.\n            (2) Over those years, there has been a significant change \n        in the way that policy makers and economists view the role of \n        government in the economy.\n            (3) In addition, major changes have occurred in the scope \n        of Federal activity, in the economy, in the use of the budget \n        for fiscal policy purposes, and in information technology.\n            (4) Because the Federal budget is inherently complex, \n        budget concepts may need to be modified to increase public \n        understanding of the operation of the Federal Government and \n        its impact on the economy.\n            (5) Federal budget concepts should be reviewed and, if \n        appropriate, revised in light of the best current thinking in \n        accounting, budgeting, and economics.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the National \nCommission on Budget Concepts to review the current structure, \nconcepts, classifications, and bases of accounting of the Federal \nbudget and to report recommendations to the President and Congress for \nmodifications that would enhance the usefulness of the budget for \npublic policy and financial planning.\n\nSEC. 3.
