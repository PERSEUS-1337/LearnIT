FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The intent of the Employee Retirement Income Security \n        Act of 1974 to protect the pension and welfare benefits of \n        workers is frustrated by the practice of mislabeling employees \n        to improperly exclude them from employee benefit plans. \n        Employees are wrongly denied benefits when they are mislabeled \n        as temporary employees, part-time employees, leased employees, \n        agency employees, staffing firm employees, and contractors. If \n        their true employment status were recognized, mislabeled \n        employees would be eligible to participate in employee benefit \n        plans because such plans are offered to other employees \n        performing the same or substantially the same work and working \n        for the same employer.\n            (2) Mislabeled employees are often paid through staffing, \n        temporary, employee leasing, or other similar firms to give the \n        appearance that the employees do not work for their worksite \n        employer. Employment contracts and reports to government \n        agencies also are used to give the erroneous impression that \n        mislabeled employees work for staffing, temporary, employee \n        leasing, or other similar firms, when the facts of the work \n        arrangement do not meet the common law standard for determining \n        the employment relationship. Employees are also mislabeled as \n        contractors and paid from non-payroll accounts to give the \n        appearance that they are not employees of their worksite \n        employer. These practices violate the Employee Retirement \n        Income Security Act of 1974.\n            (3) Employers are amending their benefit plans to add \n        provisions that exclude mislabeled employees from participation \n        in the plan even in the event that such employees are \n        determined to be common law employees and otherwise eligible to \n        participate in the plan. These plan provisions violate the \n        Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n            (4) As a condition of employment or continued employment, \n        mislabeled employees are often required to sign documents that \n        purport to waive their right to participate in employee benefit \n        plans. Such documents inaccurately claim to limit the authority \n        of the courts and applicable Federal agencies to correct the \n        mislabeling of employees and to enforce the terms of plans \n        providing for their participation. This practice violates the \n        Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to clarify applicable \nprovisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to \nensure that employees are not improperly excluded from participation in \nemployee benefit plans as a result of mislabeling of their employment \nstatus.\n\nSEC. 3. ADDITIONAL STANDARDS RELATING TO MINIMUM PARTICIPATION \n              REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Required Inclusion of Service.--Section 202(a)(3) of the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1052(a)(3)) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n    ``(E) For purposes of this section, in determining `years of \nservice' and `hours of service', service shall include all service for \nthe employer as an employee under the common law, irrespective of \nwhether the worker--\n            ``(i) is paid through a staffing firm, temporary help firm, \n        payroll agency, employment agency, or other such similar \n        arrangement,\n            ``(ii) is paid directly by the employer under an \n        arrangement purporting to characterize an employee under the \n        common law as other than an employee, or\n            ``(iii) is paid from an account not designated as a payroll \n        account.''\n    (b) Exclusion Precluded When Related to Certain Purported \nCategorizations.--Section 202 of such Act (29 U.S.C. 1052) is amended \nfurther by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(c)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a pension plan shall be treated \nas failing to meet the requirements of this section if any individual \nwho--\n            ``(A) is an employee under the common law, and\n            ``(B) performs the same work (or substantially the same \n        work) for the employer as other employees who generally are not \n        excluded from participation in the plan,\nis excluded from participation in the plan, irrespective of the \nplacement of such employee in any category of workers (such as \ntemporary employees, part-time employees, leased employees, agency \nemployees, staffing firm employees, contractors, or any similar \ncategory) which may be specified under the plan as ineligible for \nparticipation.\n    ``(2) Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed to preclude the \nexclusion from participation in a pension plan of individuals who in \nfact do not meet a minimum service period or minimum age which is \nrequired under the terms of the plan and which is otherwise in \nconformity with the requirements of this section.''\n\nSEC. 4.

OBJECTIVE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA IN PLAN INSTRUMENTS.\n\n    Section 402 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \n(29 U.S.C. 1102) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsubsection:\n    ``(c)(1) The written instrument pursuant to which an employee \nbenefit plan is maintained shall set forth eligibility criteria which--\n            ``(A) include and exclude employees on a uniform basis;\n            ``(B) are based on reasonable job classifications; and\n            ``(C) are based on objective criteria stated in the \n        instrument itself for the inclusion or exclusion (other than \n        the mere listing of an employee as included or excluded).\n    ``(2) No plan instrument may permit an employer or plan sponsor to \nexclude an employee under the common law from participation \nirrespective of the placement of such employee in any category of \nworkers (such as temporary employees, leased employees, agency \nemployees, staffing firm employees, contractors, or any similar \ncategory) if the employee--\n            ``(A) is an employee of the employer under the common law,\n            ``(B) performs the same work (or substantially the same \n        work) for the employer as other employees who generally are not \n        excluded from participation in the plan, and\n            ``(C) meets a minimum service period or minimum age which \n        is required under the terms of the plan.''\n\nSEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    Section 502(a)(3)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(3)(B)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``or'' in clause (i) and inserting a comma,\n            (2) by striking the semicolon at the end of clause (ii) and \n        inserting ``, or'', and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following: ``(iii) to provide \n        relief to employees who have been miscategorized in violation \n        of sections 202 and 402;''.\n\nSEC. 7.
