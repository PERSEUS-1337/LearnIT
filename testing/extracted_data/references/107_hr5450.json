    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Beneficiary Access to Care Act of \n2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) payments for drugs and biologicals under the Medicare \n        outpatient hospital prospective payment system should be based \n        on all of the costs of delivering outpatient pharmacy therapy \n        (involving the drug or biological) in the outpatient hospital \n        setting, including (but not limited to) acquisition costs, and \n        the costs associated with storage, handling, processing, \n        quality control, disposal, and pharmacy overhead should be \n        fully accounted for under such system;\n            (2) the payment rates proposed in Centers for Medicare & \n        Medicaid Services, Medicare Program; Changes to the Hospital \n        Outpatient Prospective Payment System and Calendar Year 2003 \n        Payment Rates; and Changes to Payment Suspension for Unified \n        Cost Report; Proposed Rule, (67 Federal Register 52092 et seq. \n        (August 9, 2002)) do not fully reflect such costs;\n            (3) the methodology implied by the statute establishing \n        such system and used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n        Services to estimate acquisition costs is flawed because it \n        derives such estimates from what hospitals charged for \n        individual products on patient bills without appropriate \n        adjustment for hospital charging practices;\n            (4) this methodology substantially underestimates the \n        acquisition costs of newer, more expensive drugs and \n        biologicals;\n            (5) the methodology used to develop such rates produces \n        erratic and unreliable results, with--\n                    (A) the payment rate for one product increasing 700 \n                percent and the rates for many others exceeding 100 \n                percent of their average wholesale price (AWP), and\n                    (B) the payment rates for nine drugs and \n                biologicals used in cancer therapy experiencing rate \n                reductions of between 50 and 90 percent;\n            (6) beneficiary access may be jeopardized in the outpatient \n        hospital setting for those drugs and biologicals for which \n        program payments are substantially below the costs of \n        delivering them; and\n            (7) the payment rates proposed for most drugs and \n        biologicals under such system for calendar year 2003 are less \n        than the payment rates established for them in 2002, with the \n        payment reductions exceeding 30 percent in most cases.\n\nSEC. 3. DURATION OF PERIOD FOR WHICH TRANSITIONAL, PASS-THROUGH \n              PAYMENTS ARE MADE FOR DRUGS AND BIOLOGICALS.\n\n    (a) Continuation if Data Collected in 2 to 3 Year Period Are \nInadequate.--Section 1833(t)(6) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395l(t)(6)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (C)(i), by striking ``The payment'' and \n        inserting ``Except as provided in subparagraph (F), the \n        payment'';
