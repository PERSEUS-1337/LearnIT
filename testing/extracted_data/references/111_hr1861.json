FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Acts of violence against journalists and media \n        personnel continue to rise in frequency, with very few of the \n        attacks resulting in prosecution.\n            (2) According to the 2008 Annual Report by the Committee to \n        Protect Journalists, in 2008 at least 41 journalists were \n        killed in connection with their work, and 125 were imprisoned.\n            (3) Reflecting the rise in influence of Internet reporting, \n        an increasing number of online editors, bloggers, and web-based \n        reporters are being imprisoned and websites are being closed \n        because of official censorship.\n            (4) The United States and the international community agree \n        that the safety and independence of journalists and the media \n        are a matter of pressing international concern. On December 10, \n        1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal \n        Declaration of Human Rights. Article 19 of the Universal \n        Declaration of Human Rights states that ``Everyone has the \n        right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes \n        freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, \n        receive and impart information and ideas through any media and \n        regardless of frontiers.''.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) highlight and promote the work and accomplishments of \n        journalists and media organizations that promote freedom of \n        opinion and expression worldwide;\n            (2) draw attention to the conditions in countries in which \n        journalists are killed, imprisoned, kidnapped, threatened, or \n        censored;\n            (3) offer protection for these individuals and media \n        organizations by identifying to the international community \n        those countries where journalists are at the highest risk; and\n            (4) emphasize the significance of including freedom of the \n        press as enshrined in article 19 of the Universal Declaration \n        of Human Rights as a factor in United States foreign policy.\n\nSEC. 3.
