IMPROVING THE ``NEXUS'' AND ``FAST'' REGISTERED TRAVELER \n              PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Section 7208(k) of the Intelligence Reform and \n        Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required that the Secretary of \n        Homeland Security implement a registered traveler program to \n        expedite the processing of registered travelers who enter and \n        exit the United States. In order to include as many \n        participants as possible, the Congress mandated that the \n        Secretary of Homeland Security create a program that--\n                    (A) minimizes the cost of enrollment;\n                    (B) makes the program enrollment convenient and \n                easily accessible; and\n                    (C) provides applicants with clear and consistent \n                eligibility requirements.\n            (2) According to the Department of State Bureau of Consular \n        Affairs, 400,000 individuals made 48 percent of cross-border \n        trips between the United States and Canada in 2004. These are \n        the frequent travelers that must be encouraged to enroll in \n        expedited traveler programs.\n            (3) Barriers to enrollment in the Free and Secure Trade \n        program (``FAST'' or ``FAST'' program) and the ``NEXUS'' \n        dedicated commuter lane system (``NEXUS'' or ``NEXUS program'') \n        include inadequate numbers and locations of enrollment centers, \n        a confusing application process, and high enrollment fees for \n        non-commercial users.\n            (4) Consistent with the report of the National Commission \n        on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, it is imperative \n        that the Department of Homeland Security expand the NEXUS and \n        FAST programs.\n    (b) Merging Requirements of NEXUS and FAST.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n        merge the procedures for the programs described in subsection \n        (l) into a single procedure, with common eligibility and \n        security screening requirements, enrollment processes, and \n        sanctions regimes.\n            (2) Specific requirements.--In carrying out paragraph (1), \n        the Secretary shall ensure that--\n                    (A) the procedures for the programs known as \n                ``NEXUS Highway'', ``NEXUS Marine'', and ``NEXUS Air'' \n                are integrated into such single procedure; and\n                    (B) the processes relating to eligibility and \n                security screening are identical to those for the FAST \n                program described in subsection (l)(2) on the date of \n                the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Integrating NEXUS and FAST Information Systems.--The Secretary \nof Homeland Security shall integrate all databases and information \nsystems for the programs described in subsection (l) in a manner that \nwill permit any identification card issued to a participant to operate \nin all locations where a program described in such subsection is \noperating.\n    (d) Creation of NEXUS Convertible Lanes.--In order to expand the \nNEXUS program described in subsection (l)(2) to major northern border \ncrossings, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the \nCanadian government, shall equip the following northern border \ncrossings with NEXUS technology:\n            (1) Pembina, North Dakota;\n            (2) Sault Ste.

The Secretary shall work with State and local \nauthorities in determining the locations of mobile enrollment centers.\n    (g) On-Line Application Process.--The Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity shall design an on-line application process for the programs \ndescribed in subsection (l).
