FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) lead poisoning remains a serious environmental risk, \n        especially to the health of young children;\n            (2) childhood lead poisoning can cause reductions in IQ, \n        attention span, reading, and learning disabilities, and other \n        growth and behavior problems;\n            (3) children under the age of 6 are at the greatest risk \n        because of the sensitivity of their developing brains and \n        nervous systems;\n            (4) poor children and minority children are at \n        substantially higher risk of lead poisoning;\n            (5) it is estimated that more than 500,000 children \n        enrolled in Medicaid have harmful levels of lead in their \n        blood;\n            (6) children enrolled in Medicaid represent 60 percent of \n        the 890,000 children in the United States with elevated blood \n        lead levels;\n            (7) although the Health Care Financing Administration has \n        required mandatory blood lead screenings for children enrolled \n        in Medicaid who are not less than 1 nor more than 5 years of \n        age, approximately two-thirds of children enrolled in Medicaid \n        have not been screened or treated;\n            (8) the Health Care Financing Administration mandatory \n        screening policy has not been effective, or sufficient, to \n        properly identify and screen children enrolled in Medicaid who \n        are at risk;\n            (9) uniform lead screening requirements do not exist for \n        children not enrolled in Medicaid; and\n            (10) adequate treatment services are not uniformly \n        available for children with elevated blood lead levels.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create a lead screening \nsafety net that will, through Medicaid and other entitlement programs, \nensure that low-income children at the highest risk of lead poisoning \nreceive blood lead screenings and appropriate followup care.\n\nSEC. 3. INCREASED LEAD POISONING SCREENINGS AND TREATMENTS UNDER THE \n              MEDICAID PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Penalty for Insufficient Increases in Lead Poisoning \nScreenings.--\n            (1) Performance improvement.--Section 1903 of the Social \n        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b) is amended by adding at the end \n        the following:\n    ``(x) Performance Improvement.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 1905(b), \n        beginning with fiscal year 2000 and for each fiscal year \n        thereafter, with respect to any State that fails to meet \n        minimum blood lead screening rates stated in paragraph (2), the \n        Federal medical assistance percentage determined under \nsection 1905(b) for the State for the fiscal year shall be reduced by 1 \npercentage point, but only with respect to--\n                    ``(A) items and services furnished under a State \n                plan under this title during that fiscal year;\n                    ``(B) payments made on a capitation or other risk-\n                basis under a State plan under this title for coverage \n                occurring during that fiscal year;
