FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) full, safe decommissioning of nuclear power plants is a \n        compelling Federal interest, in that--\n                    (A) the public health and safety and the protection \n                of the environment can be guaranteed only if nuclear \n                power plants are adequately decommissioned at the end \n                of their useful lives; and\n                    (B) decommissioning obligations cannot be avoided, \n                abandoned, or mitigated, as a matter of public health \n                and safety;\n            (2) electric utilities that own nuclear power plants must \n        be able to collect adequate revenues to ensure that the \n        utilities can satisfy the obligation to fully decommission \n        nuclear power plants in accordance with standards established \n        by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission;\n            (3) the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \n        ensure that utilities are able to collect adequate funds so \n        that they can satisfy the decommissioning obligation is limited \n        by the fact that the Commission does not directly establish \n        rates for electric services;\n            (4) many nuclear decommissioning trust funds are not \n        adequate to meet decommissioning obligations, and the current \n        electric rates of collection are not adequate to ensure that \n        there will be adequate funds at the time of decommissioning.\n            (5) potential restructuring of the electric utility \n        industry will exacerbate the problem, because competitive \n        pressure is expected to be placed on current rates, thereby \n        threatening the ability of utility entities to recover funds \n        for decommissioning in electric rates; and\n            (6) there is a Federal interest in establishing a national \n        policy to ensure that electric utilities that own nuclear power \n        plants can recover funds sufficient to satisfy the \n        decommissioning obligation.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure that electric utilities that own commercial \n        nuclear electric generating plants will be able to satisfy the \n        obligation to decommission the plants, as established by the \n        Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and\n            (2) to provide ratemaking bodies, including the Federal \n        Energy Regulatory Commission, with sufficient authority to \n        provide for recovery of funds for decommissioning.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Decommission.--The term ``decommission'' has the \n        meaning given the term in section 50.2 of title 10, Code of \n        Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation).\n            (2) Decommissioning obligation.--The term ``decommissioning \n        obligation'' means the obligation to pay costs associated with \n        the measures necessary to ensure the continued protection of \n        the public from the dangers of any residual radioactivity or \n        other hazards present at a facility when a nuclear unit is \n        decommissioned.\n            (3) Nuclear decommissioning trust fund.--The term ``nuclear \n        decommissioning trust fund'' has the meaning given the term \n        ``external sinking fund'' in section 50.75(e)(1)(ii) of title \n        10, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation).\n            (4) State commission.--The term ``State commission'' has \n        the meaning given the term in section 3 of the Federal Power \n        Act (16 U.S.C. 796).\n\nSEC. 4.
