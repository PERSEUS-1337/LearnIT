FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Police cannot protect, and are not legally liable for \n        failing to protect, individual citizens, as evidenced by the \n        following:\n                    (A) The courts have consistently ruled that the \n                police do not have an obligation to protect \n                individuals, only the public in general. For example, \n                in Warren v. District of Columbia Metropolitan Police \n                Department, 444 A.2d 1 (D.C. App. 1981), the court \n                stated: ``[C]ourts have without exception concluded \n                that when a municipality or other governmental entity \n                undertakes to furnish police services, it assumes a \n                duty only to the public at large and not to individual \n                members of the community.''.\n                    (B) Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith told \n                Florida legislators that police responded to only \n                200,000 of 700,000 calls for help to Dade County \n                authorities.\n                    (C) The United States Department of Justice found \n                that, in 1989, there were 168,881 crimes of violence \n                for which police had not responded within 1 hour.\n                    (D) Currently, there are about 150,000 police \n                officers on duty at any one time.\n            (2) Citizens frequently must use firearms to defend \n        themselves, as evidenced by the following:\n                    (A) Every year, more than 2,400,000 people in the \n                United States use a gun to defend themselves against \n                criminals--or more than 6,500 people a day. This means \n                that, each year, firearms are used 60 times more often \n                to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take \n                lives.\n                    (B) Of the 2,400,000 self-defense cases, more than \n                192,000 are by women defending themselves against \n                sexual abuse.\n                    (C) Of the 2,400,000 times citizens use their guns \n                to defend themselves every year, 92 percent merely \n                brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off \n                their attackers. Less than 8 percent of the time, does \n                a citizen kill or wound his or her attacker.\n            (3) Law-abiding citizens, seeking only to provide for their \n        families' defense, are routinely prosecuted for brandishing or \n        using a firearm in self- defense. For example:\n                    (A) In 1986, Don Bennett of Oak Park, Illinois, was \n                shot at by 2 men who had just stolen $1,200 in cash and \n                jewelry from his suburban Chicago service station. The \n                police arrested Bennett for violating Oak Park's \n                handgun ban. The police never caught the actual \n                criminals.\n                    (B) Ronald Biggs, a resident of Goldsboro, North \n                Carolina, was arrested for shooting an intruder in \n                1990. Four men broke into Biggs' residence one night, \n                ransacked the home and then assaulted him with a \n                baseball bat. When Biggs attempted to escape through \n                the back door, the group chased him and Biggs turned \n                and shot one of the assailants in the stomach. Biggs \n                was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly \n                weapon--a felony. His assailants were charged with \n                misdemeanors.\n                    (C) Don Campbell of Port Huron, Michigan, was \n                arrested, jailed, and criminally charged after he shot \n                a criminal assailant in 1991. The thief had broken into \n                Campbell's store and attacked him. The prosecutor plea-\n                bargained with the assailant and planned to use him to \n                testify against Campbell for felonious use of a \n                firearm. Only after intense community pressure did the \n                prosecutor finally drop the charges.\n            (4) The courts have granted immunity from prosecution to \n        police officers who use firearms in the line of duty. \n        Similarly, law-abiding citizens who use firearms to protect \n        themselves, their families, and their homes against violent \n        felons should not be subject to lawsuits by the violent felons \n        who sought to victimize them.\n\nSEC. 3. RIGHT TO OBTAIN FIREARMS FOR SECURITY, AND TO USE FIREARMS IN \n              DEFENSE OF SELF, FAMILY, OR HOME; ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    (a) Reaffirmation of Right.--A person not prohibited from receiving \na firearm by Public Law 90-351 shall have the right to obtain firearms \nfor security, and to use firearms--\n                    (A) in defense of self or family against a \n                reasonably perceived threat of imminent and unlawful \n                infliction of serious bodily injury.\n                    (B) in defense of self or family in the course of \n                the commission by another person of a violent felony \n                against the person or a member of the person's family; \n                and\n                    (C) in defense of the person's home in the course \n                of the commission of a felony by another person.\n    (b) Firearm Defined.--As used in subsection (a), the term \n``firearm'' means--\n            (1) a shotgun (as defined in section 921(a)(5) of title 18, \n        United States Code);\n            (2) a rifle (as defined in section 921(a)(7) of title 18, \n        United States Code); or\n            (3) a handgun (as defined in section 10 of Public Law 99-\n        408).\n    (c) Enforcement of Right.--\n            (1) In general.--A person whose right under subsection (a) \n        is violated in any manner may bring an action in any United \n        States district court against the United States, any State, or \n        any person for damages, injunctive relief, and such other \n        relief as the court deems appropriate.\n            (2) Authority to award a reasonable attorney's fee.--In an \n        action brought under paragraph (1), the court, in its \n        discretion, may allow the prevailing plaintiff a reasonable \n        attorney's fee as part of the costs.\n            (3) Statute of limitations.--An action may not be brought \n        under paragraph (1) after the 5-year period that begins with \n        the date the violation described in paragraph (1) is \n        discovered."
