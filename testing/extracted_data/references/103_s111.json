FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds:\n            (1) In the period since 1960 the average annual caseload of \n        the aid to families with dependent children program (hereafter \n        referred to in this section as ``AFDC'') under title IV of the \n        Social Security Act has quintupled.\n            (2) In 1990 there were on average almost twice as many \n        households receiving AFDC payments as the number of households \n        and individuals receiving unemployment compensation benefits.\n            (3) Nearly one-quarter of children born in the period 1967 \n        through 1969 were on welfare (AFDC) before reaching age 18. For \n        minority children this ratio approached three-quarters.\n            (4) At any given time one-quarter of school children are \n        from single parent families, or households with neither parent. \n        The National Assessment of Educational Progress has documented \n        the educational losses associated with single parent or no \n        parent households.\n            (5) Only one-quarter of father-absent families receive full \n        child support and over one-half receive none.\n            (6) The average AFDC benefit has declined by more than one-\n        third since 1960.\n            (7) The burden of welfare dependency is an issue of \n        necessary concern to women, who in overwhelming proportion are \n        the heads of single parent families.\n            (8) The rate of welfare dependency may be rising. However, \n        the statistical basis on which to assess this national issue is \n        wholly inadequate, much as the statistical basis for addressing \n        issues of unemployment was inadequate prior to the Employment \n        Act of 1946, which required the creation of the annual economic \n        report of the President and the development of unemployment \n        rates.\n    (b) Congressional Policy.--The Congress hereby declares that--\n            (1) it is the policy and responsibility of the Federal \n        Government to reduce welfare dependency to the lowest possible \n        level, and to assist families toward self-sufficiency, \n        consistent with other essential national goals;\n            (2) it is the policy of the United States to strengthen \n        families, to ensure that children grow up in families that are \n        economically self-sufficient and to underscore the \n        responsibility of parents to support their children;\n            (3) the Federal Government should help welfare recipients \n        as well as individuals at risk of welfare dependency to improve \n        their education and job skills, to obtain access to necessary \n        support services, and to take such other steps as may assist \n        them to meet their responsibilities to become financially \n        independent; and\n            (4) it is the purpose of this Act to aid in lowering \n        welfare dependency by providing the public with generally \n        accepted measures of welfare dependency so that the public can \n        track dependency over time and determine whether progress is \n        being made in reducing welfare dependency and enabling families \n        to be self-sufficient.\n\nSEC. 3. MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF WELFARE DEPENDENCY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 413 the following new \nsection:\n\n           ``measurement and reporting of welfare dependency\n\n    ``Sec. 414.
