FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The limited introduction into commerce of ``copy-\n        protected compact discs'' has caused consumer confusion and \n        placed increased, unwarranted burdens on retailers, consumer \n        electronics manufacturers, and personal computer manufacturers \n        responding to consumer complaints, conditions which will worsen \n        as larger numbers of such discs are introduced into commerce.\n            (2) Recording companies introducing new forms of copy \n        protection should have the freedom to innovate, but should also \n        be responsible for providing adequate notice to consumers about \n        restrictions on the playability and recordability of ``copy-\n        protected compact discs''.\n            (3) The Federal Trade Commission should be empowered and \n        directed to ensure the adequate labeling of prerecorded digital \n        music disc products.\n\nSEC. 3.
