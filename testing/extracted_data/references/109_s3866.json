    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Education for Retirement Security \nAct of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Improving economic and financial literacy is a critical \n        and complex task for Americans of all ages.\n            (2) Low levels of savings and high levels of personal and \n        real estate debt are serious problems for many households \n        nearing retirement.\n            (3) Historically, Americans are living longer than ever \n        before. However, most Americans are retiring before the age of \n        65.\n            (4) Research suggests that many Americans are not prepared \n        to plan for their retirement and may have to work far longer \n        than they expect in order to be financially secure in \n        retirement.\n            (5) In 2005, only 42 percent of workers or their spouses \n        calculated the amount they needed to save for retirement, down \n        from 53 percent in 2000.\n            (6) Only 53 percent of working Americans have any form of \n        pension coverage. Three out of 4 women aged 65 or older receive \n        no income from employer-provided pensions.\n            (7) The limited timeframe that midlife and older \n        individuals and families have to assess the realities of their \n        individual circumstances, to recover from counterproductive \n        choices and decisionmaking processes, and to benefit from more \n        informed financial practices, has immediate impact and near-\n        term consequences for Americans nearing or of retirement age.\n            (8) Research indicates that there are now 4 basic sources \n        of retirement income security. Those sources are social \n        security benefits, pensions and savings, healthcare insurance \n        coverage, and, for an increasing number of older individuals, \n        necessary earnings from working during one's retirement years.\n            (9) Over the next 30 years, the number of older individuals \n        in the United States is expected to double, from 35,000,000 to \n        nearly 75,000,000, and long-term care costs are expected to \n        skyrocket.\n            (10) Financial exploitation is the largest single category \n        of abuse against older individuals and this population \n        comprises more than \\1/2\\ of all telemarketing victims in the \n        United States.\n            (11) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Identity Theft Data \n        Clearinghouse has reported that incidents of identity theft \n        targeting individuals older than the age of 60 increased from \n        1,821 victims in 2000 to 21,084 victims in 2004, an increase of \n        more than 11 times in number.\n\nSEC. 3.
