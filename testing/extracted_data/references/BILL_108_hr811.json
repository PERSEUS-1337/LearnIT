FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Journal of the American Medical Association reports \n        that protecting children's health requires two key elements, \n        which are (A) that a caring adult is engaged in the life of the \n        child, and (B) that there is a connection between the child and \n        his or her school.\n            (2) Schools offer the most natural community setting in \n        which individuals live, work, and play. Schools are a respected \n        element of community infrastructure and are recognized as the \n        most valuable element in creating connection and support for \n        children, families, and communities.\n            (3) Primary care and behavioral health services are among \n        the most important elements of a comprehensive approach to \n        promoting health and education and preventing illness in \n        children and youth.\n            (4) School safety and violence prevention are critical to \n        the well-being of each student, and early intervention and \n        mental health care significantly reduce school discipline \n        problems.\n            (5) Good health is a prerequisite for optimal learning, and \n        schools can help students achieve academic success by \n        participating in efforts that promote good health, including \n        access to regular medical and mental health care.\n            (6) Children are experiencing increasing rates of \n        behavioral and physical illness, such as attention deficit \n        hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and asthma and diabetes, and are \n        experiencing increasing rates of obesity that portend \n        increasing rates of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer later \n        in life.\n            (7) In order to be effective, new strategies for prevention \n        must be built on community-based, community-designed, and \n        community-implemented strategies.\n            (8) Effective behavioral and physical health services can \n        be provided in a school-based setting in such a way as to \n        prevent later disease.\n            (9) Schools are ideal settings in which to provide care for \n        children, especially those who would otherwise have inadequate \n        access to health services. Limited access contributes directly \n        to the growing rates of disease among children. Prevention \n        strategies should be joined with treatment to develop an \n        understanding of what types of prevention can reduce rates of \n        illness, and therefore the need for treatment. Higher rates of \n        disease, even with adequate access to health services, portend \n        loss of vitality and higher complications from disease.\n            (10) School-based health programs should focus on improving \n        behavioral and physical health, including with respect to \n        obesity.\n            (11) By reducing the incidence of disease, effective \n        community-based prevention programs (whether through school-\n        based approaches or otherwise) result in significant savings to \n        the Federal Government and to the States by reducing \n        expenditures in Federal and State health services programs. \n        Such savings should be dedicated to further prevention efforts, \n        which in turn will result in further savings. Savings that \n        result from prevention programs should not be redirected to \n        unrelated purposes, and prevention programs that achieve \n        savings should not be penalized by having their funding levels \n        reduced.\n\nSEC. 3.
