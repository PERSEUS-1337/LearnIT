FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In the past decade, the concept of ``sustainable \n        development'' has become standard United States and \n        international policy.\n            (2) Sustainable development is environmentally sound and is \n        undertaken in a way that meets the needs of the present without \n        compromising the ability of future generations to meet their \n        needs.\n            (3) Federal land managers have worked with the mining \n        industry and other industries over the past decade to develop \n        sustainability principles for resource development on Federal \n        lands, but there is a need to demonstrate and implement these \n        principles.\n            (4) For the mining industry, a prime goal of sustainable \n        development is to plan and implement economically viable and \n        productive post-mining land uses that will allow lands impacted \n        by mining to continue providing jobs and other economic \n        benefits beyond the completion of mining activity. \n        Privatization of the surface at mine sites is a crucial \n        component in achieving and maintaining sustainable development \n        opportunities for a mining operation's host community.\n            (5) With more than 80 percent of Nevada's lands in Federal \n        ownership, the State's rural communities in particular depend \n        on continued productive uses of Federal lands for jobs, tax \n        revenues, and economic development.\n            (6) Mining on Nevada's public lands is the most important \n        source of high-paying jobs and other economic benefits to rural \n        Nevada communities. Mining on Nevada public lands also provides \n        substantial tax revenues to the Treasury and to State and local \n        governments.\n            (7) The Rochester Mine, located in Pershing County, Nevada, \n        provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate sustainable \n        development principles in the mining industry.\n            (8) The Rochester Mine, operated by Coeur Rochester, Inc., \n        opened in 1986 and employs 250 people, most of whom live in or \n        near Lovelock, Nevada. The mine operates on patented lands and \n        approximately 7,000 acres of public lands subject to mining \n        claims and impacted by the mining operation.\n            (9) For its 20 years of operation, the Rochester Mine has \n        been the major source of employment for Pershing County \n        residents.\n            (10) The Rochester Mine is near the end of its \n        productivity, and closure and reclamation of the mine are \n        expected to begin within 5 years, subject to closure and \n        reclamation plans to be approved by the Secretary of the \n        Interior and the State of Nevada. Given ore grades and \n        exploration results in the area, Coeur Rochester, Inc. does not \n        contemplate any future mining at the site.\n            (11) Without a post-mining land use for the Rochester Mine \n        or entry of a new industry, Pershing County faces significant \n        and destabilizing unemployment and loss of tax revenues when \n        the Rochester Mine closes.\n            (12) Coeur Rochester, Inc. has developed an innovative plan \n        for post-mining land uses of the Rochester Mine site, including \n        reuse of the mine's overburden and waste rock as aggregate in \n        California and other markets, and potential use of the mine \n        site as a State-permitted landfill for municipal or industrial \n        wastes or construction debris.\n            (13) The public lands subject to mining claims at the \n        Rochester Mine are difficult and uneconomical for the Bureau of \n        Land Management to manage because of the checkerboard pattern \n        of Federal land ownership in the vicinity of the Rochester \n        Mine.\n            (14) Disposal of such lands will also serve other important \n        public objectives, including the demonstration of viable and \n        productive post-mining land uses and of other sustainable \n        development concepts in the mining industry. The project would \n        also facilitate the creation of a new long-term employment \n        source and would result in other important economic development \n        benefits and the maintenance of a tax base for Pershing County.\n            (15) The Bureau of Land Management has determined that the \n        public lands addressed in this Act are suitable for \n        consolidation of ownership or disposal into private ownership.\n            (16) Lands to be conveyed under this Act would remain \n        subject to applicable Federal and State environmental, land \n        use, and safety laws.\n            (17) Any lands disposed of by the Secretary pursuant to \n        this Act would be sold at $500 per acre.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to implement a sustainable development project in \n        Pershing County, Nevada;\n            (2) to encourage and promote the concept of sustainable \n        development practices in resource-dependent communities that \n        have a limited privately held land base; and\n            (3) to provide funds for the general fund of the Treasury, \n        for the State of Nevada abandoned mine lands program, and for \n        education and other purposes in the State of Nevada.\n\nSEC. 3.
