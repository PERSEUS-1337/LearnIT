    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 562 is added to the Food and Agricultural Code, to read:\n562.\nThe Legislature further finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) California\u2019s agricultural output is larger and more diverse than any state in the United States, providing the majority of the country\u2019s fruits, vegetables, nuts, and dairy products.\n(b) Dependent on land and natural resources, California agriculture is uniquely vulnerable to climate change, which poses a serious threat to California agriculture with rising temperatures, increases in extreme weather events, constrained water resources, reduced winter chilling hours, and rising sea levels.\n(c) California agriculture also is uniquely positioned to provide climate benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Research funded by the State Energy Resources\nand Conservation\nConservation and\nDevelopment Commission\u2019s Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) program finds that some agricultural practices will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but they also may help to store carbon in soils and trees. Carbon storage is an important strategy to help meet the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions targets.\n(d) Steps taken by those working in California agriculture to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester atmospheric carbon can provide other important environmental cobenefits, such as improved air and water quality, water conservation, enhanced wildlife habitat, and healthier rural communities.\n(e) It is, therefore, the intent of the Legislature to enhance the long-term viability of California agriculture by supporting activities that reduce climate change impacts that may negatively impact it and the rest of the state.\n(f) It is further the intent of the Legislature that the department, pursuant to this article, support the state\u2019s agricultural sector in pursuing on-farm practices and activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon storage in agricultural soils and woody biomass.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 564 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n564.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions govern the construction of this article:\n(a) \u201cAgricultural activities\u201d means those activities that generate products as specified in Section 54004.\n(b) \u201cDepartment\u201d means the Department of Food and Agriculture.\n(c) \u201cFund\u201d means the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, created pursuant to Section 16428.8 of the Government Code.\n(d) \u201cPanel\u201d means the Environmental Farming Science Advisory Panel.\n(e) \u201cSecretary\u201d means the Secretary of Food and Agriculture.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 566 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n566.\n(a) (1) The department shall establish and oversee an environmental farming program. The program may provide incentives, including, but not limited to, loans, grants, research, technical assistance, or educational materials and outreach, to farmers whose practices promote the well-being of ecosystems, air quality, and wildlife and their habitat and reduce on-farm greenhouse gas emissions or increase carbon storage in agricultural soils and woody biomass, or both.\n(2) The department may provide support through the program that may include, but need not be limited to, permit assistance and coordination and the funding of on-farm demonstration projects in furtherance of the goals of the program.\n(b) (1) The department may assist in the compilation of scientific evidence from public and private sources, including the scientific community, industry, conservation organizations, and federal, state, and local agencies identifying the net environmental impacts and benefits that agriculture creates for the environment.\n(2) The department shall serve as the depository of the scientific evidence compiled pursuant to this subdivision and provide it to federal, state, and local agencies as needed.\n(c) The department shall conduct the activities specified in this article with existing resources, to the extent they are available.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 568 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n568.\n(a) The secretary shall convene an Environmental Farming Science Advisory Panel to advise the secretary on the implementation of an environmental farming program, established pursuant to Section 566, and assist federal, state, and local government agencies, as appropriate or necessary, on issues relating to the impact of agricultural practices on air, water, climate change, and wildlife habitat.\n(b) (1) The panel shall consist of the following members:\n(A) Two members appointed by the Secretary for Environmental Protection.
