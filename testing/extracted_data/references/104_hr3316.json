excess \n        benefit arrangement were treated as a plan for the deferral of \n        compensation which is maintained by a corporation not exempt \n        from tax under this chapter and which does not meet the \n        requirements for qualification under section 401.\n            ``(3) Qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement.--\n        For purposes of this subsection, the term
