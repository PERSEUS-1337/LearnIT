    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Local Voices on TV Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The newly created class A television service provides \n        valuable local and specialized television service to unserved \n        and underserved audiences throughout the United States, and for \n        that reason Congress enacted the Community Broadcasters \n        Protection Act of 1999 to provide permanent broadcast licenses \n        to television stations providing such service.\n            (2) It was the purpose of the Community Broadcasters \n        Protection Act of 1999 to provide continuing opportunities for \n        low power television broadcast stations to qualify for and be \n        granted class A licenses, especially where those licenses could \n        provide local programming and local voices to underserved urban \n        and rural communities.\n            (3) This new television service was created seven years \n        after the enactment of the Cable Television Consumer Protection \n        and Competition Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-385), and while \n        that Act includes licenses for class A television service under \n        the provisions relating to low power broadcast television, it \n        does not reflect the fact that such stations operate as full-\n        service, commercial broadcast television stations under part 73 \n        of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (the rules of the \n        Federal Communications Commission for full power television \n        stations) and provide significant local programming to their \n        underserved communities often equaling in duration that \n        provided by the major networks in other small markets.\n            (4) Thirteen of the largest 25 Hispanic markets in the \n        United States receive Spanish language network programming \n        through low power television stations. The provisions of the \n        Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of \n        1992 that exclude from mandatory carriage on cable television \n        any low power television broadcast station within the largest \n        160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas deny equitable cable \n        carriage opportunities for such television stations and other \n        television stations serving specialized and other underserved \n        urban communities.\n            (5) In 1992, Congress believed that requirements for \n        mandatory carriage on cable television were necessary to ensure \n        the benefits of the local origination of programming. Today, \n        such provisions are also necessary to ensure the benefits of \n        the local programming provided by qualified class A television \n        stations.\n            (6) Must-carry rights are often challenged on issues of \n        signal quality and strength. If qualified class A television \n        broadcast stations and other low power television stations use \n        industry standard equipment in delivering signals to the cable \n        headends, cable operators should accept any equipment provided \n        and paid for by such television stations so long as acceptance \n        of such equipment does not negatively impact the operation of \n        cable systems.\n\nSEC. 3. CABLE TELEVISION CARRIAGE REQUIREMENTS REGARDING CLASS A LOCAL \n              TELEVISION SERVICE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 614 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \nU.S.C. 534) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (b)(2)(A)--\n                    (A) by inserting ``or qualified class A station'' \n                after ``qualified low power station'';

and\n            (4) in subsection (h)--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1)--\n                            (i) in subparagraph (A)--\n                                    (I) by inserting ``or qualified \n                                class A station'' after ``full power \n                                television broadcast station'';
