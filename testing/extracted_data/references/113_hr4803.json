    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``TSA Office of Inspection \nAccountability Act of 2014''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Consistent with Federal law and regulations, for law \n        enforcement officers to qualify for premium pay as criminal \n        investigators, the officers must, in general, spend on average \n        at least 50 percent of their time investigating, apprehending, \n        or detaining individuals suspected or convicted of offenses \n        against the criminal laws of the United States.\n            (2) According to the Inspector General of the Department of \n        Homeland Security (DHS IG), the Transportation Security \n        Administration (TSA) does not ensure that its cadre of criminal \n        investigators in the Office of Inspection are meeting this \n        requirement, even though they are considered law enforcement \n        officers under TSA policy and receive premium pay.\n            (3) Instead, TSA criminal investigators in the Office of \n        Inspection primarily monitor the results of criminal \n        investigations conducted by other agencies, investigate \n        administrative cases of TSA employee misconduct, and carry out \n        inspections, covert tests, and internal reviews, which the DHS \n        IG asserts could be performed by employees other than criminal \n        investigators at a lower cost.\n            (4) The premium pay and other benefits afforded to TSA \n        criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection who are \n        incorrectly classified as such will cost the taxpayer as much \n        as $17,000,000 over 5 years if TSA fails to make any changes to \n        the number of criminal investigators in the Office of \n        Inspection, according to the DHS IG.\n            (5) This may be a conservative estimate, as it accounts for \n        the cost of Law Enforcement Availability Pay, but not the costs \n        of law enforcement training, statutory early retirement \n        benefits, police vehicles, and weapons.\n\nSEC. 3.
