FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) historically, Federal programs have addressed the \n        Nation's problems by providing categorical financial assistance \n        with detailed requirements relating to the use of funds;\n            (2) while the assistance described in paragraph (1) has \n        been directed at critical problems, some program requirements \n        may inadvertently impede the effective delivery of services, \n        and the Federal government should exercise leadership in \n        eliminating these impediments;\n            (3) the Nation's state, local, and tribal governments and \n        private, nonprofit organizations are dealing with increasingly \n        complex problems that require the coordinated delivery of many \n        kinds of services;\n            (4) the Nation's communities are diverse, and different \n        needs are present in different communities; and\n            (5) it is more important than ever for the Federal \n        Government to--\n                    (A) review, coordinate, and rationalize rules, \n                regulations and policies governing the range of Federal \n                financial assistance programs;\n                    (B) reduce the barriers between programs that \n                impede state, local, and tribal governments' ability to \n                deliver services in a coordinated and effective manner; \n                and\n                    (C) promote more effective and efficient local \n                delivery of services.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) remove Federal impediments to coordination of service \n        delivery;\n            (2) enable more efficient use of Federal, State, and local \n        resources through program coordination and reduction of \n        regulation;\n            (3) facilitate cooperation among and coordination of \n        programs operated by state, local, and tribal governments and \n        private, nonprofit organizations; and\n            (4) place less emphasis in Federal service programs on \n        measuring resources and procedures and more emphasis on \n        accountability for achieving policy goals.\n\nSEC. 4.
