    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Ag Science Center Act of \n2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL AG SCIENCE CENTER IN STANISLAUS COUNTY, \n              CALIFORNIA.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the State of California is a preeminent producer of \n        more than 350 different agricultural commodities, including--\n                    (A) more than 90 percent of all of the tomatoes and \n                grapes produced in the United States;\n                    (B) all of the commercial almonds, dates, figs, \n                olives, cling peaches, prunes, and raisins produced in \n                the United States; and\n                    (C) 1 out of every 5 glasses of milk consumed in \n                the United States;\n            (2) California is the leading State in terms of \n        agricultural exports, annually shipping more than \n        $7,000,000,000 in agricultural commodities around the world;\n            (3) the total investment by the 78,500 farms in the State \n        of California, in terms of direct and indirect economic impact, \n        is staggering;\n            (4) if California intends to keep its agricultural industry \n        strong and vibrant, the State must focus on the needs of \n        farmers who are valuable contributors to the economic, social, \n        and cultural life of the State and the United States;\n            (5) since 1945, agricultural land has been rapidly \n        disappearing across California, as soil erosion, urbanization, \n        the growth of deserts, and salinization have all contributed to \n        loss of productive farmland;\n            (6) if those trends continue, California will no longer be \n        able to supply food for its population, let alone the United \n        States, and will be unable to export food to the rest of the \n        world;\n            (7) as people in the United States grow more and more \n        detached from the great agrarian history of the United States, \n        fewer of those people understand the fundamental importance of \n        agriculture to society in the United States;\n            (8) educating young people in the United States about \n        agriculture and its importance to the United States is an \n        investment that will pay off in future benefits;\n            (9) greater public understanding and appreciation of the \n        importance of agriculture to California, the United States, and \n        the world is needed to secure a positive future, in which the \n        United States can rely on healthy food that is produced \n        domestically;\n            (10) citizens of all ages, especially youth, must play a \n        meaningful, hands-on role in determining the future of \n        California agriculture;\n            (11) as planners, conservationists, and other interested \n        persons around the State of California organize to help protect \n        agricultural resources, the proposed National Ag Science Center \n        in Stanislaus County, California, is preparing to educate and \n        alert future generations about the need to preserve \n        agricultural land and to foster an understanding of the \n        importance of agriculture;\n            (12) the mission of the National Ag Science Center will be \n        to provide exciting and fun agricultural learning opportunities \n        and resources in order--\n                    (A) for young people to learn how a vibrant \n                agricultural economy is necessary for a vibrant \n                society;\n                    (B) to prepare young people for career and \n                leadership opportunities in agriculture; and\n                    (C) to ensure a bright future for all aspects of \n                the agriculture industry;\n            (13) according to findings of the Center for Public Policy \n        Studies at California State University, Stanislaus, the \n        National Ag Science Center will create or support up to 359 new \n        local jobs, create or support up to $57,500,000 in economic \n        activity and $15,200,000 in labor income through construction \n        of the new facility, generate as much as $8,500,000 in total \n        annual economic activity, and result in as much as $3,400,000 \n        in total annual labor income;\n            (14) on September 14, 2005, the Yosemite Community College \n        District Board, in Stanislaus County, California, voted \n        unanimously to approve the dedication of a 3.5 acre site on the \n        West Campus of Modesto Community College for the National Ag \n        Science Center; and\n            (15) establishment of the National Ag Science Center is in \n        the national interest, as the proposed Center will enable \n        future generations to help ensure a healthy and profitable \n        place for agriculture in the economy of California and the \n        United States.\n    (b) Designation.--\n            (1) In general.--The facility under development by the \n        Stanislaus Ag Center Foundation, in Stanislaus County, \n        California, shall be known and designated as the ``National Ag \n        Science Center''.\n            (2) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n        document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n        facility under development referred to in paragraph (1) shall \n        be deemed to be a reference to the National Ag Science Center."
