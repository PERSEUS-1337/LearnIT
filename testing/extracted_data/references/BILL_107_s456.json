FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs administers the \n        largest health care network in the United States, including 172 \n        hospitals, 73 home care programs, more than 800 community-based \n        outpatient clinics, and numerous other specialized care \n        facilities.\n            (2) There are approximately 25,000,000 veterans in the \n        United States, including approximately 19,300,000 veterans of a \n        period of war.\n            (3) The number of veterans seeking medical care in \n        Department medical facilities is increasing nationwide.\n            (4) The medical caseload of the Department in fiscal year \n        2000 was expected to total approximately 3,800,000 cases, an \n        increase of 185,000 cases from fiscal year 1999. The medical \n        caseload of the Department is further expected to increase to \n        3,900,000 cases in fiscal year 2001. In fiscal year 2001, \n        outpatient visits to Department facilities are expected to \n        increase by 2,600,000 visits to approximately 40,400,000 \n        visits.\n            (5) The average age of veterans is increasing. The increase \n        in the average age of veterans is expected to result in \n        additional demands for health care services, including more \n        frequent and long-term health needs.\n            (6) The Department is attempting to meet increasing demand \n        for medical care without substantial increases in \n        appropriations, mainly through efforts to increase efficiency.\n            (7) The need to treat more veterans without substantial \n        increases in available resources has resulted in serious \n        concerns about the potential for loss of quality of care and of \n        patient satisfaction.\n            (8) Many of the regional networks and hospitals \n        administered by the Veterans Health Administration report that \n        timely access to high quality health care may be jeopardized by \n        inadequate funding.\n\nSEC. 3.
