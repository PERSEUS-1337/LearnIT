FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) Radio Free Asia (referred to in this Act as ``RFA'')--\n            (A) was authorized under section 309 of the United States \n        International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6208);\n            (B) was incorporated as a private, non-profit corporation \n        in March 1996 in the hope that its operations would soon be \n        obviated by the global advancement of democracy; and\n            (C) is headquartered in Washington, DC, with additional \n        offices in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Phnom Penh, Seoul, Ankara, and \n        Taipei.\n        (2) RFA broadcasts serve as substitutes for indigenous free \n    media in regions lacking free media outlets.\n        (3) The mission of RFA is ``to provide accurate and timely news \n    and information to Asian countries whose governments prohibit \n    access to a free press'' in order to enable informed decisionmaking \n    by the people within Asia.\n        (4) RFA provides daily broadcasts of news, commentary, \n    analysis, and cultural programming to Asian countries in several \n    languages, including--\n            (A) 12 hours per day in Mandarin;\n            (B) 8 hours per day in 3 Tibetan dialects, Uke, Kham, and \n        Amdo;\n            (C) 4 hours per day in Korean and Burmese;\n            (D) 2 hours per day in Cantonese, Vietnamese, Laotian, \n        Khmer (Cambodian), and Uyghur; and\n            (E) 1\\1/2\\ hours per week in Wu (local Shanghai dialect).\n        (5) The governments of the countries targeted for these \n    broadcasts have consistently denied and blocked attempts at Medium \n    Wave and FM transmissions into their countries, forcing RFA to rely \n    on Shortwave broadcasts and the Internet.\n        (6) RFA has provided continuous online news to its Asian \n    audiences since 2004, although some countries--\n            (A) routinely and aggressively block RFA's website;\n            (B) monitor access to RFA's website; and\n            (C) discourage online users by making it illegal to access \n        RFA's website.\n        (7) Despite these attempts, RFA has successfully managed to \n    reach its online audiences through proxies, cutting-edge software, \n    and active republication and repostings by its audience.\n        (8) RFA also provides forums for local opinions and experiences \n    through message boards, podcasts, web logs (blogs), cell phone-\n    distributed newscasts, and new media, including Facebook, Flickr, \n    Twitter, and YouTube.\n        (9) Freedom House has documented that freedom of the press is \n    in decline in nearly every region of the world, particularly in \n    Asia, where none of the countries served by RFA have increased \n    their freedom of the press during the past 5 years.\n        (10) In fiscal year 2010, RFA is operating on a $37,000,000 \n    budget, less than $400,000 of which is available to fund Internet \n    censorship circumvention.\n        (11) Congress currently provides grant funding for RFA's \n    operations on a fiscal year basis.\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n    It is the sense of the Senate that--\n        (1) public access to timely, uncensored, and accurate \n    information is imperative for promoting government accountability \n    and the protection of human rights;\n        (2) Radio Free Asia provides a vital voice to people in Asia;\n        (3) some of the governments in Asia spend millions of dollars \n    each year to jam RFA's shortwave, block its Internet sites;\n        (4) Congress should provide additional funding to RFA and the \n    other entities overseen by the Broadcasting Board of Governors \n    for--\n            (A) Internet censorship circumvention; and\n            (B) enhancement of their cyber security efforts; and\n        (5) permanently authorizing funding for Radio Free Asia would--\n            (A) reflect the concern that media censorship and press \n        restrictions in the countries served by RFA have increased \n        since RFA was established; and\n            (B) send a powerful signal of our Nation's support for free \n        press in Asia and throughout the world.\nSEC. 3. PERMANENT AUTHORIZATION FOR RADIO FREE ASIA.\n    Section 309 of the United States International Broadcasting Act of \n1994 (22 U.S.C. 6208) is amended--\n        (1) in subsection (c)(2), by striking ``, and shall further \n    specify that funds to carry out the activities of Radio Free Asia \n    may not be available after September 30, 2010'';\n        (2) by striking subsection (f);\n        (3) by redesignating subsections (g) and (h) as subsection (f) \n    and (g), respectively; and\n        (4) in subsection (f), as redesignated--\n            (A) by striking ``The Board'' and inserting the following:\n        ``(1) Notification.--The Board'';\n            (B) by striking ``before entering'' and inserting the \n        following: ``before--\n            ``(A) entering'';\n            (C) by striking ``Radio Free Asia.'' and inserting the \n        following: ``Radio Free Asia; or\n            ``(B) entering into any agreements in regard to the \n        utilization of Radio Free Asia transmitters, equipment, or \n        other resources that will significantly reduce the broadcasting \n        activities of Radio Free Asia.'';\n            (D) by striking ``The Chairman'' and inserting the \n        following:\n        ``(2) Consultation.--The Chairman''; and\n            (E) by inserting ``or Radio Free Asia broadcasting \n        activities'' before the period at the end.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
