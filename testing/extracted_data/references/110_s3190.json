    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Earned Income Credit Information Act \nof 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress hereby finds:\n            (1) President Gerald Ford and Congress created the earned \n        income credit (EIC) in 1975 to offset the adverse effects of \n        Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes on working poor \n        families and to encourage low-income workers to seek employment \n        rather than welfare.\n            (2) President Ronald Reagan described the earned income \n        credit as ``the best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the \n        best job-creation measure to come out of Congress.''\n            (3) Over the last 30 years, the EIC program has grown into \n        the largest Federal anti-poverty program in the United States. \n        In 2005, 22.8 million tax filers received $42.4 billion in tax \n        credits through the EIC program.\n            (4) In 2007, the EIC provided a maximum Federal benefit of \n        $4,716 for families with 2 or more children, $2,853 for \n        families with a single child, and $428 for a taxpayer with no \n        qualifying children.\n            (5) Based on analysis conducted by the General \n        Accountability Office, 25 percent of those eligible to receive \n        the EIC do not take advantage of the tax benefit.\n            (6) Based on analysis conducted by the Joint Economic \n        Committee, working Americans may have lost out on approximately \n        $8 billion in unclaimed earned income credits in 2004.\n            (7) In response to a study by the California Franchise Tax \n        Board that found that there were approximately 460,000 \n        California families that qualified, but did not file, for the \n        EIC, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law Assembly \n        Bill 650, the Earned Income Tax Credit Information Act, on \n        October 13, 2007. The law requires that California employers \n        notify employees of their potential eligibility for the EIC.\n            (8) In order to ensure that tax benefits designed to assist \n        working Americans reach the maximum number of people, the \n        Federal Government should enact a similar law.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to inform the greatest \npossible number of Americans about their potential eligibility for the \nearned income credit in a way that is neither costly nor burdensome for \nemployers or the Government.\n\nSEC. 3. EMPLOYER NOTIFICATION OF AVAILABILITY OF EARNED INCOME CREDIT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 77 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n(relating to miscellaneous provisions) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following new section:\n\n``SEC. 7529. EMPLOYER NOTIFICATION OF AVAILABILITY OF EARNED INCOME \n              CREDIT.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Every employer required to provide a statement \nunder section 6051 (relating to W-2 statements) to a potential EIC-\neligible employee shall provide to such employee the notice described \nin subsection (c).\n    ``(b) Potential EIC-Eligible Employee.--For purposes of this \nsection, the term `potential EIC-eligible employee' means any \nindividual whose annual wages from the employer are less than the \namount of earned income (as defined in section 32(c)(2)) at which the \ncredit under section 32(a) phases out for an individual described in \nsection 32(c)(1)(A)(ii) (or such other amount as may be prescribed by \nthe Secretary).\n    ``(c) Contents of Notice.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The notice required by subsection (a) \n        shall be--\n                    ``(A) a copy of Internal Revenue Service Notice 797 \n                or any successor notice, or\n                    ``(B) a notice stating: `Based on your annual \n                earnings, you may be eligible to receive the earned \n                income credit from the Federal Government. The earned \n                income credit is a tax credit for certain working \n                individuals and families. In 2008, earned income credit \n                benefits are available for taxpayers with earnings up \n                to $38,646 ($41,646 if married filing jointly). \n                Eligibility and benefit amounts vary according to \n                filing status (single or married), number of qualifying \n                children, and other sources of income. For example, in \n                2008, earned income credit benefits are available for \n                childless taxpayers earning less than $15,880, \n                taxpayers with 1 child earning less than $36,995, and \n                taxpayers with 2 or more children earning less than \n                $41,646. In most cases, earned income credit payments \n                will not be used to determine eligibility for Medicaid, \n                supplemental security income, food stamps, low-income \n                housing or most temporary assistance for needy families \n                programs. Even if you do not owe Federal taxes, you may \n                qualify, but must file a tax return to receive the \n                earned income credit. For information regarding your \n                eligibility to receive the earned income credit, \n                contact the Internal Revenue Service by calling 1-800-\n                829-1040 or through its web site at www.irs.gov. The \n                Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program provides \n                free tax preparation assistance to individuals under \n                the above income limits.
