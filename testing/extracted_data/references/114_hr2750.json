VETTING OF AVIATION WORKERS.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--By not later than December 31, 2015, the \nAdministrator, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Policy \nof the Department, shall request from the Director of National \nIntelligence access to additional data from the Terrorist Identities \nDatamart Environment (TIDE) data and any or other terrorism-related \ninformation to improve the effectiveness of the Administration's \ncredential vetting program for individuals with unescorted access to \nsensitive areas of airports.\n    ``(b) Security Inspection.--By not later than December 31, 2015, \nthe Administrator shall issue guidance for Transportation Security \nInspectors to annually review airport badging office procedures for \napplicants seeking access to sensitive areas of airports.

In preparing this determination, the \nAdministrator shall consult with the Chief Civil Rights and Civil \nLiberties Officer of the Department to ensure that protocols are in \nplace to align the period of retention of personally identifiable \ninformation and biometric information, including fingerprints, in the \nRap Back Service with the period in which the individual who is the \nsubject of an inquiry has a valid credential.\n    ``(f) Credential Security.--By not later than September 30, 2015, \nthe Administrator shall issue guidance to airports mandating that all \nfederalized airport badging authorities place an expiration date on \nairport credentials commensurate with the period of time during which \nan individual is lawfully authorized to work in the United States.\n    ``(g) Aviation Worker Lawful Status.--By not later than December \n31, 2015, the Administrator shall review the denial of credentials due \nto issues associated with determining an applicant's lawful status in \norder to identify airports with specific weaknesses and shall \ncoordinate with such airports to mutually address such weaknesses, as \nappropriate.\n    ``(h) Reports to Congress.--Upon completion of the determinations \nand reviews required under this section, the Administrator shall brief \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation \nand Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the results of \nsuch determinations and reviews.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002 is amended by inserting after the item relating to \nsection 1601 the following new item:\n\n``Sec. 1602.

The \nreport shall include details on the business, technical, and resource \nrequirements for the Transportation Security Administration and pilot \nprogram participants, and provide a timeline and goals for the pilot \nprogram.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives July 27, 2015.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L.
