FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Obstetric fistula is a devastating condition that \n        occurs during childbirth when prolonged pressure of the baby's \n        head against the mother's pelvis can lead to the child's death \n        as well as cut off the blood supply of the tissues surrounding \n        the woman's vagina, bladder, or rectum, causing those tissues \n        to deteriorate, and thus leaving an open hole, or fistula.\n            (2) Obstetric fistula can be excruciatingly painful and \n        often causes a woman to lose control of her bowel movements.\n            (3) To date, an estimated 2,000,000 cases of obstetric \n        fistula have been reported worldwide--mostly in Africa among \n        women who are very young, delivering their first child, lacking \n        proper nutrition and maternity care, and living in rural areas.\n            (4) The actual number of women who have obstetric fistula \n        may actually be much higher due to a lack of adequate \n        reporting. For example, an additional estimate contends that in \n        Nigeria alone, approximately 1,000,000 women suffer from \n        obstetric fistula.\n            (5) It is estimated that 50,000 to 100,000 new cases of \n        obstetric fistula occur each year, mostly involving women under \n        the age of 20.\n            (6) Women who suffer from obstetric fistula may also suffer \n        from social isolation because they are often abandoned by their \n        husbands, families, and employers.\n            (7) Women who suffer from obstetric fistula may also suffer \n        severe emotional stress from their condition and social \n        isolation that is often magnified by the death of their child \n        during labor.\n            (8) Obstetric fistula can be prevented through increased \n        access by women to emergency obstetrical care, a postponement \n        of sexual activity and childbearing past the teenage years, and \n        increased training for birth attendants in local communities.\n            (9) Obstetric fistula can also be treated through a \n        relatively minor surgical procedure that is 90 percent \n        effective and which can cost as little as $150.\n            (10) A large percentage of women who suffer from obstetric \n        fistula are unaware that treatment exists and may spend their \n        entire lives suffering from this condition needlessly.\n            (11) Unfortunately, there are few treatment centers or \n        hospitals with the capacity to treat obstetric fistula in \n        developing countries, particularly countries in Africa, and \n        demand for services and surgery far exceed the supply.\n            (12) Currently the United States Agency for International \n        Development provides assistance for programs that target \n        prevention of obstetric fistula but not programs that target \n        treatment of obstetric fistula.\n            (13) Tens of thousands of women in developing countries \n        suffering from obstetric fistula could be successfully treated \n        if adequate resources were devoted to this objective.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that, in \naddition to the prevention of obstetric fistula, treatment of obstetric \nfistula is an important priority of United States bilateral foreign \nassistance programs, including through--\n            (1) the establishment and expansion of the capacity to \n        treat obstetric fistula in developing countries, including \n        through the provision of surgery and post-surgery care; and\n            (2) the reduction of the incidence of obstetric fistula in \n        developing countries, including through the conduct of \n        appropriate seminars and the dissemination of appropriate \n        educational materials, such as brochures, pamphlets, and \n        posters.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``obstetric fistula'' means a rupture or hole \nin tissues surround a woman's vagina, bladder, or rectum that occurs \nwhen the woman is in obstructed childbirth for a prolonged period of \ntime without adequate medical attention.\n\nSEC. 4. AMENDMENTS TO THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961.\n\n    Section 104(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n2151b(c)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new \n        paragraph:\n    ``(4)(A) In carrying out the purposes of this subsection, the \nPresident is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and \nconditions as the President may determine, for the establishment and \noperation of not less than twelve centers for the treatment of \nobstetric fistula at appropriate sites in developing countries.\n    ``(B) In selecting sites for the establishment of centers pursuant \nto subparagraph (A), the President should seek the consultation and \nadvice of United States embassy officials, appropriate nongovernmental \norganizations, and local government officials in developing countries \nwith high rates of obstetric fistula, with particular emphasis on \ncountries in Africa.\n    ``(C) Each center established pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall, \nto the maximum extent practicable, carry out the following activities:\n            ``(i) The provision of surgery to repair obstetric fistula \n        in women who do not otherwise have the resources to pay for \n        such surgery and the provision of necessary post-surgery care \n        and support for such women.\n            ``(ii) Assistance related to surgery and post-surgery care \n        and support described in clause (i), including the provision of \n        transportation to and from the center for women in need of such \n        transportation and the provision of necessary temporary shelter \n        and food assistance to women in need of such shelter and food \n        assistance.\n            ``(iii) Activities to reduce the incidence of obstetric \n        fistula, including the conduct of appropriate seminars and the \n        dissemination of appropriate educational materials, such as \n        brochures, pamphlets, and posters.\n    ``(D) Not later than January 31 of each year, the President shall \nprepare and transmit to Congress a report on the implementation of this \nparagraph for the prior fiscal year.\n    ``(E) In addition to amounts otherwise available for such purpose, \nthere are authorized to be appropriated to the President $35,000,000 \nfor each of the fiscal years 2005 and 2006 to carry out this paragraph. \nAmounts appropriated under this clause are authorized to remain \navailable until expended.\n    ``(F) In this paragraph, the term `obstetric fistula' means a \nrupture or hole in tissues surrounding a woman's vagina, bladder, or \nrectum that occurs when the woman is in obstructed childbirth for a \nprolonged period of time without adequate medical attention.''."
