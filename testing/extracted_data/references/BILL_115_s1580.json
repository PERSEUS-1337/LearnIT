FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As of June 2018, more than 68,000,000 people have been \n        displaced by disasters and conflicts around the world, the \n        highest number recorded since the end of World War II, of which \n        more than 25,000,000 people are refugees.\n            (2) More than half of the population of refugees are \n        children and, according to the United Nations High Commissioner \n        for Refugees, nearly 4,000,000 school-aged refugee children \n        lack access to primary education.\n            (3) Education offers socioeconomic opportunities, \n        psychological stability, and physical protection for displaced \n        people, particularly for women and girls, who might otherwise \n        be vulnerable to severe forms of trafficking in persons (as \n        such term is defined in section 103(9) of the Trafficking \n        Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102(9)), child \n        marriage, sexual exploitation, or economic disenfranchisement.\n            (4) Displaced children face considerable barriers to \n        accessing educational services and, because the duration of \n        such displacement is, on average, 26 years, such children may \n        spend the entirety of their childhood without access to such \n        services.\n            (5) Despite the rising need for educational services, as of \n        2016, less than two percent of humanitarian aid was directed \n        toward educational services.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) it is critical to ensure that children, particularly \n        girls, displaced by conflicts overseas are able to access \n        educational services because such access can combat extremism \n        and reduce exploitation and poverty; and\n            (2) the educational needs of vulnerable women and girls \n        should be considered in the design, implementation, and \n        evaluation of related United States foreign assistance policies \n        and programs.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to--\n            (1) partner with and encourage other countries, public and \n        private multilateral institutions, and nongovernmental and \n        civil society organizations, including faith-based \n        organizations and organizations representing parents and \n        children, to support efforts to ensure that displaced children \n        have access to safe primary and secondary education;\n            (2) work with donors to enhance training and capacity-\n        building for the governments of countries hosting significant \n        numbers of displaced people to design, implement, and monitor \n        programs to effectively address barriers to such education; and\n            (3) coordinate with the governments of countries hosting \n        significant numbers of displaced people to--\n                    (A) promote the inclusion of displaced children \n                into the educational systems of such countries; and\n                    (B) in circumstances in which such inclusion is \n                difficult, develop innovative approaches to providing \n                safe primary and secondary educational opportunities, \n                such as encouraging schools to permit children to be \n                educated by extending the hours of schooling or \n                expanding the number of teachers.\n\nSEC. 5. UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR \n              DISPLACED CHILDREN.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of State and the Administrator of \nthe United States Agency for International Development are authorized \nto prioritize and advance ongoing efforts to support programs that--\n            (1) provide safe primary and secondary education for \n        displaced children;\n            (2) build the capacity of institutions in countries hosting \n        displaced people to prevent discrimination against displaced \n        children, especially displaced girls, who seek access to such \n        education; and\n            (3) help increase the access of displaced children, \n        especially displaced girls, to educational, economic, and \n        entrepreneurial opportunities, including through the \n        governmental authorities responsible for educational or youth \n        services in such host countries.\n    (b) Coordination With Multilateral Organizations.--The Secretary \nand the Administrator are authorized to coordinate with the World Bank, \nappropriate agencies of the United Nations, and other relevant \nmultilateral organizations to work with governments in other countries \nto collect relevant data, disaggregated by age and gender, on the \nability of displaced people to access education and participate in \neconomic activity, in order to improve the targeting, monitoring, and \nevaluation of related assistance efforts.\n    (c) Coordination With Private Sector and Civil Society \nOrganizations.--The Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to \nwork with private sector and civil society organizations to promote \nsafe primary and secondary education for displaced children.\n\nSEC. 6.
