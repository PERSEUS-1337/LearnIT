FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the pursuit of justice requires the fair application of \n        the law;\n            (2) racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal process \n        have contributed to a growing perception of bias in the \n        criminal justice system;\n            (3) there are a variety of possible causes of disparities \n        in criminal justice statistics among racial and ethnic groups \n        and these causes may differ throughout the United States, \n        including factors such as--\n                    (A) varying levels of criminal activity among \n                racial and ethnic groups and legitimate law enforcement \n                response to that criminal activity; and\n                    (B) racial discrimination, ethnic and cultural \n                insensitivity, or unconscious bias;\n            (4) the Nation would benefit from an understanding of all \n        factors causing a disparate impact on the criminal justice \n        system; and\n            (5) programs that promote fairness will increase public \n        confidence in the criminal justice system, increase public \n        safety, and further the pursuit of justice.\n\nSEC. 3.
