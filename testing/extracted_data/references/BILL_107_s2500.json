FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade \n        Center represented the single greatest act of terrorism \n        perpetrated against the United States;\n            (2) the Federal Government has responded quickly and \n        provided many of the necessary resources to begin the \n        rebuilding process in New York City, New York;\n            (3) September 11, 2001, had a damaging impact on the \n        1,100,000 students, 137,000 staff members (consisting of \n        superintendents, principals, teachers, administrators, and \n        staff), and millions of members of families serving or served \n        by the New York City public schools (referred to in this \n        subsection as the ``NYCPS'') community;\n            (4) more than 1,500 students and 800 staff members lost a \n        family member or loved one as a result of the disaster;\n            (5)(A) faculty and staff of the NYCPS reacted with \n        extraordinary calm, grace, and bravery to evacuate all children \n        and ensure that each child in their care was safe; and\n            (B) their diligence prevented even a single injury from \n        occurring in the midst of unprecedented mayhem;\n            (6) the Chancellor of the New York City Board of Education, \n        members of school boards, principals, assistant principals, \n        teachers, and counselors--\n                    (A) worked tirelessly after the event to ensure \n                that schools resumed classes and returned to their \n                regular school schedule as soon as possible; and\n                    (B) worked aggressively to restore a safe, \n                supportive school environment and to regain normalcy \n                and stability throughout the entire school system;\n            (7) the closure of certain bridges and tunnels to \n        Manhattan, New York City, New York, in the aftermath of the \n        disaster, affected not only Manhattan-resident students but \n        also approximately 50,000 students (a population that exceeds \n        the citywide student enrollments of the school districts of \n        each of the cities of Atlanta, Georgia, Oakland, California, \n        Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Seattle, Washington) from other \n        boroughs who attend school in Manhattan and were affected by \n        travel disruptions and lost instructional time;\n            (8)(A) extended classroom instruction is needed for all \n        students who lost valuable lesson time as a result of the \n        September 11, 2001, terrorist attack;\n            (B) without that extra help, student performance on high-\n        stakes standardized tests may suffer; and\n            (C) failure to prepare students adequately for State and \n        city examinations will--\n                    (i) increase the risk that those students will have \n                to repeat a grade; and\n                    (ii) further strain the already limited resources \n                of the school system;\n            (9) a recent study commissioned by the New York City Board \n        of Education and conducted by Applied Research and Consulting \n        and the Columbia University School of Public Health--\n                    (A) found profound effects since September 11, \n                2001, on the mental health of schoolchildren across New \n                York City, New York, not just those in close proximity \n                to Ground Zero; and\n                    (B) found that--\n                            (i) more than a fourth of New York City \n                        schoolchildren surveyed in the 4th through 12th \n                        grades are suffering from at least 1 trauma-\n                        related disorder in the wake of the attack on \n                        the World Trade Center; and\n                            (ii) those disorders include major \n                        depression (8.4 percent), post-traumatic stress \n                        (10.5 percent), agoraphobia (15 percent), \nseparation anxiety (12.3 percent), acting out (10.9 percent), general \nanxiety (10.3 percent), and panic anxiety (9.3 percent);\n            (10) based on the findings of that study, the NYCPS need \n        additional resources for mental health and trauma counseling \n        and other appropriate support services to meet the mental \n        health needs of students affected by the single worst terrorist \n        attack in United States history;\n            (11)(A) the NYCPS system incurred significant costs as a \n        result of the terrorist attack, including--\n                    (i) cleanup and repair costs;\n                    (ii) costs relating to loss of textbooks and \n                classroom supplies; and\n                    (iii) costs relating to transportation and food \n                revenue losses; and\n            (B) the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other \n        Federal agencies have yet to provide adequate resources to \n        address those significant costs;\n            (12)(A) the Federal Government provided resources to the \n        school systems of Miami-Dade, Florida, Los Angeles, California, \n        and Columbine, Colorado, after those systems incurred \n        extraordinary expenses resulting from a traumatic event or \n        disaster; and\n            (B) the Federal Government needs to partner with the NYCPS \n        system to ensure that the system receives similar Federal \n        assistance in the wake of the September 11 tragedy; and\n            (13)(A) on September 11, 2001, the President instructed the \n        Federal Emergency Management Agency to do whatever it takes to \n        help those affected by the terrorist attack; and\n            (B) the Federal Emergency Management Agency needs to commit \n        to ensuring that the President's instruction is carried out.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency has the authority and direction to provide \nnecessary resources to the New York City public school system--\n            (1) to meet any extraordinary expenses resulting from the \n        terrorist attack of September 11, 2001; and\n            (2) to prevent any of the resulting financial losses from \n        infringing on the ability of the system to provide all public \n        elementary school and secondary school students of New York \n        City, New York, with a fair and equal opportunity to obtain a \n        high-quality education.\n\nSEC. 2. USE OF FUNDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--From the amounts appropriated to the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency for fiscal year 2002, $161,000,000 may be \nused to compensate the New York City Board of Education for additional \noperating and education-related expenses that--\n            (1) were incurred for the provision of services to public \n        elementary school and secondary school students;\n            (2) were incurred for the period beginning September 11, \n        2001, and ending December 31, 2002; and\n            (3) resulted from the terrorist attack on New York City, \n        New York, on September 11, 2001.\n    (b) Expenses.--Expenses that may be compensated under subsection \n(a) include, at a minimum, the costs of--\n            (1) providing additional classroom instruction time and \n        related activities to students who lost instructional time as a \n        result of the terrorist attack;\n            (2) providing mental health and trauma counseling and other \n        appropriate support services to students suffering from trauma-\n        related disorders resulting from the terrorist attack on New \n        York City on September 11, 2001;\n            (3) providing guidance, grief counseling, and mental health \n        services for students and school staff members, including \n        providing overtime payments for counselors and mental health \n        professionals;\n            (4) providing cleanup and structural inspections and \n        repairs of school facilities;\n            (5) reimbursement for textbooks and other school supplies \n        and equipment used to support the relocation of students from \n        schools in the Lower Manhattan area of New York City, New York;\n            (6) relocating students, including--\n                    (A) transportation of students relocated from the \n                schools that the students attended at the beginning of \n                the 2002-2003 school year to temporary school \n                facilities; and\n                    (B) reimbursement for the amount expended for the \n                daily rate of bus service paid by the New York City \n                Board of Education for that transportation; and\n            (7) reimbursement for--\n                    (A) loss of perishable food stock; and\n                    (B) revenue lost from food services."
