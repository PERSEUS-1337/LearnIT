SITING OF LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS IMPORT FACILITIES.\n\n    Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(d)(1) Before issuing an order authorizing an applicant to site, \nconstruct, expand, or operate a liquefied natural gas import facility, \nthe Commission shall require the applicant, in cooperation with the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard and State and local agencies that provide \nfor the safety and security of the liquefied natural gas import \nfacility and any vessels that serve the facility, to develop a cost-\nsharing plan.\n    ``(2) A cost-sharing plan developed under paragraph (1) shall \ninclude a description of any direct cost reimbursements that the \napplicant agrees to provide to any State and local agencies with \nresponsibility for security and safety--\n            ``(A) at the liquefied natural gas import facility; and\n            ``(B) in proximity to vessels that serve the facility.\n    ``(e)(1) In this subsection, the term `region' means a census \nregion designated by the Bureau of the Census as of the date of \nenactment of this subsection.\n    ``(2) Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \nsubsection and annually thereafter, the Commission shall--\n            ``(A) review all applications for the siting, construction, \n        expansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas import \n        facility in a region that are pending with the Commission;\n            ``(B) consult with States in the region to identify remote \n        sites for the development of potential liquefied natural gas \n        import facilities in the region;
