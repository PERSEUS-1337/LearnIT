FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Medical liability insurance premiums are soaring to the \n        highest rates since the mid-1980s.\n            (2) The average increase for 2001 was approximately 15 \n        percent, and it is predicted that rates could rise as much as \n        50 percent this year for some specialties in some regions.\n            (3) Some of the largest insurers are raising rates more \n        than 30 percent in many States.\n            (4) In 1999, jury awards in claims cases jumped 7 percent \n        compared to the previous year. In addition, according to Jury \n        Verdict Research, it cost 30 percent more to settle a suit than \n        it did just a year before in 1998.\n            (5) About 45 percent of the jury awards in 1998-99 were for \n        that amount or more, up from 39 percent during the preceding 12 \n        months.\n            (6) Physicians in West Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, \n        Mississippi, Florida, and other southeastern States are already \n        in crisis. In New York and Florida, obstetricians, \n        gynecologists, and surgeons routinely pay more than $100,000 a \n        year for $1,000,000 coverage. Some are paying more than \n        $200,000.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to implement health \ncare liability reforms designed to--\n            (1) protect access of all Americans to good health care and \n        competent physicians; and\n            (2) relieve the undue burden on physicians that is created \n        by excessive medical malpractice claims and judgments.\n\nSEC. 3. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Punitive damages may, if otherwise permitted by \napplicable State or Federal law, be awarded against any person in a \nhealth care lawsuit only if it is proven by clear and convincing \nevidence that such person acted with malicious intent to injure the \nclaimant, or that such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary \ninjury that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain to \nsuffer. In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory \ndamages is rendered against such person, no punitive damages may be \nawarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit. No demand for \npunitive damages shall be included in a health care lawsuit as \ninitially filed. A court may allow a claimant to file an amended \npleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the claimant and \nafter a finding by the court, upon review of supporting and opposing \naffidavits, or after a hearing, after weighing the evidence, that the \nclaimant has established by a substantial probability that the claimant \nwill prevail on the claim for punitive damages. At the request of any \nparty in a health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a \nseparate proceeding--\n            (1) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n        amount of such award; and\n            (2) the amount of punitive damages following a \n        determination of punitive liability.\nIf a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only to the \nclaim for punitive damages, as determined by applicable State law, \nshall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether \ncompensatory damages are to be awarded.\n    (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n            (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n        punitive damages, the trier of fact shall consider only the \n        following:\n                    (A) The severity of the harm caused by the conduct \n                of such party.\n                    (B) The duration of the conduct or any concealment \n                of it by such party.\n                    (C) The profitability of the conduct to such party.\n                    (D) The number of products sold or medical \n                procedures rendered for compensation, as the case may \n                be, by such party, of the kind causing the harm \n                complained of by the claimant.\n                    (E) Any criminal penalties imposed on such party, \n                as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n                claimant.\n                    (F) The amount of any civil fines assessed against \n                such party as a result of the conduct complained of by \n                the claimant.\n            (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n        in a health care lawsuit may be up to as much as two times the \n        amount of economic damages awarded or $250,000, whichever is \n        greater. The jury shall not be informed of this limitation.\n\nSEC. 4.
