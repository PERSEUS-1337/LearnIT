FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Black Metropolis area on Chicago, Illinois' South \n        Side has a cohesive and distinctive history as well as an \n        important streetscape that distinguishes the area as worthy of \n        designation as a National Heritage Area.\n            (2) The historic features of Chicago's Black Metropolis \n        predate the Great Migration of 1916-1919 and illustrate its \n        influence on African-American life in Chicago and the Nation as \n        a result of this demographic phenomenon in which 500,000 \n        African-Americans migrated to the North in search of work and \n        other opportunities, with 50,000 of that aggregate relocating \n        in Chicago.\n            (3) The Black Metropolis, as a setting, witnessed some of \n        the finest accomplishments in African-American contributions to \n        Chicago, the State of Illinois, and the Nation, while its \n        legally and socially proscribed citizens challenged their \n        environment and their Nation to fulfill its promise as a place \n        of opportunity for all.\n            (4) These contributions and accomplishments fall into the \n        following main categories:\n                    (A) Business and entrepreneurial pursuits.--With \n                State Street developing as the Black Metropolis' ``Wall \n                Street'', the area produced two of the largest Black \n                banking operations in the Nation in the Binga State and \n                Douglass National Banks and scores of smaller \n                businesses ranging from print shops to restaurants to \n                clothing stores to hair salons and barbershops.\n                    (B) Culture and aesthetics.--The area emerged as a \n                musical mecca ranging from jazz to gospel to delta and \n                urban blues to rhythm and blues and was home for \n                institutions such as the George Cleveland Hall Branch \n                Library, which nurtured literary giants such as \n                Langston Hughes, the South Side Community Arts Center, \n                and the DuSable Museum of African American History and \n                Culture.\n                    (C) Education.--The area includes the first public \n                secondary school in the State of Illinois built \n                specifically to accommodate the educational needs of \n                African-American students, which opened in 1934 at 4934 \n                South Wabash Avenue and was named in honor of Chicago's \n                first non-native inhabitant and trader, Jean Baptiste \n                Pointe du Sable, a Black man from Haiti, and whose \n                illustrious graduates include Nat ``King'' Cole and \n                Chicago Mayor Harold Washington.\n                    (D) Governance and politics.--From its political \n                bases in the area's Second Ward and the First \n                Congressional District, Chicago's Black Metropolis \n                proved itself a political center for all African-\n                Americans, producing the first African-American to sit \n                in Congress in the 20th century, the Honorable Oscar \n                DePriest, as well as the first African-American \n                Democratic congressman, the Honorable Arthur W. \n                Mitchell, succeeded by Honorable William L.
