FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress of the United States makes the \nfollowing findings:\n            (1) An estimated 150,000 people have died from war-related \n        causes in the Liberian civil war begun in 1989, while an \n        estimated 1,000,000 Liberians have been forced to flee to \n        neighboring countries and many others displaced internally.\n            (2) War crimes have been committed by all factions, \n        including rape, torture, summary executions of innocent \n        civilians, ritual murder, and cannibalism, with the goal of \n        terrorizing the Liberian civilian population.\n            (3) The Abuja Accord signed by Liberia's warring factions \n        in August 1995 led to the creation of a Transitional Government \n        after several years of fighting and political instability in \n        Liberia.\n            (4) The peace process has been derailed and the \n        transitional arrangement disrupted when factional fighting \n        erupted once again in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, in early \n        April 1996.\n            (5) The Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), a \n        West African peacekeeping force, originally intervened in \n        August 1990 to stabilize the situation in Liberia.\n            (6) ECOMOG forces have provided relative peace and \n        stability intermittently to the capital, Monrovia, despite \n        financial and logistical difficulties in a very hostile \n        peacekeeping environment.\n            (7) The United States Government has provided an estimated \n        $5,000,000 in support of the ECOMOG's peacekeeping efforts over \n        the past several years, $15 of which arrived in early February \n        and has made commitments for additional $30,000,000.\n            (8) The United States has provided over $100,000,000 in \n        humanitarian and development assistance to Liberia since 1994.\n            (9) The factional fighting that again erupted in the \n        capital of Liberia in April 1996, has forced thousands to flee \n        the capital to neighboring countries.\n            (10) ECOMOG's failure to contain the April violence has \n        been widely criticized by the international community, \n        including the United States.\n            (11) The United States evacuated an estimated 2,300 \n        American and foreign nationals to neighboring countries during \n        April's factional fighting in the Liberian capital.\n            (12) United States troops entered Liberia on April 11, \n        1996, equipped for combat for the purpose of evacuating \n        American citizens and to protect American embassy personnel and \n        property.\n            (13) An estimated 2,500 American troops are currently \n        deployed in and near Liberia.\n            (14) The governments of Cote d'Ivore, Burkina Faso, and \n        Guinea have contributed to the political instability and \n        violence in Liberia by providing financial, political, and \n        material support to the Liberian factions since the war erupted \n        in 1989.\n            (15) The behavior of the above mentioned governments has \n        directly contributed to the death, torture, and displacement of \n        hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians.\n            (16) The governments of the above mentioned countries have \n        ignored pleas from the international community and the United \n        States to cease their destructive activities.\n            (17) The war crimes committed by all factions in Liberia \n        are of such an egregious nature as to warrant total and \n        complete isolation of those responsible for these crimes.\n            (18) The United States and the international community \n        should bring those responsible for war crimes to justice and \n        prevent these individuals and their associates from holding \npositions of responsibility in government.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United \nStates to help bring about lasting peace and stability in Liberia and \nto work toward establishing a just and democratic society.\n\nSEC. 3 REMOVING OBSTACLES TO PEACE AND STABILITY.\n\n    (a) Policy Statement.--The governments of Cote d'Ivore, Burkina \nFaso, and Guinea have

prohibit exporting or \n        otherwise providing (by sale, lease or loan, grant, or other \n        means), directly or indirectly, any defense articles or \n        services, or licensing of defense articles or services under \n        the Arms Export Control Act to such countries.\n    (c) Waiver.--The President may waive any of the above mentioned \nmeasures if the President certifies to Congress that Cote d'Ivore, \nBurkina Faso, and Guinea have halted their assistance to Liberian \nfactions, or upon an explicit finding that such measures would not be \nin the national interest of the United States.\n    (d) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than 90 days after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a report to \nthe appropriate congressional committees detailing the activities of \nthe governments of Cote d'Ivore, Burkina Faso, and Guinea and the \nstatus of the Liberian civil war.\n\nSEC. 4.
