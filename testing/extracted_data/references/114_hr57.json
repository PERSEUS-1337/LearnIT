FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Despite the 2011 referendum for secession that \n        established the independent state of South Sudan, South \n        Sudanese women continue to experience brutal violation of their \n        human rights.\n            (2) Strong and continued United States support can ensure \n        that the advances made by South Sudanese women since July 2011 \n        when the Republic of South Sudan gained its independence will \n        continue and grow, rather than recede.\n            (3) The United States has made a substantial contribution \n        to the emergency relief and humanitarian efforts for South \n        Sudan. Completing the United States mission in South Sudan will \n        also require significant and long-term investments in \n        development and reconstruction assistance.\n            (4) An inadequate healthcare system has resulted in high \n        maternal and infant mortality rates. The maternal mortality \n        rate is 1,054 deaths per 100,000 live births, making it one of \n        the highest in the world.\n            (5) South Sudan faces many difficulties with its lack of \n        infrastructure and lacks significant human development factors, \n        which can further marginalize women.\n            (6) Over 80 percent of women and girls in South Sudan are \n        illiterate, and thus it is imperative to both secure and inform \n        women's rights within the national development.\n            (7) With the assistance of internal aid and the \n        proliferation of local women's organizations, women's equality \n        can be integrated into South Sudan's nation-building efforts.\n            (8) South Sudan has made gains in incorporating women into \n        the new regime with efforts such as inclusion in the \n        legislative assembly, thus additional support from the United \n        States serves to reinforce these ideals and implementations.\n            (9) The women of South Sudan are taking the initiative to \n        reach across the conflict divide and foster peace. Women's \n        perspectives and experiences in seeking solutions to conflicts \n        are necessary to ensure lasting peace.\n            (10) Adequate security in both urban and rural areas, \n        particularly on military borders, is essential if women and \n        girls are to exercise their human rights, work, attend school, \n        and otherwise participate in and benefit from humanitarian and \n        development programs sponsored by the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
