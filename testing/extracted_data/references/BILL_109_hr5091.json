STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish an undergraduate \nscholarship program which is designed to bring talented students of \nlimited financial means from Haiti to the United States for study at \nUnited States institutions of higher education to--\n            (1) improve the diversity and quality of educational \n        opportunities for such students;\n            (2) assist the development efforts of Haiti by providing \n        training and educational assistance to persons who can help \n        address the social and economic needs of Haiti;\n            (3) build a well-educated middle-class in Haiti which is \n        capable and willing to provide leadership in the public and \n        private sectors to help sustain the political and economic \n        progress that is sorely needed to confront the daunting \n        challenges of that country; and\n            (4) promote positive and productive relationships between \n        the United States and Haiti.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the national interest of the United States to \n        provide a stable source of financial support to give talented \n        students in Haiti the opportunity to study in the United States \n        in order to improve the range and quality of educational \n        alternatives for these students, further the development of \n        Haiti, and build enduring relationships between the people of \n        the United States and the people of Haiti.\n            (2) Providing scholarship to foreign students to study in \n        the United States has proven to be an effective means of \n        creating strong bonds between the United States and the future \n        leadership of developing countries and assisting those \n        countries to substantially further their development \n        objectives.\n            (3) Talented students from families of limited financial \n        means in Haiti traditionally have few, if any, opportunities to \n        continue their education in their own country and are less \n        likely to pursue higher education in the United States.\n            (4) In 2003, 76 percent of the population in Haiti earned \n        less than the equivalent of $2.00 per day, and 56 percent of \n        the population in the country in the same year earned less than \n        the equivalent of $1.00 per day.\n            (5) In 2003, the literacy rate of individuals in Haiti who \n        are older than 15 years of age was less than 52 percent. The \n        net primary school enrollment rate was 68 percent, as compared \n        to the average of approximately 78 percent for other low income \n        countries, such as Afghanistan and Guinea-Bissau.\n            (6) Women in Haiti are more likely to be adversely affected \n        by the dire economic and social conditions in Haiti.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The President, acting through the Administrator of \nthe United States Agency for International Development, shall provide \nscholarships (including partial assistance) for undergraduate study at \nUnited States institutions of higher education (as such term is defined \nin section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001)) by \ncitizens and nationals of Haiti who have completed their secondary \neducation with distinction and who would not otherwise have the \nopportunity to study in the United States due to financial constraints.\n    (b) Form of Scholarship; Forgiveness of Loan Repayment.--To \nencourage Haitian students to use their training and education for the \nbenefit of Haiti, each scholarship that is extended under this Act \nshall be in the form of a loan. All repayment of the loan (including \nprincipal and accrued interest) shall be forgiven upon the scholarship \nrecipient's prompt return to Haiti for a period which is at least one \nyear longer than the period spent studying in the United States under \nthe scholarship.\n    (c) Guidelines.--The scholarship program under this Act shall be \ncarried out in accordance with the pertinent guidelines of section 604 \nof the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 \n(22 U.S.C. 4704; Public Law 99-93; relating to guidelines for United \nStates scholarship program for developing countries).\n\nSEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE PEACE CORPS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the President, acting through the \nDirector of the Peace Corps, should, as soon as practicable, make \navailable again to the Government of Haiti qualified Peace Corps \nvolunteers who would serve under hardship conditions to--\n            (1) assist the people of Haiti to improve literacy rates \n        and meet other basic needs so that they can become economically \n        self-sufficient; and\n            (2) promote mutual understanding between the people of the \n        United States and the people of Haiti.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated $2,500,000 \nfor each of fiscal years 2007, 2008, and 2009, for the President, \nacting through the Administrator for the United States Agency for \nInternational Development, to carry out this Act.\n    (b) Additional Authorities.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to the \nauthorization of appropriations under subsection (a) are--\n            (1) authorized to remain available until expended; and\n            (2) shall be in addition to funds otherwise available for \n        such purposes.\n    (c) Literacy and Other Basic Education Programs.--Of the amounts \nauthorized to be appropriated to carry out chapter 1 of part I of the \nForeign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.; relating to \ndevelopment assistance) for each of fiscal years 2007, 2008, and 2009, \nand which are not allocated for assistance for countries in Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean, not less than $3,000,000 for each such \nfiscal year is authorized to be made available for assistance for \nliteracy and other basic education programs in Haiti.\n\nSEC. 7.
