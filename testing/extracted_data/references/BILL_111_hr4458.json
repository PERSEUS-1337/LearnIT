FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More than 2,300,000 people are incarcerated in Federal, \n        State, Tribal, or local correction facilities in the United \n        States, with an average stay of 30 months.\n            (2) Of the individuals now in prison, 97 percent will \n        eventually be released into communities. More than 700,000 of \n        these individuals are released into communities every year.\n            (3) A Bureau of Justice Statistics Report found 67.5 \n        percent of people released from correctional facilities in 1994 \n        were arrested again within the 3-year period after their \n        release from incarceration.\n            (4) Many of the men and women who will leave correction \n        facilities each year have mental health and alcohol or \n        substance use disorders, have low levels of education and job \n        training, and face significant barriers to employment.\n            (5) A number of studies have shown that at every stage of \n        the criminal justice process--from arrest, pretrial, \n        conviction, to incarceration--81 percent of those incarcerated \n        in Federal facilities, and 77 percent of those housed in local \n        jails have alcohol and drug use problems, or were under the \n        influence of alcohol or drugs when they committed their \n        offenses. However, only 13 percent of these individuals receive \n        drug and alcohol treatment while they are incarcerated \n        according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n            (6) Substance use disorder treatment has been proven to \n        reduce drug use, recidivism, unemployment, and homelessness, \n        according to several studies, and every dollar invested in \n        substance use disorder treatment saves taxpayers $7.46 in other \n        social costs.\n            (7) Individuals reentering society from incarceration have \n        significant educational needs. Fewer than half of those \n        released have a high school education or higher. The typical \n        Louisiana inmate has a fifth grade literacy level.\n            (8) Prison inmates interviewed as part of the Department of \n        Justice's Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative \n        evaluation identified education as topping their list of most \n        vital needs for a successful reentry into the community from \n        prison.\n            (9) According to a recent study of releases from the \n        Indiana Department of Corrections, recidivism, education, and \n        employment are closely linked. As the level of education goes \n        up, the likelihood of employment increases. As employment \n        increases, the likelihood of recidivism decreases.\n            (10) According to the National Center for Education \n        Statistics, more prison inmates were on waiting lists for \n        vocational training programs than were enrolled in such \n        programs when sampled as part of the National Assessment of \n        Adult Literacy in 2004.\n            (11) State, Tribal, and local governments have not been \n        able to maintain prison education programs in the face of a \n        prison population that has nearly doubled in the past decade. \n        As a result, according to the National Institute for Literacy, \n        the percentage of incarcerated individuals participating in \n        correctional education programs is declining.\n            (12) A study funded by the Department of Education found \n        that participation in correctional education programs lowers \n        the likelihood of an individual being incarcerated again by 29 \n        percent, and that for every dollar spent on education, more \n        than two dollars in reduced prison costs would be returned to \n        taxpayers. The Federal Bureau of Prisons also found a 33 \n        percent drop in recidivism among people detained in Federal \n        facilities who participate in vocational and apprenticeship \n        training.\n            (13) According to the National Institute of Justice, 60 \n        percent of formerly incarcerated individuals are unemployed \n        after 1 year of release. Unemployment can contribute to the \n        likelihood of repeating criminal conduct.\n            (14) Job training and placement programs for formerly \n        incarcerated people have been shown in a number of studies to \n        improve employment outcomes and reduce recidivism.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to increase public safety and reduce \nrecidivism rates by establishing a grant program under which the \nAttorney General provides competitive grants to State, Tribal, and \nlocal corrections agencies to help finance a 40-hour work week \ncurriculum of self-improvement activities for incarcerated individuals \nthat promotes responsibility, education, family, work, and parenthood.\n\nSEC. 4.
