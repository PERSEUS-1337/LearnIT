CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The right to keep and bear arms in the District of \n        Columbia has been severely restricted for many years, resulting \n        in citizens with firearms skills insufficient for proper \n        safety.\n            (2) The ability of the public to safely use firearms for \n        hunting and self defense is dependent on sufficient \n        opportunities for safety education and training.\n            (3) The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 \n        U.S.C. 669 et seq.) facilitates hunter and firearm safety \n        education and training for all States.\n            (4) Richard A. Heller of Washington, DC, has shown untiring \n        energy and courage in pursuing Second Amendment rights for the \n        citizens of the District of Columbia, resulting in the landmark \n        Supreme Court decision in the case District of Columbia v. \n        Heller (554 U.S. 570, 2008).\n\nSEC. 3.
