FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Approximately 3,500,000 students (18 percent of all \n        undergraduate students) attend institutions on a less than \n        half-time basis.\n            (2) Currently, students who are not in a degree-seeking \n        program, or attend school less than half-time, are not eligible \n        for federal financial aid.\n            (3) Individuals in the 21st century workforce will be \n        expected to enhance their skills on a regular basis in order to \n        keep up with constantly changing technology.\n            (4) Time and cost are the most frequently reported barriers \n        to participation in work-related courses.\n            (5) Access to financial aid must be more widely available \n        to people who have family or work responsibilities, or both.\n            (6) Employers will require that workers in the 21st century \n        economy have training beyond high school.\n            (7) Job security and success in the 21st century economy \n        will be dependent on workers access to lifelong learning \n        skills.\n            (8) Approximately 20 percent of United States workers are \n        landing jobs with employers that offer job security, training, \n        and opportunities for lifelong learning.\n            (9) Approximately 40 percent of American workers are not \n        receiving education after high school. These workers may not be \n        able to compete for the best jobs in the 21st century economy.\n            (10) As America is forced to compete increasingly in a \n        global marketplace, employers must have the best trained \n        workforce in the world.\n            (11) Employers must have the domestic capacity to fill the \n        jobs of the 21st century economy.\n\nSEC. 3.
