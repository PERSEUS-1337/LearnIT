FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Price gouging in emergencies, including natural \n        disasters and other emergencies, is reprehensible commercial \n        activity.\n            (2) Emergencies place great strains on commercial and \n        consumer relationships in the areas affected.\n            (3) Emergencies can strain commercial and consumer \n        relationships in areas beyond those directly damaged or \n        affected by the emergency.\n            (4) It is an unfortunate truth that some will try to take \n        advantage of others in emergency situations by price gouging \n        for consumer and other commercial goods or services.\n            (5) Price gouging can take place prior to, during, and \n        following natural disasters and other emergencies.\n            (6) Price gouging in commercial and consumer settings \n        affects interstate commerce.\n            (7) Price gouging--\n                    (A) distorts markets without regard to State lines;\n                    (B) disturbs and interferes with the flow of \n                commodities and services across State lines; and\n                    (C) creates or exacerbates shortages and \n                interruptions of supplies of materials across State \n                lines.\n            (8) It is in the interest of the United States to prohibit \n        and deter price gouging.\n\nSEC. 3.
