FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Labor unions make significant political contributions \n        and expenditures that directly or indirectly influence the \n        election of candidates and support or oppose political causes. \n        Decisions to use union dues for political contributions and \n        expenditures are usually made by union leadership and \n        management, rather than union membership.\n            (2) Unions, acting through their management, should be \n        obligated to conduct business in the best interests of their \n        membership.\n            (3) Historically, union members have not had a way to know, \n        or to influence, the political activities of unions that are \n        supposed to represent them. Union members and the public have a \n        right to know how unions are spending members' dues to make \n        political contributions or expenditures benefitting candidates, \n        political parties, and political causes.\n            (4) Unions should be accountable to their membership in \n        making political contributions or expenditures affecting \n        Federal governance and public policy. Requiring the express \n        approval of a union's membership for political contributions or \n        expenditures will establish necessary accountability.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCLOSURE AND APPROVAL OF CERTAIN POLITICAL EXPENDITURES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title II of the Labor-Management Reporting and \nDisclosure Act (29 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) is amended by inserting after \nsection 201 the following:\n\n``SEC. 201A.
