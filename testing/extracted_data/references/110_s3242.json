TEMPORARY DUTY SUSPENSION AND RELIQUIDATION OF CERTAIN DIGITAL-\n              TO-ANALOG CONVERTER BOXES AND TELEVISION TUNERS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act \n        of 2005 (Public Law 109-171) provided that all full power \n        television broadcasts be switched to digital format on February \n        17, 2009.\n            (2) Nearly 20,000,000 United States consumers do not \n        subscribe to cable or satellite television service and millions \n        more have untethered television sets that only receive over-\n        the-air signals.\n            (3) Upon the conversion to the digital format mandated by \n        Congress, these households will no longer receive any \n        television signal unless they are equipped with digital-to-\n        analog converters.\n            (4) Low and middle income families, rural residents, \n        American Indians, senior citizens, the infirmed and the \n        physically and mentally impaired are less likely to own \n        television sets capable of receiving a digital signal without \n        the purchase of digital-to-analog converters.\n            (5) The conversion to an all digital format should not \n        place an unfair economic burden on those families of the United \n        States least able to afford it.\n            (6) The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is \n        collecting an import tax, or duty, on converter boxes, which \n        adds to the costs of converting to receiving a digital signal.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the costs \nto convert to an all digital format should be affordable for all people \nof the United States, and especially those of lower incomes.\n    (c) Definition of Digital-to-Analog Converter Box.--The U.S. Notes \nat the beginning of subchapter II of chapter 99 of the Harmonized \nTariff Schedule of the United States is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n    ``20. For purposes of headings 9902.85.28 and 9902.85.29, the term \n`digital-to-analog converter box' means a stand-alone device that does \nnot contain features or functions except those necessary to enable a \nconsumer to convert any channel broadcast in the digital television \nservice into a format that the consumer can display on television \nreceivers designed to receive and display signals only in the analog \ntelevision service, but may also include a remote control device.''.\n    (d) Temporary Duty Suspensions.--\n            (1) Digital-to-analog converter boxes.--Subchapter II of \n        chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n        States is amended by inserting in numerical sequence the \n        following new heading:\n\n\n``     9902.85.28      Digital-to-analog   Free         No change        No change        On or before 12/  ''.\n                        converter boxes                                                    31/2009.......\n                        (provided for in\n                        subheading\n                        8528.71.40)......\n\n            (2) Certain television tuners.--Such subchapter is further \n        amended by inserting in numerical sequence the following new \n        heading:\n\n\n``     9902.85.29      Television tuners   Free         No change        No change        On or before 12/  ''.\n                        used in the                                                        31/2009.......\n                        United States\n                        assembly of\n                        digital-to-analog\n                        converter boxes\n                        (provided for in\n                        subheading\n                        8529.90.29)......\n\n    (e) Retroactive Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection \n(d) apply to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for \nconsumption, on or after December 1, 2007.\n    (f) Reliquidation of Entries.--\n            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 514 of the Tariff \n        Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1514) or any other provision of law and \n        subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), the U.S. Customs \n        and Border Protection shall, not later than 90 days after the \n        receipt of a request described in paragraph (2), liquidate or \n        reliquidate as applicable any entry described in paragraph (4) \n        at the applicable rate under subchapter II of chapter 99 of the \n        Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, as amended by \n        subsection (d).\n            (2) Requests.--Liquidation or reliquidation may be made \n        under paragraph (1) with respect to an entry described in \n        paragraph (4) only if--\n                    (A) a request therefore is filed with U.S. Customs \n                and Border Protection not later than 90 days after the \n                date of the enactment of this Act; and\n                    (B) the request contains sufficient information to \n                enable U.S. Customs and Border Protection to locate the \n                entry or reconciliation entry if it cannot be located.\n            (3) Payment of amounts owed.--Any amounts owed by the \n        United States pursuant to the liquidation or reliquidation of \n        any entry under paragraph (1) shall be paid, with interest, not \n        later than 180 days after the date of such liquidation or \n        reliquidation.\n            (4) Entries described.--The entries referred to in \n        paragraph (1) are the entries, or withdrawals from warehouse \n        for consumption, of goods to which duty-free treatment is \n        provided by subsections (d) and (e)--\n                    (A) that was made on or after December 1, 2007; and\n                    (B) with respect to which there would have been no \n                duty if subsection (d) of this Act had applied to such \n                entry or withdrawal."
