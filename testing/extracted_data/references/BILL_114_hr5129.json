EXTENSION OF FOREST SERVICE RECREATION PRIORITY USE PERMITS.\n\n    Where the holder of a special use permit for outfitting and guiding \nthat authorizes priority use has submitted a request for renewal of \nsuch permit in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the \nSecretary of Agriculture shall have the authority to grant the holder \none or more extensions of the exiting permit for additional items not \nto exceed 5 years in the aggregate, as necessary to allow the Secretary \nto complete the renewal process and to avoid the interruption of \nservices under such permit. Before granting an extension under this \nsection, the Secretary shall take all reasonable and appropriate steps \nto complete the renewal process before the expiration of the special \nuse permit."
