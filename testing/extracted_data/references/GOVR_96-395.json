    "content": "Although the debate on the American Land Sovereignty Protection bill was often couched in terms which included U.N. influence over U.S. parks andmonuments, supporters of the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act were primarily concerned that a lack ofa congressional role in designating the sites anda lack of congressional oversight of implementation of the act undermines the congressional role under theConstitution to make rules governing land belongingto the United States. As the House Resources Committee web site on the legislation stated: \"By using theseinternational designations, the Executive Branch isable to guide domestic land use policies without consulting Congress.\" (2) Supporters express concern that even though there may be no internationalor U.N. directcontrol of U.S. sites, federal agency managers may take into account the international rules of the World Heritageprogram in making land use decisions, or usethe designation to undermine local land use decisions, often without the advice or even the knowledge of localauthorities or property owners.  The World Heritage Convention does not give the United Nations authority over U.S. sites. The Department of State has testified that under the terms of theWorld Heritage Convention, management and sovereignty over the sites remain with the country where the site islocated. Supporters of the World Heritagesystem note that member countries nominate sites for the World Heritage List voluntarily and agree to develop lawsand procedures to protect them using theirown constitutional procedures. Most of the U.S. sites named have already been accorded protection in law asnational monuments or parks. In commenting onthe bill, the Clinton Administration stated that the designation does not give the United Nations the authority toaffect land management decisions within theUnited States and has not been utilized to exclude Congress from land management decisions. The Department ofState noted that the Convention itself has norole or authority beyond listing sites and offering technical advice and assistance. Supporters of the conventionassert that World Heritage status has been theimpetus behind closer cooperation between federal agencies and state and local authorities. Inclusion on the World Heritage List increases knowledge and interest in sites throughout the world. Many countries use the World Heritage designation toincrease tourism to site areas. Designation also brings international attention and support to protect endangeredsites. In 1993, the World Heritage Committeesupported the United States in protecting Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve by publicizing U.S. concerns abouta Canadian open pit mine near the Bay andreminding the Canadian government of its obligations under the Convention to protect the site. In 1996,international concern, including concern raised by U.S.citizens, was instrumental in changing the plans of a Polish company to build a shopping center near AuschwitzConcentration Camp in Poland, a World HeritageSite. In March of 2000, Mexico dropped plans to develop a salt plant on the shores of a gray whale breeding groundin a protected Mexican area designated as aWorld Heritage Site.  Supporters of legislation restricting U.S. World Heritage participation express concern about the impact of the designation on private property near the sites. Theysuggest that agreeing to manage the site in accordance with the international convention may have an impact on theuse of private land nearby, or may even be anindirect way of complying with treaties which the Congress has not approved. They claim that advocacy groupsuse federal regulations and international land usedesignations to frustrate the public land management decision-making process. The Interior Department hastestified, on the other hand, that the nominationprocedure includes open public meetings and congressional notification on sites being considered. In June 1995, the U.S. Department of the Interior notified the World Heritage Committee that Yellowstone was in danger and requested an on-site visit. In afollow up letter, the Department of the Interior noted actions which the United States was taking to address thesituation. A team organized by the World HeritageCenter reviewed actual and potential threats to the park. In December 1995, based on this visit and consultationswith U.S. government officials, the WorldHeritage Committee placed Yellowstone on the List of World Heritage in Danger, citing threats posed by plans fora gold mine just over 1 mile from the Park, theintroduction of non-native fish into Yellowstone Lake, and activities to eliminate brucellosis from Park bison herds. The World Heritage Committee noted thatany response to the threat was a U.S. domestic decision and asked that the U.S. government keep the committeeinformed of actions taken by the United Statesand to assess what more must be done in order to remove Yellowstone from the endangered list.  Both the non native fish and the Park bison herds are the subject of ongoing federal, state, and local discussions.The gold mine issue has been resolved. Congress appropriated funds to compensate the mine owners for not developing it. The non-native fish problemis ultimately unresolvable, but Park authoritiesare working to minimize the number of non native fish in Yellowstone lake. The Administration will continue toreport annually to the World HeritageCommittee on both Yellowstone and Everglades National Parks until they are removed from the endangered list. The World Heritage Committee will continueto list both parks on the World Heritage in Danger List in consultation with the United States. The Decembermeeting of the World Heritage Committee will bethe next opportunity for the United States to report on actions taken to eliminate the danger to the parks, or todiscuss changes to their designation. It is too earlyto know what the Bush Administration position will be on this topic. 1. (back) Convention concerning the protection ofthe world cultural and natural heritage. 27 UST 37. 2.
