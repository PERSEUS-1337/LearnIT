    "content": "Between 1819 and 1857, the room currently called Statuary Hall served as the Hall of the House of Representatives. Upon the completion of the current House chamber in 1857, the fate of the old \"Hall of the House\" was debated for many years. Perhaps the simplest was that it be converted into additional space for the Library of Congress, which was still housed in the Capitol. More drastic was the suggestion that the entire Hall be dismantled and replaced by two floors of committee rooms. Eventually, the idea of using the chamber as an art gallery was approved, and works intended for the Capitol extensions were put on exhibit; among these was the plaster model for the Statue of Freedom, which was later cast in bronze for the Capitol dome. The lack of wall space effectively prevented the hanging of large paintings, but the room seemed well suited to the display of statuary. Beginning in November 1879, Statuary Hall was first used for events. The first two events were a reception and dinner for the Society of the Army of the Cumberland on November 20, 1879, and a ceremony to close the Centennial Safe on November 22, 1879. Today, Statuary Hall is the home to many of the statues in the National Statuary Hall collection, which consists of two statues from each state. A room in the House Wing of the Capitol may be reserved in one of two ways: through a chamber resolution or pursuant to the Speaker's authority. House Rule I, clause 3 provides the Speaker with the authority to assign unappropriated rooms (i.e., not already assigned to a committee, House leadership, or an officer of the House). House Rule I, clause 3 states Except as otherwise provided by rule or law, the Speaker shall have general control of the Hall of the House, the corridors and passages in the part of the Capitol assigned to the use of the House, and the disposal of unappropriated rooms in that part of the Capitol. For rooms jointly controlled by the House and Senate (e.g., the Rotunda and Emancipation Hall), a concurrent resolution is generally required to authorize use. Initially adopted in 1811 to provide the Speaker with approval authority over events in the House chamber, clause 3 was last amended in 1911, to provide the Speaker with control over unappropriated rooms elsewhere in the House Wing of the Capitol. Since 1911, the Speaker has generally authorized use of rooms in the House Wing of the Capitol not otherwise appropriated. Since 2005, 170 events have been held in Statuary Hall. The House Sergeant at Arms, whose office provided data for this report, defines an event as activity that prevents public access to Statuary Hall for a period of time. As a result, activities such as a brief wreath laying at a particular statue are not included. Table 1 reports the total number of events held in Statuary Hall since 2005. The Appendix provides the date of each event and a brief description. Following receipt of the data from the House Sergeant at Arms, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) examined the events and divided them into four categories: (1) receptions and dinners, (2) ceremonies, (3) media events, and (4) memorial services. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category and examples of activities. Table 2 reports the number of events since 2005, by category. The largest percentage of events held in Statuary Hall (57.6%) were receptions or dinners, hosted by both official congressional entities and private groups. For example, the Joint Congressional Committee on the Inaugural Ceremonies held the Inaugural Luncheon in Statuary Hall in 2005, 2009, and 2013; and the Capitol Historical Society held a reception for new Members of Congress in the Hall in 2005 and 2013. Ceremonies account for 28.8% of the events held in Statuary Hall since 2005. These ceremonies include presentations of awards, unveiling of official portraits, commemorations of event anniversaries, formal wreath layings, and prayer services. For example, the annual National Moment of Remembrance is held in Statuary Hall. In addition, prior to moving the statue to Emancipation Hall in the Capitol Visitor Center, an annual lei draping ceremony at King Kamehameha statue was held in Statuary Hall. Statuary Hall has also been occasionally used as the location for media availability, primarily after a presidential address to a joint session of Congress in the House chamber. Media events represent 5.9% of the events held in Statuary Hall. Since 2005, 13 memorial services (7.6%) for current or former Members of Congress have been held in Statuary Hall: for Representatives Robert Matsui (January 5, 2005); Juanita Millender-McDonald (May 17, 2007); Tom Lantos (February 14, 2008); Stephanie Tubbs Jones (September 10, 2008); John P. Murtha (March 30, 2010); Donald M. Payne (April 25, 2012); Speaker Thomas Foley (October 29, 2013); Mark Takai (September 14, 2016); Robert Michel (March 9, 2017); Louise Slaughter (April 18, 2018); and since 2016, an annual U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress memorial service to honor former Members who died in the past year. Since January 1, 2005, 170 events have been held in Statuary Hall. Table A-1 contains a chronological list of these events, the date of the event, and the event type."
