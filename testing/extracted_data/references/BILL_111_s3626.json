FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) approximately 30 percent of the total quantity of \n        energy consumed in the United States is used to provide thermal \n        energy for heating and cooling building space, domestic hot \n        water, and industrial processes;\n            (2) thermal energy is an essential, but often overlooked, \n        segment of the national energy mix;\n            (3) district energy systems use 1 or more central plants to \n        provide thermal energy to multiple buildings that range in size \n        from campus applications to systems heating entire towns or \n        cities;\n            (4) district energy systems provide sustainable thermal \n        energy infrastructure by producing and distributing thermal \n        energy from combined heat power, sources of industrial or \n        municipal surplus heat, and from renewable sources such as \n        biomass, geothermal, and solar energy;\n            (5) as of 2009, the United States had approximately 2,500 \n        operating district energy systems;\n            (6) district energy systems provide advantages that support \n        secure, affordable, renewable, and sustainable energy for the \n        United States, including--\n                    (A) use of local fuels or waste heat sources that \n                keep jobs and energy dollars in local economies;\n                    (B) stable, predictable energy costs for businesses \n                and industry;\n                    (C) reduction in reliance on fossil fuels;\n                    (D) reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases; and\n                    (E) flexibility to modify fuel sources in response \n                to future changes in fuel availability and prices and \n                development of new technologies;\n            (7) district energy helps cut peak power demand and reduce \n        power transmission and distribution system constraints by--\n                    (A) meeting air conditioning demand through \n                delivery of chilled water produced with heat from \n                combined heat and power or other energy sources; and\n                    (B) shifting power demand through thermal storage \n                and, with combined heat and power, generating power \n                near load centers;\n            (8) combined heat and power systems increase energy \n        efficiency of power plants by capturing thermal energy and \n        using the thermal energy to provide heating and cooling, more \n        than doubling the efficiency of conventional power plants;\n            (9) according to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, if the \n        United States was able to increase combined heat and power from \n        approximately 9 percent of total electric generation capacity \n        to 20 percent by 2030, the increase would--\n                    (A) save as much energy as half of all household \n                energy consumption;\n                    (B) create approximately 1,000,000 new jobs;\n                    (C) avoid more than 800,000,000 metric tons of \n                carbon dioxide emissions annually, which is equivalent \n                to taking half of all United States passenger vehicles \n                off the road; and\n                    (D) save hundreds of millions of barrels of oil \n                equivalent; and\n            (10) constraints to significant expansion of district \n        energy and combined heat and power include--\n                    (A) the lack of economic value in the energy \n                marketplace for the environmental, grid support, energy \n                security, and local economic development benefits of \n                district energy systems;\n                    (B) relatively high project development costs due \n                to the variety of institutional, legal, and technical \n                issues that must be addressed; and\n                    (C) the high costs of debt service, particularly in \n                the early years of systems development before a broad \n                base of customers has connected.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to encourage the implementation of \nthermal energy infrastructure order to--\n            (1) increase energy efficiency;\n            (2) increase use of renewable energy resources;\n            (3) revitalize the infrastructure of the cities and \n        institutions of the United States;\n            (4) reduce local and regional air pollution;\n            (5) reduce emissions of greenhouse gases;\n            (6) reduce emissions of ozone-depleting refrigerants; and\n            (7) enhance power grid reliability and overall energy \n        supply reliability and energy security.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States that, in energy policy \ndevelopment and program implementation, the following factors should be \nconsidered:\n            (1) Thermal energy represents a significant part of the \n        energy requirements of the United States, providing building \n        heating and cooling, domestic hot water, and industrial process \n        energy.\n            (2) There are many opportunities for meeting thermal energy \n        requirements directly through renewable energy sources or \n        recycled energy (such as recovered waste heat), without \n        generation of electricity.\n            (3) Policies and incentives for encouraging renewable \n        energy and energy efficiency should address thermal energy as \n        well as electricity.\n            (4) District energy systems provide an important means of \n        delivering sustainable thermal energy to consumers, and provide \n        energy security benefits, by--\n                    (A) cutting peak power demand;\n                    (B) reducing power transmission and distribution \n                system constraints; and\n                    (C) providing flexibility to modify fuel sources in \n                response to future changes in fuel availabilities and \n                prices and development of new technologies.\n\n TITLE I--MODIFICATION OF CREDIT FOR ELECTRICITY PRODUCED FROM CERTAIN \n                           RENEWABLE SOURCES\n\nSEC. 101.
