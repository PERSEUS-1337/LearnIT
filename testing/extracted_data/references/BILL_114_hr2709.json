CAREER SUPPORT FOR SKILLED, INTERNATIONALLY EDUCATED HEALTH \n              PROFESSIONALS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Association of Schools of Public \n        Health, projections indicate a nationwide shortage of up to \n        250,000 public health workers needed by 2020.\n            (2) Similar trends are projected for other health \n        professions indicating shortages across disciplines, including \n        within the fields of nursing (500,000 by 2025), dentistry \n        (15,000 by 2025), pharmacy (38,000 by 2030), mental and \n        behavioral health, primary care (46,000 by 2025), and community \n        and allied health.\n            (3) A nationwide health workforce shortage will result in \n        serious health threats and more severe and costly health care \n        needs, due to, in part, a delayed response to food-borne \n        outbreaks, emerging infectious diseases, natural disasters, \n        fewer cancer screenings, and delayed treatment.\n            (4) Vulnerable and underserved populations and health \n        professional shortage areas will be most severely impacted by \n        the health workforce shortage.\n            (5) According to the Migration Policy Institute, over \n        2,000,000 college-educated immigrants in the United States \n        today are unemployed or underemployed in low- or semi-skilled \n        jobs that fail to draw on their education and expertise.\n            (6) Approximately 2 out of every 5 internationally educated \n        immigrants are unemployed or underemployed.\n            (7) According to Drexel University Center for Labor Markets \n        and Policy, underemployment for internationally educated \n        immigrant women is 28 percent higher than for their male \n        counterparts.\n            (8) According to the Drexel University Center for labor \n        markets and policy, the mean annual earnings of underemployed \n        immigrants were $32,000, or 43 percent less than United States \n        born college graduates employed in the college labor market.\n            (9) According to Upwardly Global and the Welcome Back \n        Initiative, with proper guidance and support, underemployed \n        skilled immigrants typically increase their income by 215 \n        percent to 900 percent.\n            (10) According to the Brookings Institution and the \n        Partnership for a New American Economy, immigrants working in \n        the health workforce are, on average, better educated than \n        United States-born workers in the health workforce.\n    (b) Grants to Eligible Entities.--\n            (1) Authority to provide grants.--The Secretary of Health \n        and Human Services acting through the Bureau of Health \n        Workforce within the Health Resources and Services \n        Administration, the National Institute on Minority Health and \n        Health Disparities, or the Office of Minority Health (in this \n        section referred to as the ``Secretary'') may award grants to \n        eligible entities to carry out activities described in \n        subsection (c).\n            (2) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n        this section, an entity shall--\n                    (A) be a clinical, public health, or health \n                services organization, a community-based or nonprofit \n                entity, an academic institution, a faith-based \n                organization, a State, county, or local government, an \n                Area Health Education Center, or another entity \n                determined appropriate by the Secretary;
