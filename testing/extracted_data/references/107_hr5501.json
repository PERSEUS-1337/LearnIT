SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Higher Education \nAccrediting Agency Responsibility Act of 2002''.\n    (b) References to Higher Education Act of 1965.--Except as \notherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or \nrepeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \nsection or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be \nmade to a section or other provision of the Higher Education Act of \n1965.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Accrediting agencies were originally intended to \n        provide voluntary, nongovernmental oversight of institutions of \n        higher education.\n            (2) However, Congress has allowed accreditors to become \n        gatekeepers of more than $40,000,000,000 of Federal student aid \n        funds due to such agencies role, enshrined in current Federal \n        law, to help determine an institution's eligibility to \n        participate in Federal student aid programs.\n            (3) More effective and less costly mechanisms are already \n        in place to protect students and parents, as no institution can \n        receive Federal funds until the Department of Education \n        certifies its financial and administrative capacity. \n        Additionally, the amount of useful information publicly \n        available about the quality of academic institutions has grown \n        dramatically in recent years and now far exceeds the minimal \n        amount conveyed by the accreditation system.\n            (4) It is virtually unknown for an institution to be denied \n        accreditation because of low educational values, despite \n        growing public concern that American college graduates are \n        lacking the skills necessary for participation in civic life.\n            (5) The time and effort required of institutions of higher \n        education to comply with the accreditation process imposes \n        costs which must ultimately be borne by students and parents.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To refocus the purpose of accreditation on providing \n        comparative information about the quality of institutions of \n        higher education, rather than determining student aid \n        eligibility, which should properly be the responsibility of the \n        Department of Education.\n            (2) To end the virtual monopoly that today's accrediting \n        agencies enjoy, and require them to operate in a competitive \n        environment like any other industry.\n\nSEC. 3.
