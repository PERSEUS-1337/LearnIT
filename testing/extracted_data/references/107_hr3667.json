    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Self-Sufficiency Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A principal objective of programs under the Personal \n        Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 \n        (PRWORA) is to move economically disadvantaged adults toward \n        self-sufficiency through employment that pays a wage and \n        benefits at a level that will allow these adults to support \n        themselves and their dependents without public assistance.\n            (2) While there is evidence that PRWORA has been successful \n        in moving people off welfare and into jobs, it is not known \n        whether these individuals are on the path to economic \n        independence. There is no standardized method for measuring the \n        extent to which PRWORA is meeting the objective of moving \n        families toward self-sufficiency or the impact of public work \n        supports. There is no requirement that States, Congress, or the \n        Administration ascertain the point at which individual families \n        living in specific locations will reach self-sufficiency.\n            (3) At the same time, there is no way of determining what \n        programs have been successful in preparing individuals for the \n        workforce, helping them retain jobs, and moving them in the \n        direction of economic independence.\n            (4) Absent this information, the Congress cannot fully \n        evaluate the success of welfare reform or ensure that state and \n        federal funds are being allocated where they will do the most \n        good.\n            (5) States should understand when families reach self-\n        sufficiency, what programmatic investments help families toward \n        economic independence, and should be rewarded for putting \n        programs in place that will ensure the long-term success of \n        welfare leavers by helping them move toward economic \n        independence.\n\nSEC. 3. SELF-SUFFICIENCY STANDARDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 402 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n602) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, subject to \n        subsection (b),'' after ``the Secretary has found''; and\n            (2) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections \n        (c) and (d), respectively, and by inserting after subsection \n        (a) the following:\n    ``(b) Self-Sufficiency Standards.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may not find that a State \n        plan includes the material described in subsection (a) unless \n        the plan includes a specification of the income needs of \n        families (in this part referred to as `self-sufficiency \n        standards'), adopted or developed by the State, based on family \n        size, the number and ages of children in the family, and sub-\n        State geographical considerations.\n            ``(2) Criteria.--The State self-sufficiency standards shall \n        separately specify the monthly costs of housing, food, child \n        care, transportation, health care, other basic needs, and taxes \n        (including tax benefits), and shall be determined using \n        national, State, and local data on the cost of purchasing goods \n        and services in the marketplace.\n            ``(3) Categories of families.--The State self-sufficiency \n        standards shall categorize families--\n                    ``(A) by whether there are 1 or 2 adults in the \n                family;\n                    ``(B) by whether there are 0, 1, 2, 3, or more than \n                3 children in the family;
