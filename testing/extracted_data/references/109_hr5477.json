FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Invention, the wellspring of innovation, is the basic \n        source of the economic wellbeing and quality of life enjoyed in \n        the developed world today.\n            (2) There have been enormous differences in the \n        capabilities of different societies to invent, to carry the \n        inventions into practice, and to adopt the inventions of other \n        societies, and maintaining those capabilities will be key for \n        the future wellbeing of the United States.\n            (3) Federal support of individual investigators doing basic \n        research has been effective in leading to scientific discovery, \n        but less effective in enabling those investigators to turn \n        those discoveries into invention.\n            (4) The process of invention and the traits of the \n        inventive mind can be enhanced by education and fostered by \n        appropriate societal support.\n            (5) In formal education, every student deserves the \n        opportunity to learn more about the nature of invention and to \n        acquire some simple basic skills and generative attitudes.\n\nSEC. 3. INVENTIVENESS CURRICULUM MATERIALS.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Program.--The National Science Foundation \nshall establish a competitive grant program, with the goal of \ndeveloping, and making available for use at the elementary, secondary, \nand undergraduate levels within 2 years after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, curriculum tools that will help foster inventiveness.\n    (b) Materials.--The curriculum materials developed under the \nprogram established under this section shall--\n            (1) leverage existing knowledge on how the inventive mind \n        works on behalf of a more inventive society to address key \n        challenges of today's world, through--\n                    (A) emphasizing adventure, excitement, and mystery \n                as much as the analytical and technical side of \n                invention;\n                    (B) encouraging inventive thinking that crosses \n                boundaries of convention, expectation, and disciplines; \n                and\n                    (C) anticipating that there will be unanticipated \n                consequences of invention, an enduring lesson from \n                history;\n            (2) strengthen those aspects of the education process that \n        enhance creativity in general, and technological inventiveness \n        in particular, including--\n                    (A) open-ended, problem solving assignments;\n                    (B) historical study of the social and political \n                implications of inventions and new technologies;\n                    (C) universities seeking research projects and \n                external collaborations, and policies that promote \n                inventive creativity of students and faculty;\n                    (D) appropriate supporting infrastructure, which \n                should be fostered to enable teachers to utilize new \n                teaching methods and materials; and\n                    (E) hands-on activities, visual thinking \n                experiences, historical case studies, and ``how things \n                work'' exercises for all students, not just engineering \n                or science majors; and\n            (3) initiate, strengthen, and expand initiatives to involve \n        young people directly in the invention process, including--\n                    (A) efforts to support teams in high schools and \n                colleges that work collaboratively with the private or \n                local government sectors to invent useful products or \n                processes;\n                    (B) realistic, open-ended, design-oriented \n                activities, which can be included in university \n                engineering courses, with the primary goal of teaching \n                the important principles of a field in ways that will \n                promote inventive creativity in the application of \n                these principles;\n                    (C) a network of community centers, ``invention \n                homes'', or ``free workshops'' that would provide \n                access to the tools, materials, and flexible space so \n                important to invention, to be based in schools, \n                museums, or other locations;\n                    (D) workshops that would allow teachers to learn by \n                experience how to effectively lead a project-based \n                classroom; and\n                    (E) networks of innovators and social entrepreneurs \n                both domestically and internationally.\n    (c) Dissemination.--The National Science Foundation shall develop \nand implement measures, including workshops, for the dissemination of \ncurriculum tools developed under this section.\n\nSEC. 4. INVENTIVENESS PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.\n\n    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nNational Science Foundation shall implement a public awareness and \noutreach campaign relating to invention and inventiveness. The public \nawareness and outreach campaign shall--\n            (1) foster public events, including competitions, public \n        displays, traveling exhibitions, and other ways to increase the \n        public profile of inventors and inventiveness; and\n            (2) establish additional awards and prizes honoring \n        inventors, with the objective of stimulating invention in areas \n        of greatest need, as well as of raising the stature of \n        inventors and invention in the eyes of young people.\n\nSEC. 5. ENGINEERING AND SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH PROGRAM ON INVENTION.\n\n    The National Science Foundation shall establish engineering and \nsocial science research programs on the process of invention and the \nteaching of inventiveness. The research programs shall--\n            (1) be aimed at a deeper understanding of the creative mind \n        and creative environment, the measurement of inventiveness, \n        diffusion of teaching of inventive creativity, and rapid \n        learning as part of the crossing of boundaries of convention, \n        expectation, and disciplines that is at the heart of invention;\n            (2) include study of the influence of flexible learning \n        environments and role of parents, teachers, mentors, and \n        broader social institutions;\n            (3) study the impact on inventive creativity of past major \n        programs of Federal and State support for elementary, \n        secondary, and higher education;\n            (4) identify the major societal sectors that have had \n        significant effects on major inventions and innovations of the \n        recent past, and study the role of each such sector, the \n        importance of intersector interactions, and the impact of \n        patent and other relevant law; and\n            (5) assess how invention could make a difference to the \n        sustainable development needs of the poorest regions and \n        nations, including research to understand and promote social \n        enterprise, cultivation of creativity on a local level, surveys \n        of key technology gaps, and surveys of available financial \n        resources."
