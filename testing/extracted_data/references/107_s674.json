    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Affordable Health Care \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than 43,000,000 Americans currently lack health \n        insurance.\n            (2) The great majority of the uninsured are members of \n        families with at least 1 full-time worker.\n            (3) Nearly half of the uninsured workers are in firms with \n        fewer than 25 employees.\n            (4) Small employers generally face higher costs for health \n        insurance than do larger firms, which makes small firms less \n        likely to offer coverage.\n            (5) According to the Congressional Budget Office, only 42 \n        percent of small-firm establishments with fewer than 50 \n        employees offer health insurance to their employees.\n            (6) The smaller the firm size, the less likely it is to \n        offer coverage. According to the Employee Benefit Research \n        Institute (EBRI), in 1998, among private sector workers in \n        firms with fewer than 10 employees, 27.4 percent received \n        health insurance from their employers in their own name, \n        compared with 66.5 percent of workers in firms with 1,000 or \n        more employees.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide new tax \nincentives to make health insurance more affordable for small \nbusinesses, thus encouraging those businesses that do not currently \noffer health insurance to do so and discouraging businesses that \ncurrently do offer heatlh insurance from dropping coverage because of \nrising costs.\n\nSEC. 3.
