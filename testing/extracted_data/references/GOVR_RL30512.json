    "content": "Congress appropriated $2.649 billion for legislative branch operationsin FY2001, a 6.6% increase overthe FY2000 appropriation of $2.486 billion. The FY2001 funding level includes the appropriation in theregular annual legislative branch appropriations bill; a supplemental appropriation of $118 million in amiscellaneous appropriations bill; and a rescission of 0.22%. Regular FY2001 Appropriations . The first regular FY2001 legislative branch appropriations bill( H.R. 4516 ) approved by Congress was vetoed by President Clinton in late October 2000. Seven weeks later, on December 14, a new legislative branch appropriations bill ( H.R. 5657 ),which contained the funding levels as approved in the original bill, was introduced and incorporated byreference in the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( H.R. 4577 ). The latter act wassigned into law ( P.L. 106-554 ) on December 21, 2000. During initial consideration of the regular legislative branch bill, the House Appropriations Committee,in compliance with budget allocation restrictions, established funding for FY2001 at 5.5% less than the levelappropriated for FY2000. When the Senate took up the bill it approved an overall 3.7 % increase. TheHouse later restored most of the funds cut at the committee level when it adopted a manager's amendmentcontaining an additional $95.7 million in funding during floor consideration of the House bill. Thecompromise bill approved by the conference committee provided for a 2.1% over FY2000.  Additional Regular Appropriations and Rescission . A second bill ( H.R. 5666 ), whichcontained an additional $118 million in regular FY2001 legislative branch appropriations funds, and a 0.22%across-the-broad cut in FY2001 appropriations, was also incorporated by reference into P.L. 106-554 .  From October 1, the beginning of FY2001, to December 21, 2000, the legislative branch was fundedat its FY2000 level in continuing resolutions.  Effective in FY1978, the legislative branch appropriations bill has beendivided into two titles. TitleI, Congressional Operations, contains budget authorities for activities directly serving Congress. Includedin this title are the budgets of the House, the Senate, Joint Items (joint House and Senate activities), theOffice of Compliance, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) (exceptthe Library of Congress (LOC) buildings and grounds), the Congressional Research Service (CRS) withinthe Library of Congress, and congressional printing and binding activities of the Government Printing Office(GPO). Title II, Related Agencies, contains budgets for activities not directly supporting Congress. Includedin this title are the budgets of the Botanic Garden, the Library of Congress (except the CongressionalResearch Service), the Library buildings and grounds maintained by the Architect of the Capitol, theGovernment Printing Office (except congressional printing and binding costs), and the General AccountingOffice (GAO). Periodically since FY1978, the legislative bill has contained additional titles for suchpurposes as capital improvements and special one-time functions. In FY2000, Title I budget authority was 69.7% of the total appropriation of $2.486 billion, includinga rescission and supplementals. (1) Title II budgetauthority was 30.3% of the total appropriation. In addition,there is legislative budget authority that is not included in the annual legislative branch appropriations actor supplemental appropriations acts. It includes permanent budget authority for both federal funds and trustfunds, and other budget authority. (2) Permanent federal funds are available as the result of previously enacted legislation and do not requireannual action. (3) Permanent trust funds are monies held in accounts credited with collections from specific sourcesearmarked by law for a defined purpose. Trust funds do not appear in the annual legislative bill since theyare not budget authority. They are included in the U.S. Budget either as budget receipts or offsettingcollections. (4) The Budget also contains some non-legislative entities within the legislative branch budget. They arefunded in other appropriation bills, but are placed in the legislative section by the Office of Management andBudget for bookkeeping purposes. (5)  Table 1. Status of LegislativeBranch Appropriations, FY2001(H.R. 4516) (S. 2603) (H.R. 5657 Which Was Incorporated by Reference inP.L. 106-554)  1 The subcommittee vote to report the measure was 6-3. The full House Appropriations Committee markup was May 9,2000. Thecommittee voted 31-23 to report the measure to the House. 2 The Senate version was marked up by the full SenateAppropriations Committee on May 18, 2000. The committee voted 28-0 toreport the measure ( S. 2603 ) to the Senate. 3 Passage was by unanimous consent. On May 25, 2000, bya vote of 98-2, the Senate agreed to the motion to advance S. 2603 to the third reading, and subsequently the bill was engrossed and returned to the Senate calendar. The Senatepassed H.R. 4516 , after incorporating the text of S. 2603 , as amended.  4 Conference report appeared in the CongressionalRecord on July 27, p. H7095-7126. 5 On July 27, the House agreed to H. Res. 565, the rule waivingpoints of order against the conference report to accompany H.R. 4516 (214-210). 6 Earlier, on Sept. 20, 2000, the Senate failed to approve theconference report (28-69). 7 The first FY2001 bill, H.R. 4516 , was vetoed Oct. 30,2000. The second bill, H.R. 5657 , introduced Dec.14, was incorporated by reference in H.R. 4577 , FY2001 consolidated appropriations bill, signed by thePresident onDec. 21 ( P.L. 106-554 ).  Submission of FY2001 BudgetEstimates. On February 7, 2000, President Clinton released the FY2001budget request of $2.688 billion for legislative activities funded in the legislative branchappropriations bill. (6) The revised budget estimatefor the legislative branch was $2.716billion, (7) and was an increase of $258.3 million, or10.5%, over the FY2000 appropriationof $2.458 billion, before supplementals. Actions on the House FY2001 Legislative Funding Bill(H.R. 4516). On June 22, the House passed its version of theFY2001 legislative funding bill, H.R. 4516 , which contained $1.914 billion(excluding Senate items). The FY2001 funding level was a decrease of $9.8 million, or0.5%, from the FY2000 appropriation of $1.924 billion. (8) During floor consideration theHouse adopted a managers' amendment adding $95.7 million to the bill as it was reportedby the House Appropriations Committee.  As reported earlier on May 23, H.R. 4516 contained a 5.5% reduction of$105.6 million, to $1.818 billion in FY2001 (excluding Senate items) from $1.924 billionin FY2000 ( H.Rept. 106-635 ). (9) The overall reduction was the result of compliance by theSubcommittee on Legislativeand the House Appropriations Committee with the FY2001 House budget allocations madeby the concurrent budget resolution passed by the House on March 23, 2000. (10) Thereduction was based on maintaining the FY2000 budget authority, less $94 million. As reported, the bill contained reductions that included -1.2% for the House ofRepresentatives, -11.7% for the Capitol Police (including the pending FY2000supplemental), -8.8% for the Office of Compliance, -17.9% for the Architect of the Capitol(including the pending FY2000 supplemental and excluding Senate items), -6.7% for theCongressional Research Service, -25.3% for the Government Printing Office, -6.9% for theGeneral Accounting Office, and -3.9% for the Congressional Budget Office.  The House Appropriations Committee estimated that 1,720 full time equivalentpositions (FTEs) would be eliminated in the legislative branch. Some agencies, however,would have had limited authority to make their budget reductions in some non-personalareas. Based on agency estimates, according to members expressing additional views, thebill possibly meant reductions of 438 from the Capitol Police, 707 from the GAO, 114 fromCRS, 31 from CBO, 156 from the AOC, 62 minimum from GPO, and 319 from the Houseof Representatives. Earlier, on May 4, the House Appropriations Committee chairman released fundingallocations (referred to as 302(b) allocations) of $2.355 billion in budget authority for thelegislative branch in FY2001. The House allocation was $45 million less than the Senateallocation of $2.5 billion. On May 8, the House Appropriations Committee voted to reportits version of the overall FY2001 legislative budget, agreeing without change to the billreported by its Subcommittee on Legislative on May 3. On June 20, in order for the manager's amendment of an additional $95.7 million tobe adopted, the House Appropriations Committee reallocated an additional $113 million tothe Subcommittee on Legislative from the Subcommittee on Transportation.  Hearings were held by the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative onJanuary 27 and February 1 and 2, 2000.  Actions on the Senate FY2001 Legislative Funding Bill(S. 2603). On July 17, the Senate passed H.R. 4516 by unanimous consent, after incorporating the text of S. 2603 , as amended. Aspassed, H.R. 4516 contained $1.721 billion (excluding House items), a 3.7%increase from $1.662 billion in FY2000 (excluding House items). (11) The FY2000appropriation base used by the Senate did not include an FY2000 supplemental of $17.1million in H.R. 3908 , passed by the House on March 30 ( S.Rept. 106-635 ).  Prior to Senate consideration, however, the Senate minority leader had stated hisintention of seeking to postpone Senate passage until after the House considered its version. Earlier, on May 24, the Senate began consideration of its version of the FY2001legislative branch appropriations bill, S. 2603 . On May 25, by a vote of 98-2,the Senate agreed to the motion to advance S. 2603 to the third reading (therebyending the time to offer amendments), and subsequently the bill was engrossed and returnedto the Senate calendar.  As passed by the Senate, H.R. 4516 contained a 3.9% increase for theSenate, a 29.1% increase for the Capitol Police, a 3.7% increase for the Office ofCompliance, a 3.8% increase for the Congressional Budget Office, a 0.1% increase for theArchitect of the Capitol (including Library buildings and grounds, but excluding Houseoffice buildings), a 1.0% increase for the Library of Congress, excluding the CongressionalResearch Service, a 3.4% increase for the Congressional Research Service, 3.7% increasefor the Government Printing Office, and a 1.9% increase for the General Accounting Office. Discussion during the Senate Appropriations Committee markup indicated that the bill didnot reduce FTE staff positions.  Earlier, on May 4, 2000, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2001budget allocations for its subcommittees, with an allocation of $2.5 billion for the legislativebranch. The Senate allocation was $145 million more than the House allocation of $2.355billion.  Hearings were held by the Senate Subcommittee on Legislative Branch on February8, 22, and 29, and March 21, 2000. Actions on the FY2001 Conference Report on H.R.4516. The conference report on H.R. 4516 was filedJuly 27, and approved by the House on September 14 (212-209). The Senate approved thereport on October 12 (58-37), after having failed to approve it earlier on September 20(28-69). The report contained $2.527 billion, a 2.1% increase over the FY2000appropriation of $2.475 billion. The report also contained $51.1 million in emergencyFY2000 supplemental appropriations for the legislative branch and the Department ofHousing and Urban Development, Federal Housing Administration. Both the legislativebranch and the FY2000 supplemental appropriations are contained in Division A of the bill. Division B contained provisions of the FY2001 treasury and postal service appropriationsbill and a repeal of the excise tax on telephone and other communications services.  Of the $51.1 million in FY2000 emergency supplemental appropriations, $11.1 millionwas for legislative branch activities - $2.1 million for the Capitol Police Board for securityenhancements, and $9 million for repairs to the garage of the Cannon House office building.  Veto of H.R. 4516 by thePresident. On October 30, 2000, the President vetoed H.R. 4516 . In his veto message, the President criticized the bill for providing funds for operationof the Congress and White House before passing other appropriations measures affectingthe public. His statement read in part: I am returning herewith without my approval, H.R. 4516 , the Legislative Branch and the Treasury and General GovernmentAppropriations Act, 2001. This bill provides funds for the legislative branch and the WhiteHouse at a time when the business of the American people remainsunfinished. The Congress' continued refusal to focus onthe priorities of the American people leaves me no alternative but to veto this bill. I cannotin good conscience sign a bill that funds the operations of the Congress and the White Housebefore funding our classroom, fixing our schools, and protecting ourworkers.\" (12) Until the FY2001 bill was enacted on December 21, the legislative branch was fundedat its FY2000 level by continuing resolutions beginning on October 1, at the start ofFY2001.  Enactment of FY2001 Legislative Branch Funds inP.L. 106-544. Pursuant to the President's veto of H.R. 4516 , FY2001 legislative branch funds were contained in H.R. 5657 , introduced on December 14.

P.L. 106-554 also incorporated by reference the provisions of H.R. 5666 ,miscellaneous appropriations bill, which contained additional FY2001 legislative branchappropriations of $118 million (13) and a 0.22%across-the-board cut.  The total FY2001 legislative branch appropriation including the 0.22% cut is $2.649billion. During 2000, Congress also approved the following FY2000 supplementalappropriations - $10 million for the Russian leadership program of the Library of Congress,$136,700 for a gratuity payment, and a 0.38% rescission ( P.L. 106-113 ); $17.5 million forthe Architect of the Capitol for fire safety ( P.L. 106-246 ); $2.1 million for the Capitol policeboard for security and $9 million for the Architect of the Capitol for House office buildings( P.L. 106-554 ). Action on a Rescission and Supplemental to FY2000Legislative Branch Appropriations (P.L. 106-113). Duringthe last days of the 1999 session, Congress approved a 0.38% across-the-board rescissionin the FY2000 appropriations acts, including that for the legislative branch. The provisionwas contained in H.R. 3194 , the FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act,which was signed into law as P.L.106-113 on November 29, 1999. P.L. 106-113 alsocontained a $10 million supplemental for the Library of Congress to continue operation ofthe Russian leadership program and $136,700 for a gratuity payment. Action on a Second Bill Containing an FY2000Supplemental for the Legislative Branch (H.R. 3908). On March30, the House passed an FY2000 supplemental appropriations measure, H.R. 3908 , which contained $17 million for the legislative branch, as follows: (14) $1.9 million to the Capitol Police Board for additional costs of securityenhancements to the Library of Congress buildings and grounds; and, $15.2 million to the Architect of the Capitol, for the account \"Capitolbuildings and grounds,\" for fire safety, as follows: Capitol buildings and grounds, \"Capitolbuildings - salaries and expenses,\" $7.0 million; House office buildings, $4.2 million;Capitol power plant, $3,000; Botanic garden, \"salaries and expenses,\" $26,000; Architectof the Capitol, \"Library buildings and grounds - structural and mechanical care,\" $3.9million.  The Senate delayed further action on H.R. 3908 due in part to concernsover the rising costs of the supplemental and the desire of Senate Majority Leader Lott toattach a reduced supplemental to one of the first FY2001 regular annual appropriations bills.  Subsequently, the $17 million supplemental was added to S. 2536 (seebelow). Action on a Third Bill Containing an FY2000Supplemental for the Legislative Branch (S. 2536 and H.R.4461). The FY2000 legislative supplemental appropriation contained in H.R. 3908 , as passed by the House on March 30 (see above), was subsequentlyincorporated in S. 2536 , the FY2001 agriculture, rural development, food anddrug administration, and related agencies appropriations bill.

The $17.5 million appropriation for fire safety was subsequently deleted from S. 2536 and inserted in H.R. 4425 , the FY2001 militaryconstruction appropriations, during conference (see discussion following). Also deletedfrom S. 2536 was language relating to the Trade Deficit Review Commission.  The other three legislative branch provisions (for $11.9 million, $2.7million, andArchitect of the Capitol language) were incorporated by the Senate in H.R. 4461 , the House version of the FY2001 agriculture appropriations bill. H.R. 4461 was amended by the Senate to contain the language of S. 2536 and passedby the Senate on July 20. The three provisions were dropped during alter consideration of H.R. 4461 . Action on a Fourth Bill Containing an FY2000Supplemental for the Legislative Branch, H.R. 4425 (P.L.106-246). Conferees on the FY2001 military construction appropriationsbill, H.R. 4425 , agreed to add a $17.5 million supplemental for the Architectof the Capitol for fire safety. H.R. 4425 was signed into law by the Presidenton July 13 ( P.L. 106-246 ). The appropriations for fire safety upgrades were as follow: \"Capitol buildings andgrounds, \"Capitol buildings - salaries and expenses,\" $7.0 million; Senate office buildings,$2.3 million; House office buildings, $4.2 million; Capitol power plant, $3,000; Botanicgarden, \"salaries and expenses,\" $26,000; and Architect of the Capitol, \"Library buildingsand grounds - structural and mechanical care,\" $3.9 million.

According to theconference report \"The Comptroller General is to monitor the performance of the CAO andreport to the chief of the Capitol Police, the Capitol Police Board, and the appropriationsand authorizing committees of the Senate and House. The chief is to report the CAO's plansand progress made in resolving the several administrative problems of the Capitol Police tothe appropriations and authorizing committees of the Senate and House ofRepresentatives.\" Action on Supplementals in H.R. 5666,Miscellaneous Appropriations Bill (P.L. 106-554). H.R. 5666 contained an FY2000 supplemental of $11.1 million - $2.1 millionfor the Capitol Police Board for security and $9 million to the Architect of the Capitol forHouse office buildings. H.R. 5666 was incorporated by reference in P.L.106-554 , FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Among the major funding issues considered and resolved were actionsto: increase funds for the Capitol Police for 100 - 115 additional officersto implement the Capitol Police Board's security plan; temporarily transfer administrationof the Capitol Police to a chief administrative office, under jurisdiction of the GeneralAccounting Office (subsequently changed to jurisdiction of the U.S. CapitolPolice); merge the Library of Congress police and the Government PrintingOffice police with the Capitol Police (provision deleted in conference); provide adequatefunds for electronic document printing, the digital online program of the Library ofCongress, and enhancements to the legislative information system; fund the support agencies' staff succession programs to replaceemployees eligible for retirement in the immediate future; and authorize the comptrollergeneral greater authority for flexibility in a reduction-in-force and for voluntary earlyretirement authority and separation payments (provision deleted in conference). Each spring, as members of the House Subcommittee on Legislative and the SenateSubcommittee on Legislative Branch consider funding requests from legislative agencies,they are faced with three options on funding levels: to maintain a flat budget; to provide amodest increase; or to approve a budget decrease. Statements by subcommittee membersduring the January and February 2000 hearings suggested support for a fairly flat budget forFY2001. However, the FY2001 bill reported to the full Appropriations Committee, andsubsequently reported to the House, represented a 5.5% reduction, or $105.6 million, fromthe current funding level for FY2000. The House subsequently added $95.7 million duringfloor consideration on June 22. As reported from conference, H.R. 4516 contained a 2.1% increase, to $2.527 billion in FY2001 from $2.475 billion in FY2000. The legislative branch budget is 0.15% of the total federal budget.  Flat Budget. A \"flat\" budget typicallyprovides new funds for mandatory cost increases, but denies additional funding requests. (16) A flat budget can be difficult to achieve due to a number of factors, such as ongoing andemergency maintenance and repair needs or an effort to keep operations current with recenttechnology developments. The FY2001 budget of $2.527 billion, as reported fromconference in H.R. 4516 , represented a flat budget, compared with $2.475billion appropriated for FY2000 at that time. This follows the trend of FY1999 and FY1998. The FY1999 regular annualLegislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L. 105-275 ), without theemergencysupplementals , contained a 2.8% increase over FY1998, to $2.352 billion from $2.288billion (both figures in current dollars). The rate of inflation for the comparable period oftime was 2.2%.  When including the FY1999 emergency supplementals, the FY1999 increase washigher, 12.8%, to $2.581 billion in FY1999 from $2.288 billion in FY1998. Allowing forinflation, the increase was 10.5%.  In the previous year, conferees on the FY1998 legislative funding bill also approveda fairly flat budget, or a 3.9% increase based on current dollars, to $2.288 billion in FY1998from $2.203 billion in FY1997. Allowing for inflation, the FY1998 conference figure wasactually a 2.2% increase, to $2.391 billion in FY1998 from $2.340 billion in FY1997 (inconstant 1999 dollars). Modest Increase. When including theFY1999 emergency supplemental appropriations in P.L. 105-277 , the FY1999 totalappropriation allowed for a modest increase, to $2.581 billion from $2.288 billion inFY1998, or a 12.9% increase. The emergency supplemental contained funds for securitysystems, a Capitol visitors' center, and Year-2000 compliance of software and othercomputer changes. Budget Decrease. In FY1996 andFY2000, Congress reduced the legislative budget. For FY1996, Congress approved a budgetthat was an 8.2% reduction from the previous year. The FY1996 budget was $2.184 billion,down from the FY1995 budget of $2.378 billion. When accounting for inflation, thedecrease was more, 12.4%, to $2.328 billion in FY1996 from $2.659 billion in FY1995. The FY2000 appropriation of $2.475 billion (enacted at the time of the conferencereport on H.R. 4516 ) was a 4.1% reduction from the FY1999 appropriation of$2.581 billion. Allowing for inflation, the decrease was more, 6.3%. Security of Legislative Information. TheHouse Appropriations Committee report on the FY2001 bill contained language expressingits concern for the security of electronically formatted legislative information. The Housedirected the clerk of the House, in consultation with the secretary of the Senate, to meetwith legislative entities that electronically create or store legislative information, to prepareinformation security standards and procedures for these entities, and to establish a processto routinely evaluate security risks.  The clerk was required to submit proposed standards and procedures to the Committeeon House Administration and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration forapproval. Upon approval, the clerk's plans were to be submitted to the House and SenateAppropriations Committees. The Library of Congress and the Government Printing Office are directed to \"workwith the clerk and secretary of the Senate to test, develop, and implement, no later thanJanuary 3, 2001, systems that will enable them to confirm the authenticity of such legislativeinformation.\" (17) House and Senate Legislative InformationSystems. Both houses continued to seek ways to reduce duplication ofeffort in tracking legislation and to upgrade legislative tracking and document managementsystems. Toward this end, both houses continue to develop information systems that createand manage legislative data files. The House legislative information system is administered by the House clerk. TheSenate system is administered by the secretary of the Senate. They report, respectively, tothe House Administration Committee (formerly House Oversight) and the Senate Committeeon Rules and Administration on their recommendations regarding the electronic transfer oflegislative data between the two houses and among other legislative branch entities.  In support of the development of the House and Senate legislative information systems,both houses directed the Congressional Research Service in 1996 to develop a data retrievalsystem with the technical support of the Library of Congress and in collaboration with otherlegislative branch agencies, such as the Government Printing Office. (18) The House andSenate legislative information systems are expected to reduce duplication through theconsolidation of existing legislative retrieval systems.  HouseSystem. In FY1996, theCommittee on House Administration (formerly House Oversight) directed the clerk to studymethods for increasing the capacity of the House to manage its documents electronically. The committee further directed that subsequent proposals of the clerk relating to printingbe coordinated with GPO and all House entities requiring printing and storage of documents.  The clerk of the House requested $750,000 for FY2001 to continuedevelopment ofthe House document management system (DMS), which would provide a method forcreating, tracking, editing, sharing, printing, and transmitting documents. Identical appropriations were made for the DMS in FY1998 and FY1999. According to the clerk, thegoals of the DMS are \"to improve the legislative document creation and revision process;to provide pro-active tracking, routing, and control of legislative documents; to improveinformation exchange with the Senate and other government entities in order to facilitate thelegislative process; to enable the Office of the Clerk to become the repository for Houselegislation and related documents for current and future use, for the general public,legislative organizations, and the House of Representatives; [and] to allow the House ofRepresentatives to become more independent for preparation, printing, and distribution ofofficial House of Representatives documents.\" (19) The DMS is designed to automate document preparation, using a system forprint-on-demand and for electronic transmission to GPO. Although development of theDMS is costly, anticipated savings to the House in administrative and printing costs wereestimated to be about $1 million annually. (20) Senate System. The FY1997 LegislativeBranch Appropriations Act directed the secretary of the Senate to develop a legislativeinformation system for the Senate. (21) The actdirected that the secretary oversee the system'sdevelopment and implementation, subject to the approval of the Senate Committee on Rulesand Administration. Like the House, the Senate system provides a means for creating,tracking, editing, sharing, and transmitting documents. The FY1997 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act funded the Senate system byauthorizing the secretary to use unspent FY1995 monies previously appropriated for theOffice of the Secretary of the Senate; they remained available until September 30, 1998. The secretary was also authorized to transfer to the development of the legislativeinformation system, as he determined to be necessary, funds already appropriated to thesecretary's office for the purpose of development of the Senate financial managementsystem. Access to additional funding was provided in the FY1997 supplemental appropriationsbill signed into law ( P.L. 105-18 ; H.R. 1871 ) on June 12, 1997. That actauthorized the transfer of $5 million from other Senate accounts to the account, \"ContingentExpenses of the Senate,\" under the subaccount, \"Secretary of the Senate.\" (22) That moneywas made available through September 30, 2000. The transfer was made subject to theapproval of the Senate Committee on Appropriations.  The FY1999 Senate report on S. 2137 also contained language directingthe Congressional Research Service and the Library \"to continue their development of thelegislative retrieval system for the Senate and provide an annual report outlining thestrategic objective of this initiative.\" (23) In July 2000, Congress approved an FY2000 supplemental of $17.5 million to theArchitect of the Capitol for fire safety in the Capitol and other congressional buildings. Conferees on the FY2001 military construction appropriations bill ( H.R. 4425 )added the supplemental to the bill, which was signed into law by the President on July 13( P.L. 106-246 ). Congress made the appropriation subsequent to the release of a report bythe Office of Compliance which identified 253 possible fire safety hazards or violations inCapitol Hill buildings. Earlier, both houses had approved FY2000 fire safety supplemental appropriations inseparate bills. First, the House passed H.R. 3908 , an FY2000 supplementalappropriation bill, on March 30 containing $15.2 million for fire safety. Second, althoughthe Senate delayed further action on H.R. 3908 , the Senate added the Houselanguage, plus $2.3 million for fire safety upgrades in Senate office buildings, to S. 2536 , the FY2001 agriculture, rural development, food and drugadministration, and related agencies appropriations bill. As reported ( S.Rept. 106-288 ), S. 2536 contained $17.5 million for fire safety upgrades. This appropriationwas dropped from S. 2536 with conferees on the FY2001 military constructionappropriations bill agreeing to add the funding to their bill. House Committee Funding. The FY2001request for committee operations was $121.8 million, an increase of $6.8 million, or 5.9%,over the FY2000 funding level of $115.0 million. The appropriation is contained in theappropriations heading \"committee employees\" that comprises two subheadings. The firstsubheading contains funds for personnel and non-personnel expenses of House committees,except the Appropriations Committee, as authorized by the House in a committee expenseresolution. The request for this subheading was $99.2 million, which was an increase of$5.4 million, or 5.7%, over the FY2000 funding level of $93.9 million. The conference on H.R. 4516 contained $92.2 million, a reduction from FY2000 of 1.8%, or $1.7million.  The second subheading contains funds for the personnel and non-personnel expensesof the Committee on Appropriations. The FY2001 request was $22.5 million, an increaseof $1.4 million, or 6.8%, over the FY2000 level of $21.1 million. The conference on H.R. 4516 contained $20.6 million, a decrease of 2.2%, or $467,000.  Most of the requested increase for both subheadings was for personnel expensespursuant to the January 2000 pay increase of 3.7%, and price level increases. The increasefor House committees, other than Appropriations, was also to pay expenses for use of cellphones and pagers, use of which is growing, and to meet expenses incurred in providinggreater flexibility by allowing staff to use their residential lines for official business, withreimbursement to them by the House. The Appropriations Committee request includedfunds for equipment and additional travel.  Senate Committee Funding. S. 2603 contained $79.9 million for Senate committees in FY2001, a 2.3%increase from $78.1 million in FY2000. The FY2001 appropriation is a total of committeeappropriations contained in two separate Senate accounts. The first account is the Senate\"Committee on Appropriations;\" the second is \"Inquiries and Investigations,\" whichcontains funds for all other Senate committees. The FY2001 appropriation for the SenateAppropriations Committee was $6.9 million, an increase of $392,000, or 6%, over theFY2000 level of $6.5 million. The FY2001 appropriation for all other Senate committeeswas $73.0 million, an increase of $1.4 million, or 2.0%, over the FY2000 appropriation of$71.6 million. Capitol Complex Security Plan. TheOffice of the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) continued to develop a perimeter security planfor the Capitol, the Senate and House office buildings, and adjacent grounds. Congressapproved $20 million for the perimeter plan as part of an FY1998 supplementalappropriations bill ( P.L. 105-174 ). The relevant provision of the law reads: For necessary expenses for the design, installation and maintenance of the Capitol Square Perimeter Security Plan, $20,000,000 (ofwhich not to exceed $4,000,000 shall be transferred upon request of the Capitol PoliceBoard to the Capitol Police Board, \"Capitol Police,\" \"General Expenses,\" for physicalsecurity measures associated with the Capitol Square perimeter security plan) to remainavailable until expended, subject to the review and approval by the appropriate House andSenate authorities. (24)  The appropriation for the perimeter security plan was based on recommendations thata task force prepared for the U.S. Capitol Police Board. Of the $20 million, $4 million wasmade available to the Capitol Police Board for the design and installation of securitysystems that were to be part of the perimeter plan. The perimeter security plan has beenapproved by the four oversight and funding committees that responsible for itsimplementation.  Other Security Activities of the CapitolPolice. Several current Capitol Police security projects are the result of acomprehensive security survey of the Capitol complex conducted by a task force in 1998. The task force was composed of security experts from five federal law enforcementagencies. Pursuant to the findings of the task force, the Capitol Police requested andreceived funding for 260 additional police officers and other personnel (including 215authorized officers), upgraded police equipment, and new security technology. (25) ForFY2001, the Capitol Police requested an additional 100 police officers in their FY2001request to implement the task force recommendations. In 1999, the Capitol Police Board and the police department developed a \"StrategicPlan for the U.S. Capitol Police,\" primarily dealing with financial management of the police. The police requested funding for the first phase of the plan in the FY2001 bill. Additionally, the Architect of the Capitol, who was directed to study the facility needs ofthe Capitol Police, developed a master plan, which addresses major issues of police trainingfacilities, a vehicle maintenance facility, and an off-site delivery center. Funding for the Capitol Police Board. Conferees on H.R. 4516 agreed to $103.9 million for the Capitol Police Board,revised to $103.8 million pursuant to a rescission of 0.22%. The revised appropriationrepresents an increase of 22.3%, or $18.9 million, from the FY2000 funding level of $84.9million. (26) This increase funded 1,481 FTEs, whichwas the number recommended by theSenate, and conferees directed that the Chief of Police obtain approval of the House andSenate Committees on Appropriations before filling positions above an FTE level of 1,402. Conferees also stated that they \"intend that sufficient resources be allocated to implementthe 'two officers per door' policy,\" and required the Capitol Police Board to study therequirements of each post and report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committee. The study and report were to be made before the Chief of Police could hire any employeesover an FTE level of 1,402. Conferees retained a House provision that created a new Office of Administrationwithin the Capitol Police directed by a chief administrative officer (CAO) to be appointedby the comptroller general, after consultation with the Capitol Police Board. The CAOwould be an employee of the General Accounting Office until October 1, 2002, when hewould become an employee of the Capitol Police.  Conferees dropped a provision (section 310 of S. 2603 ) which containedadministrative language transferring uniformed officers of the Library of Congress andGovernment Printing Office to the Capitol Police, effective October 1, 2000. Prior to thetransfer, the General Accounting Office was to identity issues to be addressed before thetransfer; the agency was to report its findings to the Senate Appropriations Committee andthe Capitol Police Board by July 1, 2000.  The FY2001 request for the board was $110.9 million, an increase of $26 million, or31%, over FY2000. Most of the requested increase was to fund 100 new FTE (27) policeofficers in FY2001, and to continue to fund the additional 260 FTEs (police officers andother personnel) hired in FY1999 and FY2000. (28) The total number of FTEs would increaseto 1,611 from 1,511, which would allow the Capitol Police Board to staff each congressionalentrance with two officers. The increased funds would allow the board to continueimplementation of its strategic plan for training and other security enhancement programs.  The House bill, as reported, contained $76.7 million, a reduction of 9.7%, or $8.2million, from the FY2000 level of $84.9 million, excluding a pending supplemental CapitolPolice appropriation of $1.9 million for Library of Congress security. However, anamendment adopted on the House floor contained an additional $22.7 million, increasingthe FY2001 appropriation to $99.3 million. The Senate bill contained $109.6 million, an increase of $24.7 million, or 29.1% overthe FY2000 appropriation of $84.9 million. Funds for the Capitol Police Board are contained under two headings, \"Capitol Policesalaries,\" and \"Capitol Police, general expenses.\" For Capitol Police salaries, the requestwas $106.0 million, an increase of $27.7 million, (29) or 35.4%, over the FY2000 appropriationof $78.4 million. The House bill contained $92.8 million; the Senate bill contained $102.7million. Conferees agreed to $97.1 million.  For Capitol Police general expenses, $10.0 million was requested. This was anincrease of $3.4 million, or 52.1%, over the FY2000 appropriation of $6.6 million. TheHouse bill contained $6.6 million; the Senate bill contained $6.9 million. Conferees agreedto $6.8 million. The accompanying House report language -  Appropriated $4 million for overtime, equally divided between theHouse and Senate police details. Appropriated for 1,058 FTEs, 506 for the House and 552 for the Senate. Directed a policy shift by the Capitol Police from emphasis on manpower to security technology.  Created a new Office of Administration within the Capitol Police directed by a chief administrative officer (CAO) to be appointed by the comptroller general,after consultation with the Capitol Police Board. The CAO would be an employee of theGeneral Accounting Office until October 1, 2002, when he would become an employee ofthe Capitol Police. Upon transfer, the Capitol Police Board would assume theresponsibilities previously held by the comptroller general. This language was changed inthe conference report on H.R. 4475 , the FY2001 Department of Transportationappropriations bill, to place the CAO under jurisdiction of the U.S. CapitolPolice. Encouraged the Capitol Police to study the possible use of eye-viewsecurity technology, which permits real time surveillance and monitoring over the Internetthrough secure connections. Administration of Security EnhancementMoney. Besides administering funds from annual appropriations, theCapitol Police are responsible for administering the security enhancements fund and thephysical security fund, both established for specific purposes. Transfer of money fromeither fund to the Capitol Police Board is subject to the approval of the police oversight andappropriations committees. Activities are coordinated by a memorandum of understandingamong the Capitol Police, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, and the Library ofCongress. Recent Appropriations for SecurityEnhancements. In FY1997, the Capitol Police Board received $3.25million for the \"design and installation of security systems for the Capitol buildings andgrounds,\" and the Architect was given $250,000 for \"architectural and engineering servicesrelated to the design and installation\" of those systems. (30) In addition, the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act ( P.L. 105-277 ) contained$106.8 million for the board to make \"security enhancements to the Capitol complex,including the buildings and grounds of the Library of Congress.\" (31) The accompanyingconference report ( H.Rept. 105-825 ) identified 22 specific categories of priority securityneeds. The Omnibus Appropriations Act also transferred responsibility for the design,installation, and maintenance of the Library of Congress security system from the Architectof the Capitol to the Capitol Police Board. (32) The supplemental allocations resulted from (1) a broad review of the existing securityprogram by the Capitol Police, with assistance from other federal security agencies andprivate consultants. There were also hearings and discussions with congressional leaders,as well as the committees of jurisdiction; and (2) a personnel audit of security operations ofthe police. As a result of these and other studies, a comprehensive 10-year Capitol Policemaster plan was issued in August 1999.  Congress appropriated an FY1999 emergency supplemental appropriation for theCapitol Police Board as a result of recommendations for security upgrades made pursuantto a comprehensive security study of the Capitol complex. The Capitol Police Boardmandated the study in 1998 by a task force composed of security experts from federal lawenforcement agencies and the private sector.  Language in the FY1999 emergency supplemental appropriation directed the CapitolPolice Board to prepare an implementation plan for the use of the emergency supplementalto include necessary equipment upgrades and detailing the first phase of the securityenhancements to the Capitol complex and Library of Congress buildings and grounds. TheCapitol Police Board prepared a security enhancement implementation plan, now pendingbefore the authorizing and appropriations committees. Parts of the plan have already beenapproved. For FY2000, Congress appropriated a supplemental of $2.1 millionto the CapitolPolice Board for security enhancements contained in P.L. 106-554 . Capitol Visitors' Center. Although theFY2001 legislative budget request does not contain funds for a proposed Capitol visitors'center, several references were made to the center's development during House and Senatehearings on the FY2001 budget.  Current Status. Congressional leadershipbroke ground for the center on June 20, 2000. (33) Construction is scheduled to begin in late2001 or early 2002 and is expected to be completed by December 2004. (34) Appropriations and Other Funds Available. The current estimated cost of the center is $265.6 million. (35) Congress agreed to an FY1999emergency supplemental appropriation of $100 million to the architect \"for planning,engineering, design, and construction\" of a Capitol visitors' center. The funding was addedin the conference on H.R. 4328 , the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated andEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 105-277 ).  The conference report on H.R. 4328 stipulated that appropriated funds forthe project are to be supplemented by private funds, and the clerk of the House and thesecretary of the Senate were directed by the Capitol Preservation Commission to developa fund-raising plan. The clerk and secretary presented a plan on February 9, 2000, whichthe commission accepted, to authorize the Pew Charitable Trusts to establish a nonprofit501(c)(3) foundation to seek private funds. The target for the foundation is $100,000. (36) In addition, $26.6 million in Capitol Preservation Commission funds are reportedlyavailable for the center; (37) other funds will beavailable through the sale of a recentlyapproved commemorative coin program marking the 200thanniversary of the convening ofCongress in the Capitol. (38) Discussions During FY2000 Hearings. Theissue was also discussed during House and Senate hearings on the FY2000 budget of theOffice of the Architect of the Capitol; several subcommittee members urged the architectto move expeditiously to construct a Capitol visitors' center. A sponsor of earlier legislationauthorizing construction of the center, Representative John Mica, also spoke before theHouse subcommittee in favor of the project. He stated that \"my concern is that this projectmay now be delayed, unduly putting off construction unnecessarily and adding costs to theproject.\" (39) Architect of the Capitol Appropriation forFY2001. Conferees on H.R. 4516 agreed to $201.2 millionfor all activities of the Architect of the Capitol. When adding supplementals and adjustingfor a 0.22% rescission, the total FY2001 figure is $210.9 million. This figure represents adecrease of 9.6%, or $22.4 million, from the FY2000 level of $233.3 million. The FY2001budget proposal was $247.2 million. H.R. 4516 , as passed by the House, contained $137.2 million for theArchitect in Title I and Title II, excluding funds for Senate office buildings in Title I. (40) Theappropriation was a decrease of 13.3%, or $21 million, from the FY2000 funding level of$158.2 million. Previously, the House Committee on Appropriations reported $129.9million, a decrease of 17.9% from the FY2000 appropriation of $158.2 million (excludingSenate items).  The Senate bill, S. 2603 , as passed, contained $169.6 million, a decreaseof 0.06% from the FY2000 appropriation of $169.7 million (excluding House activities).  During consideration of the FY2001 budget, Congress approved FY2000 supplementalappropriations of $17.5 million for fire safety, contained in P.L. 106-246 ) and $9 million tothe Architect for House office buildings. Appropriation Accounts of the Office of the Architect ofthe Capitol in the Annual Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill. TheOffice of the Architect of the Capitol's budget is contained in two places in a legislativebranch appropriations bill, in Titles I and II. Title I contains funds for the Capitol buildingsand grounds, the Senate office buildings, the House office buildings, and the Capitol powerplant. Occasionally, funds for special projects are included in Title I. For example, in theFY1999 legislative branch appropriations act, Title I also contained the emergencysupplemental of $100 million for a Capitol visitors' center. (41) For Title I, the House and Senate consider separate requests because the House budgetrequest does not include Senate office building funds (which are determined by the Senate),and the Senate budget request does not include House office building funds (determined bythe House). For FY2001, the total Title I budget request, including funds for House andSenate office buildings, was $226.9 million, a $36 million increase, or 18.9%, over theFY2000 appropriation of $190.9 million. Conferees on H.R. 4516 agreed to $185.2 million for Title I activities.  The House bill, as reported, contained $114.8 million in Title I, excluding Senateitems . This was a reduction of 17.1%, or $23.6 million, from the FY2000 appropriation of$138.4 million, excluding Senate items and including pending supplemental appropriations. As passed, the House bill contained $121.4 million for Title I. The Senate bill contained $153.2 million in Title I, excluding House items , a reductionof 0.4% from the FY2000 appropriation of $153.8 million, excluding House items andpending supplemental appropriations.  Title II contains funds for the architect to maintain the buildings and grounds of theLibrary of Congress (LOC). From time to time, other projects of the architect are fundedin Title II. For example, the FY1999 legislative branch appropriations act contained aone-time appropriation of $1 million for the congressional cemetery in Title II.  For Title II activities conferees agreed to $16.0 million.  The FY2001 budget request for Title II activities was $20.3 million, an increase of $4.3million, or 27%, over the appropriation of $16 million in FY2000. For Title II activities, theHouse bill, as reported, contained $15.1 million, a reduction of $4.7 million, or 23.8%, fromthe FY2000 appropriation of $19.9 million, including appropriations pending in the FY2000supplemental, H.R. 3908 . As passed, the House bill contained $15.8 million inTitle II. S. 2603 contained $16.3 million, a 1.9% increase from the FY2000appropriation of $16.0 million. Title II also contains funds for the Botanic Garden, which areadministered by thearchitect. In the legislative branch appropriations bill, funds for the Botanic Garden arecontained in a separate account; for purposes of this report, they are not included withinfunding of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol. Botanic Garden. Conferees agreed to$3.3 million. The FY2001 request of $4.9 million was an increase of $1.5 million, or 4.4%,over the FY2000 appropriation of $3.4 million. The request contained $200,000 for thedesign of the renovation and addition to the garden's administrative building. The Housebill, as reported and passed, contained $3.2 million, a reduction of $222,000, or 6.5%, fromthe FY2000 level of $3.4 million, including appropriations in the pending supplemental, H.R. 3908 . The Senate bill contained $3.7 million. Funds were not requested for FY2001 for renovation of the conservatory, to becompleted in September 2000. Most of the renovation funds were made available in theFY1997 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L. 104-197 ). A contract for renovationwas awarded in September 1998, with the architect authorized to award contracts foradditional garden projects if additional funds were available. (42) A privately funded nationalgarden, a new addition to the Botanic Garden, will be located next to the conservatory. Congressional Budget Office Budget. Conferees on H.R. 4516 agreed to $28.5 million for the Congressional BudgetOffice (CBO), which was the same amount requested by CBO's director. The appropriationsubsequently was adjusted to $28.4 million, pursuant to a 0.22% rescission. The FY2001appropriation was an increase of $2.3 million, or 9.0%, over the FY2000 appropriation of$26.1 million. In his testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Legislative Branch, thedirector said the increase was \"largely necessitated by our need to compensate for asignificant funding shortfall in 2000 - our appropriation increase for fiscal year 2000 wasonly 1.8 percent, or $450,000.\" (43) He stated thatthe $450,000 increase was less than the $1.5million necessary to meet additional expenses of pay and benefits for its 232 FTEs, notingthat the number of staff on payroll was 225. (44) The additional FY2001 funds will also pay for mandatory pay and benefit increasesin FY200l, for enhanced computer technology ($588,000), and for expenses of an increasedworkload, including a number of congressionally mandated reports and studies.  The director also expressed concern about the ability of CBO to offer the salariesnecessary to attract and retain staff, noting that there was a loss of \"very good analysts andmanagers in 1999,\" and that he expects \"a significant number of senior staff to retire in thenext 12 months.\" Approximately half of CBO managers and more than half of its topexecutive are currently eligible to retire, with several others becoming eligible to retire inthe next three years. (45) H.R. 4516 , as reported, contained a $1.0 million, or 3.9%, reduction to$25.1 million from $26.1 million in FY2000. As passed, H.R. 4516 contained$27.4 million, an increase of 4.9%, or $1.3 million. S. 2603 contained$992,000, a 3.8% increase to $27.1 million. General Accounting Office Budget. Conferees on H.R. 4516 agreed to $384.9 million for the General AccountingOffice (GAO), which was subsequently reduced to $384.0 million, pursuant to a 0.22%rescission. This was an increase of $6.4 million, or 1.7%, over the FY2000 funding levelof $377.6 million. The FY2001 budget request of the General Accounting Office (GAO)was $399.9 million, (46) an increase of $22.4million, or 5.9%, over the FY2000 appropriationof $377.6 million. (47) Seventy-three percent of theincrease, or $16.3 million, was requestedfor mandatory pay and related personnel costs.  In his testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Legislative Branch, theComptroller General said that major initiatives in the FY2001 budget were in the area ofhuman resources. (48) He noted that the FY2001budget request maintains the FY2000 FTElevel of 3,275 (estimate), and that GAO would continue to use existing staff resourcesbefore requesting additional personnel. Funds requested would allow GAO to provide staffwith enhanced training and rewards in line with those given in the executive branch. Inorder to make the best use of existing staff, GAO is currently revising its performanceappraisal system in developing a new system for its evaluators to assist in retaining existingstaff. He also said that GAO was \"sparse\" at the entry level due to the five-year freeze onhiring and downsizing since 1992. The comptroller general discussed his request for legislative authorityto allow theagency greater flexibility in personnel matters, including the ability to offer early-outs toselected individuals, to apply reductions-in-force so as to prevent an unbalanced workforce,and, in order to attract and retain staff, to compensate selected scientific and technicalpersonnel at senior executive pay levels. In his prepared testimony, the Comptroller General cited staff succession as a majorissue, noting the percentages of staff eligible to retire by the end of FY2004 (September 30,2003). Those eligible will be 34% of evaluators and related staff, 48% of managementevaluators, and 55% of senior executives. H.R. 4516 , as reported, reduced the budget of GAO by $26 million, or6.9%, to $351.5 million in FY2001 from $377.6 million in FY2000. The AppropriationsCommittee included language in the report that the level of FY2001 funding \"support 2,698FTEs, a decrease of 577 below the number currently expected to be utilized in fiscal2000.\" (49) As passed, H.R. 4516 contained $368.9 million, a decrease of 2.3%, or$8.7 million. S. 2603 contained an increase of $7.3 million, or 1.9%, to $384.9 millionfrom $377.6 million. Library of Congress Budget. The budgetof the Library of Congress is included in both Title I and Title II of the legislativeappropriations bill. Title I contains funds for the Congressional Research Service (CRS); Title II contains funds for all other activities of the Library of Congress.  Conferees on H.R. 4516 agreed to an FY2001 funding level of $412.3million, an increase of 4.6%, or $18.0 million, over the FY2000 level of $394.4 million. (50) Pursuant to a supplemental of $100 million for the digital preservation program and a 0.22%rescission, the revised FY2001 appropriation is $511.1 million. Appropriations for theLibrary, excluding CRS, are $437.7 million; the CRS appropriation is $73.4 million. The FY2001 budget request for activities of the Library of Congress in both titles was$428.1 million, an 8.6% increase of $33.7 million from the FY2000 appropriation of $394.4million. (51) Almost half of the increase, or $16.6million, was to meet mandatory pay andrelated personnel costs, and price increases for goods and services. Most of the remaining net increase of $27.1 million was to meet the costs of workloadincreases related to support for the digital futures initiative to create the National On-LineLibrary ($21.3 million); for additional domestic and international digital content ($7.6million); for storage, maintenance, and preservation of collections ($3.2 million); forenhanced security of collections and facilities ($7 million); and for other activities. Whileincreases total more than $27.1 million, they were offset by decreases and savings in otherareas - for example, savings of $2 million by the integrated library system and completionof funding for other programs. Another concern of the Librarian during his FY2001 budget testimony wascontinuation of a staff succession program. A recent risk assessment study of the Library'sworkforce showed that almost 45% of employees will be eligible to retire in 2004. TheFY2001 request contained $2.6 million for the plan, including development of a recruitmentprogram and establishment of an internal career enhancement plan. The Librarian requested an increase of 192 FTE positions, increasing staff to 4,268from 4,076, which is 6.0% lower than the Library's staff in 1992. The primary need foradditional staff is to meet a significantly increased internet activity workload. Library of Congress, Except CRS (in TitleII). Conferees on H.R. 4516 agreed to $338.7 million forFY2001 for the Library of Congress, except the Congressional Research Service. Theappropriation represented an increase of $15.4 million, or 4.8%, over the FY2000appropriation of $323.4 million.  Both the FY2001 and FY2000 figures were subsequently adjusted to reflectsupplementals and rescissions. When accounting for these adjustments, the FY2000 figurewas adjusted to $394.4 million and the FY2001 figure to $437.7 million. The increase was$43.3 million, or 11.0%.  The Title II budget request was $352.5 million, an increase of $29.1 million, or 9.0%,above the FY2000 appropriation. H.R. 4516 contained $323.9 million, anincrease of $523,000, or 0.2%, over FY2001. S. 2603 contained a 0.7%increase to $325.6 million. Congressional Research Service (in TitleI). Conferees on H.R. 4516 agreed to $73.6 million for theCongressional Research Service (CRS), revised to $73.4 million, pursuant to a rescissionof 0.22%. The FY2001 funding level represents an increase of $2.5 million, or 3.5%, fromthe FY2000 level of $71 million. The FY2001 Title II request was $75.6 million, anincrease of $4.7 million, or 6.6%, from the FY2000 funding level of $71.0 million. Mostof the request, or 72.7%, was to fund mandatory pay and related personnel costs, andincreases in prices due to inflation. The remaining $1.1 million was to fund the third yearof the staff succession program. Of this amount, $860,045 was to fund the program inFY2001, and $279,727 to restore positions lost in the FY2000 rescission. Approximatelyhalf of all CRS staff will be eligible to retire by 2006. H.R. 4516 , as reported, reduced the budget of CRS by 6.7%, or $4.8million, to $66.2 million from the FY2000 appropriation of $70.97 million. It wasestimated that CRS staff would have been reduced by 114 FTE positions in FY2001. As passed, H.R. 4516 contained $73.8 million, an increase of $2.8million, or 4.0%. The Senate bill, S. 2603 , contained $73.4 million, an increaseof 3.4%, or $2.4 million. Government Printing Office (GPO)Budget. Conferees on H.R. 4516 agreed to $99.4 million forthe Government Printing Office, revised to $99.2 million, pursuant to a 0.22% rescission. The FY2001 funding level is a decrease of 3.9%, or $4 million, from the FY2000appropriation of $103.2 million. The FY2001 request was $121.3 million, an increase of$18.1 million, or 17.5%, over FY2000. The primary reasons the Public Printer requestedthe increase were expenses related to mandatory pay and related personnel benefitsincreases, and to price increases for services and supplies; expenses of making governmentdocuments electronically available through the Federal Depository Library program'selectronic collection; and costs of an increased statutory workload requirement, includingpublication of a new edition of the U.S. Code . The FY2001 requestincluded a directappropriation of $6 million to the GPO revolving fund to replace the agency's airconditioning equipment. (52) GPO is funded in Title I for congressional printing and binding, and in Title II for theOffice of Superintendent of Documents. Title II also contains funding from time to time forthe GPO revolving fund, as it does in the FY2001 request.  The FY2001 appropriation for Title I is $71.5 million. The request of $80.8 millionwas a 10.2% increase of $7.5 million over the FY2000 $73.3 million appropriation. H.R. 4516 , as reported, contained $65.5 million, a reduction of $7.8 million,or 10.7%, over FY2000. As passed, H.R. 4516 contained $69.6 million, areduction of $3.7 million, or 5.0%. The Senate's bill contained $73.3 million, the same asappropriated for FY2000.  The Title II appropriation in H.R. 4516 for FY2001 is $28.0 million,compared with the Public Printer's request of $40.5 million (including $6 million for the revolving fund). H.R. 4516 , as reported, contained $11.6 million, a reductionof 61.1%, or $18.3 million, from the FY2000 appropriation. As passed by the House, H.R. 4516 contained $25.7 million, a reduction of 14.1%, or $4.2 million. S. 2603 contained $30.3 million, an increase of 1.3% over the FY2000appropriation of $30.0 million.  The GPO budget reduction in H.R. 4516 , as reported to the House, was25.3% when combining Title I and Title II appropriations. As passed, the total budgetreduction is 7.7%, or $7.9 million, to $95.3 million from $103.2 million in FY2000. Guide to Determining Legislative BudgetTrends. Interpretation of budget trends is determined primarily by threefactors: (1) selection of current or constant dollars to express budget authority (constantdollars reflecting the impact of inflation); (2) selection of budget authority contained inannual appropriations bills, with or without permanent budget authority (permanent budgetauthority not requiring annual approval by Congress); and (3) selection of fiscal years to becompared. Note: This discussion excludes FY2000supplemental appropriations. Selection of Current or Constant Dollars. Current-dollar data reflect actual budget authority appropriated each year. Constant-dollardata reflect the conversion of actual budget authority into equivalent 2000 dollars. Forexample, Congress appropriated budget authority of $41,793,000 for the Senate in FY1968,excluding permanent budget authority. Converted into 2000 dollars, $41,793,000 is$204,641,586. When reviewing the 31-year growth of the Senate budget from FY1968-FY2000 incurrent dollars, the increase amounts to 830.8%. In constant dollars, the increase is 90.1%. The constant-dollar figure indicates budget growth after the effects of inflation areneutralized. Selection of Fiscal Years. Differences alsoappear based on choice of fiscal years used to compare budgets. For example, a comparisonof budget growth, FY1968 and FY2000, shows these changes in total legislative budgets after adjustment for inflation: FY1968-FY2000, +90.1%;FY1972-FY2000, +13.0%; andFY1978-FY2000, -8.8%. (53) Changes in the 1970s significantly affected the congressional budget. Implementationby Congress of the 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act increased the budgets and staffs ofcongressional committees and support agencies from FY1971 through FY1978. Forexample, the increase in total legislative budget authority, adjusted for inflation, fromFY1969 (pre-1970 Reorganization Act) through FY1973 (a year of significantimplementation of the 1970 Act) was 64.5%. The legislative budget during the 1970s also reflected implementation of the 1974Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, which created the House and SenateBudget Committees and the Congressional Budget Office. Also, Congress began to providesignificant funding for its computer capabilities. This growth in the legislative budgetstabilized by FY1978 and has remained fairly level since that time. Current Legislative Budget Trends. BetweenFY1978 and FY2000, the total legislative budget, adjusted for inflation, decreased by 8.9%. Budget authority for direct congressional operations in Title I decreased by 4.1% over thistime. Throughout the 12 years following FY1978 (FY1979-FY1990), the legislative budgetremained lower than the FY1978 budget authority, when adjusted for inflation. The firstincrease over the FY1978 budget occurred in FY1991, a 1.1% increase from the FY1978level.  Compared to the FY1978 budget, funding increased again in FY1992, FY1995,FY1997, FY1998, and FY1999, and decreased in FY1993, FY1994, FY1996, and FY2000,when adjusted for inflation. If inflation is taken into account, the total legislative budgetdecreased by 5.9% between FY1994 and FY2000. Without allowing for inflation, thechange between FY1994 and FY2000 was an increase of 8.2%.  Table 2.

Source for 2000 estimate is the Congressional BudgetOffice. a Prior to FY1978, the legislative branch appropriations act contained numerous titles.Effective in FY1978, Congress restructured the legislative bill so that it would \"moreadequately reflect actual costs of operating the U.S. Congress than has been true in thepast years\" (H.Rept. 95-450, FY1978 Legislative Appropriations). As a result, the actwas divided into two titles. Title I, Congressional Operations, was established to containappropriations for the actual operation of Congress. Title II, Related Agencies, wasestablished to contain the budgets for activities not considered as providing directsupport to Congress. Periodically, the act has contained additional titles for suchpurposes as capital improvements and special one-time functions.  b FY1996figures contain rescissions in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act,FY1997 ( P.L. 104-208 , Sept. 28, 1996).
