CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Corporations are subject to a tax rate of up to 34 \n        percent or 35 percent.\n            (2) Due to tax deductions, exclusions, and credits, the net \n        tax liability actually paid by many corporations is far below \n        the real rate. In fact, certain special-interest tax deductions \n        and expenditures provide corporations with an extra \n        $70,000,000,000 per year. Additionally, direct Government \n        subsidies to corporations will amount to $30,000,000,000 per \n        year.\n            (3) Over the past several years, one of the most serious \n        problems affecting the middle-class has been corporate \n        downsizing. Many large, wealthy, and profitable corporations \n        have reduced the number of their American employees by \n        transferring those jobs to foreign countries or have reduced \n        the number of their employees in order to realize an immediate \n        short-term profit or increase in stock value.\n            (4) Between April 3, 1975, and January 31, 1996, the \n        relocation of manufacturing operations resulted in over \n        4,500,000 workers seeking adjustment assistance for workers \n        under chapter 2 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974. Because \n        many displaced workers did not seek assistance, this figure is \n        far below the actual number of workers displaced.\n            (5) A higher priority should be given to preserving \n        American jobs and adding fairness to the Federal tax system by \n        closing loopholes and eliminating unnecessary expenditures, \n        thus providing additional funds to assist in balancing the \n        Federal budget by 2002 while maintaining Medicare and Medicaid \n        at acceptable levels.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION OF TAX BENEFITS FOR PROFITABLE LARGE CORPORATIONS \n              WHICH REDUCE WORKFORCE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subchapter C of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 (relating to corporate distributions and adjustments) is \namended by adding at the end the following new part:\n\n``PART VII--REDUCTION OF TAX BENEFITS FOR PROFITABLE LARGE CORPORATIONS \n                         WHICH REDUCE WORKFORCE\n\n                              ``Sec. 386.
