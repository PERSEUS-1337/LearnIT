FINDINGS.\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) The sustained commitment of the North Atlantic Treaty \n    Organization (NATO) to mutual defense has made possible the \n    democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of \n    the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can and should play a \n    critical role in addressing the security challenges of the post-\n    Cold War era in creating the stable environment needed for those \n    emerging democracies in Europe.\n        (2) Lasting stability and security in Europe requires the \n    military, economic, and political integration of emerging \n    democracies into existing European structures.\n        (3) In an era of threats from terrorism and the proliferation \n    of weapons of mass destruction, the North Atlantic Treaty \n    Organization is increasingly contributing to security in the face \n    of global security challenges for the protection and interests of \n    its member states.\n        (4) In the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public \n    Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress declared that ``full \n    and active participants in the Partnership for Peace in a position \n    to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and to \n    contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area should be \n    invited to become full NATO members in accordance with Article 10 \n    of such Treaty at an early date . . .''.\n        (5) In the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (title VI \n    of section 101(c) of title I of division A of Public Law 104-208; \n    22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress called for the prompt admission of \n    Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia to the North \n    Atlantic Treaty Organization, and declared that ``in order to \n    promote economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, \n    Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine \n    . . . the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies \n    in Central and Eastern Europe should not be limited to \n    consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and \n    Slovenia as full members of the NATO Alliance''.\n        (6) In the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of \n    division G of Public Law 105-277; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress \n    declared that ``Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should not \n    be the last emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe \n    invited to join NATO'' and that ``Romania, Estonia, Latvia, \n    Lithuania, and Bulgaria . . . would make an outstanding \n    contribution to furthering the goals of NATO and enhancing \n    stability, freedom, and peace in Europe should they become NATO \n    members [and] upon complete satisfaction of all relevant criteria \n    should be invited to become full NATO members at the earliest \n    possible date''.\n        (7) In the Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act of \n    2002 (Public Law 107-187; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress endorsed \n    ``. . . the vision of further enlargement of the NATO Alliance \n    articulated by President George W. Bush on June 15, 2001, and by \n    former President William J. Clinton on October 22, 1996''.\n        (8) At the Madrid Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n    Organization in July 1997, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic \n    were invited to join the Alliance, and the North Atlantic Treaty \n    Organization heads of state and government issued a declaration \n    stating ``[t]he alliance expects to extend further invitations in \n    coming years to nations willing and able to assume the \n    responsibilities and obligations of membership . . . [n]o European \n    democratic country whose admission would fulfill the objectives of \n    the [North Atlantic] Treaty will be excluded from consideration''.\n        (9) At the Washington Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n    Organization in April 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n    heads of state and government issued a communique declaring ``[w]e \n    pledge that NATO will continue to welcome new members in a position \n    to further the principles of the [North Atlantic] Treaty and \n    contribute to peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area . . . \n    [t]he three new members will not be the last . . . [n]o European \n    democratic country whose admission would fulfill the objectives of \n    the Treaty will be excluded from consideration, regardless of its \n    geographic location . . .''.\n        (10) In May 2000 in Vilnius, Lithuania, the foreign ministers \n    of Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Republic of \n    Macedonia (FYROM), Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia issued a \n    statement (later joined by Croatia) declaring that--\n            (A) their countries will cooperate in jointly seeking \n        membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the \n        next round of enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization;\n            (B) the realization of membership in the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization by one or more of these countries would be \n        a success for all; and\n            (C) eventual membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization for all of these countries would be a success for \n        Europe and for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n        (11) On June 15, 2001, in a speech in Warsaw, Poland, President \n    George W. Bush stated ``[a]ll of Europe's new democracies, from the \n    Baltic to the Black Sea and all that lie between, should have the \n    same chance for security and freedom--and the same chance to join \n    the institutions of Europe--as Europe's old democracies have . . . \n    I believe in NATO membership for all of Europe's democracies that \n    seek it and are ready to share the responsibilities that NATO \n    brings . . . [a]s we plan to enlarge NATO, no nation should be used \n    as a pawn in the agenda of others . . . [w]e will not trade away \n    the fate of free European peoples . . . [n]o more Munichs . . . \n    [n]o more Yaltas . . . [a]s we plan the Prague Summit, we should \n    not calculate how little we can get away with, but how much we can \n    do to advance the cause of freedom''.\n        (12) On October 22, 1996, in a speech in Detroit, Michigan, \n    former President William J. Clinton stated ``NATO's doors will not \n    close behind its first new members . . . NATO should remain open to \n    all of Europe's emerging democracies who are ready to shoulder the \n    responsibilities of membership . . . [n]o nation will be \n    automatically excluded . . . [n]o country outside NATO will have a \n    veto . . . [a] gray zone of insecurity must not reemerge in \n    Europe''.\n        (13) At the Prague Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n    Organization in November 2002, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n    Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia were invited to join the \n    Alliance in the second round of enlargement of the North Atlantic \n    Treaty Organization since the end of the Cold War, and the North \n    Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of state and government issued a \n    declaration stating ``NATO's door will remain open to European \n    democracies willing and able to assume the responsibilities and \n    obligations of membership, in accordance with Article 10 of the \n    Washington Treaty''.\n        (14) On May 8, 2003, the United States Senate unanimously \n    approved the Resolution of Ratification to Accompany Treaty \n    Document No. 108-4, Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 \n    on Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n    Slovakia, and Slovenia, inviting Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n    Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia to join the North \n    Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n        (15) At the Istanbul Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n    Organization in June 2004, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n    heads of state and government issued a communique reaffirming that \n    NATO's door remains open to new members, declaring ``[w]e celebrate \n    the success of NATO's Open Door Policy, and reaffirm tody that our \n    seven new members will not be the last. The door to membership \n    remains open. We welcome the progress made by Albania, Croatia, and \n    the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (1) in implementing their \n    Annual National Programmes under the Membership Action Plan, and \n    encourage them to continue pursuing the reforms necessary to \n    progress toward NATO membership. We also commend their contribution \n    to regional stability and cooperation. We want all three countries \n    to succeed and will continue to assist them in their reform \n    efforts. NATO will continue to assess each country's candidacy \n    individually, based on the progress made towards reform goals \n    pursued through the Membership Action Plan, which will remain the \n    vehicle to keep the readiness of each aspirant for membership under \n    review. We direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep the enlargement \n    process, including the implementation of the Membership Action \n    Plan, under continual review and report to us. We will review at \n    the next Summit progress by aspirants towards membership based on \n    that report''.\n        (16) Georgia and Ukraine have stated their desire to join the \n    Euro-Atlantic community, and in particular, are seeking to join the \n    North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Georgia and Ukraine are working \n    closely with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its members \n    to meet criteria for eventual membership in NATO.\n        (17) At a press conference with President Mikhail Saakashvili \n    of Georgia in Washington, D.C. on July 5, 2006, President George W. \n    Bush stated that ``. . . I believe that NATO would benefit with \n    Georgia being a member of NATO, and I think Georgia would benefit. \n    And there's a way forward through the Membership Action Plan . . . \n    And I'm a believer in the expansion of NATO. I think it's in the \n    world's interest that we expand NATO''.\n        (18) Following a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in New York \n    on September 21, 2006, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer \n    announced the launching of an Intensified Dialogue on membership \n    between the Alliance and Georgia.\n        (19) At the NATO-Ukraine Commission Summit in Brussels in \n    February 2005, President of Ukraine Victor Yushchenko declared \n    membership in NATO as the ultimate goal of Ukraine's cooperation \n    with the Alliance and expressed Ukraine's desire to conclude a \n    Membership Action Plan.\n        (20) At the NATO-Ukraine Commission Foreign Ministerial meeting \n    in Vilnius in April 2005, NATO and Ukraine launched an Intensified \n    Dialogue on the potential membership of Ukraine in NATO.\n        (21) At the Riga Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n    Organization in November 2006, the Heads of State and Government of \n    the member countries of NATO issued a declaration reaffirming that \n    NATO's door remains open to new members, declaring that ``all \n    European democratic countries may be considered for MAP (Membership \n    Action Plan) or admission, subject to decision by the NAC (North \n    Atlantic Council) at each stage, based on the performance of these \n    countries towards meeting the objectives of the North Atlantic \n    Treaty. We direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep that process \n    under continual review and report to us. We welcome the efforts of \n    Albania, Croatia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to \n    prepare themselves for the responsibilities and obligations of \n    membership. We reaffirm that the Alliance will continue with \n    Georgia and Ukraine its Intensified Dialogues which cover the full \n    range of political, military, financial and security issues \n    relating to those countries' aspirations to membership, without \n    prejudice to any eventual Alliance decision. We reaffirm the \n    importance of the NATO-Ukraine Distinctive Partnership, which has \n    its 10th anniversary next year and welcome the progress that has \n    been made in the framework of our Intensified Dialogue. We \n    appreciate Ukraine's substantial contributions to our common \n    security, including through participation in NATO-led operations \n    and efforts to promote regional cooperation. We encourage Ukraine \n    to continue to contribute to regional security. We are determined \n    to continue to assist, through practical cooperation, in the \n    implementation of far-reaching reform efforts, notably in the \n    fields of national security, defence, reform of the defence-\n    industrial sector and fighting corruption. We welcome the \n    commencement of an Intensified Dialogue with Georgia as well as \n    Georgia's contribution to international peacekeeping and security \n    operations. We will continue to engage actively with Georgia in \n    support of its reform process. We encourage Georgia to continue \n    progress on political, economic and military reforms, including \n    strengthening judicial reform, as well as the peaceful resolution \n    of outstanding conflicts on its territory. We reaffirm that it is \n    of great importance that all parties in the region should engage \n    constructively to promote regional peace and stability.''.\n        (22) Contingent upon their continued implementation of \n    democratic, defense, and economic reform, and their willingness and \n    ability to meet the responsibilities of membership in the North \n    Atlantic Treaty Organization and a clear expression of national \n    intent to do so, Congress calls for the timely admission of \n    Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia (FYROM), and Ukraine to the \n    North Atlantic Treaty Organization to promote security and \n    stability in Europe.\nSEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n    Congress--\n        (1) reaffirms its previous expressions of support for continued \n    enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization contained in \n    the NATO Participation Act of 1994, the NATO Enlargement \n    Facilitation Act of 1996, the European Security Act of 1998, and \n    the Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act of 2002;\n        (2) supports the commitment to further enlargement of the North \n    Atlantic Treaty Organization to include European democracies that \n    are able and willing to meet the responsibilities of Membership, as \n    expressed by the Alliance in its Madrid Summit Declaration of 1997, \n    its Washington Summit Communique of 1999, its Prague Summit \n    Declaration of 2002, its Istanbul Summit Communique of 2004, and \n    its Riga Summit Declaration of 2006; and\n        (3) endorses the vision of further enlargement of the North \n    Atlantic Treaty Organization articulated by President George W. \n    Bush on June 15, 2001, and by former President William J. Clinton \n    on October 22, 1996, and urges our allies in the North Atlantic \n    Treaty Organization to work with the United States to realize a \n    role for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in promoting global \n    security, including continued support for enlargement to include \n    qualified candidate states, specifically by entering into a \n    Membership Action Plan with Georgia and recognizing the progress \n    toward meeting the responsibilities and obligations of NATO \n    membership by Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia (FYROM), and \n    Ukraine.\nSEC. 4.
