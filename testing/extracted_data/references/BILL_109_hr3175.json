FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) African poverty and stagnation are the greatest tragedy \n        of our time and demand a forceful response by the United \n        States.\n            (2) The world, especially the United States, is awash with \n        wealth on a scale that has never been seen in human history.\n            (3) We live in a world where new medicines and medical \n        techniques have eradicated many of the diseases and ailments \n        that plagued the rich world.\n            (4) In Africa, some 4,000,000 children under the age of \n        five die each year, two-thirds of them from illnesses that cost \n        very little to treat; malaria is the biggest single killer of \n        African children, and half of those deaths could be avoided if \n        the parents of these children had access to diagnosis and drugs \n        that cost little more than $1 per dose.\n            (5) We live in a world where scientists can map the human \n        genome and have the technology to clone a human being.\n            (6) In Africa, we allow more than 250,000 women die each \n        year from complications in pregnancy or childbirth.\n            (7) We live in a world where the Internet in the blink of \n        an eye can transfer more information than any human brain could \n        hold.\n            (8) In Africa each day, some 40,000,000 children are not \n        able to go to school.\n            (9) We live in a world which, faced by one of the most \n        devastating diseases ever seen, AIDS, has developed the \n        antiretroviral drugs to control its advance.\n            (10) In Africa, where 25,000,000 people are infected with \n        AIDS, antiretroviral drugs are not made generally available; as \n        a result, 2,000,000 people will die of AIDS in 2005.\n            (11) We live in a world where rich nations spend as much as \n        the entire income of all the people in Africa subsidizing the \n        unnecessary production of unwanted food, in an amount of almost \n        $1,000,000,000 each day.\n            (12) In Africa, hunger is a key factor in more deaths than \n        those caused by all of the continent's infectious diseases \n        combined.\n            (13) We live in a world where every cow in Europe receives \n        almost $2 each day in government subsidies.\n            (14) In Africa the average daily income is approximately \n        $1.\n            (15) The contrast between the lives led by those who live \n        in rich countries and those of poor people in Africa is the \n        greatest scandal of our age.\n            (16) One in six children in Africa dies before reaching the \n        age of 5.\n            (17) Two-thirds of all the African children who die under \n        the age of 5 could be saved by low-cost treatments such as \n        vitamin A, and a tenth of all the diseases suffered by African \n        children are caused by intestinal worms that infect 200,000,000 \n        people and could be treated for just 25 cents per child.\n            (18) More than 300,000,000 Africans--42 percent of Africa's \n        population--still do not have access to safe water, and 60 \n        percent do not have access to basic sanitation.\n            (19) 62 percent of all people aged 15-24 years who live \n        with HIV are found in Africa.\n            (20) Africa had 43,000,000 orphans in 2003, of which AIDS \n        was responsible for 12,000,000.\n            (21) In Zambia, 71 percent of child prostitutes are \n        orphans.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    The Congress supports implementing the recommendations of the \nCommission for Africa, which call for rich nations to increase foreign \nassistance to Africa, provide debt relief, eliminate trade distorting \nagricultural subsidies, and remove insidious trade barriers that impede \neconomic opportunity in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSEC. 4.
