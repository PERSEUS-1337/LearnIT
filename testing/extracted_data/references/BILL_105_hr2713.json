FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The first 3 years of life are a critical period of \n        brain development, intellectual growth, and emotional, social, \n        affective, and moral development, that help determine the \n        health and productivity of a child in later life.\n            (2) Scientific research shows that how individuals function \n        from preschool through adolescence and adulthood hinges to a \n        significant extent on the experiences children have in their \n        first 3 years of life.\n            (3) One in 3 victims of physical abuse is a baby less than \n        1 year of age.\n            (4) In 1993 the National Educational Goals Panel reported \n        that nearly half of infants in the United States do not have \n        what they need to grow and thrive.\n            (5) High-quality care from a parent or other adult is \n        necessary to facilitate growth and development.\n            (6) More than 50 percent of mothers with children less than \n        1 year of age are working outside the home.\n            (7) Five million children under age 3 are in the care of \n        other adults while their parents work outside the home.\n            (8) Parents of very young children have few child care \n        service options. Many cannot afford to stay home with their \n        children, or to pay for safe, high-quality developmental child \n        care services.\n            (9) Statewide and multistate studies have found that less \n        than 20 percent of child care services for very young children \n        is of good quality; nearly 50 percent is of such substandard \n        quality that it adversely affects such children's development \n        and may put their health and safety at risk.\n            (10) Families with children less than 3 years of age are \n        the single largest group living in poverty. Twenty-five percent \n        of such children, 3,000,000 children, are living below the \n        poverty line, are at greater risk for malnutrition, poor \n        health, and maltreatment, and are less likely to receive the \n        care they need from parents or other child care service \n        providers to grow and develop normally.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to improve the quality, and to increase the \n        availability, of child care services for children less than 3 \n        years of age,\n            (2) to improve the affordability of child care services \n        available to such children,\n            (3) to improve the quality, and to increase the \n        availability, of services to assist families to nurture such \n        children, and\n            (4) to improve the coordination and effectiveness of \n        existing programs that provide such services to such children \n        and their families.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANTS FOR SERVICES.\n\n    (a) Authority To Make Grants.--The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices may make grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible States to \nimprove the quality, and to increase the availability, of child care \nservices for very young children and of support services for the \nfamilies of such children.\n    (b) Priority.--For the purpose of making grants under subsection \n(a), the Secretary shall give priority to eligible States to the extent \nthat such State, as demonstrated in the application for a grant under \nsuch subsection--\n            (1) will minimize the administrative costs to be incurred \n        to carry out the plan contained in such application,\n            (2) has coordinated the activities described in the plan \n        contained in such application, with providers of child care \n        services for children between 3 and 6 years of age, and with \n        providers of family support services for families of such \n        children, located in the State,\n            (3) has taken substantial legislative or executive action \n        to reduce the duplication of, and barriers to providing, such \n        services, and\n            (4) during the fiscal year for which such grant is \n        received, will reimburse such providers for such services at \n        rates that reflect--\n                    (A) the higher costs incurred by such providers who \n                are accredited by national association that provides \n                accreditation for providers of the respective types of \n                such services and that is recognized by the Secretary, \n                and\n                    (B) the higher costs incurred by such providers to \n                provide child care services to children who are very \n                young children.\n\nSEC. 5.
