FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The labor of drayage and intermodal truck drivers is \n        vital to the movement of goods and to our Nation's economic \n        prosperity.\n            (2) Independent studies have repeatedly documented the low \n        pay and rampant worker misclassification in the port drayage \n        and intermodal industries.\n            (3) The Subcommittee on Highways and Transit of the House \n        Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held a hearing on \n        May 5, 2010, on the negative economic and environmental impacts \n        of port trucking.\n            (4) An investigation published in USA Today on June 16, \n        2017, titled ``Rigged'', detailed disturbing employer abuses \n        and called the work arrangements for many port truck drivers \n        modern-day indentured servitude.\n            (5) The California Labor Commissioner has issued decisions \n        awarding over 400 port drivers in excess of $40 million in back \n        pay due to wage and hour violations.\n            (6) Federal and State courts have consistently upheld the \n        California Labor Commissioner's authority to adjudicate these \n        claims and have rejected complaints that wage claims brought by \n        truck drivers with the Labor Commissioner are preempted by the \n        Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994.\n            (7) The California Employment Development Department and \n        the New Jersey Department of Labor have awarded at least 50 \n        port drivers unemployment and disability benefits.\n            (8) Regions 21 and 5 of the National Labor Relations Board \n        have issued several complaints against port trucking companies \n        for allegedly committing unfair labor practices after \n        investigations determined port drivers were being \n        misclassified.\n            (9) Drayage drivers at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long \n        Beach have engaged in at least 15 unfair labor practice strikes \n        over the past 3 years to protest misclassification, which have \n        caused picketing at marine terminals that delayed cargo and \n        created congestion.\n            (10) Many stakeholders in the movement of goods and \n        licensed motor carriers, including beneficial cargo owners and \n        third-party logistics providers, contribute to negative working \n        conditions for port truck drivers.\n            (11) Government officials have an opportunity and a \n        responsibility to improve the working conditions of port truck \n        drivers.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that truck drivers, including drayage \ndrivers, have the right to--\n            (1) be treated with honesty and respect;\n            (2) have full-time work guarantee a basic standard of \n        living;\n            (3) be covered by Federal, State, and local labor and \n        employment laws;\n            (4) be covered by workplace safety and health laws;\n            (5) be free from exploitative truck lease or rental \n        arrangements;\n            (6) not be misclassified as independent contractors and \n        denied legal protections, benefits, and pay; and\n            (7) bargain collectively for better wages and working \n        conditions.\n\nSEC. 4.
