FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Haiti is the world's first black-led republic and the \n        first Caribbean country to achieve independence.\n            (2) Since its independence on January 1, 1804, the \n        Government of Haiti has struggled to meet the promise of \n        freedom and democracy expressed in the Preliminary Declaration \n        of its 1805 Constitution.\n            (3) Many government changes in the last three decades, \n        accompanied with ongoing violence, have contributed to the \n        government's inability to provide security for its citizens and \n        provide an environment conducive for the development of \n        infrastructure.\n            (4) Since the return of Haiti's democracy, the country has \n        taken steps to achieve a relative measure of stability. \n        However, the 40 percent rise in global food prices and \n        subsequent 50 percent rise in the cost of Haiti's staple foods \n        since mid-2007 has threatened Haiti's security and the capacity \n        of Haiti's economy to prosper.\n            (5) Haiti today stands as the Western Hemisphere's poorest \n        country, and would benefit greatly from technical assistance in \n        the fields of health care, sanitation, capacity building, and \n        the environment.\n            (6) United States Caribbean nationals have traditionally \n        contributed to the economic and social development of their \n        home countries through remittances. Diasporas serve as lobbies \n        in their host countries and as transnational networks and \n        actors in their respective societies. Partnering with the \n        resources of a diaspora can lead to staffing and training of \n        public administration, business development, job creation, and \n        migration management.\n            (7) At least 3 million Haitians live abroad, mostly in the \n        United States and Canada. Members of the Haitian diaspora are \n        Haiti's first customers and investors in tourism, small \n        business, and mining. Return trips by Haitians living abroad \n        provide significant capital for local economies and tourism.\n            (8) According to the Inter-American Development Bank, \n        remittances to families in Haiti reached an estimated 1.83 \n        billion in 2007. These remittances account for 35 percent of \n        Haiti's gross domestic product.\n            (9) The diaspora support is received from hometown \n        associations of professionals focusing on specific fields. \n        These help create small- and medium-sized businesses in Haiti, \n        through micro-volunteer projects and the channeling of funds \n        through local, departmental, and national initiatives.\n            (10) Mobilizing Haitians abroad is one means to advance \n        state and economic reconstruction as well as reversing the \n        brain drain and bring skilled and professional expatriates back \n        to Haiti to greatly expand the nation's management capacity and \n        workforce.\n\nSEC. 3.
