FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Scientific discoveries and technical innovations are \n        critical to the economic and national security of the United \n        States.\n            (2) Maintaining the leadership of the United States in \n        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will require \n        a diverse population with the skills, interest, and access to \n        tools required to advance these fields.\n            (3) Just as earlier digital revolutions in communications \n        and computation provided individuals with the Internet and \n        personal computers, a digital revolution in fabrication will \n        allow anyone to make almost anything, anywhere.\n            (4) Fab labs like the Center for Bits and Atoms at the \n        Massachusetts Institute of Technology provide a model for a new \n        kind of national laboratory that links local facilities for \n        advanced manufacturing to expand access and empower \n        communities.\n            (5) A coordinated national public-private partnership will \n        be the most effective way to accelerate the provision of this \n        infrastructure for learning skills, developing inventions, \n        creating businesses, and producing personalized products.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL FAB LAB NETWORK.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n            (1) the term ``fab lab'' means a facility--\n                    (A) equipped with an integrated suite of \n                fabrication tools to convert digital designs into \n                functional physical things and scanning tools to \n                convert physical things into digital designs; and\n                    (B) available for a range of individual and \n                collaborative educational, commercial, creative, and \n                social purposes, based on guidelines established by the \n                NFLN relating to sustainable operation; and\n            (2) the term ``NFLN'' means the National Fab Lab Network.\n    (b) Federal Charter.--The National Fab Lab Network is a federally \ncharted nonprofit corporation, which shall facilitate the creation of a \nnational network of local fab labs and serve as a resource to assist \nstakeholders with the effective operation of fab labs.\n    (c) Membership and Organization.--\n            (1) In general.--Eligibility for membership in the NFLN and \n        the rights and privileges of members shall be as provided in \n        the constitution and bylaws of the NFLN.
