    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Norman Yoshio Mineta Congressional \nGold Medal Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Norman Yoshio Mineta was born November 12, 1931, in San \n        Jose, California, to immigrant parents, Kunisaku and Kane \n        Mineta, from Shizouka prefecture in Japan.\n            (2) In 1942, Mineta and his family were forcibly relocated \n        to the Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming. They were \n        among 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of whom \n        were natural-born United States citizens, sent to internment \n        camps by the United States Government during the Second World \n        War.\n            (3) After graduating from the University of California at \n        Berkeley, Mineta served as an intelligence officer for the \n        United States Army in Korea and Japan from 1953 to 1956. Mineta \n        then joined his father's insurance business located in San \n        Jose's Japantown.\n            (4) In 1966, Mineta accepted an appointment to the San Jose \n        Housing Authority, believing community involvement to be \n        essential to civic life and the full integration of Japanese \n        Americans into his hometown. He became a city councilmember one \n        year later.\n            (5) Mineta was elected mayor of San Jose in 1971, becoming \n        the first Asian American mayor of a major American city in the \n        continental United States. As mayor, he worked to economically \n        develop San Jose as ``Silicon Valley'' was forming, and also \n        strengthened community relations by engaging racial and ethnic \n        minorities through San Jose city departments and agencies, \n        including the San Jose Police Department.\n            (6) From 1975 to 1995, Mineta served as a Member of the \n        U.S. House of Representatives, representing the heart of Santa \n        Clara County and Silicon Valley. He served on numerous \n        committees, including the Budget, Intelligence, and Science \n        committees. He served longest on the House Public Works and \n        Transportation Committee, now known as the Transportation and \n        Infrastructure Committee, including as Committee Chairman.\n            (7) In 1978, Mineta, along with Representative Frank Horton \n        (R-NY), introduced a bipartisan joint resolution authorizing \n        and requesting the President to proclaim the 7-day period \n        beginning on May 4, 1979, as ``Asian/Pacific American Heritage \n        Week''. May is the month when the first Japanese immigrants \n        arrived in the United States in 1843, and also when Chinese \n        laborers completed the transcontinental railroad in 1869. The \n        resolution became Public Law that year, and was later expanded \n        to recognize the month of May as Asian Pacific American \n        Heritage Month.\n            (8) In 1987, Mineta had the honor of signing the Civil \n        Liberties Act which offered an official apology and redress for \n        the grave injustices committed against Americans of Japanese \n        ancestry during World War II, on behalf of the House of \n        Representatives when acting as Speaker pro tempore. In a \n        culmination of a 10-year bipartisan effort, President Ronald \n        Reagan signed the bill into law as Public Law 100-383 on August \n        10, 1988.\n            (9) Throughout his tenure in the House of Representatives, \n        Mineta was a strong advocate for transportation laws which made \n        air travel safer and aviation and transit systems more \n        accessible to Americans with disabilities. He also authored the \n        Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, which \n        gave State, local, and regional governments greater control \n        over the use of Federal dollars in their communities.\n            (10) Mineta co-founded the Congressional Asian Pacific \n        American Caucus and the Asian Pacific American Institute for \n        Congressional Studies in 1994, which today continue to promote \n        the well-being and full participation of these communities in \n        American civic life.\n            (11) In 2000, Mineta became the first Asian American to \n        serve in a Presidential Cabinet as the Secretary of Commerce \n        under President William J. Clinton.\n            (12) In 2001, Mineta continued his dedication to public \n        service and bipartisanship by serving as Secretary of \n        Transportation under President George W. Bush.\n            (13) Mineta was at the helm of the Department of \n        Transportation on the day of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n        attacks. In the aftermath of the attacks and through the end of \n        his tenure as Secretary of Transportation, he ushered in \n        critical reforms to the Nation's transportation and security \n        screening networks.\n            (14) In 2001, the San Jose City Council announced that the \n        city's airport was to be renamed the Norman Y. Mineta San Jose \n        International Airport.\n            (15) Mineta received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the \n        highest civilian award in the United States, in 2006 from \n        President George W. Bush, and the Grand Cordon, Order of the \n        Rising Sun, from the Government of Japan, which is the highest \n        honor bestowed upon an individual outside of Japan.\n            (16) Having personally experienced the wrongful indignity \n        of internment as a child by his own government, Norman Yoshio \n        Mineta has dedicated his life to public service, to his \n        community, and to his country, and has done so with exemplary \n        dignity and integrity.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make \nappropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of the \nCongress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to Norman Yoshio \nMineta, in recognition of his courageous, principled dedication to \npublic service, civic engagement, and civil rights.\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation referred \nto in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in \nthis Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with suitable \nemblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\nSEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n    The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold \nmedal struck pursuant to section 3 under such regulations as the \nSecretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient to cover the cost \nthereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \noverhead expenses, and the cost of the gold medal.\n\nSEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n    (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this Act are \nnational medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States \nCode.\n    (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of title 31, \nUnited States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be \nconsidered to be numismatic items."
