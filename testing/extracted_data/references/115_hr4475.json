DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United \n        States Geological Survey.\n            (2) System.--The term ``System'' means the National Volcano \n        Early Warning and Monitoring System established under section \n        3(a)(1).\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL VOLCANO EARLY WARNING AND MONITORING SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish within the \n        United States Geological Survey a system, to be known as the \n        ``National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System'', to \n        monitor, warn, and protect citizens of the United States from \n        undue and avoidable harm from volcanic activity.\n            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of the System are--\n                    (A) to organize, modernize, standardize, and \n                stabilize the monitoring systems of the volcano \n                observatories in the United States, which include the \n                Alaska Volcano Observatory, California Volcano \n                Observatory, Cascades Volcano Observatory, Hawaiian \n                Volcano Observatory, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, \n                and other volcano observatories established under \n                subsection (d); and\n                    (B) to unify the monitoring systems of volcano \n                observatories in the United States into a single \n                interoperative system.\n            (3) Objective.--The objective of the System is to monitor \n        all the volcanoes in the United States at a level commensurate \n        with the threat posed by the volcanoes by--\n                    (A) upgrading existing networks on monitored \n                volcanoes;\n                    (B) installing new networks on unmonitored \n                volcanoes; and\n                    (C) employing geodetic and other components when \n                applicable.\n    (b) System Components.--\n            (1) In general.--The System shall include--\n                    (A) a national volcano watch office that is \n                operational 24 hours a day and 7 days a week;\n                    (B) a national volcano data center; and\n                    (C) an external grants program to support research \n                in volcano monitoring science and technology.\n            (2) Modernization activities.--Modernization activities \n        under the System shall include the comprehensive application of \n        emerging technologies, including digital broadband \n        seismometers, real-time continuous Global Positioning System \n        receivers, satellite and airborne radar interferometry, \n        acoustic pressure sensors, and spectrometry to measure gas \n        emissions.\n    (c) Management.--\n            (1) Management plan.--\n                    (A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the \n                date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n                submit to Congress a 5-year management plan for \n                establishing and operating the System.\n                    (B) Inclusions.--The management plan submitted \n                under subparagraph (A) shall include--\n                            (i) annual cost estimates for modernization \n                        activities and operation of the System;\n                            (ii) annual milestones, standards, and \n                        performance goals;
