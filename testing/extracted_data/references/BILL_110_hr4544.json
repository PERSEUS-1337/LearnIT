PURPOSE.\n    The purpose of this Act is to require the issuance of medals to \nexpress the sense of the Congress that--\n        (1) the service of Native American code talkers to the United \n    States deserves immediate recognition for dedication and valor; and\n        (2) honoring Native American code talkers is long overdue.\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n    The Congress finds the following:\n        (1) When the United States entered World War I, Native \n    Americans were not accorded the status of citizens of the United \n    States.\n        (2) Without regard to that lack of citizenship, members of \n    Indian tribes and nations enlisted in the Armed Forces to fight on \n    behalf of the United States.\n        (3) The first reported use of Native American code talkers was \n    on October 17, 1918.\n        (4) Because the language used by the Choctaw code talkers in \n    the transmission of information was not based on a European \n    language or on a mathematical progression, the Germans were unable \n    to understand any of the transmissions.\n        (5) This use of Native American code talkers was the first time \n    in modern warfare that such a transmission of messages in a native \n    language was used for the purpose of confusing an enemy.\n        (6) On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, \n    and the Congress declared war the following day.\n        (7) The Federal Government called on the Comanche Nation to \n    support the military effort during World War II by recruiting and \n    enlisting Comanche men to serve in the Army to develop a secret \n    code based on the Comanche language.\n        (8) The United States Army recruited approximately 50 Native \n    Americans for special native language communication assignments.\n        (9) The United States Marine Corps recruited several hundred \n    Navajos for duty in the Pacific region.\n        (10) During World War II, the United States employed Native \n    American code talkers who developed secret means of communication \n    based on native languages and were critical to winning the war.\n        (11) To the frustration of the enemies of the United States, \n    the code developed by the Native American code talkers proved to be \n    unbreakable and was used extensively throughout the European \n    theater.\n        (12) In 2001, the Congress and President Bush honored Navajo \n    code talkers with congressional gold medals for the contributions \n    of the code talkers to the United States Armed Forces as radio \n    operators during World War II.\n        (13) The heroic and dramatic contributions of Native American \n    code talkers were instrumental in driving back Axis forces across \n    the Pacific during World War II.\n        (14) The Congress should provide to all Native American code \n    talkers the recognition the code talkers deserve for the \n    contributions of the code talkers to United States victories in \n    World War I and World War II.\nSEC. 4.
