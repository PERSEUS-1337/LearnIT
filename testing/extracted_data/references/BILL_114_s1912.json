TRIBAL ACCESS TO POLLING PLACES AND VOTER REGISTRATION.\n\n    (a) Actions Requiring Preclearance.--No State or political \nsubdivision may, unless that State or political subdivision meets the \nrequirements of subsection (b)--\n            (1) eliminate the only polling place or voter registration \n        site on an Indian reservation;\n            (2) move or consolidate a polling place or voter \n        registration site that is located on an Indian reservation to a \n        location 1 mile or further from the existing location of the \n        polling place or voter registration site;\n            (3) move or consolidate a polling place on an Indian \n        reservation to a location across a river, lake, mountain, or \n        other natural boundary such that it makes travel difficult for \n        a voter, regardless of distance;\n            (4) eliminate in-person voting on an Indian reservation by \n        designating an Indian reservation as a permanent absentee \n        voting location, unless--\n                    (A) the entire State is or becomes a permanent \n                absentee voting State; or\n                    (B) the Indian tribe requests such a designation in \n                accordance with section 3(c);\n            (5) remove an early voting location or otherwise diminish \n        early voting opportunities on an Indian reservation; or\n            (6) decrease the number of days or hours that an in-person \n        or early voting location is open on an Indian reservation or \n        change the dates of in-person or early voting on an Indian \n        reservation.\n    (b) Preclearance.--\n            (1) In general.--A State or political subdivision meets the \n        requirements of this subsection if the State or political \n        subdivision--\n                    (A) institutes an action in the United States \n                District Court for the District of Columbia for a \n                declaratory judgment that the specified activity \n                described in subsection (a) that the State or political \n                subdivision desires to carry out neither has the \n                purpose nor will have the effect of denying or \n                abridging the right to vote on account of race or \n                color, or membership in a language minority group, and \n                unless and until the court enters such judgment the \n                State or political subdivision shall not carry out such \n                activity; or\n                    (B) the chief legal officer or other appropriate \n                official of such State or subdivision submits a request \n                to carry out the specified activity described in \n                subsection (a) to the Attorney General and the Attorney \n                General has not interposed an objection within 60 days \n                after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to \n                facilitate an expedited approval within 60 days after \n                such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively \n                indicated that such objection will not be made.\n            (2) No limitation on future actions.--Neither an \n        affirmative indication by the Attorney General that no \n        objection will be made, nor the Attorney General's failure to \n        object, nor a declaratory judgment entered under this section \n        shall bar a subsequent action to enjoin enforcement of an \n        activity described in subsection (a). In the event the Attorney \n        General affirmatively indicates that no objection will be made \n        within the 60-day period following receipt of a submission, the \n        Attorney General may reserve the right to reexamine the \n        submission if additional information comes to the Attorney \n        General's attention during the remainder of the 60-day period \n        which would otherwise require objection in accordance with this \n        section. Any action under this section shall be heard and \n        determined by a court of 3 judges in accordance with the \n        provisions of section 2284 of title 28 of the United States \n        Code and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court.\n\nSEC. 4.
