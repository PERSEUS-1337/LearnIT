FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are more than 200,000 to 400,000 vacancies in \n        various categories of information technology jobs.\n            (2) From 1996 to 2005, more than 1,300,000 new computer \n        scientists, engineers, and systems analysts will be required in \n        the United States to fill vacant jobs, which equals 136,800 new \n        workers per year.\n            (3) Systems analysts will experience the largest job \n        growth, accounting for a 103 percent increase in the number of \n        new positions from 1996 (506,000) to 2005 (1,025,000).\n            (4) The shortage of information technology workers \n        transcends industries, affecting the manufacturing, service, \n        transportation, health care, education, and government sectors. \n        Within each sector, vacancies exist at all levels from aides \n        and mechanics to programmers and designers.\n            (5) The information technology worker shortage is having an \n        adverse effect on the viability of businesses in the United \n        States and on the Nation's competitiveness. Industry surveys \n        report that half of industry executives cite the lack of \n        workers skilled in technology as the number one obstacle to \n        their company's growth. An additional 20 percent of industry \n        executives identify the lack of information technology workers \n        as a major obstacle to their company's growth.\n            (6) A major factor affecting the short supply of \n        information technology workers is the mismatch between what \n        universities teach and what industry needs.\n            (7) It is in the national interest to promote special \n        initiatives which effectively educate and train our domestic \n        workforce to keep pace with these expanding job opportunities.\n            (8) Institutions of higher education have the capacity and \n        resources to provide a role of oversight and technical \n        assistance to a wide range of local entities, including \n        community-based organizations, participating in a comprehensive \n        education and training program for potential technology \n        workers.\n            (9) Higher education institutions must be responsive to the \n        digital environment and expand both their outreach efforts and \n        on-campus activities to train and certify individuals to close \n        the information technology worker gap.\n\nSEC. 3.
