FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the railroad industry has consolidated dramatically \n        since passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (94 Stat. 1895 \n        et seq.), leaving the railroad industry with only a few major \n        carriers and providing shippers with limited competitive \n        options;\n            (2) the financial health of the railroad industry has \n        improved substantially since the passage of the Staggers Rail \n        Act of 1980;\n            (3) due partly to the continued consolidation of the \n        railroad industry, captive rail shippers--\n                    (A) continue to exist; and\n                    (B) are increasing in number; and\n            (4) rail shippers, including captive rail shippers, will \n        benefit from increased competition among railroads and a \n        streamlined process under which the Surface Transportation \n        Board determines the reasonableness of captive rail shipper \n        rates.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Transportation.\n            (2) Surface transportation board.--The term ``Surface \n        Transportation Board'' or ``Board'' means the Surface \n        Transportation Board established under section 701 of title 49, \n        United States Code.\n\nSEC. 4.

CLARIFICATION OF RAIL TRANSPORTATION POLICY.\n\n    Section 10101 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``In \n        regulating''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Primary Objectives.--The primary objectives of the rail \ntransportation policy of the United States shall be--\n            ``(1) to ensure effective competition among rail carriers \n        at origin and destination; and\n            ``(2) to maintain reasonable rates in the absence of \n        effective competition.''.\n\nSEC. 6. REQUIREMENT OF RAILROADS TO ESTABLISH RATES TO FACILITATE RAIL \n              TO RAIL COMPETITION.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Rate.--Section 11101(a) of title 49, United \nStates Code, is amended by inserting after the first sentence the \nfollowing: ``Upon the request of a shipper, a rail carrier shall \nestablish a rate for transportation requested by the shipper between \nany 2 points on the system of that rail carrier where traffic \noriginates, terminates, or may be interchanged. A rate established \nunder the preceding sentence shall apply to the shipper that makes the \nrequest for the rate without regard to whether the rate established is \nfor part of a through transportation route between an origin and a \ndestination or whether the shipper has made arrangements for \ntransportation over any other part of that through route.''.\n    (b) Review of Reasonableness of Rate.--Section 10701(d) of title \n49, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n    ``(3) If a rail carrier establishes a rate for transportation \nbetween any 2 points on the system of that rail carrier where rail \ntraffic originates, terminates, or may be interchanged, the shipper may \nchallenge the reasonableness of--\n            ``(A) that rate; or\n            ``(B) the aggregate rate between origin and destination (if \n        the rate established is for part of a through route).''.\n\nSEC. 7.
