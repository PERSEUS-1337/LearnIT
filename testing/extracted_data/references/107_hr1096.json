FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) While there are rural education initiatives identified \n        at the State and local level, no Federal education policy \n        focuses on the specific needs of rural school districts and \n        schools, especially those that serve poor students.\n            (2) The National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) \n        reports that while 46 percent of our Nation's public schools \n        serve rural areas, they only receive 22 percent of the Nation's \n        education funds annually.\n            (3) A critical problem for rural school districts involves \n        the hiring and retention of qualified administrators and \n        certified teachers (especially in special education, science, \n        and mathematics). Consequently, teachers in rural schools are \n        almost twice as likely to provide instruction in two or more \n        subjects than teachers in urban schools. Rural schools also \n        face other tough challenges, such as shrinking local tax bases, \n        high transportation costs, aging buildings, limited course \n        offerings, and limited resources.\n            (4) Data from the National Assessment of Educational \n        Progress (NAEP) consistently shows large gaps between the \n        achievement of students in high-poverty schools and those in \n        other schools. High-poverty schools face special challenges in \n        preparing their students to reach high standards of performance \n        on State and national assessments.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide rural school \nstudents in the United States with increased learning opportunities.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n     In this Act:\n            (1) The terms ``elementary school'', ``local educational \n        agency'', and ``State educational agency'' have the meanings \n        given such terms in section 14101 of the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801).\n            (2) The term ``eligible local educational agency'' means a \n        local educational agency that serves--\n                    (A) a school-age population, 20 percent or more of \n                whom are from families with incomes below the poverty \n                line; and\n                    ``(B)(i) only schools designated by the Secretary \n                with a school locale code of 6, 7, or 8; or\n                    (ii) a school-age population of 800 or fewer.\n            (3) The term ``poverty line'' has the meaning given such \n        term by section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)) applicable to a family of the size \n        involved.\n            (4) The term ``rural area'' means the area defined by the \n        Secretary using school locale codes 6, 7, and 8.\n            (5) The term ``school-age population'' means the number of \n        students aged 5 through 17.\n            (6) The term ``school locale code'' has the meaning given \n        such term by the Secretary.\n            (7) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Education.\n            (8) The term ``specially qualified agency'' means an \n        eligible local educational agency, located in a State that does \n        not participate in a program under this Act in a fiscal year, \n        that may apply directly to the Secretary for a grant in such \n        year under section 4(a)(3).\n\nSEC. 4.
