FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The operation of dams and other water diversion \n        projects are for the benefit of the American public. The \n        construction and operation of these Federal water resource \n        development projects have had impacts on many water systems and \n        their respective fish populations, resulting in the need to \n        build and operate fish hatcheries to mitigate for aquatic \n        resources affected by these projects.\n            (2) In accordance with the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 \n        (16 U.S.C. 742(a)-754), the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act \n        (16 U.S.C. 661-667(e)), the Watershed Protection and Flood \n        Prevention Act (16 U.S.C. 1001-1009), and the National \n        Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), the Service has \n        established policy (501 FW 2) to seek to mitigate for fish, \n        wildlife, and their habitats, and uses thereof, from the \n        effects of land and water developments.\n            (3) The United States Fish and Wildlife Service currently \n        operates nearly 40 fish hatcheries that are involved in \n        mitigation fishery activities related to construction and \n        operation of Federal water resource development projects.\n            (4) Mitigation fishery activities conducted by the Service \n        at these facilities are highly valued by the State and Indian \n        tribal partners, and the fishing community.\n            (5) Inconsistency in authorities, which now number over \n        200, to construct and operate Federal water resource \n        development projects have led to myriad mechanisms for funding \n        and conducting Federal mitigation fishery activities. In most \n        cases Federal water project sponsors fund mitigation fishery \n        costs. In some cases the Service expends its appropriations to \n        offset mitigation fishery costs.\n            (6) The Service is the Federal agency through which a \n        sponsor agency will negotiate to provide goods and services to \n        augment fisheries to compensate for the impact of Federal water \n        development projects on aquatic resources.\n            (7) The sponsor agency should bear the financial \n        responsibility for mitigation fishery costs incurred by the \n        Service.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For this Act, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Sponsor agency.--The term ``sponsor agency'' means the \n        United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of \n        Reclamation, or the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n            (2) Service.--The term ``Service'' means the United States \n        Fish and Wildlife Service.\n            (3) Mitigation fisheries.--The term ``mitigation \n        fisheries'' means fisheries augmented by hatchery fish to \n        compensate for the impacts of Federal water development \n        projects on aquatic resources.\n            (4) Mitigation fishery activities.--The term ``mitigation \n        fishery activities'' means rearing and stocking of native and \n        nonnative fish to replace or maintain harvest levels lost as a \n        result of Federal water resource development projects and \n        includes project planning and evaluation.\n            (5) Mitigation fishery costs.--The term ``mitigation \n        fishery costs'' means the expenditures necessary to operate, \n        maintain, and rehabilitate facilities to conduct mitigation \n        fishery activities, and include: personnel, transportation, \n        utilities, contractual services, fish feed, supplies, \n        equipment, routine maintenance, deferred maintenance, fish \n        eggs, technical support, fish health, management and \n        administration, planning, and evaluation.\n            (6) Mitigation fishery facility.--The term ``mitigation \n        fishery facility'' means facilities owned and operated by the \n        United States Fish and Wildlife Service through the National \n        Fish Hatchery System for the purpose, either wholly or in part, \n        of conducting mitigation fishery activities.\n            (7) Fishery mitigation plan.--The term ``fishery mitigation \n        plan'' refers to a resource management plan developed between \n        the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and one or more \n        sponsor agencies, and in cooperation and coordination with \n        affected States and Indian Tribes, that describes the long-term \n        goals and annual targets for conducting mitigation fishery \n        activities. A fishery mitigation plan shall be approved in \n        advance by a sponsor agency and the Service.\n\nSEC. 4. MITIGATION FISHERY COSTS.\n\n    Not later than October 1, 2007, and each October 1st thereafter, a \nsponsor agency shall pay to the Service the total amount of funds \nnecessary to meet the mitigation fishery costs to meet objectives \ndescribed in the fishery mitigation plan for a respective water \ndevelopment project. The funds to be obligated for this purpose shall \nbe identified in advance by the Director of the United States Fish and \nWildlife Service."
