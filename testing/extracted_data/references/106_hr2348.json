If the Western Area Power Administration \nand the Bureau of Reclamation determine that the funds in the Colorado \nRiver Basin Fund will not be sufficient to meet the obligations of \nsection 5(c)(1) of the Colorado River Storage Project Act for a 3-year \nperiod, the Western Area Power Administration and the Bureau of \nReclamation shall request appropriations to meet base funding \nobligations.\n    (e) Authority To Retain Appropriated Funds.--At the end of each \nfiscal year any unexpended appropriated funds for capital projects \nunder this Act shall be retained for use in future fiscal years. \nUnexpended funds under this Act that are carried over shall continue to \nbe used to implement the capital projects needed for the Recovery \nImplementation Programs.\n    (f) Additional Authority.--The Secretary may enter into agreements \nand contracts with Federal and non-Federal entities, acquire and \ntransfer interests in land, water, and facilities, and accept or give \ngrants in order to carry out the purposes of this Act.\n    (g) Indian Trust Assets.--The Congress finds that much of the \npotential water development in the San Juan River Basin and in the \nDuchesne River Basin (a subbasin of the Green River in the Upper \nColorado River Basin) is for the benefit of Indian tribes and most of \nthe federally designated critical habitat for the endangered fish \nspecies in the San Juan River Basin is on Indian trust lands, and 2\\1/\n2\\ miles of critical habitat on the Duchesne River is on Indian Trust \nLand. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to restrict the Secretary, \nacting through the Bureau of Reclamation and the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, from funding activities or capital projects in accordance with \nthe Federal Government's Indian trust responsibility.\n    (h) Termination of Authority.--All authorities provided by this \nsection for the respective Recovery Implementation Program shall \nterminate upon expiration of the current time period for the respective \nCooperative Agreement referenced in section 2(1) unless, at least 1 \nyear prior to such expiration, the time period for the respective \nCooperative Agreement is extended to conform with this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
