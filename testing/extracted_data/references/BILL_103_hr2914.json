FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Department of Housing and Urban Development has a \n        large and growing inventory of multifamily housing projects \n        owned by the Department and multifamily housing projects \n        subject to mortgages in foreclosure that are held by the \n        Department;\n            (2) the total number of such housing projects in the \n        inventory of the Department at the beginning of fiscal year \n        1993 was 444 and is likely to increase to 742 by the end of \n        fiscal year 1998;\n            (3) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has \n        estimated that the Department will lose as much as \n        $11,900,000,000 as a result of mortgage foreclosures on \n        multifamily housing projects insured by the Department, which \n        is equivalent to 25 percent of the value of all mortgages \n        insured under the General Insurance Fund;\n            (4) the Department is not prepared to manage an inventory \n        of multifamily housing projects as large as the inventory \n        expected by the end of fiscal year 1993, resulting in increased \n        holding and disposition costs for such projects; and\n            (5) existing laws would require the attachment of \n        $7,000,000,000 of rental assistance in the form of 15-year \n        contracts under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of \n        1937 to eliminate the backlog of multifamily housing projects \n        in the inventory of the Department.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act, therefore, is--\n            (1) to declare that an emergency exists with respect to the \n        disposition of multifamily housing projects in the inventory of \n        the Department;\n            (2) to provide for flexibility in disposing of such \n        projects by removing some of the statutory requirements that \n        impede the sale of such projects;\n            (3) to encourage assistance for residents of such projects \n        through means other than rental assistance under section 8 of \n        the United States Housing Act of 1937; and\n            (4) to maintain, to the maximum extent possible, the low-\n        income character of such projects while disposing of such \n        projects in an economical and expeditious manner.\n\nSEC. 3.
