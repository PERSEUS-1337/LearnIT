FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution \n        to protect every State from invasion, which includes terrorist \n        attack.\n            (2) The Federal Government relies on State and local \n        personnel to protect against terrorist attack.\n            (3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and \n        protects sensitive information to enhance national security.\n            (4) Some homeland security information is needed by the \n        State and local personnel to prevent and prepare for terrorist \n        attack.\n            (5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access \n        to relevant homeland security information to combat terrorism \n        must be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected \n        status of such information and to protect the sources and \n        methods used to acquire such information.\n            (6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local \n        personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information \n        regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, and \n        local levels of government.\n            (7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt \n        classified information so it may be shared with State and local \n        personnel without the need for granting additional security \n        clearances.\n            (8) State and local personnel have capabilities and \n        opportunities to gather information on suspicious activities \n        and terrorist threats not possessed by the Federal intelligence \n        agencies.\n            (9) The intelligence community and State and local \n        governments and agencies in other jurisdictions may benefit \n        from such information.\n            (10) Federal, State, and local governments and \n        intelligence, law enforcement, and other emergency preparation \n        and response agencies must act in partnership to maximize the \n        benefits of information gathering and analysis to prevent and \n        respond to terrorist attacks.\n            (11) Information systems, including the National Law \n        Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist Threat \n        Warning System, have been established for rapid sharing of \n        sensitive and unclassified information among Federal, State, \n        and local entities.\n            (12) Increased efforts to share homeland security \n        information should avoid duplicating existing information \n        systems.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Federal, \nState, and local entities should share homeland security information to \nthe maximum extent practicable.\n\nSEC. 3. FACILITATING HOMELAND SECURITY INFORMATION SHARING PROCEDURES.\n\n    (a) Presidential Procedures for Determining Extent of Sharing of \nHomeland Security Information.--\n            (1) The President shall prescribe procedures under which \n        Federal agencies determine--\n                    (A) whether, how, and to what extent homeland \n                security information may be shared with appropriate \n                State and local personnel, and with which such \n                personnel may it be shared; and\n                    (B) to the extent such information is in classified \n                form, whether, how, and to what extent to declassify \n                (or remove classified information from, as appropriate) \n                such information, and with which such personnel may it \n                be shared after such declassification (or removal).\n            (2) The President shall ensure that such procedures apply \n        to each element of the intelligence community and that the \n        requisite technology is available.\n            (3) Such procedures shall not change the substantive \n        requirements for the classification and treatment of classified \n        information.\n            (4) Such procedures shall not change the requirements and \n        authorities to protect sources and methods.\n    (b) Procedures for Sharing of Homeland Security Information.--\n            (1) Under procedures prescribed jointly by the Director of \n        Central Intelligence and the Attorney General, each element of \n        the intelligence community shall, through information sharing \n        systems, share homeland security information with appropriate \n        State and local personnel to the extent such information may be \n        shared, as determined in accordance with subsection (a), \n        together with assessments of the credibility of such \n        information.\n            (2) Each information sharing system through which \n        information is shared under paragraph (1) shall--\n                    (A) have the capability to transmit unclassified or \n                classified information, though the procedures and \n                recipients for each capability may differ;\n                    (B) have the capability to restrict delivery of \n                information to specified subgroups by geographic \n                location, type of organization, position of a recipient \n                within an organization, and a recipient's need to know \n                such information;\n                    (C) be configured to allow the efficient and \n                effective sharing of information;
