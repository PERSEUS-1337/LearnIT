FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Colombia has been embroiled in a 38-year civil war, \n        resulting in the death of tens of thousands of civilians and \n        combatants;\n            (2) the two main armed anti-government rebel groups, the \n        Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas \n        Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC) and the National \n        Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional, or ELN), have \n        engaged in military activities in 700 of 1,098 municipalities \n        in Colombia, and in recent years have controlled or influenced \n        local governments in as much as 40 percent to 50 percent of \n        Colombian territory;\n            (3) the FARC and ELN not only attack police and military \n        forces but also regularly attack civilian populations, commit \n        massacres and extrajudicial killings, collect war taxes, compel \n        citizens into their ranks, force farmers to grow illicit crops, \n        and regulate travel, commerce, and other activities;\n            (4) paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense \n        Groups of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia or AUC), \n        originally established to protect rural landowners, have grown \n        dramatically in recent years to become a major national \n        military force in Colombia;\n            (5) paramilitary groups are responsible, according to human \n        rights groups, for the greatest number of extrajudicial \n        killings and forced disappearances in Colombia since 1995;\n            (6) the FARC, ELN, and AUC, all designated by the State \n        Department as foreign terrorist organizations, have a combined \n        force of 25,000 combatants;\n            (7) the Government of Colombia, particularly during the \n        administration of President Andres Pastrana, has afforded armed \n        rebel groups numerous opportunities to negotiate a peace \n        agreement, including the extraordinary step in November 1998 of \n        creating a safe haven for the FARC by withdrawing its security \n        forces from 5 municipalities covering some 16,000-17,000 square \n        miles;\n            (8) despite having been given the opportunity to seek \n        peace, the FARC instead used the safe haven to enhance its \n        military capability to further its violent campaign against the \n        government and people of Colombia;\n            (9) while President Pastrana and the Colombian government \n        negotiated in good faith, the FARC proceeded to kidnap \n        political officials, including presidential candidate former \n        Senator Ingrid Betancourt, as well as execute Members of \n        Congress who were engaged in negotiations with the FARC, such \n        as Senator Martha Catalina Daniels;\n            (10) in February of this year, the FARC's actions forced \n        President Pastrana to withdraw from the peace process and begin \n        the process of retaking the safe zone he had previously ceded \n        to the FARC and other rebel groups;\n            (11) after the election of Alvaro Uribe as Colombia's \n        President, the FARC began targeting mayors with letters \n        declaring that they had 24 hours to leave or would be \n        considered ``military targets'';\n            (12) although before the recent Presidential election the \n        violence had been mostly contained in rural areas, it has now \n        spread to the urban areas, with cities such as Medellin \n        experiencing an average of 13 killings a day;\n            (13) an average of 2.8 rebel bombs go off every day in \n        Colombia while bomb squads disarm another five;\n            (14) the middle and upper classes have been targeted for \n        kidnaping, with an average of 3,250 Colombians being kidnaped \n        each year since 1998;\n            (15) between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 people have been \n        forced to leave their homes, representing the third largest \n        internal refugee crisis in the world; and\n            (16) between 1,500 and 2,500 Colombians were massacred in \n        contested rural areas in 2001.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that, in view of the recent escalation \nof the current civil war in Colombia, Colombia qualifies for \ndesignation under section 244(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(1)(A)), pursuant to which Colombian \nnationals would be eligible for temporary protected status in the \nUnited States.\n\nSEC. 4. DESIGNATION FOR PURPOSES OF GRANTING TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS \n              TO COLOMBIANS.\n\n    (a) Designation.--\n            (1) In general.--For purposes of section 244 of the \n        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a), Colombia \n        shall be treated as if it had been designated under subsection \n        (b) of such section, subject to the provisions of this section.\n            (2) Period of designation.--The initial period of such \n        designation shall begin on the date of the enactment of this \n        Act and shall remain in effect for 1 year.\n    (b) Aliens Eligible.--In applying section 244 of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act pursuant to the designation under this Act, subject \nto section 244(c)(3) of such Act, an alien who is a national of \nColombia meets the requirements of section 244(c)(1) of such Act only \nif--\n            (1) the alien has been continuously physically present in \n        the United States since the date of enactment of this Act;\n            (2) the alien is admissible as an immigrant, except as \n        otherwise provided under section 244(c)(2)(A) of such Act, and \n        is not ineligible for temporary protected status under section \n        244(c)(2)(B) of such Act; and\n            (3) the alien registers for temporary protected status in a \n        manner that the Attorney General shall establish.\n    (c) Consent to Travel Abroad.--The Attorney General shall give the \nprior consent to travel abroad described in section 244(f)(3) of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act to an alien who is granted temporary \nprotected status pursuant to the designation under this Act, if the \nalien establishes to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that \nemergency and extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the alien \nrequire the alien to depart for a brief, temporary trip abroad. An \nalien returning to the United States in accordance with such an \nauthorization shall be treated the same as any other returning alien \nprovided temporary protected status under section 244 of such Act."
