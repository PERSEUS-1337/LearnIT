    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Koby Mandell Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Numerous American citizens have been murdered or maimed \n        by terrorists around the world, including more than 100 \n        murdered since 1968 in terrorist attacks occurring in Israel or \n        in territories administered by Israel or in territories \n        administered by the Palestinian Authority.\n            (2) Some American citizens who have been victims of \n        terrorism overseas, especially those harmed by terrorists \n        operating from areas administered by the Palestinian Authority, \n        have not received from the United States Government services \n        equal to those received by other such victims of overseas \n        terrorism.\n            (3) The United States Government has not devoted adequate \n        efforts or resources to the apprehension of terrorists who have \n        harmed American citizens overseas, particularly in cases \n        involving terrorists operating from areas administered by the \n        Palestinian Authority. Monetary rewards for information leading \n        to the capture of terrorists overseas, which the Government \n        advertises in regions where the terrorists are believed to be \n        hiding, have not been advertised in areas administered by the \n        Palestinian Authority.\n            (4) This situation is especially grave in the areas \n        administered by the Palestinian Authority, because many \n        terrorists involved in the murders of Americans are walking \n        free there; some of these terrorists have been given positions \n        in the Palestinian Authority security forces or other official \n        Palestinian Authority agencies; and a number of schools, \n        streets, and other public sites have been named in honor of \n        terrorists who were involved in the murders of Americans.\n            (5) To remedy these and related problems, an office should \n        be established within the Department of Justice for the purpose \n        of ensuring equally vigorous efforts to capture all terrorists \n        who have harmed American citizens overseas and equal treatment \n        for all American victims of overseas terrorism.\n\nSEC. 3.
