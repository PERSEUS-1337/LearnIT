FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The growth in international trade, particularly \n        containerized trade, is placing pressure on the nation's \n        transportation network and influences traffic congestion in the \n        areas surrounding the major United States-international \n        gateways.\n            (2) From 2000 to 2005, the value of international trade \n        rose from approximately $2,000,000,000,000 to \n        $2,600,000,000,000, while the number of containerized trade \n        shipments rose over the same period from approximately \n        59,000,000 20-foot equivalent units to 81,000,000 20-foot \n        equivalent units.\n            (3) Existing trade agreements, in addition to potential \n        future agreements, foreshadow an even greater increase in \n        international trade and further increases of freight shipments \n        congestion.\n            (4) In addition to being a member of the World Trade \n        Organization, the United States has agreed to 11 free trade \n        agreements and is in various stages of negotiation with 4 \n        different countries and multi-lateral organizations with \n        regards to other potential free trade agreements.\n            (5) Traffic congestion continues to worsen in United States \n        cities of all sizes, causing Americans to waste 4,200,000,000 \n        hours in traffic and to purchase an extra 2,900,000,000 gallons \n        of fuel for a congestion cost of $78,000,000,000 per year.\n            (6) More than 200 freight bottlenecks are costing the goods \n        movement industry $8,000,000,000 in economic losses annually \n        and 243,000,000 hours of delay and lost productivity each year.\n            (7) To simply maintain the current conditions and traffic \n        levels of service of our transportation system, all levels of \n        government must have invested $235,000,000,000 in 2006 and must \n        invest $304,000,000,000 in 2015 and $472,000,000,000 in 2030.\n            (8) To improve the current conditions and traffic levels of \n        service of our transportation system to a level that benefits \n        the Nation's economic productivity, all levels of government \n        must have invested $288,000,000,000 in 2006 and must invest \n        $368,000,000,000 in 2015 and $561,000,000,000 in 2030.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) address major transportation investment needs in \n        national trade gateway corridors;\n            (2) reduce freight congestion along current and future \n        trade corridors and provide congestion mitigation along surface \n        transportation routes that are or will be congested as a result \n        of current or future growth in international trade; and\n            (3) develop corridors that will increase freight \n        transportation system reliability and enhance the quality of \n        life for United States citizens.\n\nSEC. 3.
