FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Currently, 64.5 percent of adults in the United States, \n        age 20 years and older, are overweight and 30.5 percent of them \n        are obese.\n            (2) Data from two National Health and Nutrition Examination \n        Surveys show that among adults aged 20-74 years the prevalence \n        of obesity increased from 15.0 percent in the 1976-1980 survey \n        to 32.9 percent in the 2003-2004 survey.\n            (3) 50 percent of women aged 20 to 74 are overweight or \n        obese in the United States according to the National Women's \n        Health Information Center.\n            (4) In 2003-04, of children and adolescents 2-19 years of \n        age more than 12,500,000 (or 17.1 percent) were overweight, and \n        of adults more than 66,000,000 (or 32.2 percent) were obese. \n        Almost 5 percent of adults were extremely obese.\n            (5) The percentage of children who are overweight has more \n        than doubled, and among adolescents the rates have more than \n        tripled, since 1980 increasing from 5 percent to 17.1 percent.\n            (6) More than 50 percent of adults in the United States do \n        not get enough physical activity and national data have shown \n        an increase in the calorie consumption of adults.\n            (7) About two-thirds of young people in grades 9-12 are not \n        engaged in recommended levels of physical activity. Daily \n        participation in high school physical education classes dropped \n        from 42 percent in 1991 to 33 percent in 2005.\n            (8) The rising rates of obesity portend greater disease and \n        health conditions including hypertension, high total \n        cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, \n        gallbladder disease, osteoporosis, sleep apnea, and respiratory \n        problems, and some cancers, such as endometrial, breast, and \n        colon cancer.\n            (9) Many underlying factors have been linked to the \n        increase in obesity, such as increasing portion sizes, eating \n        out more often, increased consumption of sugar-sweetened \n        drinks, increasing television, computer, and electronic gaming \n        time, changing labor markets, and fear of crime, which prevents \n        outdoor exercise.\n            (10) Chronic diseases account for 1.7 million, or 70 \n        percent, of all deaths in the United States each year. Although \n        chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health \n        problems, they are also among the most preventable. Adopting a \n        healthy lifestyle such as eating nutritious foods and engaging \n        in physical activity, can prevent or control the devastating \n        effects of these diseases. Although chronic diseases are among \n        the most common and costly health problems, they are also among \n        the most preventable.\n            (11) According to the Surgeon General's Call to Action to \n        Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity, the cost of \n        obesity in the United States in 2000 was more than $117 \n        billion.\n\nSEC. 3.
