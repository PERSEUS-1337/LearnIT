FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Concussions are mild traumatic brain injuries, the \n        long-term effects of which are not well understood.\n            (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention (CDC), each year United States emergency departments \n        treat an estimated 173,285 sports- and recreation-related mild \n        traumatic brain injuries (MTBIs), including concussions, among \n        children and adolescents, from birth to 19 years of age. \n        However, this number does not capture the total number, as many \n        MTBIs go undiagnosed.\n            (3) There is an increased risk for subsequent brain \n        injuries among persons who have had at least one previous brain \n        injury.\n            (4) A repeat concussion, one that occurs before the brain \n        recovers from a previous concussion, can slow recovery or \n        increase the likelihood of having long-term problems.\n            (5) In rare cases, repeat concussions can result in second \n        impact syndrome, which can be marked by brain swelling, \n        permanent brain damage, and death.\n            (6) Recurrent brain injuries and second impact syndrome are \n        highly preventable.\n            (7) Many States have adopted concussion management rules \n        and regulations, but many schools lack the resources to \n        implement best practices in concussion diagnosis and \n        management.\n\nSEC. 3. GUIDELINES ON BEST PRACTICES FOR DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND \n              MANAGEMENT OF MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES IN SCHOOL-\n              AGED CHILDREN.\n\n    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act 6 (42 U.S.C. \n243 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 317T the following:\n\n``SEC. 317U.
