CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n        provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n        shall not be infringed.\n            (2) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n        protects the rights of individuals, including those who are not \n        members of a militia or engaged in military service or \n        training, to keep and bear arms.\n            (3) The law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia \n        are deprived by local laws of handguns, rifles, and shotguns \n        that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the \n        United States for sporting use and for lawful defense of their \n        persons, homes, businesses, and families.\n            (4) The District of Columbia has one of the highest per \n        capita murder rates in the Nation, which may be attributed in \n        part to local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-\n        abiding persons who would otherwise be able to defend \n        themselves and their loved ones in their own homes and \n        businesses.\n            (5) The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by the \n        Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, and the Brady Handgun \n        Violence Prevention Act of 1993, provide comprehensive Federal \n        regulations applicable in the District of Columbia as \n        elsewhere. In addition, existing District of Columbia criminal \n        laws punish possession and illegal use of firearms by violent \n        criminals and felons. Consequently, there is no need for local \n        laws which only affect and disarm law-abiding citizens.\n            (6) Legislation is required to correct the District of \n        Columbia's law in order to restore the fundamental rights of \n        its citizens under the Second Amendment to the United States \n        Constitution and thereby enhance public safety.\n\nSEC. 3. REFORM D.C. COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT FIREARMS.\n\n    Section 4 of the Act entitled ``An Act to prohibit the killing of \nwild birds and wild animals in the District of Columbia'', approved \nJune 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 809; section 1-303.43, D.C. Official Code) is \namended by adding at the end the following: ``Nothing in this section \nor any other provision of law shall authorize, or shall be construed to \npermit, the Council, the Mayor, or any governmental or regulatory \nauthority of the District of Columbia to prohibit, constructively \nprohibit, or unduly burden the ability of persons not prohibited from \npossessing firearms under Federal law from acquiring, possessing in \ntheir homes or businesses, or using for sporting, self-protection or \nother lawful purposes, any firearm neither prohibited by Federal law \nnor subject to the National Firearms Act. The District of Columbia \nshall not have authority to enact laws or regulations that discourage \nor eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REPEAL D.C.
