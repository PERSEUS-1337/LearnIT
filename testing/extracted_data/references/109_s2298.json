    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``California Perchlorate Contamination \nRemediation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) because finite water sources in the United States are \n        stretched by regional drought conditions and increasing demand \n        for water supplies, there is increased need for safe and \n        dependable supplies of fresh water for drinking and \n        agricultural purposes;\n            (2) perchlorate, a naturally occurring and manmade compound \n        with commercial and national defense applications, is used \n        primarily in military munitions and rocket fuels, and also in \n        fireworks, road flares, blasting agents, and automobile \n        airbags;\n            (3) perchlorate has been detected in fresh water sources \n        intended for drinking water and agricultural use in 35 States \n        and the District of Columbia;\n            (4)(A) perchlorate has been detected in the food supply of \n        the United States; and\n            (B) many fruits and vegetables, including lettuce, wheat, \n        tomato, cucumber, and cantaloupe, contain at least trace levels \n        of perchlorate, as do wine, whiskey, soy milk, dairy milk, and \n        human breast milk; and\n            (5) if ingested in sufficient concentration and for \n        adequate duration, perchlorate may interfere with thyroid \n        metabolism, the effects of which may impair normal development \n        of the brain in fetuses, newborns, and children.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide grants for remediation of perchlorate \n        contamination of water sources and supplies (including \n        wellheads) in the State;\n            (2) to provide grants for research and development of \n        perchlorate remediation technologies; and\n            (3) to express the sense of Congress that the Administrator \n        should establish a national drinking water standard for \n        perchlorate.\n\nSEC. 3.
