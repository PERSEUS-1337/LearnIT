FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is appropriate to exercise congressional enforcement \n        authority under section 5 of the 14th Amendment to the \n        Constitution of the United States and Congress' plenary power \n        under article I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n        United States (commonly known as the ``commerce clause'') in \n        order to ensure that States and political subdivisions thereof \n        do not discriminate against providers and consumers of mobile \n        services by imposing new selective and excessive taxes and \n        other burdens on such providers and consumers.\n            (2) In light of the history and pattern of discriminatory \n        taxation faced by providers and consumers of mobile services, \n        the prohibitions against and remedies to correct discriminatory \n        State and local taxation in section 306 of the Railroad \n        Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (49 U.S.C. \n        11501) provide an appropriate analogy for congressional action, \n        and similar Federal legislative measures are warranted that \n        will prohibit imposing new discriminatory taxes on providers \n        and consumers of mobile services and that will assure an \n        effective, uniform remedy.\n\nSEC. 3.
