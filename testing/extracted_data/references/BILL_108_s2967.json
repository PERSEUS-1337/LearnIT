DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Green chemistry.--The term ``green chemistry'' means \n        chemistry and chemical engineering to design chemical products \n        and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of \n        hazardous substances.\n            (2) Interagency working group.--The term ``Interagency \n        Working Group'' means the interagency working group established \n        under section 3(c).\n            (3) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Green \n        Chemistry Research and Development Program described in section \n        3.\n\nSEC. 3. GREEN CHEMISTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The President shall establish a Green Chemistry \nResearch and Development Program to promote and coordinate Federal \ngreen chemistry research, development, demonstration, education, and \ntechnology transfer activities.\n    (b) Program Activities.--The activities of the Program shall be \ndesigned to--\n            (1) provide sustained support for green chemistry research, \n        development, demonstration, education, and technology transfer \n        through--\n                    (A) merit-reviewed competitive grants to individual \n                investigators and teams of investigators, including, to \n                the extent practicable, young investigators, for \n                research and development;\n                    (B) merit-reviewed competitive grants to fund \n                collaborative university-industry research and \n                development partnerships;\n                    (C) green chemistry research, development, \n                demonstration, and technology transfer conducted at \n                Federal laboratories; and\n                    (D) to the extent practicable, encouragement of \n                consideration of green chemistry in--\n                            (i) the conduct of Federal chemical science \n                        and engineering research and development; and\n                            (ii) the solicitation and evaluation of all \n                        proposals for chemical science and engineering \n                        research and development;\n            (2) examine methods by which the Federal Government can \n        create incentives for consideration and use of green chemistry \n        processes and products;\n            (3) facilitate the adoption of green chemistry innovations;\n            (4) expand education and training of undergraduate and \n        graduate students in green chemistry science and engineering;\n            (5) collect and disseminate information on green chemistry \n        research, development, and technology transfer, including \n        information on--\n                    (A) incentives and impediments to development and \n                commercialization;\n                    (B) accomplishments;\n                    (C) best practices; and\n                    (D) costs and benefits; and\n            (6) provide venues for outreach and dissemination of green \n        chemistry advances such as symposia, forums, conferences, and \n        written materials in collaboration with, as appropriate, \n        industry, academia, scientific and professional societies, and \n        other relevant groups.\n    (c) Interagency Working Group.--The President shall establish an \nInteragency Working Group, which shall include representatives from the \nNational Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, and any other agency that the President may designate. The \nDirector of the National Science Foundation and the Assistant \nAdministrator for Research and Development of the Environmental \nProtection Agency shall serve as co-chairs of the Interagency Working \nGroup. The Interagency Working Group shall oversee the planning, \nmanagement, and coordination of the Program. The Interagency Working \nGroup shall--\n            (1) establish goals and priorities for the Program, to the \n        extent practicable in consultation with green chemistry \n        researchers and potential end-users of green chemistry products \n        and processes; and\n            (2) provide for interagency coordination, including budget \n        coordination, of activities under the Program.\n    (d) Report to Congress.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Interagency Working Group shall transmit a \nreport to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. \nThe report shall include--\n            (1) a summary of federally funded green chemistry research, \n        development, demonstration, education, and technology transfer \n        activities, including the green chemistry budget for each of \n        these activities; and\n            (2) an analysis of the progress made toward achieving the \n        goals and priorities for the Program, and recommendations for \n        future program activities.\n\nSEC. 4.
