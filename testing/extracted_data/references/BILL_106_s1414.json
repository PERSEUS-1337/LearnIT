FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Research has shown that medicare beneficiaries who are \n        in need of home health services that are covered under the \n        medicare program generally fall into 1 of the 4 following \n        categories:\n                    (A) Post-hospital, short-stay beneficiaries.\n                    (B) Medically stable, long-stay beneficiaries.\n                    (C) Medically complex, long-stay beneficiaries.\n                    (D) Medically unstable and complex, extremely high-\n                use beneficiaries.\n            (2) The interim payment system for home health services \n        under the medicare program, enacted as part of the Balanced \n        Budget Act of 1997 and amended by title V of the Tax and Trade \n        Relief Extension Act of 1998 (contained in Division J of Public \n        Law 105-277), is having the following unintended consequences:\n                    (A) The sickest, most frail medicare beneficiaries \n                are losing access to medically necessary home health \n                services that are otherwise covered under the medicare \n                program.\n                    (B) Many high quality, cost-effective home health \n                agencies have had per beneficiary limits under the \n                interim payment system set so low that such agencies \n                are finding it impossible to continue to provide home \n                health services under the medicare program.\n                    (C) Many home health agencies are being subjected \n                to aggregate per beneficiary limits under the interim \n                payment system that do not accurately reflect the \n                current patient mix of such agencies, thereby making it \n                impossible for such agencies to compete with similarly \n                situated home health agencies.\n                    (D) Medicare beneficiaries that reside in certain \n                States and regions of the country have far less access \n                to home health services under the medicare program than \n                individuals who have identical medical conditions but \n                reside in other States or regions of the country.\n                    (E) The health status of home health beneficiaries \n                varies significantly in different regions of the \n                country, creating differing needs for home health \n                services.\n\nSEC. 3.
