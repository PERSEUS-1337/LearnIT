FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Money laundering is a serious problem that enables \n        criminals to reap the rewards of their crimes by hiding the \n        criminal source of their profits.\n            (2) When carried out by using banks, money laundering \n        erodes the integrity of our financial institutions.\n            (3) United States financial institutions are a critical \n        link in our efforts to combat money laundering.\n            (4) In addition to organized crime enterprises, corrupt \n        government officials around the world increasingly employ \n        sophisticated money laundering schemes to conceal wealth they \n        have plundered or extorted from their nations or received as \n        bribes, and these practices weaken the legitimacy of foreign \n        states, threaten the integrity of international financial \n        markets, and harm foreign populations.\n            (5) Private banking is a growing activity among financial \n        institutions based in and operating in the United States.\n            (6) The high profitability, competition, high level of \n        secrecy, and close relationships of trust developed between \n        private bankers and their clients make private banking \n        vulnerable to money laundering.\n            (7) The use by United States bankers of financial centers \n        located outside of the United States that have weak financial \n        regulatory and reporting regimes and no transparency \n        facilitates global money laundering.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to eliminate the \nweaknesses in Federal law that allow money laundering to flourish, \nparticularly in private banking activities.\n\nSEC. 3.
