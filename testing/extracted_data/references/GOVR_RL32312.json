    "content": "On November 20, 2004, both houses agreed to the conference report on a consolidatedappropriations bill ( H.R. 4818 ), containing the FY2005 legislative branchappropriations bill, along with eight other regular annual appropriations bills on which action hadnot yet been completed. (1) H.R. 4818 was signedby the President on December 8, 2004( P.L. 108-447 , 118 Stat. 2809; 658 pages). The annual legislative branch appropriations bill contains two titles. Appropriations forlegislative branch agencies are contained in Title I. Title II contains general administrativeprovisions, and from time to time, appropriations for legislative branch entities. For example, in theFY2003 Act Title II contained funding for the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Trainingand Development and the Congressional Award Act. Congress changed the structure of the annual legislative branch appropriations bill effective in FY2003. Prior to enactment of the FY2003 bill, and effective in FY1978, the legislative branchappropriations bill was divided into two titles. Title I, Congressional Operations, contained budgetauthorities for activities directly serving Congress. Included in this title were the budgets of theHouse, the Senate, Joint Items (joint House and Senate activities), the Office of Compliance, theCongressional Budget Office (CBO), the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) (except the Library ofCongress (LOC) buildings and grounds), the Congressional Research Service (CRS) within theLibrary of Congress, and congressional printing and binding activities of the Government PrintingOffice (GPO). Title II, Related Agencies, contained budgets for activities not directly supporting Congress. Included in this title were budgets of the Botanic Garden, the Library of Congress (except theCongressional Research Service), the Library buildings and grounds maintained by the Architect ofthe Capitol, the Government Printing Office (except congressional printing and binding costs), andthe Government Accountability Office (GAO), formerly named the General Accounting Office. Periodically since FY1978, the bill contained additional titles for such purposes as capitalimprovements and special one-time functions. In addition to activities funded in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill, other legislative budget authorities include permanent budget authority for both federal funds and trustfunds, and non-legislative entities. These include the following: Permanent federal funds are available as the result of previously enacted legislation and do not require annual action. (2) Permanent trust funds are monies held in accounts credited with collections from specific sources earmarked by law for a defined purpose. Trust funds do not appear in the annual legislativebill since they are not budget authority. They are included in the U.S. Budget, prepared by the Officeof Management and Budget, either as budget receipts or offsetting collections. (3) The U.S. Budget also contains non-legislative entities within the legislative branch budget. They are funded in other appropriation bills, but are counted as legislative branch funds by the Officeof Management and Budget for bookkeeping purposes. (4) For a more accurate picture of the legislative branch budget, as contained in the annual legislative branch appropriation bill, the total FY2005 legislative branch appropriation figure in theFY2005 U.S. Budget must be adjusted. This is accomplished by subtracting non-legislative fundsand permanent federal and trust funds. The FY2005 U.S. Budget contains a legislative budgetauthority request of $4.4 billion. After subtracting non-legislative entities ($48 million), permanentfederal funds ($358 million), and permanent trust funds ($27 million), the total request for entitiesfunded in the regular annual appropriation bill is $3.97 billion.  Table 1. Legislative Branch Appropriations, FY1995 - FY2005 (budget authority in billions of current dollars) a a.

Submission of FY2005 Budget Request on February 3, 2004. A substantial part of the 12.5% increase requested is to meet (1)mandatory expenses, which includes funding for annual salary adjustments required by lawand related personnel expenses, such as increased government contributions to retirementbased on increased pay, and (2) expenses related to increases in the costs of goods andservices due to inflation. Submission of FY2005 Budget Amendments on May 6, 2004. The President submitted amendments to pending FY2005 legislativebranch budgets. These amendments were based on requests of legislative branch entities, and contain an additional $2.7 million in net discretionary resources. The amendments containfunds for the Senate ($1.7 million), (5) Joint EconomicCommittee ($4,000), Capitol GuideService and Special Services Office ($5,000), Library of Congress Copyright Office($810,000), (6) and Congressional Research Service($200,000). (7) Another amendment eliminated a proviso governing the use of some appropriations requested for the Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China. The commission is not funded in the annual legislative appropriation bill, but rather is placedin the legislative branch section of the U.S. Budget by the Office of Management and Budgetfor bookkeeping purposes.  House Hearings on FY2005 Budget Request. The first House hearing scheduled for February 25, 2004, wascancelled that morning by Representative Jack Kingston, chairman of the Subcommittee onLegislative Branch. Referring to significant increases in agency requests, RepresentativeKingston stated that  With record deficits, a war on terrorism, and troops on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq, the budget is too tight to waste our timeentertaining requests for a 40-percent spending increase. The President's budget calls for anincrease of less than one-percent in non-defense and non-homeland security discretionaryspending but these 'inside the beltway' bureaucracies want 32- to 45-percent increases. (8) The chairman subsequently requested the heads of legislative entities to resubmit revised, reduced budgets, and to explain the impact on authorized staff levels. Among legislative entities with requests containing increases of 32% or more are the Capitol Police (32.7%) and the Architect of the Capitol (45.2%). The Office of Compliancerequested a 31.6% increase.  On April 22, 2004, the House held its first hearing, considering budget requests of the House of Representatives and GAO.

Conference Report on FY2005 Bill. The FY2005 legislative branch appropriations bill was contained in the conference report on H.R. 4818 , a consolidated appropriations bill. Eight other unfinishedappropriations bills were also part of H.R. 4818. As agreed to in conference on November19, and subsequently by both houses the following day, legislative branch report languagecontained an overall increase of 1.2%, to $3.571 billion from $3.527 billion, subject to a 0.80% rescission; (16) an increase of 5.7% in budget authority for the Capitol Police, to $232.3 million (from $219.8 million), which enables the force to maintain 1,592 sworn staff;and a decrease of 12.5% ($50.3 million) in budget authority for the Architect of the Capitol, to $352.7 million from $403 million. Funding Issues. Congress approved $232.3 million in FY2005 budget authority for the Capitol Police, an overall increase of $12.5 million(+5.7%), from the previous year's budget authority of $219.8 million. The agency's requestwas a $71.9 million (+32.7) increase to $291.6 million. (17) Appropriations are contained intwo accounts:  salaries account containing $203.4 million, a $7.0 million (+3.6%) increase; and general expenses account containing $28.9 million, a $5.5 million(23.7%) increase. A second appropriation relating to the Capitol Police appears within the Architect of the Capitol account for Capitol Police buildings and grounds. That funding level is $5.9 million,a reduction from the request of $40.3 million. Note: Details of conference report language regarding the Capitol Police will be included in the next version of this report. Conferees on the FY2005 bill agreed to authorize the transfer of up to $10.6 million to the Capitol Visitors' Center (CVC) from the Capitol Building account of the Architect of theCapitol. Conferees allotted $6 million for CVC facility maintenance and $3.3 million forCVC start-up operations.  Earlier, on July 12, the House passed H.R. 4755 , its version of the FY2005 legislative branch funding bill, without funds for the CVC. On September 21, the Senatepassed H.R. 4755, amended to contain the language of S. 2666 , containing $7.6million for maintenance (including equipment, furniture, materials, and supplies), start-upoperations, and new staff. Although the budget request for the CVC did not provideconstruction money, it contained $14.2 million for start-up operations and maintenance. These funds were to cover an interim period during while a decision was made on whichlegislative office would be responsible for the center's operation and maintenance. Therequested funds supported 35 FTE positions.  The CVC request was contained in two appropriations under the Architect of the Capitol. The first provided $6.3 million in the Capitol Building appropriation \"to procure equipmentand supplies; to provide training, database management, workflow support services, andinventory systems support; and to support, operate, and maintain the structural, architectural,and utilities infrastructures.\" The second provided $8.2 million in the CVC appropriation to\"cover transitional start-up costs for the operation, administration, and management of guideservices, visitor services, food services, and gift shop services for the CVC.\" (18) The FY2005 request followed the FY2004 appropriation of $48.6 million, which reflected a new appropriation of $36.62 million and a transfer to the center's account of $12million. The transfer was made from previously appropriated funds available for CapitolPolice buildings and grounds, also funded within the AOC account. Interest in construction of the CVC reflects heightened security concerns by some Members of Congress and the desire to make necessary appropriations available so thatconstruction of the center can be completed by the end of 2005. Upon completion offurnishing the CVC and setting up exhibits, the construction barriers will be removed inspring 2006. (19) Congressional leadership brokeground for the center on June 20, 2000, andconstruction began in early 2002. Funding Issues. FY2005 funding for the Architect of the Capitol is $352.7 million, a decrease of $50.3 million (-12.5%) from theFY2004 level of $403.0 million. The AOC requested a 45.2% increase, to $584.9 million. Neither the FY2004 appropriation or the FY2005 request reflected one-time appropriationsfor the CVC.  Operations of the Architect are funded in nine accounts. The FY2005 budget authority for these accounts and the percentage changes from FY2004 are: general administration -- $80.4 million (+4.9% from $76.6 million); request was a 16.5% increase; Capitol building -- $28.9 million (+3.0% from $28.0 million); requestwas a 15.1% increase; Capitol grounds -- $7.0 million (+1.9% from $6.9 million); request was an 18.0% increase; Senate office buildings -- $62.1 million (-1.5% from $63.0 million); request was a 3.6% increase; House office buildings -- $65.4 million (+4.7% from $62.5 million); request was a 69.2% increase; Capitol power plant -- $56.8 million (-29.9% from $81.1 million); request was a 21.8% decrease;  Library buildings and grounds -- $40.1 million (+3.0% from $38.9 million); request was a 312.8% increase; Capitol Police buildings and grounds -- $ 5.9 million (+78.0% from $3.3 million; request was a 1,125.1% increase; and Botanic garden -- $6.3 million (+2.8% from $6.2 million); request was an 88.3% increase.  Overall Funding. FY2005 budget authority for House internal operations is $1.05 billion, an increase of $40.1 million (+4.0%), less thanthe requested $1.07 billion, which would have provided a 5.7% increase. The approvedincrease primarily funds mandatory expenses.  House Committee Funding. Funding for House committees is contained in the appropriation heading \"committee employees\" thatcomprises two subheadings. The first subheading contains funds for personnel andnonpersonnel expenses of House committees, except the Appropriations Committee, asauthorized by the House in a committee expense resolution. The amount approved forFY2005 is $114.3 million, an increase of 11.8% from $102.2 million in FY2004.  The second subheading contains funds for the personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of the Committee on Appropriations, which is $24.9 million, the same level appropriated forFY2004.  Overall Funding. Congress agreed to $726.1 million for internal Senate programs and activities, a 1.9% increase over the prioryear's funding level of $712.5 million. The Senate requested $758.0 million, an increase of6.4%. Like the House, a significant factor in the request was funding for mandatory expensesrelated to employee insurance and retirement programs.  Among increases are those for  official personnel and office expenses of individual Senators, an increase of 5.3% instead of the requested 10.0% increase; and salaries of officers and their employees and mandatory Senatecontributions to insurance and retirement programs for most Senate employees, an increaseof 5.1%, the same as requested.  Among decreases in the bill are those for  activities of the Senate Sergeant at Arms funded under \"contingent expenses of the Senate,\" a decrease of 6.0%, instead of the requested 0.6% increase;and committee funding, a decrease of 7.1%, instead of the requested 1.7%increase. Senate Committee Funding. Appropriations for Senate committees are contained in two accounts: the inquiries and investigations account , containing funds for all Senate committees except Appropriations, for which $110.0 million was approved, a 7.1% decreasein lieu of a requested 1.7% increase; and the Committee on Appropriations account , for which$13.3 million was approved, an increase of 3.9%, the same as requested.  Congressional Budget Office. Conferees agreed to $34.9 million, which is $129,000 more than the $34.8 million passed by both theHouse and Senate. The additional amount funds increased agency costs of the employeeretirement system. The conference amount is an increase of $1.3 million (+3.9%) over theprevious year's budget, with the increase covering mandatory pay adjustments and priceincreases. The agency requested $35.5 million, an increase of $1.8 million (5.5%). (20) Most of therequest ($1.6 million) funded mandatory increases in salaries and related benefits. Thisproposed funding supported 235 FTE positions, the same as for FY2004; a 3.5%across-the-board pay adjustment for staff earning $100,000 or less; and funding forpromotions and merit adjustments for all staff, including those earning more than $100,000;completion of the replacement of CBO's budget analysis data system, \"the agency's primarybudget-tracking system, with a lower-cost, more-capable in-house system;\" (21) andtelecommunications services related to an alternative computing facility. (22) Government Accountability Office. The agency, formerly named the General Accounting Office (GAO), received $471 million inFY2005 funding, an increase of $13.4 million (+2.9%). Earlier, the House approved $473.5million, and the Senate, $470 million. As with other legislative agencies, the increaseprimarily was to meet increased expenses of mandatory pay and services adjustments.  Conferees also  withdrew the House provision that the Government Accountability Office report on statutory responsibilities of the Congressional Budget Office, theCongressional Research Service, the Joint Economic Committee, and the Joint Committee onTaxation; supported language in the Senate report directing GAO to secure congressional leadership support before undertaking future technology assessments anddirecting the Comptroller General to consult with the Senate Appropriations Committeeregarding guidelines to be used in technology assessments; and, supported Senate report language directing GAO to obtain the necessary equipment for testing and evaluation of the agency's ability to detect threats of chemical,biological, and explosive agents.  The FY2005 request of $486.7 million reflected a direct appropriation of $480.5 millionand authority to use $6.1 million in revenues from \"reimbursable audit work and rentalincome.\" (23) The new budget authority request wasa 5.0% increase over FY2004.  Based on a congressional directive to the agency to undertake technology assessments, GAO requested $545,000 for four new FTE positions and contract support to establish \"abaseline technology assessment capability,\" allowing GAO to conduct one assessment peryear.  During Senate Appropriations Committee testimony, the comptroller general (GAO head) noted that his FY2005 budget supported an authorized staff level of 3,269 FTEs. Library of Congress. Conferees agreed to $549.8 million for the Library of Congress (LOC), including the Congressional ResearchService, an increase of $26.8 million (+5.1). The House and Senate previously agreed to$543.5 million and $544.1 million, respectively. Conferees also authorized two FTE positionsin the Office of Inspector General to assist in information technology security audits, andreduced the number of FTEs by three.  LOC requested an appropriation of $562.6 million, an increase of $39.6 million (7.6%) from the FY2004 appropriation of $523.0 million. (24) In addition, the Librarian of Congressrequested authority to use $39.7 million from receipts.  According to the Librarian, the request reflected the Library's priorities to initiate operations of the National Audio Visual Conservation Center; to support the CopyrightOffice's reengineering efforts; to \"regain full funding for the Congressional Research Servicestaff capacity at 729 full-time-equivalent (FTE) positions;\" to support conversion to digitaltalking book technology for the blind and physically handicapped; to fund a massdeacidification program; to support the Veterans History Program; to insure additionalsystems, staff, buildings, and collections security; and to provide infrastructure support. (25) LOC's request supported 4,363 FTE positions (including CRS), an increase of 80 from FY2004, primarily to meet collections, security, and management needs.  Congressional Research Service. Both houses agreed to $96.9 million for the Congressional Research Service, an increase of $5.7million (+6.3%), covering mandatory pay and retirement costs and increased expenses of goods and services.
