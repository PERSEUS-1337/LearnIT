Therefore, the Congress encourages the Federal National \nMortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to \nsecuritize mortgages acquired under the increased conforming loan \nlimits established by the amendments made by this section, to the \nextent that such securitizations can be effected in a timely and \nefficient manner that does not impose additional costs for mortgages \noriginated, purchased, or securitized under the existing limits or \ninterfere with the goal of adding liquidity to the market.\n\nSEC. 3.
