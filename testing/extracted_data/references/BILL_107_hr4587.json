FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The efficient and orderly development of the State of \n        Alaska will be better achieved if the Federal Government joins \n        the State of Alaska in a carefully coordinated approach to \n        identify ownership and jurisdictional interests in land and \n        waters.\n            (2) Alaska has abundant water resources that are invaluable \n        to State residents and all citizens of the United States.\n            (3) Because of the massive number of navigable waterways \n        and other bodies of water in the State of Alaska, the task of \n        resolving submerged land ownership and navigable water \n        determinations has been very slow, counter-productive from an \n        orderly resource management standpoint, and costly as the \n        State, private landowners, and the Federal Government attempt \n        to initiate long-range planning processes.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) Expedite the process of quieting legitimate title to \n        the submerged lands in the State of Alaska.\n            (2) Facilitate determinations for purposes of the Submerged \n        Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.), to the extent possible, \n        which bodies of water in Alaska are navigable waters and which \n        such bodies of water are not navigable waters.\n            (3) Recommend to the State of Alaska and the Federal \n        Government--\n                    (A) ways to improve the process of making water use \n                and navigability decisions; and\n                    (B) ways to fairly and expeditiously quiet title to \n                the State's submerged lands.\n\nSEC. 3.
