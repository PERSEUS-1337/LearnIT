SALT CEDAR CONTROL.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) States are having increasing difficulty meeting their \n        obligations under interstate compacts to deliver water;\n            (2) it is in the best interest of States to minimize the \n        impact of and eradicate invasive species that extort water in \n        the Rio Grande watershed, the Pecos River, and other bodies of \n        water in the Southwest, such as the salt cedar, a noxious and \n        nonnative plant that can use 200 gallons of water a day; and\n            (3) as drought conditions and legal requirements relating \n        to water supply accelerate water shortages, innovative \n        approaches are needed to address the increasing demand for a \n        diminishing water supply.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Control method.--\n                    (A) In general.--The term ``control method'' means \n                a method of controlling salt cedar (Tamarix) or any \n                other nonnative phreatophyte.\n                    (B) Inclusions.--The term ``control method'' \n                includes the use of herbicides, mechanical means, and \n                biocontrols such as goats and insects.\n            (2) Demonstration project.--The term ``demonstration \n        project'' means a demonstration project carried out under this \n        section.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers.\n    (c) Program.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date on \n        which funds are made available to carry out this section, the \n        Secretary shall--\n                    (A) complete a program of research, including a \n                review of past and ongoing research, concerning a \n                control method for use in--\n                            (i) the Rio Grande watershed in the State \n                        of New Mexico;\n                            (ii) the Pecos River in the State of New \n                        Mexico;
