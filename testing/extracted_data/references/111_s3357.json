    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Birth Control Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Family planning is basic health care for women. Access \n        to contraception helps women prevent unintended pregnancy and \n        control the timing and spacing of planned births.\n            (2) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        included family planning in its published list of the Ten Great \n        Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century, the United \n        States still has one of the highest rates of unintended \n        pregnancies among industrialized nations.\n            (3) Each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, nearly half of all \n        pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and nearly \n        half of unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n            (4) Women rely on prescription contraceptives for a range \n        of medical purposes in addition to birth control, such as \n        regulation of cycles and endometriosis.\n            (5) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency \n        contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended \n        pregnancy and has approved over-the-counter access to emergency \n        contraception for individuals aged 17 and older.\n            (6) If taken soon after unprotected sex or primary \n        contraceptive failure, emergency contraception can \n        significantly reduce a woman's chance of unintended pregnancy.\n            (7) Emergency contraception works like other hormonal birth \n        control by preventing pregnancy. It also does not harm or \n        terminate an already-established pregnancy.\n            (8) Access to legal contraception is a protected \n        fundamental right in the United States and should not be \n        impeded by one individual's personal beliefs.\n            (9) Reports of pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions \n        for contraceptives, including emergency contraceptives, have \n        surfaced in States across the Nation, including Alabama, \n        Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Georgia, \n        Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, \n        Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, \n        Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, \n        Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Since emergency \n        contraception became available without a prescription for \n        certain individuals, refusals to provide non-prescription \n        emergency contraception have also been reported.\n\nSEC. 3. DUTIES OF PHARMACIES TO ENSURE PROVISION OF FDA-APPROVED \n              CONTRACEPTION.\n\n    Part B of title II of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 238 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 249.
