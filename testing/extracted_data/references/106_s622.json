    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Hate Crimes Prevention Act of \n1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n        perceived race, color, national origin, religion, sexual \n        orientation, gender, or disability of the victim poses a \n        serious national problem;\n            (2) such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n        communities and is deeply divisive;\n            (3) existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n        problem;\n            (4) such violence affects interstate commerce in many ways, \n        including--\n                    (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted \n                groups and forcing such members to move across State \n                lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence; \n                and\n                    (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n                purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n                employment or participating in other commercial \n                activity;\n            (5) perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence;\n            (6) instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used to \n        facilitate the commission of such violence;\n            (7) such violence is committed using articles that have \n        traveled in interstate commerce;\n            (8) violence motivated by bias that is a relic of slavery \n        can constitute badges and incidents of slavery;\n            (9) although many State and local authorities are now and \n        will continue to be responsible for prosecuting the \n        overwhelming majority of violent crimes in the United States, \n        including violent crimes motivated by bias, Federal \n        jurisdiction over certain violent crimes motivated by bias is \n        necessary to supplement State and local jurisdiction and ensure \n        that justice is achieved in each case;\n            (10) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n        motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local authorities \n        to work together as partners in the investigation and \n        prosecution of such crimes; and\n            (11) the problem of hate crime is sufficiently serious, \n        widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal \n        assistance to States and local jurisdictions.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning as in \nsection 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \nof 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\nSEC. 4.
