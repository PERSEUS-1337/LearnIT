    "content": "SECTION 1. COMMISSION.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Protect our Kids Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) deaths from child abuse and neglect are preventable;\n            (2) deaths from child abuse and neglect are significantly \n        underreported and there is no national standard for reporting \n        such deaths;\n            (3) according to the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data \n        System, in fiscal year 2009 approximately 1,770 children in the \n        United States are reported to have died from child abuse and \n        neglect, and many experts believe that the actual number may be \n        significantly more;\n            (4) nearly half of the number of children in the United \n        States who die from abuse are under the age of 1, and more than \n        80 percent are under the age of 4;\n            (5) in 2009, of deaths from child abuse and neglect--\n                    (A) nearly 36 percent were caused by neglect;\n                    (B) 23 percent were caused by physical abuse; and\n                    (C) more than 36 percent were caused by multiple \n                forms of maltreatment;\n            (6) each year approximately 6,000,000 children in the \n        United States are referred to child protective services because \n        of allegations of child abuse and neglect; and\n            (7) increased understanding of deaths from child abuse and \n        neglect can lead to improvement in agency systems and practices \n        to protect children and prevent child abuse and neglect.\n\nSEC. 3.
