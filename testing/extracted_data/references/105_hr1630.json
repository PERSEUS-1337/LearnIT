FERRIES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Today's ferries are a critical transportation component \n        in many communities, providing vital transportation services \n        for passengers, automobiles, buses, and trucks in locations \n        where practical alternatives are insufficient or do not exist.\n            (2) Ferries provide alternatives to other transport modes \n        that are facing severe capacity constraints.\n            (3) Ferries do not require the construction of costly \n        infrastructure such as roads, bridges, or tunnels, thereby \n        reducing environmental impacts, capital investment, and the \n        time required to begin operation.\n            (4) Ferries reduce single-occupancy vehicle traffic, \n        thereby reducing traffic congestion, air pollution, and energy \n        use.\n            (5) Ferries are flexible because vessels and some loading \n        facilities may be shifted to new locations to respond to \n        changes in demand or in times of national emergency.\n            (6) Joint efforts by private operators and local \n        governments already have resulted in highly innovative and \n        successful ferry operations in many urban areas.\n            (7) The Department of Transportation strategic plan for the \n        National Transportation System urges emphasis on those modes of \n        transportation that promote those interests ``of critical \n        importance to our country, including clean air, reducing energy \n        consumption and safe, comfortable, and cost effective \n        transportation'' goals that ferry transportation embodies.\n            (8) Ferry transportation is an important and unique \n        component of the national transportation system which should be \n        encouraged and supported in those communities for which it is \n        applicable.\n    (b) Study.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \n        conduct a study of ferry transportation in the United States \n        and its possessions--\n                    (A) to identify existing ferry operations, \n                including--\n                            (i) the locations and routes served;\n                            (ii) the name, the United States official \n                        number, and a description of each vessel \n                        operated as a ferry;\n                            (iii) the source and amount, if any, of \n                        funds derived from Federal, State, or local \n                        government sources supporting ferry operations; \n                        and\n                            (iv) the impact of ferry transportation on \n                        local and regional economies; and\n                    (B) to identify potential domestic ferry routes in \n                the United States and its possessions and to develop \n                information on those routes, including--\n                            (i) locations and routes that might be \n                        served;\n                            (ii) estimates of capacity required;\n                            (iii) estimates of capital costs of \n                        developing those routes;\n                            (iv) estimates of annual operating costs \n                        for these routes;\n                            (v) estimates of the economic impact of \n                        these routes on local and regional economies; \n                        and\n                            (vi) the potential for use of high speed \n                        ferry services.\n            (2) Report.--The Secretary shall submit a report on the \n        results of the study required under subsection (a) to the \n        Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of \n        Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation of the Senate.\n    (c) Meeting With State Metropolitan Planning Organizations.--After \nsubmitting the report required by subsection (b), the Secretary of \nTransportation shall--\n            (1) meet with the chief metropolitan planning organization \n        officer of each metropolitan area in which a ferry service is \n        operated or for which a potential ferry route is identified in \n        the report; and\n            (2) in that meeting discuss the results of the study under \n        subsection (a) and availability of resources, both Federal and \n        State, for providing ferry services.\n    (d) Funding.--Section 1064(c) of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (23 U.S.C. 129 note) is amended \nto read as follows:\n    ``(c) Authorization.--There shall be available, out of the Highway \nTrust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account), to the Secretary for \nobligation at the discretion of the Secretary, $18,000,000 for each of \nthe fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 in carrying out this \nsection.
