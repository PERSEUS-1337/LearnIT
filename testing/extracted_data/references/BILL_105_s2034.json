FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The incidence of Lyme disease in the United States is \n        increasing more rapidly than most other diseases. The Centers \n        for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that, since \n        1982, there has been a 32-fold increase in reported cases.\n            (2) For 1996, such Centers determined that 16,455 cases of \n        the disease were reported.\n            (3) There is no reliable standardized diagnostic test for \n        Lyme disease, and it is therefore likely that the disease is \n        severely underreported. The disease is often misdiagnosed \n        because the symptoms of the disease mimic other health \n        conditions.\n            (4) Lyme disease costs our Nation at least $60,000,000 a \n        year in direct medical costs for early, acute cases. The costs \n        of chronic cases of the disease, as well as the costs of lost \n        wages and productivity, are many times higher.\n            (5) Many health care providers lack the necessary knowledge \n        and expertise--particularly in non-endemic areas--to accurately \n        diagnose Lyme disease. As a result, patients often visit \n        multiple doctors before obtaining a diagnosis of the disease, \n        resulting in prolonged pain and suffering, unnecessary tests, \n        and costly and futile treatments.\n\nSEC. 3. PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS; FIVE-YEAR PLAN.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (acting \nas appropriate through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention and the Director of the National Institutes of Health) \nand the Secretary of Defense shall collaborate to carry out the \nfollowing:\n            (1) The Secretaries shall establish the goals described in \n        subsections (c) through (f) (relating to activities to provide \n        for a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of Lyme \n        disease).\n            (2) The Secretaries shall carry out activities toward \n        achieving the goals, which may include activities carried out \n        directly by the Secretaries and activities carried out through \n        awards of grants or contracts to public or nonprofit private \n        entities.\n            (3) In carrying out paragraph (2), the Secretaries shall \n        give priority--\n                    (A) first, to achieving the goal under subsection \n                (c);\n                    (B) second, to achieving the goal under subsection \n                (d);\n                    (C) third, to achieving the goal under subsection \n                (e); and\n                    (D) fourth, to achieving the goal under subsection \n                (f).\n    (b) Five-Year Plan.--In carrying out subsection (a), the \nSecretaries shall establish a plan that, for the 5 fiscal years \nfollowing the date of the enactment of this Act, provides for the \nactivities to be carried out during such fiscal years toward achieving \nthe goals under subsections (c) through section (f). The plan shall, as \nappropriate to such goals, provide for the coordination of programs and \nactivities regarding Lyme disease that are conducted or supported by \nthe Federal Government.\n    (c) First Goal: Detection Test.--\n            (1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (a), the goal \n        described in this subsection is the development, by the \n        expiration of the 18-year period beginning on the date of the \n        enactment of this Act, of--\n                    (A) a test for accurately determining whether an \n                individual who has been bitten by a tick has Lyme \n                disease; and\n                    (B) a test for accurately determining whether a \n                patient with such disease has been cured of the \n                disease.\n    (d) Second Goal: Improved Surveillance and Reporting System.--For \npurposes of subsection (a), the goal described in this subsection is to \nreview the system in the United States for surveillance and reporting \nwith respect to Lyme disease and to determine whether and in what \nmanner the system can be improved (relative to the date of the \nenactment of this Act). In carrying out activities toward such goal, \nthe Secretaries shall--\n            (1) consult with the States, units of local government, \n        physicians, patients with Lyme disease, and organizations \n        representing such patients;\n            (2) consider whether uniform formats should be developed \n        for the reporting by physicians of cases of Lyme disease to \n        public health officials; and\n            (3) with respect to health conditions that are reported by \n        physicians as cases of Lyme disease but do not meet the \n        criteria established by the Director of the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention to be counted as such cases, consider \n        whether data on such health conditions should be maintained and \n        analyzed to assist in understanding the circumstances in which \n        Lyme disease is being diagnosed and the manner in which it is \n        being treated.\n    (e) Third Goal: Indicator Regarding Accurate Diagnosis.--For \npurposes of subsection (a), the goal described in this subsection is to \ndetermine the average number of visits to physicians that are made by \npatients with Lyme disease before a diagnosis of such disease is made. \nIn carrying out activities toward such goal, the Secretaries shall \nconduct a study of patients and physicians in 2 or more geographic \nareas in which there is a significant incidence or prevalence of cases \nof Lyme disease.\n    (f) Fourth Goal: Physician Knowledge.--For purposes of subsection \n(a), the goals described in this subsection are to make a significant \nincrease in the number of physicians who have an appropriate level of \nknowledge regarding Lyme disease, and to develop and apply an objective \nmethod of determining the number of physicians who have such knowledge.\n\nSEC. 4.
