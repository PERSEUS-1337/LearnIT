FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The demand for child pornography harms children because it \n    drives production, which involves severe child sexual abuse and \n    exploitation.\n        (2) The harms caused by child pornography begin, but do not \n    end, with child sex assault because child pornography is a \n    permanent record of that abuse and trafficking in those images \n    compounds the harm to the child.\n        (3) In Paroline v. United States (2014), the Supreme Court \n    recognized that ``every viewing of child pornography is a \n    repetition of the victim's abuse''.\n        (4) The American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children \n    has stated that for victims of child pornography, ``the sexual \n    abuse of the child, the memorialization of that abuse which becomes \n    child pornography, and its subsequent distribution and viewing \n    become psychologically intertwined and each compound the harm \n    suffered by the child-victim''.\n        (5) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result of \n    knowing that a large, indeterminate number of individuals have \n    viewed and will in the future view images of their childhood sexual \n    abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason that child pornography \n    is outlawed.\n        (6) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who \n    reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a victim's \n    childhood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining and aggravating \n    the harms to that individual victim.\n        (7) It is the intent of Congress that victims of child \n    pornography be compensated for the harms resulting from every \n    perpetrator who contributes to their anguish. Such an aggregate \n    causation standard reflects the nature of child pornography and the \n    unique ways that it actually harms victims.\nSEC. 3. DETERMINING RESTITUTION.\n    (a) Determining Restitution.--Section 2259(b) of title 18, United \nStates Code, is amended--\n        (1) in paragraph (1)--\n            (A) by striking ``The order'' and inserting ``Except as \n        provided in paragraph (2), the order''; and\n            (B) by striking ``as determined by the court pursuant to \n        paragraph (2)'' after ``of the victim's losses'';\n        (2) by striking paragraph (3);\n        (3) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and\n        (4) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:\n        ``(2) Restitution for trafficking in child pornography.--If the \n    defendant was convicted of trafficking in child pornography, the \n    court shall order restitution under this section in an amount to be \n    determined by the court as follows:\n            ``(A) Determining the full amount of a victim's losses.--\n        The court shall determine the full amount of the victim's \n        losses that were incurred or are reasonably projected to be \n        incurred by the victim as a result of the trafficking in child \n        pornography depicting the victim.\n            ``(B) Determining a restitution amount.--After completing \n        the determination required under subparagraph (A), the court \n        shall order restitution in an amount that reflects the \n        defendant's relative role in the causal process that underlies \n        the victim's losses, but which is no less than $3,000.\n            ``(C) Termination of payment.--A victim's total aggregate \n        recovery pursuant to this section shall not exceed the full \n        amount of the victim's demonstrated losses. After the victim \n        has received restitution in the full amount of the victim's \n        losses as measured by the greatest amount of such losses found \n        in any case involving that victim that has resulted in a final \n        restitution order under this section, the liability of each \n        defendant who is or has been ordered to pay restitution for \n        such losses to that victim shall be terminated. The court may \n        require the victim to provide information concerning the amount \n        of restitution the victim has been paid in other cases for the \n        same losses.''.\n    (b) Additional Definitions.--Section 2259(c) of title 18, United \nStates Code, is amended--\n        (1) in the heading, by striking ``Definition'' and inserting \n    ``Definitions'';\n        (2) by striking ``For purposes'' and inserting the following:\n        ``(4) Victim.--For purposes'';\n        (3) by striking ``under this chapter, including, in the case'' \n    and inserting ``under this chapter.
