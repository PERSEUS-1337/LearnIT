A motion to \n        postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other \n        business, or a motion to recommit the bill is not in order. A \n        motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill is agreed to or \n        disagreed to is not in order.\n            (3) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n        conclusion of the debate on the bill and a single quorum call \n        at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with \n        the rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final passage \n        of the bill shall occur.\n            (4) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the Chair \n        relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the \n        House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure \n        relating to the bill shall be decided without debate.\n    (d) Consideration by Other House.--\n            (1) Before passage.--If, before the passage by one House of \n        a bill of that House described in subsection (b), that House \n        receives from the other House a bill described in subsection \n        (b), then the following procedures shall apply--\n                    (A) the bill of the other House shall not be \n                referred to a committee and may not be considered in \n                the House receiving it except in the case of final \n                passage as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii); and\n                    (B) with respect to a bill described in subsection \n                (b) of the House receiving the bill (i) the procedure \n                in that House shall be the same as if no bill had been \n                received from the other House; but (ii) the vote on \n                final passage shall be on the bill of the other House.\n            (2) After passage.--Upon disposition of the bill received \n        from the other House, it shall no longer be in order to \n        consider the bill that originated in the receiving House.\n    (e) Rules of the Senate and House.--This section is enacted by \nCongress--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in \n        that House in the case of a bill described in subsection (b), \n        and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is \n        inconsistent with such rules; and\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n        House.\n    (f) Calendar Day Defined.--In this section, the term ``calendar \nday'' means a calendar day other than one on which either House is not \nin session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a date \ncertain.\n\nSEC. 7.
