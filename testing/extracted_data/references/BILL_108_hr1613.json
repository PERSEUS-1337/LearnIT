SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``College Fire \nPrevention Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On Wednesday, January 19, 2000, a fire occurred at a \n        Seton Hall University dormitory. Three male freshmen, all 18 \n        years of age, died. Fifty-four students, 2 South Orange \n        firefighters, and 2 South Orange police officers were injured. \n        The dormitory was a 6-story, 350-room structure built in 1952, \n        that housed approximately 600 students. It was equipped with \n        smoke alarms but no fire sprinkler system.\n            (2) On Mother's Day 1996 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, a \n        fire in the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity House killed 5 college \n        juniors and injured 3. The 3-story plus basement fraternity \n        house was 70 years old. The National Fire Protection \n        Association identified several factors that contributed to the \n        tragic fire, including the lack of fire sprinkler protection.\n            (3) It is estimated that between 1980 and 1998, an average \n        of 1,800 fires at dormitories, fraternities, and sororities, \n        involving 1 death, 70 injuries, and $8,000,000 in property \n        damage were reported to public fire departments.\n            (4) Within dormitories, fraternities, and sororities the \n        leading cause of fires is arson or suspected arson. The second \n        leading cause of college building fires is cooking. The third \n        leading cause is smoking.\n            (5) New dormitories are generally required to have advanced \n        safety systems such as fire sprinklers. But such requirements \n        are rarely imposed retroactively on existing buildings.\n            (6) In 1998, 93 percent of the campus building fires \n        reported to fire departments occurred in buildings where there \n        were smoke alarms present. However, only 34 percent had fire \n        sprinklers present.\n\nSEC. 2.
