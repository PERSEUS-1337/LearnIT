CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) the overall cost of Federal regulation in the United \n        States has risen to well over $400,000,000,000 per year;\n            (2) this regulatory burden is paid by individual citizens \n        and their families in the form of a ``hidden tax'' because \n        intermediaries have no options that do not pass these \n        expenditures to individuals;\n            (3) the most recent data reveals that the ``hidden tax'' \n        paid by the citizens of this Nation now exceeds $4,100 annually \n        for each household;\n            (4) left unchecked, this ``hidden tax'' will increase by 50 \n        percent between now and the year 2000; and\n            (5) it is in the best interests of the American people to \n        have the Federal Government devise a systematic way to account \n        for the new regulatory costs that taxpayers are forced to \n        absorb and to have this financial burden better controlled.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish that each \nagency shall, as a mandatory requirement for the issuance of--\n            (1) any proposed regulation--\n                    (A) thoroughly assess and document the anticipated \n                benefits, reasonable alternative approaches, and all \n                foreseeable compliance costs of each approach; and\n                    (B) assess, and include in all proposed regulatory \n                actions, a range of possible offsets for the costs; and\n            (2) any final regulation--\n                    (A) have selected the most cost-effective \n                alternative; and\n                    (B) for a period of 3 years following enactment, \n                have fully offset all foreseeable costs through \n                revocation or revision of one or more existing \n                regulations.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) the term ``agency'' has the same meaning given such \n        term in section 3502(1) of title 44, United States Code, \n        excluding those agencies specified in section 3502(10) of title \n        44, United States Code; and\n            (2) the term ``regulation'' or ``rule'' means any agency \n        statement of general applicability and future effect designed \n        to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or \n        describing the procedure or practice requirements of an agency, \n        but does not include--\n                    (A) administrative actions governed by the \n                provisions of sections 556 and 557 of title 5, United \n                States Code;\n                    (B) regulations issued with respect to a military \n                or foreign affairs function of the United States; or\n                    (C) regulations related to agency organization, \n                management, or personnel.\n\nSEC. 4.
