    "content": "Recent tragic events in Tucson, AZ, have raised questions about the extent to which federal law outlaws crimes of violence committed against federal officials or federal employees. More than a few outlaw such conduct. Murder or assault committed anywhere in the United States is outlawed in the law of the state in which it occurs. Notwithstanding any state prosecution, however, a number of federal laws outlaw crimes of violence committed under various federal jurisdictional circumstances, including but not limited to the fact that crime is committed against a Member of Congress, a federal judge, the President, or a federal employee.
