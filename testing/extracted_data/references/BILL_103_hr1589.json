FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether oxygenated fuels \n        (referred to in this Act as ``M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels'') as \n        one means of compliance with section 211(m) of the Clean Air \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(m)), which requires the use of oxygenated \n        fuels to lower the level of carbon monoxide in nonattainment \n        areas, has resulted in excessive health-related complaints in \n        areas of the State of Alaska in which M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels \n        have been used;\n            (2) consumer hotlines in Fairbanks, Alaska and Anchorage, \n        Alaska have received hundreds of unusual medical complaints \n        (including complaints of abnormal headaches, sore throats, \n        asthma, light headedness, burning sensation in eyes and lungs, \n        shortness of breath, skin rashes, numbness, swollen tissue, and \n        abnormal congestion) in geographic areas in which M-T-B-E \n        oxygenated fuels are in use;\n            (3) tests conducted by employees at the environmental \n        health laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control revealed a \n        measurable quantity of methyl tertiary butyl ether in the blood \n        of workers exposed to M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels;\n            (4) representatives of the Centers for Disease Control \n        testified before Congress that more studies were needed to \n        determine the health effects of exposure to the substance;\n            (5) no studies have been completed to measure the chronic \n        effects of exposure to M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels in cold \n        climates on public health, particularly in areas that have \n        temperatures that regularly reach 50 degrees below zero \n        Fahrenheit;\n            (6) because of numerous health complaints and the \n        conclusions of the State epidemiologist of the Alaska Division \n        of Public Health, the Governor of Alaska suspended the M-T-B-E \n        oxygenated fuels program in Fairbanks, Alaska;\n            (7) after the program was suspended in Fairbanks, the State \n        epidemiologist concluded that there is a possibility that \n        similar illnesses are being caused by the M-T-B-E oxygenated \n        fuels program in Anchorage;\n            (8) additional scientific studies on the health effects of \n        M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels need to be completed;\n            (9) the public should not be exposed to M-T-B-E oxygenated \n        fuels until studies are completed and the public health risk \n        has been assessed; and\n            (10) ethanol blend oxygenated fuels are known to separate \n        from the gasoline base at ultacold temperatures and may \n        therefore have drivability and safety implications in Alaska.\n\nSEC. 2. WAIVER OF THE M-T-B-E OXYGENATED FUELS REQUIREMENT\n\n    Section 211(m)(3) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(m)(3)) is \namended by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:\n            ``(D) If requested in writing by an affected local \n        government within a title I nonattainment area for carbon \n        monoxide in Alaska, the Governor of the State of Alaska may \n        petition for a waiver and the Administrator may waive, in whole \n        or in part, the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) with \n        respect to an area within the State of Alaska that is \n        designated under title I as a nonattainment area for carbon \n        monoxide, if the Administrator finds that compliance with the \n        requirements should be waived for one or more of the following \n        reasons:\n                    ``(i) Compliance is not technologically or \n                economically feasible because the technology needed to \n                comply is not commercially available or because the use \n                of M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels would increase the cost of \n                commercially available fuel supplies by more than 150 \n                percent of the national average cost of using M-T-B-E \n                oxygenated fuels in nonattainment areas outside of \n                Alaska;\n                    ``(ii) Compliance would be unreasonable due to \n                unique geographical or meteorological factors;\n                    ``(ii) Compliance could or does cause harmful \n                health effects;\n                    ``(iv) The use of M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels \n                increases aldehyde emissions appreciably.\n            ``(E) The Administrator shall grant or deny a petition for \n        a waiver submitted under subparagraph (D) not later than 60 \n        days after receiving the petition.\n            ``(F)(i) The Administrator shall conduct a study that \n        compares the probable health risks and costs of title I carbon \n        monoxide nonattainment in Alaska with the probable health risks \n        and costs of increased noncarbon monoxide emissions (such as \n        aldehyde emissions) associated with the use of M-T-B-E \n        oxygenated fuels in Alaska.\n            ``(ii) The Administrator shall report the results of the \n        study of Congress not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of this paragraph.\n            ``(G) The Administrator may suspend the required use of \n        oxygenated fuels--\n                    ``(i) during the pendency of a petition for a \n                waiver submitted under paragraph (D); and\n                    ``(ii) until the completion of the health risk \n                study conducted pursuant to subparagraph (F).''."
