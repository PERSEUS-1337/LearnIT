A motion further \n                to limit debate is in order and not debatable. An \n                amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to \n                proceed to the consideration of other business, or a \n                motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in \n                order.\n                    (E) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall \n                occur immediately following the conclusion of the \n                debate on a joint resolution, and a single quorum call \n                at the conclusion of the debate if requested in \n                accordance with the rules of the Senate.\n                    (F) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals \n                from the decisions of the Chair relating to the \n                application of the rules of the Senate, as the case may \n                be, to the procedure relating to a joint resolution \n                shall be decided without debate.\n            (5) Rules relating to senate and house of \n        representatives.--\n                    (A) Coordination with action by other house.--If, \n                before the passage by one House of a joint resolution \n                of that House, that House receives from the other House \n                a joint resolution, then the following procedures shall \n                apply:\n                            (i) The joint resolution of the other House \n                        shall not be referred to a committee.\n                            (ii) With respect to a joint resolution of \n                        the House receiving the resolution--\n                                    (I) the procedure in that House \n                                shall be the same as if no joint \n                                resolution had been received from the \n                                other House; but\n                                    (II) the vote on passage shall be \n                                on the joint resolution of the other \n                                House.\n                    (B) Treatment of joint resolution of other house.--\n                If one House fails to introduce or consider a joint \n                resolution under this subsection, the joint resolution \n                of the other House shall be entitled to expedited floor \n                procedures under this subsection.\n                    (C) Treatment of companion measures.--If, following \n                passage of the joint resolution in the Senate, the \n                Senate then receives the companion measure from the \n                House of Representatives, the companion measure shall \n                not be debatable.\n                    (D) Veto debate and duration.--If the President \n                vetoes the joint resolution, debate on a veto message \n                in the Senate under this subsection shall be 1 hour \n                equally divided between the majority and minority \n                leaders or their designees.\n            (6) Rules of house of representatives and senate.--This \n        paragraph and paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) are enacted by \n        Congress--\n                    (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the \n                Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, and \n                as such it is deemed a part of the rules of each House, \n                respectively, but applicable only with respect to the \n                procedure to be followed in that House in the case of a \n                joint resolution, and it supersedes other rules only to \n                the extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional \n                right of either House to change the rules (so far as \n                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, \n                in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the \n                case of any other rule of that House."
