FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More than 80 percent of Americans over the age of 65 \n        are grandparents and more than 2,500,000 grandparents in the \n        United States are the primary caretaker of their grandchildren. \n        Experts report that such numbers are increasing as the opioid \n        epidemic expands.\n            (2) Grandparents' lives are enhanced by caring for their \n        grandchildren; the overwhelming majority of grandparents report \n        experiencing significant benefits in serving as their \n        grandchildren's primary caregivers.\n            (3) Providing full-time care to their grandchildren may \n        increase grandparents' likelihood of experiencing physical \n        illness and mental health problems and decrease their ability \n        to save for retirement.\n            (4) Grandparents raising grandchildren may face difficulty \n        enrolling their grandchildren in school, medical care, and \n        Federal assistance services.\n            (5) The Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et \n        seq.) includes services that support grandfamilies, including \n        the National Family Caregiver Support Program.\n            (6) Grandparents would benefit from better coordination and \n        information about resources available to support them in their \n        caregiving responsibilities.\n\nSEC. 3.
