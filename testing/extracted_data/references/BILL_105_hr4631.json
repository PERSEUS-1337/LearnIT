FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the travel and tourism industry, as one of the Nation's \n        largest employers, has made a substantial contribution to the \n        health of the Nation's economy in that:\n                    (A) the industry directly employs 7,000,000 \n                Americans, throughout every region of the country, \n                heavily concentrated among small businesses, and \n                indirectly employs an additional 9,200,000 Americans, \n                for a total of 16,200,000 jobs;\n                    (B) the industry ranks as the first, second, or \n                third largest employer in 32 States and the District of \n                Columbia, generating a total tourism-related annual \n                payroll of $127,900,000,000;\n                    (C) the industry has become the Nation's third \n                largest retail sales industry, generating a total of \n                $489,000,000,000 each year in total expenditures; and\n                    (D) in 1977 the industry generated $71,700,000,000 \n                in tax revenues for Federal, State, and local \n                governments;\n            (2) through an effective public-private partnership, \n        Federal, State, and local governments and the travel and \n        tourism industry can successfully market the United States as \n        the premiere international tourist destination in the world;\n            (3) the private sector, States, and cities currently spend \n        more than $1,000,000,000 annually to promote particular \n        destinations within the United States to international \n        visitors;\n            (4) the more than $98,000,000,000 spent by more than \n        54,000,000 foreign visitors in the United States in 1997 \n        generated a trade surplus in the service sector of more than \n        $26,000,000,000;\n            (5) 100 nations around the world spend hundreds of millions \n        of dollars annually to promote the visits of international \n        tourists to their countries, whereas the United States does not \n        expend Federal funds for this purpose;\n            (6) the United States will miss a major marketing \n        opportunity if it fails to aggressively compete for an \n        increased share of international tourism expenditures;\n            (7) in 1997, 17,900,000 more people visited France than the \n        United States;\n            (8) 92 percent of the tourism industry is composed of \n        small- and medium-sized businesses;\n            (9) a well-funded, well-coordinated international marketing \n        effort--developed and implemented by a joint public-private \n        sector effort--would help small and large businesses, as well \n        as State and local governments, share in the projected growth \n        of the international travel and tourism market in the 21st \n        century;\n            (10) Congress can increase the opportunities for attracting \n        international visitors and enhancing their stay in the United \n        States by--\n                    (A) continuing the successful visa waiver pilot \n                program;\n                    (B) improving international signage at airports, \n                seaports, land border crossings, highways, and bus, \n                train, and other public transit stations in the United \n                States;\n                    (C) increasing the availability of multilingual \n                tourist information; and\n                    (D) creating a toll-free, private sector operated, \n                emergency telephone number, staffed by multilingual \n                operators, to provide assistance to international \n                tourists;\n            (11) by establishing a satellite system of accounting for \n        travel and tourism, the Secretary of Commerce could provide \n        Congress and the President with objective, thorough data that \nwould help policymakers more accurately gauge the size and scope of the \ndomestic travel and tourism industry and its significant impact on the \nhealth of the Nation's economy; and\n            (12) having established the United States National Tourism \n        Organization under the United States National Tourism \n        Organization Act of 1996 (22 U.S.C. 2141 et seq.) to increase \n        the United States share of the international tourism market by \n        developing a national travel and tourism strategy, Congress \n        should support a long-term marketing effort and other important \n        regulatory reform initiatives to promote increased \n        international travel to the United States.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate \ninternational visitors' travel in the United States and promote an \ninternational marketing program to make the United States the premiere \ntravel destination in the world.\n\n               TITLE I--INTERNATIONAL VISITOR INITIATIVES\n\nSEC. 101.
