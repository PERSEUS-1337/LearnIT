FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) hydroelectric power is an irreplaceable source of \n        clean, economic, renewable energy with the unique capability of \n        supporting reliable electric service while maintaining \n        environmental quality;\n            (2) hydroelectric power is the leading renewable energy \n        resource of the United States;\n            (3) hydroelectric power projects provide multiple benefits \n        to the United States, including recreation, irrigation, flood \n        control, water supply, and fish and wildlife benefits;\n            (4) in the next 15 years, the bulk of all non-Federal \n        hydroelectric power capacity in the United States is due to be \n        relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and\n            (5) the process of licensing hydroelectric projects by the \n        Commission--\n                    (A) has become inefficient, because Federal \n                agencies that participate in the process are not \n                required to submit their mandatory and recommended \n                conditions to the license by a time certain; and\n                    (B) does not produce optimal decisions, because the \n                agencies are not required to consider a broad range of \n                factors in determining those conditions.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to improve the hydroelectric licensing \nprocess by--\n            (1) authorizing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \n        impose deadlines by which Federal agencies must submit proposed \n        mandatory and recommended conditions to a license;\n            (2) requiring the agencies to consider a broad range of \n        factors in determining those conditions and to document the \n        consideration of those factors; and\n            (3) making other improvements to the licensing process.\n\nSEC. 4.
