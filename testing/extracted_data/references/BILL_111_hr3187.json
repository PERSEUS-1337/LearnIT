FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Volumetric Excise Tax Credit was created to \n        encourage gasoline refiners to blend domestically produced corn \n        ethanol into the Nation's gasoline supplies.\n            (2) The 54-cent temporary tariff on imported ethanol was \n        created to encourage the development of a domestic grain \n        ethanol industry.\n            (3) Domestic corn ethanol production has increased five-\n        fold since 2000 to more than 9,000,000,000 gallons of corn \n        ethanol produced at more than 150 facilities.\n            (4) Domestic corn ethanol production will soon exceed \n        12,000,000,000 gallons, diverting at least one-third of the \n        Nation's corn supply from food and feed to fuel.\n            (5) Federal ethanol mandates require gasoline refiners to \n        blend 15,000,000,000 gallons of ethanol into gasoline supplies \n        by 2015.\n            (6) The United States is now the world's largest producer \n        of ethanol and our domestic corn ethanol industry is no longer \n        in need of tax subsidies or tariffs.\n            (7) In combination, the rapid growth of the corn ethanol \n        industry and Federal ethanol mandates has made the tax credit \n        for corn ethanol and tariff obsolete.\n            (8) Scarce Federal resources should be dedicated to the \n        development of new and emerging sources of renewable energy, \n        including biomass fuels that meet environmental goals.\n\nSEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the organization ``Feeding America'' formerly known as \n        America's Second Harvest, issued the results of a national \n        study on hunger and poverty in America and found that for 1 in \n        8 Americans hunger is a reality, that the numbers of hungry \n        Americans is on the rise, and 37.3 million people lived in \n        poverty, including over 7.6 million families, 3.6 million \n        seniors, and over 13.3 million children under the age of 18;\n            (2) the Department of Agriculture, Economic Research \n        Service, found that an estimated 35.5 million Americans are \n        food insecure, meaning their access to enough food is limited \n        by a lack of money and other resources;\n            (3) the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities reports \n        that ``the current downturn is likely to cause significant \n        increases both in the number of Americans who are poor and the \n        number living in `deep poverty,' with incomes below half of the \n        poverty line. Because this recession is likely to be deep and \n        the government safety net for very poor families who lack jobs \n        has weakened significantly in recent years, increases in deep \n        poverty in this recession are likely to be severe'';\n            (4) World Hunger Year (WHY), a non-profit organization \n        which operates a national hunger hotline with funding from the \n        Department of Agriculture, has experienced a significant \n        increase in calls for food assistance or information about \n        where to find food, shelter, child-care, or job-finding \n        assistance; and\n            (5) the production of cellulosic and advanced biofuels in \n        the United States will assist the Nation in becoming less \n        vulnerable to foreign supplies of oil, will create a \n        significant number of jobs, and could achieve significant \n        reductions in the generation of greenhouse gas emissions as \n        determined by several recent studies.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nsavings achieved under this Act should be used to combat hunger in the \nUnited States and to develop domestic supplies of cellulosic and \nadvanced biofuels by being used to--\n            (1) increase the assistance provided for Federal nutrition \n        programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, \n        including school nutrition programs;\n            (2) provide assistance to non-profit organizations \n        dedicated to responding to the needs of low-income families in \n        the United States; and\n            (3) provide loan guarantees or grants to companies ready to \n        construct cellulosic and advanced biofuel processing facilities \n        in the United States."
