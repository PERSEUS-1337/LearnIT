    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 6254.32 is added to the Government Code, to read:\n6254.32.\n(a) Notwithstanding any other law, including, but not limited to, Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 830) of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, a recording made by a body worn camera is confidential and shall not be disclosed, except that the recording shall be disclosed to the person whose image is recorded by the body worn camera.\n(b) The following definitions shall apply to this section:\n(1) \u201cBody worn camera\u201d means a device attached to the uniform or body of a peace officer that records video, audio, or both, in a digital or analog format.\n(2) \u201cPeace officer\u201d means any person designated as a peace officer pursuant to Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 830) of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code.\nSEC. 2.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 6254.32 to the Government Code, imposes a limitation on the public\u2019s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nThe need to protect individual privacy from the public disclosure of images captured by a body worn camera outweighs the interest in the public disclosure of that information.\nSEC. 3.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 6254.32 to the Government Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies. Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:\nProtecting the privacy of a person whose image is captured by body worn cameras on local peace officers enhances public safety and the protection of individual rights, thereby furthering the purposes of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.\nSEC. 4.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district under this act would result from a legislative mandate that is within the scope of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.\nSECTION 1.\nSection 832.7 of the\nPenal Code\nis amended to read:\n832.7.\n(a)Peace officer or custodial officer personnel records and records maintained by any state or local agency pursuant to Section 832.5, or information obtained from these records, are confidential and shall not be disclosed in any criminal or civil proceeding except by discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1046 of the Evidence Code. This section shall not apply to investigations or proceedings concerning the conduct of peace officers or custodial officers, or an agency or department that employs those officers, conducted by a grand jury, a district attorney\u2019s office, or the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n(b)Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a department or agency shall release to the complaining party a copy of his or her own statements at the time the complaint is filed.\n(c)Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a department or agency that employs peace or custodial officers may disseminate data regarding the number, type, or disposition of complaints (sustained, not sustained, exonerated, or unfounded) made against its officers if that information is in a form that does not identify the individuals involved.\n(d)Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a department or agency that employs peace or custodial officers may release factual information concerning a disciplinary investigation if the officer who is the subject of the disciplinary investigation, or the officer\u2019s agent or representative, publicly makes a statement he or she knows to be false concerning the investigation or the imposition of disciplinary action. Information may not be disclosed by the peace or custodial officer\u2019s employer unless the false statement was published by an established medium of communication, including, but not limited to, television, radio, or a newspaper. Disclosure of factual information by the employing agency pursuant to this subdivision is limited to facts contained in the officer\u2019s personnel file concerning the disciplinary investigation or imposition of disciplinary action that specifically refute the false statements made public by the peace or custodial officer or his or her agent or representative.\n(e)(1)The department or agency shall provide written notification to the complaining party of the disposition of the complaint within 30 days of the disposition.\n(2)The notification described in this subdivision shall not be conclusive or binding or admissible as evidence in any separate or subsequent action or proceeding brought before an arbitrator, court, or judge of this state or the United States.\n(f)Nothing in this section shall affect the discovery or disclosure of information contained in a peace or custodial officer\u2019s personnel file pursuant to Section 1043 of the Evidence Code."
