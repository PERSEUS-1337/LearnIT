    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Electromagnetic Labeling Act of \n1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR PRODUCTS THAT EMIT ELECTROMAGNETIC \n              FIELDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall establish uniform \nlabeling requirements for each product described in subsection (b).\n    (b) Covered Products.--The products referred to in subsection (a) \nare--\n            (1) products that emit low-frequency electric and magnetic \n        fields of which the strength is not less than 100 volts per \n        meter and 1 Gauss, respectively, when measured at a distance \n        which is one inch from the product; and\n            (2) any other products the Secretary of Energy classifies \n        as a covered product under this section in order to carry out \n        this Act.\n    (c) Labeling Content.--The labeling required for a product under \nthe requirements established pursuant to subsection (a) shall--\n            (1) contain information regarding the strength of the low-\n        frequency electromagnetic fields emitted by the product;\n            (2) reasonably enable the purchaser and user of the product \n        to make choices and comparisons among products; and\n            (3) be simple, placed on the outside of the product, and, \n        where appropriate, consolidated with other labels providing \n        information to the purchaser and user.\n    (d) Consultation.--In establishing labeling requirements pursuant \nto subsection (a), the Secretary of Energy shall consult with the \nFederal Trade Commission, the Secretary of Commerce, leaders of \naffected industry, and consumer organizations.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS OF MANUFACTURERS.\n\n    Each manufacturer of a product described in section 2(b) shall--\n            (1) provide a label for the product which meets the \n        requirements established pursuant to section 2(a) and contains \n        the labeling content described in section 2(c);\n            (2) maintain data derived from tests conducted on the \n        product for the strength of emitted electromagnetic fields; and\n            (3) annually submit to the Secretary of Energy, at a time \n        specified by the Secretary, the data described in paragraph \n        (2).\n\nSEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy may impose a civil penalty \nagainst a manufacturer of a product described in section 2(b) who \ncommits a violation described in subsection (b). The amount of a civil \npenalty imposed under this subsection may not exceed--\n            (1) $100 for each violation described in subsection (b)(1); \n        and\n            (2) $100 for each day during which a violation described in \n        paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b) occurs.\n    (b) Violations for Which Penalties May Be Imposed.--For purposes of \nsubsection (a), a violation shall be any of the following:\n            (1) A failure by the manufacturer of a product described in \n        section 2(b) to provide the label described in section 3(1).\n            (2) A failure by the manufacturer of a product described in \n        section 2(b) to maintain the data described in section 3(2).\n            (3) A failure by the manufacturer of a product described in \n        section 2(b) to make a submission described in section 3(3).\n    (c) Procedures for Imposition of Civil Penalties.--\n            (1) Notice.--Before issuing an order assessing a civil \n        penalty against a manufacturer under this section, the \n        Secretary of Energy shall provide to the manufacturer a notice \n        of the proposed penalty. The notice shall provide information \n        regarding the opportunity of the manufacturer to make an \n        election in writing within 30 days after the receipt of the \n        notice to have the procedures of paragraph (3) (in lieu of the \n        procedures of paragraph (2)) apply to the assessment of the \n        penalty.\n            (2) Assessment after a hearing on the record.--\n                    (A) In general.--Unless an election described in \n                paragraph (1) is made, the Secretary of Energy shall \n                assess a penalty under this section by order, after a \n                determination of a violation has been made on the \n                record after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance \n                with section 554 of title 5, United States Code before \n                an administrative law judge appointed under section \n                3105 of such title. The assessment order shall include \n                the findings of the administrative law judge and the \n                basis for the assessment.\n                    (B) Appeal.--A manufacturer against whom a penalty \n                is assessed under subparagraph (A) may, within 60 \n                calendar days after the date of the order assessing the \n                penalty, institute an action in the United States court \n                of appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for \n                judicial review of the order in accordance with chapter \n                7 of such title.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The term ``electromagnetic fields'' means the electric \n        fields and magnetic fields produced by a product described in \n        section 2(b).\n            (2) The term ``electric fields'' means fields of which the \n        strength is determined by the voltage and is measured in volts \n        per meter.\n            (3) The term ``low-frequency'' means a frequency of 60 \n        cycles per second or 60 Hertz.\n            (4) The term ``magnetic fields'' means fields of which the \n        strength is determined by the amount of flowing current and is \n        measured in Gauss."
