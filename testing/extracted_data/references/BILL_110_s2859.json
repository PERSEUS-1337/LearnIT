FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Federal authorities charged with examining the tragic \n        shootings at Virginia Tech in April 2007 found that confusion \n        and overly-restrictive interpretations of Federal privacy laws, \n        State medical confidentiality laws, and regulations \n        unnecessarily impede the effective transfer of information that \n        could prove useful in averting tragedies. Some school \n        administrators are unaware of exceptions to Federal privacy \n        laws that could allow relevant information about a student's \n        mental health to be appropriately shared.\n            (2) The purpose of this Act is to eliminate ambiguity in \n        Federal education privacy law to ensure that the Family \n        Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) is not \n        interpreted as prohibiting information sharing between on-\n        campus and off-campus health care providers when both are \n        involved in treating a student. Such ``consults'' are generally \n        permitted by State medical confidentiality law, and FERPA \n        should not be interpreted as posing an additional obstacle. The \n        Virginia Tech Review Panel recommended that changes to ``FERPA \n        should explicitly explain how it applies to medical records \n        held for treatment purposes''. The panel reported that \n        misinterpretation of how student treatment records are handled \n        under FERPA as the main source of confusion. FERPA protects the \n        privacy of both student education records and student treatment \n        records from being disclosed generally.\n            (3) The Virginia Tech Review Panel recommended that Federal \n        privacy laws should be amended to include ``safe harbor'' \n        provisions that would insulate a person or organization from \n        the loss of Federal education funding for making a disclosure \n        with a good faith belief that the disclosure was necessary to \n        protect the health or safety of a student or member of the \n        public at large. The Commission further recommended that the \n        Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) be \n        amended to clarify the ability of educational institutions to \n        disclose information in emergency situations and to facilitate \n        treatment of students at off-campus facilities.\n            (4) Mental disorders frequently begin during youth. \n        Research supported by the National Institute of Mental Health \n        found that half of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin \n        by age 14; three quarters have begun by age 24.\n            (5) In 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        reported 4,316 suicides among young adults aged 15-24, making \n        it the third leading cause of death in this age group. There \n        were an additional 5,074 suicides among those aged 25-34, \n        making it the second leading cause of death in this age group.\n            (6) Depression, mental illness, and suicide are problems on \n        college campuses. In 2006, 44 percent of college students \n        reported feeling so depressed it was difficult to function and \n        9 percent seriously considered suicide, according to a 2006 \n        national survey conducted by the American College Health \n        Association.\n            (7) While most people in the United States with a mental \n        disorder eventually seek treatment, a National Institute of \n        Mental Health study found pervasive and lengthy delays in \n        getting treatment, with the median delay across disorders being \n        nearly a decade. Over a 12-month period, 60 percent of those \n        with a mental disorder got no treatment at all.\n            (8) A 2006 survey sponsored by the American College \n        Counseling Association found that 9 percent of enrolled \n        students sought counseling last year and 92 percent of \n        counseling center directors reported an increase in the number \n        of students with severe psychological disorders.\n            (9) Recent events, including the campus shootings at the \n        Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois universities, have further \n        highlighted the deadly problems of mental illness and violence \n        in American schools. The Northern Illinois shooting resulted in \n        6 deaths while the Virginia Tech killings left 32 people dead, \n        making it the most lethal school shooting in United States \n        history.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDENT HEALTH RECORDS.\n\n    The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. \n1232g) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(k) Consultation With Off Campus Medical Professionals.--Nothing \nin this section shall prohibit a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, \nor other recognized healthcare professional or paraprofessional acting \nin the individual's professional or paraprofessional capacity, or \nassisting in that capacity, from consulting with or disclosing records \ndescribed in subsection (a)(4)(B)(iv) with respect to a student, to a \nphysician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized healthcare \nprofessional or paraprofessional acting in the individual's \nprofessional or paraprofessional capacity, or assisting in that \ncapacity, outside the educational agency or institution in connection \nwith the provision of treatment to the student.''.\n\nSEC. 4. SAFE HARBOR PROVISION.\n\n    The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. \n1232g) is amended in subsection (f) by adding at the end the following: \n``The release by an educational agency or institution of education \nrecords or personally identifiable information contained in such \nrecords in the good faith belief that such release is necessary to \nprotect against a potential threat to the health or safety of the \nstudent or other persons, shall not be deemed a failure to comply with \nthis section regardless of whether it is subsequently determined that \nthe specified conditions for such release did not exist.''.\n\nSEC. 5. EMERGENCY EXCEPTION AMENDMENT.\n\n    The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. \n1232g) is amended in subsection (b)(1)(I) by striking ``is necessary'' \nand all that follows and inserting ``is necessary, according to the \ngood faith belief of the educational agency or institution or persons \nto whom such disclosure is made, to protect against a potential threat \nto the health or safety of the student or other persons; and''."
