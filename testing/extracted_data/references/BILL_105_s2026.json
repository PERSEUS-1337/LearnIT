ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO TRANSITION FROM USE OF \n              CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS IN METERED-DOSE INHALERS.\n\n    (a) Assessments.--Before beginning rulemaking to issue a regulation \ndescribed in section 3(a), the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (referred \nto in this Act as the ``Commissioner'') shall conduct the following \nassessments concerning the transition from use of chlorofluorocarbons \nin metered-dose inhalers:\n            (1) An assessment of the health risks and benefits of the \n        regulatory approach set forth in the advance notice of proposed \n        rulemaking entitled ``Chlorofluorocarbon Propellants in Self-\n        Pressurized Containers; Determinations That Uses Are No Longer \n        Essential; Request for Comments'', published in the Federal \n        Register on March 6, 1997, 62 Fed. Reg. 10242, and the health \n        risks and benefits of alternative policies for facilitating the \n        transition to non-chlorofluorocarbon treatments for asthma and \n        other respiratory diseases.\n            (2) An assessment of the environmental risks and benefits \n        of the regulatory approach set forth in the notice described in \n        paragraph (1), and the environmental risks and benefits of \n        alternative policies for facilitating the transition to non-\n        chlorofluorocarbon treatments for asthma and other respiratory \n        diseases.\n            (3) An assessment of whether measures and recommendations \n        adopted by the Tenth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal \n        Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer will, when \n        implemented in the United States, facilitate the transition in \n        the United States to non-chlorofluorocarbon treatments for \n        asthma and other respiratory diseases by 2005 without \n        increasing the health risks to patients of such diseases.\n    (b) Basis for Assessments.--\n            (1) Health risks and benefits.--The Commissioner shall base \n        the assessment described in subsection (a)(1) on factors \n        including extensive consultations with patients, physicians, \n        other health care providers, manufacturers of metered-dose \n        inhalers, and other interested parties.\n            (2) Environmental risks and benefits.--The Commissioner \n        shall conduct the assessment described in subsection (a)(2) in \n        a manner consistent with section 102(2) of the National \n        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)), and parts \n        10, 20, 25, 71 , 101, 170, 171, 312, 314, 511, 514, 570, 571, \n        601, 812, and 814 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations.

RULEMAKING ON CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS IN METERED-DOSE INHALERS.\n\n    (a) Regulation.--After completing the duties described in section \n2, the Commissioner shall issue a regulation setting forth criteria for \ndetermining whether and in what cases particular chlorofluorocarbon \nmetered-dose inhalers are necessary for purposes of eligibility for \nclass I allowances under section 604(d) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n7671c(d)) and, as a result, represent essential uses of class I \nsubstances under title VI of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7671 et \nseq.).\n    (b) Alternatives.--The criteria described in section 3(a) shall \nensure that a range of non-chlorofluorocarbon inhaler alternatives are \navailable for each active moiety, to the extent consistent with title \n35, United States Code, and section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), and that such alternatives are, for all \npopulations of users, comparable to existing treatments (in existence \non the date of issuance of the regulation) in terms of safety and \neffectiveness, use for therapeutic indications, dosage strength, \ndelivery system, and sufficient availability to meet consumer needs.\n    (c) Limitations.--The criteria described in section 3(a) shall not \nutilize a therapeutic class approach. If a determination described in \nsubsection (a) results in the withdrawal of a class I allowance for use \nof a chlorofluorocarbon in a type of inhaler, inhalers of the type \ninvolved that were introduced into interstate commerce prior to the \ndate of the determination shall not be considered to be adulterated or \nmisbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n321 et seq.) solely on the basis of the withdrawal.\n\nSEC. 4. APPROVALS OF NEW MEDICAL PRODUCTS CONTAINING \n              CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS.\n\n    Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended by \ninserting after section 505A (21 U.S.C. 355a) the following:\n\n``SEC. 505B. APPROVALS OF NEW DRUGS CONTAINING CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS.\n\n    ``(a) Preliminary Assessments and Terminations of Review.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Act, with respect to any \napplication submitted to the Secretary under subsection (b) or (j) of \nsection 505 (21 U.S.C. 355) after December 31, 1998, for any drug \ncontaining chlorofluorocarbons, the Secretary shall conduct a \npreliminary assessment of such application to determine if the drug \nrepresents a significant therapeutic advance over products previously \napproved under this chapter. If the Secretary determines that the drug \ndoes not represent a significant therapeutic advance over such approved \nproducts, the Secretary shall terminate review of such application and \nnot approve the application for the drug.\n    ``(b) Limitations.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to a supplement \nto an application if the application was approved under subsection (c) \nor (j)(4) of section 505.\n    ``(c) Construction.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \nchapter, use of a drug containing chlorofluorocarbons in a \nchlorofluorocarbon metered-dose inhaler shall be subject to the \nregulation referred to in section 3(a) of the Asthma Inhaler Protection \nAct, regardless of whether an application or supplement for the drug is \napproved under section 505 in accordance with this section.''."
