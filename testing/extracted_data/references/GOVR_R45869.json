    "content": "This report provides an overview of FY2019 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS). This bill provides discretionary and mandatory appropriations to three federal departments: the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Education (ED). In addition, the bill provides annual appropriations for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). Discretionary funds represent less than one-fifth of the total funds appropriated in the LHHS bill. Nevertheless, the LHHS bill is typically the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic nondefense federal programs among the various appropriations bills. (The Department of Defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs.) The bulk of this report is focused on discretionary appropriations because these funds receive the most attention during the appropriations process. The LHHS bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs, as well as various related social policy issues addressed in the bill, such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion and for research on human embryos and stem cells. Congressional clients may consult the LHHS experts list in CRS Report R42638, Appropriations: CRS Experts , for information on which analysts to contact at the Congressional Research Service (CRS) with questions on specific agencies and programs funded in the LHHS bill. This report is divided into several sections. The opening section provides an explanation of the scope of the LHHS bill (and hence, the scope of this report) and an introduction to important terminology and concepts that carry throughout the report. Next is a series of sections describing major congressional actions on FY2019 appropriations and (for context) a review of the conclusion of the FY2018 appropriations process. This is followed by a high-level summary and analysis of enacted and proposed appropriations for FY2019, compared to FY2018 funding levels. The body of the report concludes with overview sections for each of the major titles of the bill: DOL, HHS, ED, and Related Agencies. These sections provide selected highlights from FY2019 enacted and proposed funding levels compared to FY2018. (Note that the distribution of funds is sometimes illustrated by figures, which in all cases are based on the FY2019 enacted version of the LHHS bill. ) Finally, Appendix A provides a summary of budget enforcement activities for FY2019. This includes information on the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) and sequestration, budget enforcement in the absence of an FY2019 budget resolution, provisional subcommittee spending allocations, and current-year spending levels. This is followed by Appendix B , which provides an overview of the LHHS-related floor amendments that were offered in the Senate during its consideration of H.R. 6157 , an appropriations measure that was amended to contain LHHS appropriations for FY2019. In general, this report is focused strictly on appropriations to agencies and accounts that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittees of the House and Senate appropriations committees (i.e., accounts traditionally funded via the LHHS bill). Department \"totals\" provided in this report do not include funding for accounts or agencies that are traditionally funded by appropriations bills under the jurisdiction of other subcommittees. The LHHS bill provides appropriations for the following federal departments and agencies: the Department of Labor; most agencies at the Department of Health and Human Services, except for the Food and Drug Administration (funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill), the Indian Health Service (funded through the Interior-Environment appropriations bill), and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (also funded through the Interior-Environment appropriations bill); the Department of Education; and more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Railroad Retirement Board. Note also that funding totals displayed in this report do not reflect amounts provided outside of the annual appropriations process. Certain direct spending programs, such as Social Security and parts of Medicare, receive funding directly from their authorizing statutes; such funds are not reflected in the totals provided in this report because they are not provided through the annual appropriations process (see related discussion in the \" Important Budget Concepts \" section). The LHHS bill includes both discretionary and mandatory budget authority. While all discretionary spending is subject to the annual appropriations process, only a portion of mandatory spending is provided in appropriations measures.  Mandatory programs funded through the annual appropriations process are commonly referred to as appropriated entitlements . In general, appropriators have little control over the amounts provided for appropriated entitlements; rather, the authorizing statute controls the program parameters (e.g., eligibility rules, benefit levels) that entitle certain recipients to payments. If Congress does not appropriate the money necessary to meet these commitments, entitled recipients (e.g., individuals, states, or other entities) may have legal recourse. Most mandatory spending is not provided through the annual appropriations process, but rather through budget authority provided by the program's authorizing statute (e.g., Social Security benefits payments). The funding amounts in this report do not include budget authority provided outside of the appropriations process. Instead, the amounts reflect only those funds, discretionary and mandatory, that are provided through appropriations acts. Note that, as displayed in this report, mandatory amounts for the Trump Administration's budget submission reflect current-law (or current services) estimates; they generally do not include the President's proposed changes to a mandatory spending program's authorizing statute that might affect total spending. (In general, such proposals are excluded from this report, as they typically would be enacted in authorizing legislation.) Note also that the report focuses most closely on discretionary funding. This is because discretionary funding receives the bulk of attention during the appropriations process. (As noted earlier, although the LHHS bill includes more mandatory funding than discretionary funding, the appropriators generally have less flexibility in adjusting mandatory funding levels than discretionary funding levels.) Mandatory and discretionary spending is subject to budget enforcement processes that include sequestration. In general, sequestration involves largely across-the-board reductions that are made to certain categories of discretionary or mandatory spending. However, the conditions that trigger sequestration, and how it is carried out, differ for each type of spending. This is discussed further in Appendix A . Budget authority is the amount of money a federal agency is legally authorized to commit or spend. Appropriations bills may include budget authority that becomes available in the current fiscal year, in future fiscal years, or some combination. Amounts that become available in future fiscal years are typically referred to as advance appropriations . Unless otherwise specified, appropriations levels displayed in this report refer to the total amount of budget authority provided in an appropriations bill (i.e., \"total in the bill\"), regardless of the year in which the funding becomes available. In some cases, the report breaks out \"current-year\" appropriations (i.e., the amount of budget authority available for obligation in a given fiscal year , regardless of the year in which it was first appropriated). As the annual appropriations process unfolds, the amount of current-year budget authority is measured against 302(b) allocation ceilings (budget enforcement caps for appropriations subcommittees that traditionally emerge following the budget resolution process). The process of measuring appropria tions against these spending ceilings takes into account scorekeeping adjustments , which are made by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to reflect conventions and special instructions of Congress. Unless otherwise specified, appropriations levels displayed in this report do not reflect additional scorekeeping adjustments.  Table 1 provides a timeline of major legislative actions for full-year LHHS proposals, which are discussed in greater detail below.  On July 1, the President signed into law P.L. 116-26 , an FY2019 supplemental appropriations act focused primarily on humanitarian assistance and security needs at the southern border. The bill was passed by the House on June 27 and by the Senate on June 26. (An earlier version of the bill had passed the House on June 25. A related bill, S. 1900 , had been reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee on June 19; this bill was substantially similar to the final version of P.L. 116-26 .)  As enacted, the FY2019 border supplemental contained nearly $2.9 billion in emergency-designated LHHS appropriations for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account at HHS. These funds were primarily intended to support the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program, which provides for the shelter, care, and placement of unaccompanied alien children who have been apprehended in the United States. According to a letter to Congress from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as of May 1 the number of apprehensions referred to HHS had increased by almost 50% from the prior year. In this same letter, OMB requested about $2.9 billion in supplemental funds for the UAC program, noting that these funds would provide \"critical child welfare services and high-quality shelter care.\" The letter estimated that these funds would allow HHS to increase shelter capacity to approximately 23,600 beds. Of the $2.9 billion appropriated to the UAC account, some funds were set aside for designated activities or purposes, such as state-licensed shelters (not less than $866 million); postrelease services, child advocates, and legal services (not less than $100 million); additional federal field specialists and increased case management and coordination services intended to place children with sponsors more expeditiously and reduce the length of stay in HHS custody (not less than $8 million); project officers/program staff and the development of a discharge rate improvement plan (not less than $1 million); and oversight activities conducted by the HHS Office of the Inspector General ($5 million).  In addition to these reservations, the bill also placed a number of conditions on the use of the supplemental funds. For instance, the bill  directed HHS to prioritize community-based residential care, state-licensed facilities, hard-sided dormitories, and shelter care other than large-scale institutional facilities (\u00c2\u00a7401); prohibited funds from being used for unlicensed facilities, except in limited circumstances (e.g., on a temporary basis due to a large influx of children) when specified conditions are met (e.g., comprehensive monitoring for an unlicensed facility operating for more than three consecutive months) (\u00c2\u00a7404); required HHS to ensure, when feasible, that certain types of children (e.g., children under age 13, children with special needs, pregnant or parenting teens) are not placed in unlicensed facilities (\u00c2\u00a7406); required HHS to reverse any reprogramming within the account that had been carried out pursuant to a notification submitted to the appropriations committees on May 16 (proviso within UAC appropriation); prohibited funds from being used to prevent a Member of Congress from visiting a UAC facility for oversight purposes (\u00c2\u00a7407); prohibited funds from being used by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain or remove sponsors (or potential sponsors) of unaccompanied children based on information provided by HHS as part of the sponsor's application, except when specified criteria are met (\u00c2\u00a7409); and prohibited funds from being used to reverse or change certain operational directives previously issued by HHS, except in limited circumstances (\u00c2\u00a7403). The bill also included a number of notification and reporting requirements associated with these funds. For instance, the bill required HHS to notify the appropriations committees within 72 hours of conducting a formal assessment of a facility for possible lease/acquisition and within seven days of any acquisition/lease of real property (proviso within UAC appropriation); submit to the appropriations committees a discharge rate improvement plan within 120 days of enactment (proviso within UAC appropriation); provide specific information to the appropriations committees at least 15 days before opening an unlicensed facility and provide the committees with monthly reports on the children placed at such facilities (\u00c2\u00a7405); submit to the appropriations committees (and make public) a monthly report on the number and ages of unaccompanied alien children transferred into HHS care after being separated from parents or legal guardians by DHS, along with the reasons for the separations (\u00c2\u00a7408); and submit to the appropriations committees a detailed spending plan of anticipated uses of funds within 30 days of enactment (\u00c2\u00a7410). Over the course of FY2019, the 115 th and 116 th Congresses considered supplemental appropriations to several federal departments and agencies for expenses related to various recent wildfires, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, typhoons, and other natural disasters or emergencies (e.g., H.R. 695 in the 115 th Congress; H.R. 268 , S.Amdt. 201 to H.R. 268 , and H.R. 2157 in the 116 th Congress). Each of these bills included appropriations for several accounts typically funded in the LHHS bill. Ultimately, on June 6, the President signed into law P.L. 116-20 , a supplemental appropriations act for FY2019. The bill was passed by the House on June 3 and by the Senate on May 23. (An earlier version of the bill had passed the House on May 10.)  As enacted, the bill included roughly $611 million in emergency-designated LHHS appropriations for accounts at DOL, HHS, and ED. With limited exceptions, the bill explicitly directed the LHHS funds toward necessary expenses directly related to Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael, Typhoon Mangkhut, Super Typhoon Yutu, wildfires and earthquakes occurring in calendar year 2018, and tornadoes and floods occurring in calendar year 2019. The FY2019 supplemental provided the following definite LHHS appropriations: $50 million for the dislocated worker assistance national reserve at DOL, of which up to $1 million may be transferred to other DOL accounts for reconstruction and recovery needs and up to $500,000 is to be transferred to the DOL Office of the Inspector General for oversight activities. $30 million to the Child Care and Development Block Grant at HHS to support the costs of renovating, repairing, or rebuilding child care facilities. $90 million to the Children and Families Services Programs account at HHS for necessary expenses related to the disasters and emergencies referenced by the law. Of the total, $55 million is directed to Head Start programs, $25 million is directed to the Community Services Block Grant, $5 million is directed to the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services program, and up to $5 million may be used for federal administrative expenses. $201 million for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund at HHS for necessary expenses directly related to the disasters and emergencies referenced by the law. Of this amount, HHS is directed to transfer not less than $100 million to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Health Surveillance and Program Support account for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements for behavioral health treatment, treatment of substance use disorders, crisis counseling and related helplines, and other similar programs to support impacted individuals; $80 million to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) federal health centers program for alteration, renovation, construction, equipment, and other capital improvements to meet the needs of affected areas; not less than $20 million to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for CDC-Wide Activities and Program Support for response, recovery, mitigation, and other expenses; and up to $1 million to the Office of the Inspector General for oversight activities. $165 million for Hurricane Education Recovery at ED to assist in meeting the educational needs of affected individuals. Of the total, $2 million is to be transferred to the Office of the Inspector General for oversight activities and up to $1 million may be used for program administration. In addition, the supplemental provided a combination of definite and indefinite appropriations to the Medicaid program at HHS to support program costs in the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. During the 115 th Congress, on September 28, 2018, the President signed into law the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 ( H.R. 6157 , P.L. 115-245 ). This was the first occasion since the FY1997 appropriations cycle that full-year LHHS appropriations were enacted on or before the start of the fiscal year (October 1). The House and Senate had previously agreed to resolve differences on the measure via a conference committee. (Conferees on the bill were named in the House on September 4 and in the Senate on September 6.) The conference report ( H.Rept. 115-952 ) was adopted by the Senate on September 18, and the House on September 26. LHHS discretionary appropriations in the FY2019 omnibus totaled $189.4 billion. This amount is 1.5% more than FY2018 enacted and 8.9% more than the FY2019 President's budget request. The omnibus also provided $869.8 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined LHHS total of $1.059 trillion. (Note that these totals are based only on amounts provided by the FY2019 LHHS omnibus and do not include the supplemental funds, which were provided in addition to the annual appropriations.) See Figure 1 for a breakdown of FY2019 discretionary and mandatory LHHS appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee's LHHS subcommittee approved its draft bill on June 15, 2018. The full committee markup was held on July 11, 2018, and the bill was ordered to be reported that same day (30-22). The bill was subsequently reported to the House on July 23 ( H.R. 6470 , H.Rept. 115-862 ). It did not receive floor consideration in the House. As reported by the full committee, the bill would have provided $187.2 billion in discretionary LHHS funds, a 0.3% increase from FY2018 enacted levels. This amount would have been 7.6% more than the FY2019 President's request. In addition, the House committee bill would have provided an estimated $869.8 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined total of $1.057 trillion for LHHS as a whole. The Senate Appropriations Committee's LHHS subcommittee approved its draft bill on June 26, 2018. The full committee markup was held on June 28, 2018. The committee approved the bill (30-1) and reported it that same day ( S. 3158 , S.Rept. 115-289 ). Instead of taking up S. 3158 , the Senate chose to consider and pass H.R. 6157 on August 23, 2018, by a vote of 85-7. The bill was amended on the Senate floor to contain FY2019 LHHS appropriations in Division B. (Division A contained the appropriations act for the Department of Defense.) The text of Division B that was considered for amendment was the same as S. 3158 (with minor alterations). During floor consideration, the Senate also adopted 31 amendments to the new LHHS division of the bill (see Appendix B for a summary of these amendments).  The Senate-passed bill would have provided $189.4 billion in discretionary LHHS funds. This would have been 1.5% more than FY2018, and 8.9% more than the FY2019 President's request. In addition, the Senate bill would have provided an estimated $869.8 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined total of $1.059 trillion for LHHS as a whole. On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration released the FY2019 President's budget. The President requested $173.9 billion in discretionary funding for accounts funded by the LHHS bill, which would have been a decrease of 6.8% from FY2018 levels. In addition, the President requested $869.8 billion in annually appropriated mandatory funding, for a total of $1.044 trillion for LHHS as a whole. On March 23, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( H.R. 1625 , P.L. 115-141 ). The bill was agreed to in the House on March 22 and in the Senate on March 23. The bill provided regular, full-year appropriations for all 12 annual appropriations acts, including LHHS (Division H).  LHHS discretionary appropriations in the FY2018 omnibus totaled $186.5 billion (this total does not include emergency funding provided by an earlier supplemental appropriations act for FY2018, P.L. 115-123 ). This amount was 7.6% more than FY2017 levels and 25.3% more than the FY2018 budget request from the Trump Administration. The omnibus also provided $817.5 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined FY2018 LHHS total of $1.004 trillion.  Table 2 displays FY2019 discretionary and mandatory LHHS budget authority provided or proposed, by bill title, along with FY2018 enacted levels. The amounts shown in this table reflect total budget authority provided in the bill (i.e., all funds appropriated in the bill, regardless of the fiscal year in which the funds become available), not total budget authority available for the current fiscal year. (For a comparable table showing current-year budget authority, see Table A-2 in Appendix A .)  Figure 2 displays the FY2019 enacted discretionary and mandatory LHHS funding levels, by bill title. (While the dollars and percentages discussed in this section were calculated based on the FY2019 enacted amounts, they are generally also illustrative\u00e2\u0080\u0094within several percentage points\u00e2\u0080\u0094of the share of funds directed to each bill title in FY2018 and under the other FY2019 proposals.)  As this figure demonstrates, HHS accounts for the largest share of total FY2019 LHHS appropriations: $899 billion, or 84.9%. This is due to the large amount of mandatory funding included in the HHS appropriation, the majority of which is for Medicaid grants to states and payments to health care trust funds. After HHS, ED and the Related Agencies represent the next-largest shares of total LHHS funding, accounting for 7.1% and 6.7%, respectively. (The majority of the ED appropriations each year are discretionary, while the bulk of funding for the Related Agencies goes toward mandatory payments and administrative costs of the Supplemental Security Income program at the Social Security Administration.) Finally, DOL accounts for the smallest share of total LHHS funds, 1.3%. However, the overall composition of LHHS funding is noticeably different when comparing only discretionary appropriations. HHS accounts for a comparatively smaller share of total discretionary appropriations (47.8%), while ED accounts for a relatively larger share (37.7%). Together, these two departments represent the majority (85.5%) of discretionary LHHS appropriations. DOL and the Related Agencies account for a roughly even split of the remaining 14.5% of discretionary LHHS funds. Note that all amounts in this section are based on regular LHHS appropriations only. Amounts in this section do not include mandatory funds provided outside of the annual appropriations process (e.g., direct appropriations for Unemployment Insurance benefits payments). All amounts in this section are rounded to the nearest million or billion (as labeled). The dollar changes and percentage changes discussed in the text are based on unrounded amounts. For consistency with source materials, amounts do not reflect sequestration or reestimates of mandatory spending programs, where applicable.  DOL is a federal department comprised of multiple entities that provide services related to employment and training, worker protection, income security, and contract enforcement. Annual LHHS appropriations laws direct funding to all DOL entities (see the text box). The DOL entities fall primarily into two main functional areas\u00e2\u0080\u0094workforce development and worker protection. First, there are several DOL entities that administer workforce employment and training programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) state formula grant programs, Job Corps, and the Employment Service\u00e2\u0080\u0094that provide direct funding for employment activities or administration of income security programs (e.g., for the Unemployment Insurance benefits program). Also included in this area is the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS), which provides employment services specifically for the veteran population. Second, there are several agencies that provide various worker protection services. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), and the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) provide different types of regulation and oversight of working conditions. DOL entities focused on worker protection provide services to ensure worker safety, adherence to wage and overtime laws, and contract compliance, among other duties. In addition to these two main functional areas, DOL's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects data and provides analysis on the labor market and related labor issues.  Table 3 generally displays FY2019 discretionary and mandatory DOL budget authority provided or proposed, along with FY2018 enacted levels. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus decreased discretionary appropriations for DOL by 0.8% compared to the FY2018 enacted levels. Similarly, discretionary DOL appropriations would have decreased, compared to FY2018, under the FY2019 President's budget request (-11.1%), as well as the FY2019 House committee bill (-2.4%) and Senate-passed bill (-0.8%). Of the total funding provided in the bill for DOL, roughly 89% is discretionary. The following sections present highlights from FY2019 enacted and proposed appropriations compared to FY2018 enacted appropriations for selected DOL accounts and programs.  Table 4 displays funding for DOL programs and activities discussed in this section. ETA administers the primary federal workforce development law, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA, P.L. 113-128 ). The WIOA, which replaced the Workforce Investment Act, was signed into law in July 2014 and authorizes appropriations for its programs through FY2020. WIOA's provisions went into effect in FY2015 and FY2016. Title I of WIOA, which authorizes more than half of all funding for the programs authorized by the four titles of WIOA, includes three state formula grant programs serving Adults, Youth, and Dislocated Workers. While the FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided the same funding for the three WIOA state formula grant programs compared to FY2018, the President's budget would have reduced funding for all three of the state formula grant programs by $80 million (-2.9%), compared to FY2018 enacted levels. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $221 million for the Dislocated Workers Activities National Reserve (DWA National Reserve), which was the same level enacted in FY2018. The FY2019 President's budget and the House committee bill would have reduced funding for the DWA National Reserve by $75 million (-34.0%) and $21 million (-9.4%), respectively, while the Senate would have kept DWA National Reserve funding the same as FY2018. Finally, the FY2019 LHHS omnibus maintained a provision in that account (which had originated in the FY2018 omnibus) directing $30 million from the DWA National Reserve toward training and employment assistance for workers dislocated in both the Appalachian and lower Mississippi regions. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $160 million for the Apprenticeship Grant program, which is $15 million (+10.3%) more than the level enacted in FY2018. The FY2019 President's budget would have increased funding for the Apprenticeship Grant program by $55 million (+37.9%) compared to the FY2018 enacted level. Finally, four ETA programs for which the FY2019 President's budget proposed no funding\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Native Americans program, the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers program, the Community Service Employment for Older Americans (CSEOA) program, and the Workforce Data Quality Initiative\u00e2\u0080\u0094received FY2019 appropriations at roughly the same level as FY2018. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided the same funding, $86 million, for ILAB as was provided in FY2018. The Senate-passed bill would also have provided $86 million for ILAB. The FY2019 President's budget and the House committee bill each would have decreased funding by $68 million (-78.5%) for ILAB, which provides research, advocacy, technical assistance, and grants to promote workers' rights in different parts of the world. Language in the FY2019 President's budget indicated that the proposed reduction reflected a \"workload decrease associated with the elimination of new grants as well as ILAB's refocusing of its efforts and resources on ensuring that U.S. trade agreements are fair for U.S. workers by monitoring and enforcing the labor provisions of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and trade preference programs.\" Annual LHHS appropriations acts regularly contain general provisions related to certain labor issues. This section highlights selected DOL general provisions in the FY2019 LHHS omnibus. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus continued several provisions that have been included in at least one previous LHHS appropriations act, including provisions that direct the Secretary of Labor to accept private wage surveys as part of the process of determining prevailing wages in the H-2B program, even in instances in which relevant wage data are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (included since FY2016); exempt certain insurance claims adjusters from overtime protection for two years following a \"major disaster\" (included since FY2016); authorize the Secretary of Labor to provide up to $2 million in \"excess personal property\" to apprenticeship programs to assist training apprentices (included since FY2018); authorize the Secretary of Labor to employ law enforcement officers or special agents to provide protection to the Secretary of Labor and certain other employees and family members at public events and in situations in which there is a \"unique and articulable\" threat of physical harm (included since FY2018); and authorize the Secretary of Labor to dispose of or divest \"by any means the Secretary determines appropriate\" all or part of the real property on which the Treasure Island Job Corps Center is located (included since FY2018). Note that all amounts in this section are based on regular LHHS appropriations only; they do not include funds for HHS agencies provided through other appropriations bills (e.g., funding for the Food and Drug Administration) or outside of the annual appropriations process (e.g., direct appropriations for Medicare or mandatory funds provided by authorizing laws, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act [ACA, P.L. 111-148 ]). All amounts in this section are rounded to the nearest million or billion (as labeled). The dollar changes and percentage changes discussed in the text are based on unrounded amounts. For consistency with source materials, amounts do not reflect sequestration or reestimates of mandatory spending programs, where applicable.  HHS is a large federal department composed of multiple agencies working to enhance the health and well-being of Americans. Annual LHHS appropriations laws direct funding to most (but not all) HHS agencies (see text box for HHS agencies supported by the LHHS bill). For instance, the LHHS bill directs funding to five Public Health Service (PHS) agencies: the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). These public health agencies support diverse missions, ranging from the provision of health care services and supports (e.g., HRSA, SAMHSA), to the advancement of health care quality and medical research (e.g., AHRQ, NIH), to the prevention and control of infectious and chronic diseases (e.g., CDC). In addition, the LHHS bill provides funding for annually appropriated components of CMS, which is the HHS agency responsible for the administration of Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and consumer protections and private health insurance provisions of the ACA.  The LHHS bill also provides funding for two HHS agencies focused primarily on the provision of social services: the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Administration for Community Living (ACL). ACF's mission is to promote the economic and social well-being of vulnerable children, youth, families, and communities. ACL was formed with a goal of increasing access to community supports for older Americans and people with disabilities. Finally, the LHHS bill also provides funding for the HHS Office of the Secretary (OS), which encompasses a broad array of management, research, oversight, and emergency preparedness functions in support of the entire department.  Table 5 displays enacted and proposed FY2019 funding levels for HHS, along with FY2018 levels. In general, discretionary funds account for about 10% of HHS appropriations in the LHHS bill. Compared to the FY2018 funding levels, the FY2019 LHHS omnibus increased HHS discretionary appropriations by 2.6%. The House committee bill would have increased HHS discretionary appropriations to a lesser degree, by 1.3%, whereas the Senate proposed a more substantial increase of 2.7%. In contrast, the President requested a 1.6% decrease in discretionary HHS funding.   Figure 3 provides an HHS agency-level breakdown of FY2019 enacted appropriations. As this figure demonstrates, annual HHS appropriations are dominated by mandatory funding, the majority of which goes to CMS to provide Medicaid benefits and payments to health care trust funds. When taking into account both mandatory and discretionary funding, CMS accounts for $796.9 billion, which is 88.6% of all enacted appropriations for HHS. ACF and NIH account for the next-largest shares of total HHS appropriations, receiving about 4.2% apiece.  By contrast, when looking exclusively at discretionary appropriations, funding for CMS constitutes about 4.9% of FY2019 enacted HHS appropriations. Instead, the bulk of discretionary appropriations went to the PHS agencies, which account for 63.5% of discretionary appropriations provided for HHS. NIH typically receives the largest share of all discretionary funding among HHS agencies (41.9% in FY2019), with ACF accounting for the second-largest share (25.6% in FY2019).  Annual appropriations for HHS public health service agencies are best understood in the context of certain HHS-specific funding mechanisms: the Public Health Service (PHS) Evaluation Set-Aside and the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). In recent years, LHHS appropriations have used these funding mechanisms to direct additional support to certain programs and activities. The PHS Evaluation Set-Aside, also known as the PHS Evaluation Tap, is a unique feature of HHS appropriations. It is authorized by Section 241 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and allows the Secretary of HHS, with the approval of appropriators, to redistribute a portion of eligible PHS agency appropriations across HHS for program evaluation purposes.  The PHSA limits the set-aside to not less than 0.2% and not more than 1% of eligible program appropriations. However, LHHS appropriations acts have commonly established a higher maximum percentage for the set-aside and have distributed specific amounts of \"tap\" funding to selected HHS programs. Since FY2010, and including in FY2019, this higher maximum set-aside level has been 2.5% of eligible appropriations. (While the House committee bill would also have maintained the set-aside at 2.5%, the Senate-passed bill and the President's budget each proposed to increase the set-aside to 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively.) Before FY2015, the PHS tap traditionally provided more than a dozen HHS programs with funding beyond their annual appropriations and, in some cases, was the sole source of funding for a program or activity. However, since FY2015 and including in FY2019, LHHS appropriations laws have directed tap funds to a smaller number of programs or activities within three HHS agencies (NIH, SAMHSA, and OS) and have not provided any tap transfers to AHRQ, CDC, and HRSA. This has been particularly notable for AHRQ, which had been funded primarily through tap transfers from FY2003 to FY2014, but has received discretionary appropriations since then. The House committee bill and the Senate-passed bill generally would have maintained the current distributional practice for FY2019. However, the President's budget proposed to expand the activities and agencies funded by the PHS tap to include the Public Health Scientific Services at the CDC, while simultaneously proposing to eliminate tap transfers to some other activities. Since FY2015, LHHS appropriations laws have directed the largest share of tap transfers to NIH. The FY2019 omnibus provided $1.1 billion in tap transfers to NIH, a $224 million (+24.3%) increase over the FY2018 level. The FY2019 House committee bill proposed that the NIH transfers be continued at FY2018 levels ($923 million), whereas the Senate-passed bill would have increased the transfer by $95 million (+10.3%). In contrast, the President's request proposed that the transfer be reduced by $182 million (-19.7%). The ACA both authorized and appropriated mandatory funding to three funds to support programs and activities within the PHS agencies. One of these, the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF, ACA \u00c2\u00a74002, as amended), was given a permanent, annual appropriation that was intended to provide support each year to prevention, wellness, and related public health programs funded through HHS accounts.  The ACA had appropriated $2 billion in mandatory funds to the PPHF for FY2019, but this amount has been reduced by subsequent laws that decreased PPHF funding for FY2019 and other fiscal years. Under current law, the FY2019 appropriation was $900 million. In addition, this appropriation was subject to a 6.2% reduction due to sequestration of nonexempt mandatory spending. (For more information on sequestration, see the budget enforcement discussion in Appendix A .) After sequestration, the total PPHF appropriation available for FY2019 was $844 million, an increase of $4 million relative to FY2018. Of this amount, the LHHS omnibus allocated $805 million to CDC, $12 million to SAMHSA, and $28 million to ACL.  PPHF funds are intended to supplement (sometimes quite substantially) the funding that selected programs receive through regular appropriations. Although the PPHF authority instructs the HHS Secretary to transfer amounts from the fund to HHS agencies, since FY2014 provisions in annual appropriations acts and accompanying reports have explicitly directed the distribution of PPHF funds and prohibited the Secretary from making further transfers for those years.  The CDC commonly receives the largest share of annual PPHF funds. The amount provided to the CDC for FY2019, $805 million, was a $4 million (+0.4%) increase relative to FY2018. The House committee bill and the Senate-passed bill each proposed increases to the CDC allocation (to $848 million and $808 million, respectively), while the President's request proposed eliminating the mandatory PPHF appropriation entirely.  This section begins with a limited selection of FY2019 discretionary funding highlights by HHS agency. The discussion is largely based on the enacted and proposed appropriations levels for FY2019, compared to FY2018 enacted levels. These summaries are followed by a brief overview of significant provisions from annual HHS appropriations laws that restrict spending in certain controversial areas, such as abortion and stem cell research. The section concludes with two tables ( Table 6 and Table 7 ) presenting more detailed information on FY2018 enacted and FY2019 proposed and enacted funding levels for HHS. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $6.9 billion in discretionary budget authority for HRSA. This was $107 million (+1.6%) more than HRSA's FY2018 discretionary funding level and $2.7 billion (-28.4%) less than the FY2019 President's budget request. In several cases, the FY2019 President's budget proposed new or increased discretionary budget authority for HRSA programs that had previously been funded exclusively or jointly with mandatory appropriations from authorizing laws, such as the health centers program, the National Health Service Corps, and the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program. Simultaneously, the President's budget proposed to eliminate mandatory funding for these programs. However, authorizing law ultimately provided FY2019 mandatory appropriations for each of these programs and the FY2019 LHHS omnibus maintained discretionary appropriations for them at their FY2018 levels, where applicable. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $286 million for Title X Family Planning, the same as FY2018. For the fourth year in a row, the House committee bill had proposed eliminating funding for Title X of the PHSA and also prohibiting the use of other HHS funds to carry out Title X. In contrast, the FY2019 Senate-passed bill and the FY2019 President's budget had proposed a flat funding level for Title X from FY2018, and no prohibition on the use of other HHS funds. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus also continued to fund the Rural Communities Opioids Response program within HRSA's Rural Health account. The program was created in FY2018 to support treatment and prevention of substance use disorders in high-risk rural communities. The omnibus appropriated $120 million for the program, an increase of $20 million (+20.0%) from FY2018. HRSA is directed to use this increase to establish three Rural Centers of Excellence on substance use disorders. The LHHS omnibus provided Healthy Start an increase of $12 million (+10.9%) from FY2018 as part of a new initiative to reduce maternal mortality and increased funding to support maternal mortality reduction efforts under the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant by $26 million (+4.0%).  The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $7.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for CDC. This was $117 million (-1.6%) less than CDC's FY2018 funding level and $1.6 billion (+28.3%) more than the FY2019 President's budget request. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus did not direct any PHS tap funds to the CDC, continuing the practice started in FY2015. (The FY2019 President's budget had requested $136 million in tap funds.) However, the FY2019 LHHS omnibus did supplement discretionary CDC appropriations with $805 million in PPHF transfers to the CDC, which was $4 million (+0.4%) more than FY2018. (Unlike FY2018, the FY2019 LHHS omnibus did not direct any transfers from the HHS Nonrecurring Expenses Fund (NEF) to the CDC.)  A number of CDC accounts contained funding set aside to address the opioid crisis. For example, the HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Tuberculosis Prevention account received an increase of $5 million (+0.4%) from FY2018; the conference report specified that the increase be used for a new initiative targeting infectious disease consequences of the opioid epidemic. With regard to the Injury Prevention and Control account, which was maintained at the FY2018 level of $649 million, the conference report directed HHS to reserve $476 million from this total for the CDC's Prescription Drug Overdose (PDO) activities, noting that these funds should be used to \"advance the understanding of the opioid overdose epidemic and scale up prevention activities.\" In addition, $10 million in PDO funding was to be dedicated to a nationwide opioid awareness and education campaign. The Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities account received an increase of $15 million (+10.7%), of which $10 million was to support monitoring of mothers and babies affected by the Zika virus as well as other emerging health threats, such as opioid use during pregnancy, and $2 million was reserved specifically for activities related to neonatal abstinence syndrome.  The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $37.9 billion in discretionary budget authority for NIH. This was $1.8 billion (+4.9%) more than FY2018 and $4.1 billion (+12.3%) more than the President's FY2019 budget request. In addition, the FY2019 LHHS omnibus directed $1.1 billion in PHS tap transfers to NIH, an increase of $224 million (+24.3%) from FY2018. The entirety of the tap transfer was provided to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and was paired with a discretionary appropriation of $1.7 billion. The discretionary appropriation was $137 million (-7.3%) less than FY2018, but when combined with the tap transfer, total funding for NIGMS increased by $87 million (+3.1%) from FY2018. When accounting for discretionary appropriations and PHS tap transfers, each of the NIH accounts in the LHHS bill received an increase from FY2018 levels. Compared to FY2018, the largest percentage increases went to the National Institute on Aging, which received a total of $3.1 billion (+19.8%), and the Buildings and Facilities account, which received $200 million (+55.2%). In line with recent practice, the conference report on the FY2019 LHHS omnibus directed NIH to reserve a specific amount ($2.34 billion) for Alzheimer's disease research, referring to it as an increase of $425 million from FY2018. Reserving a specific dollar amount for a particular disease or area of research at NIH is a relatively new practice and constitutes a significant departure from past precedent.  The FY2019 LHHS omnibus appropriated $711 million to the NIH Innovation Account pursuant to the 21 st Century Cures Act ( P.L. 114-255 ), which was equal to the amount authorized to be appropriated in that act. The conference report also reiterated the purposes authorized in the act, directing that NIH transfer $400 million to the National Cancer Institute to support cancer research, and $57.5 million each to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Institute of Mental Health to support the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. The remaining $196 million was divided between the Precision Medicine Initiative ($186 million) and regenerative medicine research ($10 million).  The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $5.6 billion in discretionary budget authority for SAMHSA. This amount was $584 million (+11.6%) more than SAMHSA's FY2018 funding level and $2.2 billion (+63.4%) more than the President's FY2019 budget request. In addition, the FY2019 LHHS omnibus also directed $134 million in PHS evaluation tap funding and $12 million in PPHF funding to SAMHSA, which was the same amount as FY2018. State Opioid Response Grants received $1.5 billion in FY2019, a $500 million (+50%) increase from FY2018, which was the first year in which funding was provided for this program. However, the State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis (STR) grants that were appropriated $500 million in each of FY2017 and FY2018 did not receive appropriations in FY2019. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus also included an increase of $50 million (+50.0%) from FY2018 for Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers. Mental Health Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS) and Substance Abuse Prevention PRNS each had a reduction of $43 million (-10.1% and -17.2%, respectively) from FY2018, while Substance Abuse Treatment PRNS had an increase of $55 million (+13.7) from FY2018.  The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $4.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for CMS. This was $20 million (+0.5%) more than FY2018 and $121 million (+2.8%) more than the FY2019 President's budget request. The LHHS omnibus appropriated $765 million for the CMS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account, 2.7% more than FY2018, and slightly less (-0.6%) than the FY2019 President's request. Of the total amount appropriated for HCFAC, $454 million was effectively exempt from the discretionary budget caps. (See Appendix A for an explanation of the LHHS budget cap exemptions.) The LHHS omnibus provided the CMS Program Management account with a flat funding level of $3.7 billion. This account supports CMS program operations (e.g., claims processing, information technology investments, provider and beneficiary outreach and education, and program implementation), in addition to federal administration and other activities related to the administration of Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and private health insurance provisions established by the ACA. The FY2019 appropriation was the same amount that was proposed by the Senate-passed bill, but more than the amounts proposed by the President's budget (+3.6%) and the House committee bill (+4.8%). The omnibus maintained a general provision (\u00c2\u00a7227), included in LHHS appropriations acts since FY2014, authorizing HHS to transfer additional funds into this account from Medicare trust funds. The terms of the provision required that such funds be used to support activities specific to the Medicare program, limited the amount of the transfers to $305 million, and explicitly prohibited such transfers from being used to support or supplant funding for ACA implementation. The House committee bill would have eliminated this provision.  The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $23.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for ACF. This was $357 million (+1.6%) more than FY2018 and $7.8 billion (+50.6%) more than the FY2019 President's budget request. The President's budget would have decreased ACF discretionary funding by roughly one-third relative to the prior year (-32.5%). The President's budget would have achieved much of its proposed reduction by eliminating certain programs within ACF, such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), Preschool Development Grants (PDG), and the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG). Funding for these three programs was sustained or increased in the FY2019 LHHS omnibus: LIHEAP received $3.7 billion, PDG $250 million, and CSBG $725 million.  The LHHS omnibus provided $1.9 billion for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs account, an increase of $40 million (+2.2%) relative to FY2018. The LHHS omnibus retained a provision, included in LHHS appropriations since FY2015, authorizing HHS to augment appropriations for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account by up to 10% via transfers from other discretionary HHS funds.  The conference report on the omnibus directed the majority of the appropriation for Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs toward the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program ($1.3 billion, the same as FY2018). The UAC program provides for the shelter, care, and placement of unaccompanied alien children who have been apprehended in the United States. The LHHS omnibus also included several new general provisions related to the UAC program. For instance, the law authorized HHS to accept donations for the care of UACs (\u00c2\u00a7232), required HHS to submit a report on reunification of children with parents who are no longer in the United States (\u00c2\u00a7233), and prohibited HHS appropriations from being used to prevent a Member of Congress from visiting a UAC facility for oversight purposes (\u00c2\u00a7234). In addition, the conference report on the LHHS omnibus expressed an expectation that HHS would adhere to certain general provisions that had been included in the House committee bill ( H.R. 6470 ), specifically provisions relating to sibling placement (\u00c2\u00a7235), monthly reporting (\u00c2\u00a7236), a report on preliterate children in custody (\u00c2\u00a7541), a report on the mental health needs of children separated from their parents (\u00c2\u00a7542), and a sense of the Congress that immigrant children should not be separated from their parents and should be reunited immediately (\u00c2\u00a7539).  A number of new directives and reporting requirements on the UAC program were also included in the conference report itself, as well as reports on the earlier committee-reported FY2019 LHHS bills. The conferees noted that HHS was expected to adhere to the requirements laid out in all three reports (unless a particular requirement in a committee report had been superseded by the LHHS omnibus or its conference report). These requirements addressed a range of topics related to, for instance, the administration of medication, questioning children about religion, sharing information on the whereabouts of children and parents, protecting genetic material, the provision of qualified and independent legal counsel, and expectations for communication with appropriations committees on various UAC issues.  The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $338 million in discretionary budget authority to AHRQ. This was 1.2% more than the FY2018 level of $334 million. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus did not direct any PHS tap transfers to AHRQ, which is in keeping with practices since FY2015 but contrasts with earlier years (FY2003-FY2014) in which AHRQ had been funded primarily with tap transfers. The FY2019 omnibus continued to fund AHRQ as its own operating division, declining the President's proposal to consolidate AHRQ into NIH. The FY2019 President's request had proposed zero funding for AHRQ, proposing instead to continue funding many of AHRQ's activities through a new National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ) in the NIH.  The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $2.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for ACL. This was $25 million (+1.2%) more than FY2018. In addition, the FY2019 LHHS omnibus directed $28 million in PPHF transfers to ACL, the same as FY2018. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus specified that the PPHF transfers were for the Alzheimer's Disease Program, Chronic Disease Self-Management, and Elder Falls Prevention.  The FY2019 LHHS omnibus did not adopt the President's budget proposals to consolidate Chronic Disease Self-Management and Elder Falls Prevention into the Preventive Health Services Program, or to eliminate funding for the State Health Insurance Program, the Paralysis Resource Center, and the Limb Loss Resource Center. The conference report on the FY2019 LHHS omnibus called on ACL to use a portion of the $181 million reserved for Family Caregiver Support Services to establish and carry out activities for two newly authorized advisory councils. Specifically, the report recommended that ACL dedicate $300,000 to the Family Caregiving Advisory Council authorized under the RAISE Family Caregivers Act ( P.L. 115-119 ) and $300,000 to the Advisory Council to Support Grandparents Raising Grandchildren authorized under the Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act ( P.L. 115-196 ). In addition, the conference report on the FY2019 LHHS omnibus called for a $5 million (+40.1%) increase under Aging Network Support Activities for a new Care Corps grants program. Care Corps grants are intended to support public agencies and nonprofits in placing volunteers to provide nonmedical care to help family caregivers, seniors, and individuals with disabilities to maintain independence. Annual LHHS appropriations measures regularly contain broad restrictions related to certain controversial issues. For instance, annual LHHS appropriations acts commonly include provisions limiting the use of federal funds for abortions, the use of human embryos for research, needle exchange programs, and gun control advocacy.  Abortions: Since FY1977, annual LHHS appropriations acts have included provisions limiting the circumstances under which LHHS funds (including Medicaid funds) may be used to pay for abortions. Early versions of these provisions applied only to HHS, but since FY1994 most provisions have applied to the entire LHHS bill. Under current provisions, (1) abortions may be funded only when the life of the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest; (2) funds may not be used to buy a managed care package that includes abortion coverage, except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment; and (3) federal programs and state and local governments that receive LHHS funding are prohibited from discriminating against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions or abortion services. The FY2019 omnibus retained these existing restrictions (\u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7506 and 507). In addition, the House committee bill proposed a new provision that was not enacted (\u00c2\u00a7534) based on the Conscience Protection Act ( H.R. 644 , 115 th Congress). Among other things, this provision would have amended the Public Health Service Act to generally prevent federal, state, and local governments from penalizing or discriminating against health care providers who choose not to perform, pay for, or sponsor coverage of abortions. However, the provision was not included in the LHHS omnibus. Human Embryo Research: Since FY1996, annual LHHS appropriations have included a provision prohibiting any LHHS funds (including NIH funds) from being used to create human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embryos are destroyed. The FY2019 omnibus retained these existing restrictions (\u00c2\u00a7508).  Needle Exchange Programs: Since FY1990, annual LHHS appropriations have generally included a provision prohibiting any LHHS funds from being used for needle exchange programs (i.e., programs in which sterile needles or syringes are made available to injection drug users in exchange for used needles or syringes to mitigate the spread of related infections, such as Hepatitis and HIV/AIDS). Starting in FY2016, the provision was modified to allow funds to be used for needle exchange programs under the following conditions: (1) federal funds may not be used to purchase the needles, but may be used for other aspects of such programs; (2) the state or local jurisdiction must demonstrate, in consultation with CDC, that they are experiencing, or at risk for, a significant increase in hepatitis infections or an HIV outbreak due to injection drug use; and (3) the program must be operating in accordance with state and local law. The FY2019 omnibus retained these existing restrictions and conditions (\u00c2\u00a7529). Gun Control: Since FY1997, annual LHHS appropriations have included provisions prohibiting the use of certain funds for activities that advocate or promote gun control. Early versions of these provisions applied only to CDC; since FY2012, annual appropriations acts also have included HHS-specific restrictions, in addition to restrictions that apply to all LHHS funds (including funds transferred from the PPHF). The FY2019 omnibus retained these existing restrictions (\u00c2\u00a7210 [HHS] and \u00c2\u00a7503(c) [all LHHS, plus PPHF transfers]).  Restrictions on ACA Implementation: Since FY2011, annual LHHS appropriations have included provisions limiting or altering the ability of HHS to implement various aspects of the ACA. The content and scope of these provisions has evolved over time. The FY2019 House committee bill contained two provisions related to this topic that were not included in the FY2018 omnibus. First, the FY2019 House committee bill (\u00c2\u00a7528) would have prohibited any funds appropriated in the bill from being used for health insurance \"navigator\" programs required by Section 1311 of the ACA. (Navigators conduct public education activities to help consumers and small businesses make informed decisions about insurance.) Further, the House committee bill would have prohibited LHHS appropriations from being used to \"implement, administer, enforce, or further\" any provision of the ACA, with limited exceptions (\u00c2\u00a7527). The Senate bill did not include comparable provisions.  Note that amounts in this section are based on regular LHHS appropriations only. They do not include mandatory funds provided outside of the annual appropriations process (e.g., direct appropriations for the Federal Direct Student Loan program and the mandatory portion of the Federal Pell Grant program). Amounts are rounded to the nearest million or billion (as labeled). The dollar and percentage changes discussed are based on unrounded amounts. For consistency with source materials, amounts do not reflect sequestration or reestimates of mandatory spending programs, where applicable.  Federal policymakers established the U.S. Department of Education (ED) in 1980. Its mission is to \"promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.\" Typically, about three-quarters of ED's discretionary appropriations go either to local educational agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094which primarily use the funds to provide educational and related services for economically disadvantaged students and students with disabilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094or to low-income postsecondary students in the form of Pell Grants, which help pay for college. The remainder of ED's discretionary budget provides for a wide range of activities, including (but not limited to) support for minority-serving institutions; educational research; and career, technical, and adult education. The federal government provides roughly 7% of overall funding for elementary and secondary education in the United States. The majority of school funding\u00e2\u0080\u0094about 83%\u00e2\u0080\u0094comes from states and local districts, which have primary responsibility for the provision of elementary and secondary education. With regard to higher education, the federal government provided roughly 61% of undergraduate and graduate student aid in academic year (AY) 2017-2018.  Table 8 displays FY2019 discretionary and mandatory ED budget authority provided and proposed, along with FY2018 enacted levels. Discretionary funds represent the majority of ED's annual appropriations, accounting for roughly 95% of the FY2018 and FY2019 enacted levels. The FY2019 enacted discretionary ED appropriations were 0.8% higher than FY2018 levels. Proposed discretionary ED appropriations for FY2019 compared to FY2018 would have decreased under the President's budget (-10.8%) and increased slightly under the Senate floor and House committee bills (+0.8 and +0.2, respectively).  The following sections highlight FY2019 appropriations for selected ED accounts and programs. Table 9 tracks funding levels for major ED budget and appropriations accounts. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus appropriated nearly $1.3 billion for career and technical education, a 5.8% increase from the FY2018 level of $1.2 billion. The President's budget requested approximately $1.1 billion for CTE. The Senate bill would have kept CTE funding at the FY2018 level, whereas the House committee bill would have appropriated just over $1.3 billion.  The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins Act) is the primary federal law aimed at developing and supporting career and technical education (CTE) programs at the secondary and postsecondary educational levels. Recipients of Perkins funds are required to use those funds for a variety of purposes that help CTE students attain technical skills and earn an industry-recognized credential, certificate, or a postsecondary degree. Prior to the 115 th Congress, the Perkins Act had most recently been reauthorized in 2006 by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins IV; P.L. 109-270 ). In 2018, the Perkins Act was comprehensively reauthorized once again through the passage of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21 st Century Act (Perkins V; P.L. 115-224 ). Perkins V was signed into law by President Trump on July 31, 2018, and went into effect on July 1, 2019.  The Pell Grant program within the Student Financial Assistance account provides need-based financial aid primarily to low-income undergraduate students to help them cover the cost of higher education. Pell Grants are the largest single source of federal grant aid for undergraduate students; they are projected to provide approximately $30 billion in aid to roughly 7.6 million undergraduate students in the 2019-2020 award year. The FY2019 enacted discretionary appropriation of $22.5 billion provided level funding compared to FY2018. The President's budget, the Senate bill, and the House committee bill all proposed level funding. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus increased the discretionary maximum Pell Grant award level to $5,135, which is $100 higher than the FY2018 level. The Senate bill recommended that same amount. The House committee bill did not recommend an increase. The President's budget, which was released before the FY2018 appropriations were finalized, requested the same discretionary maximum Pell Grant award level as in FY2017: $4,860.  The total maximum Pell Grant award is the sum of the discretionary maximum award level and the mandatory add-on award level. The discretionary award program costs may be funded through (1) annual discretionary appropriations; (2) a permanent, definite mandatory appropriation; and (3) the Pell Grant program surplus. The mandatory add-on award program costs are funded by a permanent, indefinite mandatory appropriation. Both mandatory appropriation sources are provided outside the annual appropriations process, are authorized by and funded in the Higher Education Act (HEA), and do not appear in Table 9 . As a result of Pell Grant award rules established in the HEA, the increase in the discretionary maximum Pell Grant award level increases FY2019 program costs, assuming no other changes. In order to pay for the estimated increase in FY2019 mandatory add-on award program costs, the LHHS omnibus reduced the FY2019 definite mandatory appropriation from $1.409 billion to $1.370 billion (\u00c2\u00a7311). The Senate bill would have reduced the FY2019 definite mandatory appropriation by the same amount, while the House committee bill would not have reduced it. (The President's budget also proposed a reduction in the FY2019 definite mandatory appropriation, but that reduction was to fund a policy proposal that was subsequently implemented by the FY2018 appropriations act.) The FY2019 LHHS omnibus implemented another provision related to the Pell Grant program surplus: it rescinded $600 million of the surplus, which offset the cost of appropriations in the act.  ED collects and processes information from prospective postsecondary students to determine eligibility for federal loans, grants, and other types of financial aid using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Through the FAFSA, students provide information on income, assets, and other characteristics. The Higher Education Act (HEA) permits student information from the FAFSA to be shared with state agencies and institutions of higher education to help determine federal and nonfederal aid.  The FY2019 LHHS omnibus included a general provision authorizing institutions of higher education to share, with the applicant's explicit written consent, information collected from the FAFSA with a scholarship granting organization or an organization assisting the applicant in applying for and receiving federal, state, local, or tribal assistance (\u00c2\u00a7312). The omnibus prohibits organizations that receive such information from selling or otherwise sharing it. The omnibus specifies that this provision is to remain in effect until Title IV of the HEA is reauthorized.  Note that all amounts in this section are based on regular LHHS appropriations only; they do not include funds provided outside of the annual appropriations process (e.g., mandatory appropriations for Social Security benefit payments). All amounts in this section are rounded to the nearest million or billion (as labeled). The dollar changes and percentage changes in the text are based on unrounded amounts. For consistency with source materials, amounts do not reflect sequestration or reestimates of mandatory spending programs, where applicable.  Table 10 displays FY2019 proposed and enacted funding levels for LHHS related agencies, along with FY2018 enacted levels. In general, discretionary funds constitute about 20% of total appropriations for LHHS related agencies each year. The FY2019 omnibus increased discretionary appropriations for related agencies by about 0.1% compared to FY2018. The President's budget and the House committee bill would have decreased discretionary appropriations for related agencies by about 14.0% and 2.2%, respectively, while the Senate-passed bill would have increased such appropriations by 0.5%. The largest share of funding appropriated to related agencies in the LHHS bill consistently goes to the Social Security Administration (SSA). When taking into account both mandatory and discretionary funding, SSA usually represents roughly 97% of total appropriations to related agencies in the LHHS bill. The bulk of mandatory funding provided to SSA from the LHHS bill supports the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which provides means-tested cash assistance to disabled adults and children and to seniors aged 65 or older.  When looking exclusively at discretionary funding, SSA received 84.7% of discretionary appropriations for LHHS related agencies in the FY2019 LHHS omnibus. After SSA, the next-largest related agency in terms of appropriations is usually the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), which accounted for about 1.5% of total appropriations and 7.1% of discretionary appropriations to LHHS related agencies in FY2019. Typically, each of the remaining related agencies receives less than $1 billion from the annual LHHS appropriations bill. For more information, see Table 11 . The following sections highlight FY2019 appropriations issues for selected related agencies. Table 11 tracks funding levels for these related agencies. The SSA LAE account consists mainly of funds that are used by SSA to administer the Social Security and SSI programs and to support CMS in administering portions of Medicare. The account also contains funds that are specifically set aside for certain program integrity activities, such as continuing disability reviews (CDRs) and SSI nonmedical redeterminations. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $12.9 billion to the LAE account, which was a slight increase (+$2 million) over the FY2018 enacted level. The President's request would have provided about $482 million less (-3.7%) for the LAE account relative to FY2018. The Senate-passed bill would have increased LAE funding by $77 million (+0.6%) compared to FY2018, while the House committee bill would have decreased LAE funding by $318 million (-2.5%).  Of the $12.9 billion provided to the LAE account for FY2019, nearly $1.7 billion (13.1%) was dedicated to program integrity activities. The program integrity portion of the LAE account included $273 million in \"base\" funding subject to the discretionary spending caps established by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as well as additional funding that was effectively exempt from those caps and subject to an annual limit (\"cap adjustment funding\"; see Appendix A for further information). The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $1.4 billion in cap adjustment funding, which was the maximum amount permitted for FY2019. However, because federal law allowed more cap adjustment funding for FY2018 than for FY2019, the combined amount of program integrity funding enacted for FY2019 was $52 million (-3.0%) less than the combined amount enacted for FY2018. All three proposals would have also provided the maximum amount of cap adjustment funding permitted for FY2019.  The CNCS is an independent federal agency that administers a variety of national and community service programs, such as AmeriCorps and the National Senior Volunteer Corps. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $1.1 billion in total CNCS funding, a $19 million (+1.8%) increase over the FY2018 enacted level. The FY2019 President's budget had requested $123 million (-88.5%) for CNCS, noting that these funds would be used to execute an orderly shutdown of CNCS operations, with the agency's closure slated to be complete by the end of FY2019. Both the House committee bill and the Senate-passed bill declined the President's proposal, with the House proposing to retain CNCS funding at its FY2018 level of $1.1 billion (0.0%), while the Senate-passed bill would have modestly reduced agency funding by $6 million (-0.5%). The NLRB is an independent board that enforces provisions in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The FY2019 LHHS omnibus maintained the FY2018 funding levels for the NLRB of $274 million. The FY2019 President's budget and the House committee bill would have decreased funding for the NLRB by $25 million (-9.2%) and by $13 million (-4.7%), respectively, while the Senate-passed bill would have provided the same amount as FY2018. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus retained a provision that has been included in the LHHS bill since FY2012 that prohibits any funds appropriated to the NLRB in the bill, or any prior appropriations act, from being used to issue a directive or regulation to provide employees a means of voting through any electronic method in an election determining representation for collective bargaining (\u00c2\u00a7407). The FY2019 LHHS omnibus, however, did not include two NRLB-related provisions proposed by the House committee bill that would have prohibited any funds made available by the bill from being used to issue, enforce, or litigate any administrative action related to changing the interpretation or application of the \"joint employer\" standard in effect as of January 1, 2014 (\u00c2\u00a7408 of H.R. 6470 ) ; and prohibited any funds made available by the bill from being used to enforce the NLRA against any Indian tribe (\u00c2\u00a7409 of H.R. 6470 ). Appendix A. Budget Enforcement Activities The framework for budget enforcement under the congressional budget process has both statutory and procedural elements. The statutory elements include the discretionary spending limits and mandatory spending sequester derived from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177 ). The procedural elements are primarily associated with the budget resolution and limit both total discretionary spending and spending under the jurisdiction of each appropriations subcommittee.  Readers should note that the statutory budget enforcement requirements that apply to FY2019 discretionary spending under the BCA were altered the prior fiscal year by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123 ), which was enacted on February 9, 2018. This law increased the defense and nondefense discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019, and extended mandatory spending sequestration through FY2027.  Budget Control Act and Sequestration The BCA provides budget process mechanisms to reduce mandatory spending and further reduce discretionary spending over an extended period. For mandatory spending, reductions are to occur through sequestration in each of fiscal years between FY2013-FY2027. For discretionary spending, reductions occurred through sequestration in FY2013, but are to be achieved through lower discretionary spending limits for each of the fiscal years between FY2014-FY2021. The BCA does not require a sequester of discretionary spending in FY2014-FY2021 unless one or both of the statutory discretionary spending limits (defense and nondefense) is breached. Only discretionary spending subject to a given spending limit is affected by a breach of that limit, and the LHHS bill only includes funding in the nondefense category.  FY2019 On February 12, 2018, concurrent with the release of the President's budget, President Trump issued the required FY2019 sequestration order, calling for nonexempt mandatory spending to be reduced on October 1, 2018. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated that the FY2019 sequestration percentages would equal 2% of nonexempt Medicare spending and 6.2% of other nonexempt nondefense mandatory spending, for a total reduction of $19 billion in FY2019. (OMB also estimated an 8.7% reduction, totaling $809 million, in nonexempt defense mandatory spending, which does not affect LHHS funds.)  With regard to discretionary spending, the FY2019 statutory spending limits as specified in BBA 2018 were $647 billion for defense spending and $597 billion for nondefense spending; each of these levels was $18 billion more than their respective FY2018 limits. Once all annual appropriations acts were enacted for FY2019 and allowable adjustments to the spending limits were made, OMB determined that those appropriations did not violate either the defense or the nondefense limit. Cap Adjustments, Exemptions, and Special Rules The BCA allows for certain adjustments to the discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021. For LHHS, the BCA as originally enacted allowed increases to the nondefense limit (up to a point) to accommodate new budget authority for specified program integrity initiatives at HHS and the Social Security Administration (SSA). The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-74 ) amended the list of SSA activities that may be covered by this \"cap adjustment\" to include costs associated with work-related continuing disability reviews, Cooperative Disability Investigations, and fraud prosecutions by Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 also revised the amount of the allowable SSA adjustment amounts to be more generous in FY2017-FY2019 compared to what was previously allowed, but less generous in FY2021. The BBA 2018 added a new cap adjustment that also involves a LHHS activity. This new cap adjustment allows increases to the nondefense limit (up to a point) to accommodate new budget authority for the DOL to help fund the reemployment services and eligibility assessments conducted by the states related to unemployment compensation.  Separate from these cap adjustments, the 21 st Century Cures Act (Cures Act, P.L. 114-255 ), which was enacted on December 13, 2016, included additional budget enforcement procedures related to the discretionary spending limits. These procedures originally applied to two accounts within the scope of the LHHS bill: the NIH Innovation Account and the Account for the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis. For FY2019, the NIH Innovation Account was the only LHHS funding to be subject to the Cures Act budget enforcement procedures.  The Cures Act created the NIH Innovation and State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis accounts and authorized appropriations from them for specific fiscal years (FY2017-FY2026 for the NIH Innovation Account and FY2017-FY2018 for the Account for the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis). The Cures Act further provided that subsequent discretionary appropriations from these accounts (up to the amounts authorized for each fiscal year) are to be subtracted from any cost estimates provided for purposes of budget controls. The Cures Act ensured that appropriations from these accounts will not count against any spending limits, such as the statutory discretionary spending limits imposed by the BCA; that is, the amounts appropriated from these accounts will be considered to be outside those limits.  An additional set of statutory exemptions and special rules that apply to sequestration are relevant for the LHHS bill. The LHHS bill contains several programs that are exempt from sequestration, including Medicaid, payments to health care trust funds, Supplemental Security Income, Special Benefits for Disabled Coal Miners, retirement pay and medical benefits for commissioned Public Health Service officers, foster care and adoption assistance, and certain family support payments. The LHHS bill also contains several programs that are subject to special rules under sequestration, such as unemployment compensation, certain student loans, health centers, and portions of Medicare. Budget Resolution and 302(b) Suballocations The procedural elements of budget enforcement generally stem from requirements under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-44 ) that are associated with the adoption of an annual budget resolution. Through this process, the Appropriations Committee in each chamber receives a procedural limit on the total amount of discretionary budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year, referred to as a 302(a) allocation. The Appropriations Committee subsequently divides this allocation among its 12 subcommittees. These subcommittee-level spending limits are referred to as 302(b) suballocations. The 302(b) suballocations restrict the amount of budget authority available to each subcommittee for the agencies, projects, and activities under its jurisdiction, effectively acting as a cap on each of the 12 regular appropriations bills. Enforcement of the 302(a) allocation and 302(b) suballocations occurs through points of order. For the FY2019 appropriations cycle, the House and the Senate did not adopt a budget resolution. Instead, the House and Senate both used authority granted in the BBA 2018 for the Budget Committee chair in each chamber to file enforceable budgetary levels for FY2019. In line with these budgetary levels, the House Appropriations Committee adopted its initial suballocations on May 10, 2018 ( H.Rept. 115-710 ), while the Senate Appropriations Committee adopted its initial suballocations on May 24, 2018 ( S.Rept. 115-260 ). (As the FY2019 appropriations process was underway, both committees periodically updated these suballocations to align them with changing congressional priorities.) For current-year LHHS discretionary funding, Table A-1 displays FY2018 enacted levels, the House and the Senate FY2019 initial suballocations, and enacted FY2019 LHHS appropriations. The table shows that the House initially would have kept regular LHHS appropriations at a flat level compared to the prior fiscal year, whereas the Senate would have increased those appropriations by about $2.1 billion relative to FY2018 (+1%). Ultimately, final enacted appropriations were a little less than $1 billion higher than the prior fiscal year.  The table also displays funding for which adjustments may be made to the discretionary spending limits under the BCA, including funding for certain LHHS program integrity activities and emergency requirements, where applicable. The \"adjusted appropriations\" total includes this funding. Note that compliance with discretionary spending allocations is evaluated based on budget authority available in the current fiscal year , adjusted for scorekeeping by CBO. As such, totals shown in this table may not be comparable to other totals shown in this report. Current-year budget authority totals exclude advance appropriations for future years, but include advance appropriations from prior years that become available in the current year. (Advance appropriations are provided to selected LHHS accounts, generally in order to manage specific planning concerns and ensure continuity of operations at the start of a new fiscal year.) Current-Year Budget Authority  Table A-2 displays the total LHHS current-year budget authority, by title. The amounts shown in this table reflect total budget authority available for obligation in the fiscal year, regardless of the year in which it was first appropriated. Amounts in the FY2018 enacted column include FY2018 budget authority provided by the FY2016 omnibus ( P.L. 114-113 ) and FY2017 omnibus ( P.L. 115-31 ). Similarly, the FY2019 President's budget, House committee, Senate floor, and enacted columns include FY2019 budget authority provided by the FY2017 and FY2018 omnibuses. (For a comparable table showing total budget authority in the bill, rather than current-year budget authority, see Table 2 in this report.) As mentioned above, it is current-year budget authority (adjusted for scorekeeping by CBO) that is used to determine compliance with discretionary spending allocations.  Appendix B. Senate Floor Amendments Offered to H.R. 6157 While the Senate committee-reported version of the LHHS bill ( S. 3158 ) did not receive floor consideration, the text of this measure (with minor alterations) was included in a different appropriations vehicle ( H.R. 6157 ) that was amended on the floor and passed by the Senate on August 23, 2018. Prior to Senate floor consideration, H.R. 6157 contained the text of the FY2019 Department of Defense appropriations only. On the floor, that bill was amended into an omnibus measure that contained appropriations for both the Department of Defense and LHHS.  The Senate proceeded to consider H.R. 6157 by unanimous consent on August 16, 2018. At that point, Senator Shelby (the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee) offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute containing Department of Defense appropriations in Division A, and LHHS appropriations in Division B ( S.Amdt. 3695 ). On August 21, a cloture motion on the measure was presented in the Senate, but a subsequent unanimous consent agreement provided, among other matters, for the Senate to adopt a manager's package comprised of dozens of amendments to the substitute amendment, adopt the substitute amendment (as amended), and then proceed to a vote without the need to invoke cloture. The Senate passed the bill, as amended, by a vote of 85-7. Over the course of Senate floor consideration, a total of 32 LHHS amendments were offered to Division B. Twenty-nine of these were adopted by unanimous consent en bloc as part of the manager's package. Of the three that received recorded votes, two were adopted and one was rejected. These amendments and their dispositions are listed in Table B-1 below. "
