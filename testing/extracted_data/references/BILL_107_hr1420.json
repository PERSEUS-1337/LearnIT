SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional \nHunger Fellows Act of 2001''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) There is a critical need for compassionate individuals \n        who are committed to assisting people who suffer from hunger as \n        well as a need for such individuals to initiate and administer \n        solutions to the hunger problem.\n            (2) Bill Emerson, the distinguished late Representative \n        from the 8th District of Missouri, demonstrated his commitment \n        to solving the problem of hunger in a bipartisan manner, his \n        commitment to public service, and his great affection for the \n        institution and the ideals of the United States Congress.\n            (3) George T. (Mickey) Leland, the distinguished late \n        Representative from the 18th District of Texas, demonstrated \n        his compassion for those in need, his high regard for public \n        service, and his lively exercise of political talents.\n            (4) The special concern that Mr. Emerson and Mr. Leland \n        demonstrated during their lives for the hungry and poor was an \n        inspiration for others to work toward the goals of equality and \n        justice for all.\n            (5) These two outstanding leaders maintained a special bond \n        of friendship regardless of political affiliation and worked \n        together to encourage future leaders to recognize and provide \n        service to others, and therefore it is especially appropriate \n        to honor the memory of Mr. Emerson and Mr. Leland by creating a \n        fellowship program to develop and train the future leaders of \n        the United States to pursue careers in humanitarian service.\n\nSEC. 2.
