    "content": "Natural disasters can have varying effects on the landscape. For agricultural producers, natural disasters are part of the inherent risk of doing business. The federal role for mitigating weather risk is primarily through federal crop insurance and a suite of agricultural disaster assistance programs to address a producer's crop or livestock production loss.  Other, separate U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs are designed to repair agricultural and forest land following a natural disaster and potentially mitigate future risk. These programs offer financial and technical assistance to producers to repair, restore, and mitigate damage on private land. Agricultural land assistance programs include the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP), the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP), and the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program. In addition to these programs, USDA also has flexibility in administering other programs that allow for support and repair of damaged cropland in the event of an emergency. This report describes these emergency agricultural land assistance programs. It presents background on the programs\u2014purpose, activities, authority, eligibility requirements, and authorized program funding levels\u2014as well as current congressional issues. Agricultural land assistance programs help producers rehabilitate crop and forest land following natural disasters. These programs are described below. The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) assists landowners in restoring land used in agricultural production when damaged by a natural disaster. This can include removing debris, restoring fences and conservation structures, and providing water for livestock in drought situations. Restoration practices are authorized by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) county committee, with approval from state FSA committees, and the FSA national office. Payments are made to individual producers based on a share of the cost of completing the practice. This can be up to 75% of the cost, or up to 90% of the cost if the producer is considered to be a limited-resources producer. Payments are made following completion and inspection of the practice. The ECP was created under Title IV of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-334 ) and codified at 16 U.S.C. Sections 2201-2205. The program is permanently authorized, subject to appropriations. Authorized funding is for \"such funds as may be necessary,\" and once appropriated, funds are typically available until expended. Land eligibility is determined by the FSA county committee except in the event of a drought, in which case the national FSA office authorizes the use of funds. Following an on-site inspection, the land may be considered eligible if it is determined that the lack of treatment would:  impair or endanger the land; materially affect the productive capacity of the land; lead to damage that is unusual in character and, except for wind erosion, is not the type that would recur frequently in the same area; and be so costly to rehabilitate that future federal assistance is or would be required to return the land to productive agricultural use. Land conservation issues that existed prior to the natural disaster are not eligible for assistance. An eligible participant is defined as an agricultural producer with an interest in the land affected by the natural disaster. The applicant must be a landowner or user in the area where the disaster occurred and must be a party who will incur the expense that is the subject of the ECP cost-share application. Participants are limited to $200,000 per natural disaster. Federal agencies and states, including all agencies and political subdivisions of a state, are ineligible to participate in ECP. Funding for ECP varies widely from year to year. Most funding is authorized through supplemental appropriations acts rather than annual appropriations. Table 1 provides a funding history for ECP. Funding is generally appropriated to remain available until expended. In some instances, Congress has required that ECP funding be used for specific disasters, activities, or locations. For example, a portion of funding appropriated in FY2016 is to be used for major disasters declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act). Since ECP does not typically require a Stafford Act declaration, this requirement limits the use of ECP funds to select locations as well as for future disasters. For further discussion, see the \" Issues for Congress \" section. Once funding is appropriated, the FSA national office generally allocates ECP funds to the FSA state offices. The local FSA county committees will then obligate the funds on a first-come, first-served basis. The Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) provides cost-share assistance to private forestland owners to repair and rehabilitate damage caused by natural disasters on nonindustrial private forest land. Natural disasters include wildfires, hurricanes or excessive winds, drought, ice storms or blizzards, floods, or other resource-impacting events, as determined by USDA. The program is administered by FSA.  FSA may provide up to 75% of the cost of emergency measures that would restore forest health and forest-related resources following a disaster. Individual or cumulative requests for financial assistance of $50,000 or less per person (or legal entity) per disaster are approved by the FSA county committee. Financial assistance requests from $50,001 to $100,000 are approved by the FSA state committee. Financial assistance over $100,000 must be approved by the FSA national office.  The EFRP was created under Section 8203 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 farm bill, P.L. 110-246 ), by adding a new Section 407 to Title IV of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978. It is codified at 16 U.S.C. Section 2206 and is permanently authorized subject to appropriations. Authorized funding is for \"such funds as may be necessary,\" and once appropriated, funds are typically available until expended.  For land to be eligible for EFRP, it must be nonindustrial private forest land and must:  have existing tree cover or have had tree cover immediately before the natural disaster and be suitable for growing trees; have damage to natural resources caused by a natural disaster, which occurred on or after January 1, 2010, that, if not treated, would impair or endanger the natural resources on the land and would materially affect future use of the land; and be physically located in a county in which EFRP has been implemented. Land is ineligible if it is owned or controlled by the federal government, a state, a state agency, or a political subdivision of a state. Eligible recipients include owners of nonindustrial private forest land, defined as rural land that is owned by any nonindustrial private individual, group, association, corporation, or other private legal entity that has definitive decision making authority over the land. A payment limitation of $500,000 per person or legal entity applies per disaster. The EFRP was created in the 2008 farm bill. Congress initially appropriated $18 million to the program in an FY2010 supplemental appropriations act. Funds were not obligated, however, until FY2011, when final regulations were published. Table 2 provides a funding history for EFRP. The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program assists sponsors, landowners, and operators in implementing emergency recovery measures for runoff retardation and erosion prevention to relieve imminent hazards to life and property created by natural disasters. Eligible activities may include removing debris from stream channels, road culverts, and bridges; reshaping and protecting eroded banks; correcting damaged drainage facilities; establishing cover on critically eroding lands; removing carcasses; and repairing levees and structures. EWP funds cannot be used to perform operation or maintenance for existing structures or to repair, rebuild, or maintain private or public transportation facilities or public utilities. The EWP is administered by both USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The federal contribution toward the implementation of emergency measures may not exceed 75% of the construction cost. This can be raised to 90% if the area is considered to be a limited-resource area.  The EWP was created under Title IV of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-334 ) and codified at 16 U.S.C. Sections 2203-2205. The program is permanently authorized, subject to appropriations. Authorized funding is for \"such funds as may be necessary,\" and once appropriated, funds are typically available until expended. Private, state, tribal, and federal lands are eligible for EWP. EWP is administered by NRCS on state, tribal, and private lands and by USFS on National Forest System lands. EWP assistance funded by NRCS may not be provided on any federal lands if the assistance would augment the appropriations of another federal agency. All projects under EWP must have a sponsor. Sponsors must be a state or political subdivision, qualified Indian tribe or tribal organization, or unit of local government. Private entities or individuals may receive assistance only through the sponsorship of a governmental entity. Sponsors are responsible for: obtaining necessary land rights and permits to do repair work; providing the nonfederal portion of cost-share assistance; completing the installation of all emergency measures; and carrying out any operation and maintenance responsibilities that may be required. Funding for EWP varies widely from year to year ( Table 3 ). Most funding is authorized through supplemental appropriations acts rather than annual appropriations. NRCS provides assistance based upon a determination by the NRCS state conservationist that the current condition of the land or watershed impairment poses a threat to health, life, or property. Sponsors must submit a formal request to the NRCS state conservationist within 60 days of the natural disaster or 60 days from the date when access to the site becomes available. No later than 60 days from receipt of the request, the state conservationist will investigate the situation and prepare an initial cost estimate to be forwarded to the NRCS national office. Before release of any funds, the project sponsor must sign a cooperative agreement with NRCS that details the responsibilities of the sponsor (e.g., funding, operation, and maintenance). No funding is provided for activities undertaken before the cooperative agreement is signed. Approval of funding is based on the following rank order: exigency situations; sites where there is a serious (but not immediate) threat to human life; and sites where buildings, utilities, or other important infrastructure components are threatened. Floodplain easements under EWP are administered separately from the general EWP program. The easements are meant to safeguard lives and property from future floods, drought, and the consequences of erosion through the restoration and preservation of the land's natural values. USDA holds all EWP floodplain easements in perpetuity. Floodplain easements are purchased as an emergency measure and on a voluntary basis. If a landowner offers to sell a permanent conservation easement, then NRCS has the full authority to restore and enhance the floodplain's functions and values. This includes removing all structures, including buildings, within the easement boundaries and providing up to 100% of restoration costs. In exchange, the landowner receives the smallest of the three following values as an easement payment:  1. a geographic area rate established by the NRCS state conservationist; 2. the fair-market value based on an area-wide market analysis or an appraisal completed according to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP); or 3. the landowner's offer.  Section 382 of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (1996 farm bill, P.L. 104-127 ) amended the EWP authorization to include the purchase of floodplain easements. Prior to this amendment, NRCS had been directed in a 1993 emergency supplemental appropriations act ( P.L. 103-75 ) to use EWP funds for the purchase of floodplain easements under the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP)\u2014a farm bill program for restoring wetlands through the voluntary purchase of long-term and permanent easements on agricultural land. This became known as the Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program, which purchased floodplain easements on cropland with a history of flooding in the 1993 and 1995 Midwest flooding events. Following the 1996 farm bill amendment, NRCS began an EWP floodplain easement pilot program in 17 states in FY1997.  The Agricultural Act of 2014 (2014 farm bill, P.L. 113-79 ) amended the floodplain easement section of the EWP program to allow USDA to modify or terminate floodplain easements when the landowner agrees and the change \"addresses a compelling public need for which there is no practical alternative, and is in the public interest.\" Modification or termination requires a compensatory arrangement determined by USDA. Similar to the general EWP program, EWP floodplain easements are authorized under Title IV of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-334 ) and codified at 16 U.S.C. Sections 2203-2205. The authorization of appropriations is for \"such funds as may be necessary\" and does not expire. Lands are considered eligible for an EWP floodplain easement if they are: floodplain lands that were damaged by flooding at least once within the previous calendar year or have been subject to flood damage at least twice within the previous 10 years; other lands within the floodplain that would contribute to the restoration of the flood storage and flow, erosion control, or would improve the practical management of the easement; or lands that would be inundated or adversely impacted as a result of a dam breach. Land is considered ineligible if: restoration practices would be futile due to \"on-site\" or \"off-site\" conditions; the land is subject to an existing easement or deed restriction that provides sufficient protection or restoration of the floodplain's functions and values; or the purchase of an easement would not meet the purposes of the program. EWP participants must have ownership of the land. Unlike the general EWP program, EWP floodplain easements do not require a project sponsor.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) provided $290 million to Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, of which half ($145 million) was to be used for the purchase and restoration of EWP floodplain easements. Per requirements in ARRA, the funding was obligated by FY2011. Additional funding following Hurricane Sandy resulted in two EWP floodplain easement sign ups, which funded 246 applications on over 1,000 acres of eligible land. Through the end of 2016, NRCS reported enrolling a total of 1,586 easements on 184,911 acres, as well as 1,573 closed and restored easements on 184,423 acres. Emergency disaster (EM) loans are available through the FSA when a county has been declared a disaster area by either the President or the Secretary of Agriculture. Agricultural producers in the declared county and contiguous to the county may become eligible for low-interest EM loans. EM loan funds may be used to help eligible farmers, ranchers, and aquaculture producers recover from production losses (when the producer suffers a significant loss of an annual crop) or from physical losses (such as repairing or replacing damaged or destroyed structures or equipment or replanting permanent crops such as orchards). A qualified applicant can then borrow up to 100% of actual production or physical losses (not to exceed $500,000) at low interest rates. In addition to the authorized land assistance programs, USDA uses a number of existing conservation programs to assist with rehabilitating land following natural disasters. In many cases this assistance comes through the use of waivers and flexibility provided to the Secretary of Agriculture. The following section discusses programs recently used by USDA to offer assistance. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) provides annual payments to agricultural producers to take highly erodible and environmentally sensitive land out of production and install resource-conserving practices for 10 or more years. In limited situations, harvesting and grazing may be conducted on CRP land in response to drought or other emergencies (except during primary nesting season for birds). In many cases environmentally sensitive land is ineligible for harvesting and grazing. Emergency harvesting and grazing is authorized by the national FSA office at the request of a county FSA committee. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is a voluntary program that provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers to address natural resource concerns on agricultural and forest land. USDA has recently announced a special EQIP signup for farmers and ranchers in hurricane-affected areas. EQIP may also be used to proactively mitigate potential damage from natural disasters through the use of conservation practices (e.g., residue management to improve the soil's capacity to be more drought-resilient, or vegetative buffer strips along waterways to reduce erosion and crop damage in the event of a flood). Historically, the majority of emergency assistance for agriculture was funded through supplemental appropriations or as an add-on to regular annual appropriations. A supplemental appropriation provides additional budget authority during the current fiscal year either to finance activities not funded in the regular appropriation or to provide funds when the regular appropriation is deemed insufficient. Since most agricultural land assistance programs do not receive the level of attention that triggers a standalone supplemental appropriation bill, annual appropriation bills are increasingly seen as a vehicle for funding these programs. The change in funding mechanism from standalone supplemental appropriations to annual appropriations has presented a challenge for agricultural land assistance programs. The timing of annual appropriations bills may not coincide with natural disasters and the subsequent requests for assistance. This can increase the time between eligible disasters and funding availability. Disaster funds are typically provided to remain available until expended, which has allowed smaller, more localized disasters to be addressed in years without appropriations. However, despite this flexibility, the inconsistent funding has left some agricultural land assistance programs without funding during times of high request volume. Beginning in the 2008 farm bill, and continued in the 2014 farm bill, Congress authorized a series of permanent disaster assistance programs that receive mandatory funding, rather than relying on supplemental appropriations. These programs assist with crop and livestock production loss and are generally authorized at funding amounts that are \"such sums as necessary\" and by their mandatory nature are not subject to annual appropriations. For the three agricultural land rehabilitation programs discussed in this report, however, funding remains discretionary and is provided on an ad hoc basis.  The variability of funding for agricultural land rehabilitation has led some to suggest that these programs have been left behind in favor of providing assistance for crop and livestock production loss rather than for land rehabilitation and natural resources degradation. Some have suggested that the use of permanent mandatory funding could be expanded beyond production to include land rehabilitation assistance. Others point out that permanent mandatory funding would be difficult to achieve in the current fiscal climate.  The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ) limits emergency supplemental funding for disaster relief. Under Section 251(b)(2)(D) of the BCA, funding used for disaster relief must be used for activities carried out pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act, P.L. 93-288 ) for FY2012 through FY2021. This means funds appropriated through emergency supplemental acts for disaster relief through FY2021 may apply only to activities with a Stafford Act declaration.  In recent years, agricultural land rehabilitation programs have received funding through annual appropriations. However, it is still considered supplemental in nature and, in some cases, classified as disaster relief. When classified as disaster relief, the funds must be used for a major disaster declared pursuant to the Stafford Act. Since emergency agricultural land assistance programs do not normally require a federal disaster declaration from either the President or a state official, the Stafford Act requirement has become a limiting factor in the way agricultural land assistance programs work, potentially assisting fewer natural disaster events. For example, droughts are traditionally not declared as major disaster events under the Stafford Act. However, droughts are one of the eligible natural disasters for land assistance programs\u2014primarily to assist livestock producers to provide water to animals. Since agricultural land assistance program funds are typically available until expended, the Stafford Act requirement also limits what areas may receive future assistance with any remaining funding. For example, the FY2016 appropriated levels classify only a portion of the funding provided as disaster relief and therefore subject to the requirements of the BCA and the Stafford Act. The remaining funds are not considered disaster relief for budget scoring purposes and are therefore appropriated within the regular limitations of the current budget agreement. These funds are not subject to a Stafford Act declaration and may be used according to the authorities of the program. Another contentious issue for federal land assistance programs is mitigation. Mitigation actions are steps taken to reduce risk before a natural disaster occurs. Currently only one mitigation program exists for emergency agricultural land assistance\u2014the EWP floodplain easement program (described above). This program purchases floodplain easements on agricultural land that has a history of flooding (two of the previous 10 years). Under the program, the land is permanently taken out of production and restored to a natural function. This program has been authorized since 1997. However, prohibitions in appropriations acts have limited available funding for the program. Some have questioned the use of federal restoration funds in areas with a high risk of damage by natural disasters, arguing that it encourages poor land use decisions. While the alternative of mitigation can potentially reduce the future cost of federal assistance, the initial cost of the permanent easement and restoration is sometimes viewed as too expensive a federal cost."
