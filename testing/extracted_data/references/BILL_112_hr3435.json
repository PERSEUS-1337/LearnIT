FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Department of Defense conducted a survey of members \n        of the Armed Forces serving on active duty that revealed that \n        only 13.5 percent of such members reported incidents of sexual \n        assault, which means that more than 19,000 incidents of sexual \n        assault of members of the Armed Forces actually occurred in \n        2010 alone.\n            (2) Despite modest attempts, the Department of Defense has \n        failed to address the chronic under reporting of incidents of \n        sexual assault and harassment, as by the Department's own \n        estimates, 86 percent of sexual assaults went unreported in \n        2010.\n            (3) The military adjudication system itself lacks \n        independence, as military judges depend on command, and members \n        of the Armed Forces have only limited access to civilian courts \n        to address their grievances.\n            (4) The Cox Commission, sponsored by the National Institute \n        of Military Justice, as well as several other actors, have \n        consistently observed that the United States has fallen behind \n        countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom in terms of its \n        military justice system.\n            (5) The military atmosphere is not conducive to resolving \n        issues of sexual assault and harassment, and sexual violence \n        continues to infect the Armed Forces.\n            (6) The culture of the United States Armed Forces is based \n        on the chain of command. In a case of sexual assault, a \n        commander may be responsible for both the victim and the \n        offender, or both of their units, or the entire base or ship \n        where the offense occurred. Command discretion empowers a \n        commander to decide if the case goes forward to court martial. \n        The great deference afforded command discretion raises serious \n        concerns about conflicts of interest and the potential for \n        abuse of power.\n\nSEC. 3.
