FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the African American civil rights movement includes \n        historic events, court decisions, and legislation, the goals of \n        which were--\n                    (A) to end segregation based upon race;\n                    (B) to end discrimination against African \n                Americans; and\n                    (C) to ensure that African American citizens could \n                exercise their basic constitutional rights, including \n                the right to vote;\n            (2) the civil rights movement--\n                    (A) helped bridge the divides of race, religion, \n                sectional differences, and nationality;\n                    (B) spanned State lines; and\n                    (C) joined the ideals of liberty and freedom \n                expressed in the Declaration of Independence, the \n                Constitution, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n                U.S.C. 2000a et seq.) to the extraordinary actions of \n                ordinary men and women working in common purpose for \n                equal rights;\n            (3) the National Park Service and Organization of American \n        Historians conducted a theme study that identified and \n        interpreted sites related to the Civil Rights movement (Public \n        Law 106-113, Appendix C, ``The National Park System New Area of \n        Study Act of 2000'' [s. 1349]);\n            (4) in conducting the theme study referred to in paragraph \n        (3), the National Park Service and the Organization of American \n        Historians found that--\n                    (A) although many sites relating to the African \n                American civil rights movement have been identified and \n                recognized in existing National Park System units--\n                            (i) a number of sites relating to the \n                        African American civil rights movement have not \n                        been recognized;\n                            (ii) many sites relating to the African \n                        American civil rights movement are in imminent \n                        danger of being lost or destroyed; and\n                            (iii) many important resource types \n                        relating to the African American civil rights \n                        movement are not adequately represented and \n                        protected;\n                    (B) there are many important sites relating to the \n                African American civil rights movement that have high \n                potential for preservation and visitor use in a number \n                of States, the District of Columbia, and territories of \n                the United States;\n                    (C) no single site completely reflects and \n                characterizes the African American civil rights \n                movement, since the story of, and resources associated \n                with, the African American civil rights movement \n                involve networks, regions, and territories of the \n                United States rather than individual sites; and\n                    (D) the establishment of a variety of partnerships \n                among the Federal Government, State, and units of local \n                government, and the private sector would be most \n                appropriate for the protection, restoration, and \n                interpretation of the African American Civil Rights \n                Network;\n            (5) the National Park Service can play a vital role in \n        facilitating the creation and sustained success of the African \n        American Civil Rights Network; and\n            (6) the story and significance of the African American \n        civil rights movement can best engage the people of the United \n        States through a national program of the National Park Service \n        that links, in a unified and flexible manner--\n                    (A) historic buildings, structures, and sites \n                relating to the African American civil rights movement;\n                    (B) geographic areas relating to the African \n                American civil rights movement;\n                    (C) interpretive centers, museums, and institutions \n                relating to the African American civil rights movement; \n                and\n                    (D) programs, activities, community projects, \n                exhibits, and multimedia materials relating to the \n                African American civil rights movement.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to recognize--\n                    (A) the importance of the African American civil \n                rights movement; and\n                    (B) the sacrifices made by the people who fought \n                against discrimination and segregation; and\n            (2) to authorize the National Park Service to coordinate \n        and facilitate Federal and non-Federal activities to \n        commemorate, honor, and interpret--\n                    (A) the history of the African American civil \n                rights movement;\n                    (B) the significance of the civil rights movement \n                as a crucial element in the evolution of the Civil \n                Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.); and\n                    (C) the relevance of the African American civil \n                rights movement in fostering the spirit of social \n                justice and national reconciliation.\n\nSEC. 3.
