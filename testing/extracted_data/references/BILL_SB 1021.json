    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 3003.5 of the Penal Code is amended to read:\n3003.5.\n(a) Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of\nlaw, when a person is released on parole after having served a term of imprisonment in state prison for any offense for which registration is required pursuant to Section 290, that person may not, during the period of parole, reside in any\nsingle family\nsingle-family\ndwelling with any other person also required to register pursuant to Section 290, unless those persons are legally related by blood, marriage, or adoption. For purposes of this section,\n\u201csingle family\n\u201csingle-family\ndwelling\u201d shall not include a residential facility\nwhich\nthat\nserves six or fewer persons.\n(b)\n(1)\nNotwithstanding any other\nprovision of\nlaw, it is unlawful for any person\nconvicted of any of the offenses enumerated in Section 667.61 and\nfor whom registration is required pursuant to Section 290 to reside within\n2000\n2,000\nfeet of any public or private school, or park where children regularly gather.\nThe 2,000-foot residency restriction shall be measured by the shortest practical pedestrian or vehicle path.\n(2) The state parole authority shall enforce the residency restriction required pursuant to this section until the sex offender is discharged from parole unless any of the following occur:\n(A) The offender is subject to a greater preexisting residency restriction.\n(B) The residency restriction is modified within the county in which the offender resides as provided by Section 3003.51.\n(C) The residency restriction is found unconstitutional as applied within the county and no modified restriction can be constitutionally enforced.\n(3) Any person subject to the residency restriction imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) may, if compliance is not reasonably possible within his or her county, seek relief pursuant to Section 3003.51.\n(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit municipal jurisdictions from enacting local ordinances that further restrict the residency of any person for whom registration is required pursuant to Section 290.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 3003.51 is added to the Penal Code, to read:\n3003.51.\n(a) Any person prohibited pursuant to Section 3003.5 from living within 2,000 feet of any public or private school, or park where children regularly gather, may seek relief from those restrictions if he or she cannot comply with the restriction because of the unavailability of compliant housing within his or her county of domicile.\n(b) Any person seeking relief under this section may file a petition with the superior court of the county in which he or she resides. Notice of the petition shall be timely served on the state parole authority or other entity enforcing the subject sex offender residency restrictions.\n(c) Notwithstanding any other law, original jurisdiction for any petition filed pursuant to this section shall lie with the appellate division of the superior court in which the petition is filed. The court may consolidate all pending petitions.\n(d) The appellate division of the superior court in which the petition is filed pursuant to this section may grant the petition in whole or in part if the petitioner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence, and the court finds, each of the following:\n(1) There is a pervasive lack of compliant housing within the petitioner\u2019s county of domicile.\n(2) The petitioner is among a substantial proportion of sex offenders subject to the 2,000 foot residency restriction who have, despite good faith efforts, been unable to find compliant housing within the county.\n(3) The 2,000 foot restriction is the principal reason that those without a residence have been unable to find compliant housing.\n(e) (1) Relief granted pursuant to this section may modify residential distance restrictions to comport with the geographic constraints within the subject county but modifications shall be narrowly crafted in order to substantially comply with the intent of the people in approving Section 3003.5.\n(2) The court may, if necessary, bifurcate the application of residency restrictions so as to apply discrete restrictions to those who have been convicted of child molestation or other felony sex offenses involving victims under 18 years of age.\n(f) If relief is granted or denied pursuant to this section, no subsequent petition shall be heard, unless the petitioner or petitioners establish in the petition, to the satisfaction of the court, both of the following:\n(1) There has been a change of circumstances based upon a substantial decline in the availability of compliant housing.\n(2) There has been a corresponding increase in the percentage of sex offenders who are unable to comply with the residency restriction due to the change of circumstances described in paragraph (1) since the court ruling on the prior petition.\nSEC. 3.\nThis act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:\nIn order to protect the public at the earliest possible time, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately."
