FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n    Sections 2 and 3 of the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 (Public Law \n109-480; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note) is amended to read as follows:\n``SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n        ``(1) The Government of Belarus has engaged in a pattern of \n    clear and uncorrected violations of human rights and fundamental \n    freedoms.\n        ``(2) The Government of Belarus has engaged in a pattern of \n    clear and uncorrected violations of basic principles of democratic \n    governance, including through a series of fundamentally flawed \n    presidential and parliamentary elections undermining the legitimacy \n    of executive and legislative authority in that country.\n        ``(3) The Government of Belarus has subjected thousands of pro-\n    democratic political activists to harassment, beatings, and \n    jailings, particularly as a result of their attempts to peacefully \n    exercise their right to freedom of assembly and association.\n        ``(4) The Government of Belarus has attempted to maintain a \n    monopoly over the country's information space, targeting \n    independent media, including independent journalists, for \n    systematic reprisals and elimination, while suppressing the right \n    to freedom of speech and expression of those dissenting from the \n    dictatorship of Aleksandr Lukashenka, and adopted laws restricting \n    the media, including the Internet, in a manner inconsistent with \n    international human rights agreements.\n        ``(5) The Government of Belarus continues a systematic campaign \n    of harassment, repression, and closure of nongovernmental \n    organizations, including independent trade unions and \n    entrepreneurs, and this crackdown has created a climate of fear \n    that inhibits the development of civil society and social \n    solidarity.\n        ``(6) The Government of Belarus has subjected leaders and \n    members of select ethnic and religious minorities to harassment, \n    including the imposition of heavy fines and denying permission to \n    meet for religious services, sometimes by selective enforcement of \n    the 2002 Belarus religion law.\n        ``(7) The Government of Belarus has attempted to silence \n    dissent by persecuting human rights and pro-democracy activists \n    with threats, firings, expulsions, beatings and other forms of \n    intimidation, and restrictions on freedom of movement and \n    prohibition of international travel.\n        ``(8) The dictator of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenka, \n    established himself in power by orchestrating an illegal and \n    unconstitutional referendum that enabled him to impose a new \n    constitution, abolishing the duly elected parliament, the 13th \n    Supreme Soviet, installing a largely powerless National Assembly, \n    extending his term in office, and removing applicable term limits.\n        ``(9) The Government of Belarus has failed to make a convincing \n    effort to solve the cases of disappeared opposition figures Yuri \n    Zakharenka, Viktor Gonchar, and Anatoly Krasovsky and journalist \n    Dmitry Zavadsky, even though credible allegations and evidence \n    links top officials of the Government to these disappearance.\n        ``(10) The Government of Belarus has restricted freedom of \n    expression on the Internet by requiring Internet Service Providers \n    to maintain data on Internet users and the sites they view and to \n    provide such data to officials upon request, and by creating a \n    government body with the authority to require Internet Service \n    Providers to block Web sites.\n        ``(11) On December 19, 2010, the Government of Belarus \n    conducted a presidential election that failed to meet the standards \n    of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n    for democratic elections.\n        ``(12) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election the \n    Government of Belarus responded to opposition protests by beating \n    scores of protestors and detaining more than 600 peaceful \n    protestors.\n        ``(13) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election the \n    Government of Belarus jailed seven of the nine opposition \n    presidential candidates and abused the process of criminal \n    prosecution to persecute them.\n        ``(14) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, the \n    Government of Belarus disrupted independent broadcast and Internet \n    media, and engaged in repressive actions against independent \n    journalists.\n        ``(15) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, \n    Belarusian security services and police conducted raids targeting \n    civil society groups, individual pro-democracy activists, and \n    independent media.\n        ``(16) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, \n    Belarusian officials refused to extend the mandate of the OSCE \n    Office in Minsk.\n        ``(17) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, \n    opposition candidates and activists have been persecuted and \n    detainees have been physically mistreated, and denied access to \n    family, defense counsel, medical treatment, and open legal \n    proceedings.\n        ``(18) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, \n    lawyers representing those facing criminal charges related to the \n    post-election protest have been subjected to the revocation of \n    licenses, disbarment, and other forms of pressure.\n        ``(19) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, the \n    Government of Belarus has convicted political detainees to harsh \n    prison sentences.\n        ``(20) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, the \n    United States expanded its visa ban list, imposed additional \n    financial sanctions on certain state-owned enterprises, and \n    initiated preparations to freeze the assets of several individuals \n    in Belarus. The European Union imposed targeted travel and \n    financial sanctions on an expanded list of officials of the \n    Government of Belarus.\n        ``(21) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, the \n    United States fully restored sanctions against Belarus's largest \n    state-owned petroleum and chemical conglomerate and all of its \n    subsidiaries.\n        ``(22) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, the \n    United States has engaged in assistance efforts to provide legal \n    and humanitarian assistance to those facing repression and \n    preserving access to independent information, and has pledged \n    resources to support human rights advocates, trade unions, youth \n    and environmental groups, business associations, think-tanks, \n    democratic political parties and movements, independent \n    journalists, newspapers and electronic media operating both inside \n    Belarus and broadcasting from its neighbors, and to support access \n    of Belarusian students to independent higher education and expand \n    exchange programs for business and civil society leaders.\n        ``(23) The Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, \n    and other executive branch agencies have heretofore made effective \n    use of this Act to promote the purposes of this Act, as stated in \n    section 3 of this Act.\n``SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n    ``It is the policy of the United States to--\n        ``(1) condemn the conduct of the December 19, 2010, \n    presidential election and crackdown on opposition candidates, \n    political leaders, and activists, civil society representatives, \n    and journalists;\n        ``(2) continue to call for the immediate release without \n    preconditions of all political prisoners in Belarus, including all \n    those individuals detained in connection with the December 19, \n    2010, presidential election;\n        ``(3) continue to support the aspirations of the people of \n    Belarus for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law;\n        ``(4) continue to support the aspirations of the people of \n    Belarus to preserve the independence and sovereignty of their \n    country;\n        ``(5) continue to support the growth of democratic movements \n    and institutions in Belarus, which empower the people of Belarus to \n    end tyranny in their country;\n        ``(6) continue to refuse to accept the results of the \n    fundamentally flawed December 19, 2010, presidential election held \n    in Belarus, and to support calls for new presidential and \n    parliamentary elections, conducted in a manner that is free and \n    fair according to OSCE standards;\n        ``(7) continue to call for the fulfillment by the Belarusian \n    government of Belarus's freely undertaken obligations as an OSCE \n    participating state;\n        ``(8) continue to call for a full accounting of the \n    disappearances of opposition leaders and journalists in Belarus, \n    including Victor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovsky, Yuri Zakharenka, and \n    Dmitry Zavadsky, and the prosecution of those individuals who are \n    in any way responsible for the disappearance of those opposition \n    leaders and journalists;\n        ``(9) continue to work closely with the European Union and \n    other countries and international organizations, to promote the \n    conditions necessary for the integration of Belarus into the \n    European family of democracies;\n        ``(10) call on the International Ice Hockey Federation to \n    suspend its plan to hold the 2014 International World Ice Hockey \n    championship in Minsk until the Government of Belarus releases all \n    political prisoners; and\n        ``(11) remain open to reevaluating United States policy toward \n    Belarus as warranted by demonstrable progress made by the \n    Government of Belarus consistent with the aims of this Act as \n    stated in this section.''.\nSEC. 3.
