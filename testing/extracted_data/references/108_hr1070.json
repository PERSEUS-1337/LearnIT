    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Consumers' Assurance in \nMoving Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are approximately 1,500,000 interstate household \n        moves every year and, while the vast majority of these \n        interstate moves are completed successfully, consumer \n        complaints have been increasing since the Interstate Commerce \n        Commission was abolished in 1996 and oversight of the household \n        goods industry was transferred to the Department of \n        Transportation.\n            (2) While the overwhelming majority of household goods \n        carriers are honest and operate within the law, there appears \n        to be a growing criminal element that is exploiting a perceived \n        void in Federal and State enforcement efforts and who prey upon \n        consumers.\n            (3) The movement of an individual's household goods is \n        unique from the movement of a commercial shipment. A consumer \n        may utilize a moving company once or twice in his or her \n        lifetime and entrust virtually all of his or her worldly goods \n        to a mover.\n            (4) Current Federal regulations allow for a household goods \n        carrier found to be in violation of Federal law to be subject \n        to civil penalties but provide no remedy for consumers who have \n        been harmed by fraudulent or deceptive trade practices of a \n        household goods mover.\n            (5) Various courts have interpreted the ``Carmack'' \n        amendment, related to a carrier's liability in loss and damage \n        claims, to preclude States from pursuing any actions against \n        interstate household goods carriers, including the application \n        of consumer protection laws against fraudulent movers.\n            (6) Federal resources are inadequate to properly police or \n        deter, on a nationwide basis, those movers who willfully \n        violate Federal regulations governing the household goods \n        industry and knowingly prey on consumers who are in a \n        vulnerable position. It is appropriate that a Federal-State \n        partnership be created to enhance enforcement tools against \n        fraudulent moving companies.\n            (7) The Department of Transportation should provide greater \n        information to consumers and review current consumer protection \n        regulations, including insurance and loss and damage remedies \n        relating to individual household goods moves, in order to \n        recommend modifications to current Federal law and regulations \n        relating to rights and liabilities of both consumers and \n        household goods carriers.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL-STATE RELATIONS RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION OF HOUSEHOLD \n              GOODS.\n\n    (a) Nonpreemption of Intrastate Transportation of Household \nGoods.--Section 14501(c)(2)(B) of title 49, United States Code, is \namended by inserting ``intrastate'' before ``transportation''.\n    (b) Enforcement of Consumer Protection With Respect to Interstate \nHousehold Goods Carriers.--Chapter 145 of title 49, United States Code, \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 14506.
