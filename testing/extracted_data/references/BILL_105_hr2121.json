FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In May 1993, the United Nations established the \n        International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\n            (2) The mandate of the Tribunal is to prosecute ``genocide, \n        crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva \n        Conventions, and violations of the laws and customs of war'' \n        committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia from \n        January 1, 1991, until ``a date to be determined after \n        restoration of peace''.\n            (3) Parties to the Dayton Agreement, as well as subsequent \n        agreements, agreed to cooperate fully with the ``investigation \n        and prosecution of war crimes and other violations of \n        international humanitarian law''. All members of the \n        international community are required by the Tribunal Statute to \n        cooperate in ``the identification and location of persons'', \n        ``the arrest or detention of persons'', and ``the surrender or \n        the transfer of the accused'' to the Tribunal.\n            (4) Although 76 persons have been publicly indicted by the \n        Tribunal, 66 remain at large. Of those publicly indicted, there \n        are 51 Bosnian Serbs, 1 Croatian Serb, 3 Serbian Yugoslav Army \n        officers, 18 Bosnian Croats, and 3 Bosniacs.\n            (5) Credible reports indicate that some of the indicted war \n        criminals are living in areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina that \n        are under the effective control of Croatia or Serbia-\n        Montenegro. Many of the indicted war criminals have been \n        sighted living openly and freely in Croatia, the Croat-\n        controlled areas of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n        Republika Srpska, and Serbia-Montenegro.\n            (6) An estimated 2,000,000 persons have been forced from \n        their homes by the war, many of whom remain displaced and \n        unable to return to their homes, in violation of the Dayton \n        Accords, because their homes are in a jurisdiction controlled \n        by a different ethnic group.\n            (7) The fighting in Bosnia has ceased for more than a year, \n        and international efforts are now focused on the economic \n        reconstruction and implementation of the civilian aspects of \n        the Dayton Accords.\n            (8) The International Bank for Reconstruction and \n        Development, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \n        Development, the International Monetary Fund, and individual \n        donor countries, including the United States, have begun \n        disbursing funds toward meeting an identified goal of \n        $5,100,000,000 for reconstruction of Bosnia.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) In General.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be \n        achieved if indicted war criminals remain at large and refugees \n        and displaced persons are unable to return to their homes;\n            (2) reconstruction without reconciliation will not be \n        effective in ensuring stability in the long run because, absent \n        individual accountability, victimized communities will assign \n        collective responsibility, thus perpetuating the cycle of \n        hatred; and\n            (3) the Government of the United States should ensure that \n        multilateral and bilateral assistance is provided to parties to \n        the Dayton Agreement only if doing so would promote \n        reconciliation as well as reconstruction, including the \n        transfer of war criminals to the Tribunal, the return of \n        refugees and displaced persons, and freedom of movement.\n    (b) Additional Provision.--It is further the sense of the Congress \nthat the Tribunal, consistent with its mandate, should continue to \ninvestigate and bring indictments against persons who have violated \ninternational humanitarian law.\n\nSEC. 4.
