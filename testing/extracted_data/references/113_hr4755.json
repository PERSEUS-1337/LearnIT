    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation \nTherapy Act of 2014''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Intensive, coordinated medical rehabilitation provided \n        in inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and units is critical to \n        Medicare beneficiaries with injuries, illnesses, disabilities, \n        and chronic conditions in order to return to health, full \n        function, independent living, and a high quality of life.\n            (2) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (in this \n        section referred to as ``CMS'') uses an ``intensity of \n        therapy'' requirement to help determine which Medicare \n        beneficiaries are appropriate for treatment in an inpatient \n        rehabilitation hospital or unit. CMS has interpreted the \n        intensity of therapy requirement through application of the so-\n        called ``Three Hour Rule'' (42 C.F.R. 412.622(a)(3)(ii)) which \n        requires the patient to be able to participate in three hours \n        of rehabilitation therapy per day, five days per week, or 15 \n        hours of rehabilitation therapy over a one-week period.\n            (3) Before 2010, CMS regulations explicitly stated that \n        physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and/or \n        orthotics and prosthetics were counted toward the Three Hour \n        Rule on an as-needed basis. In addition, CMS regulations stated \n        that ``other therapeutic modalities'' that were determined by \n        the physician and the rehabilitation team to be needed by the \n        patient ``on a priority basis'' would qualify toward \n        satisfaction of the rule (HCFA Ruling 85-2).\n            (4) This language allowed recreational therapy to count \n        toward satisfaction of the Three Hour Rule for patients who \n        required this mix of therapies on a priority basis in the \n        inpatient rehabilitation hospital or unit setting.\n            (5) CMS by regulation (74 Fed. Reg. 39811 (August 7, 2009)) \n        revised these prior regulations, effective January 1, 2010, by \n        limiting the Three Hour Rule to recognize only four services \n        (namely, physical, occupational, and speech therapy as well as \n        orthotics and prosthetics) and removing the discretion of the \n        physician and the rehabilitation team to count other \n        therapeutic services needed by the patient toward satisfaction \n        of the Three Hour Rule. As a result, recreational therapy \n        services are often not available to patients who require \n        medically necessary recreational therapy as part of their plan \n        of care.\n            (6) Recreational therapy is a treatment service designed to \n        restore, remediate, and rehabilitate a patient's level of \n        functioning and independence in life activities, to promote \n        health and wellness as well as to reduce or eliminate the \n        activity limitations and restrictions to participation in life \n        situations caused by an illness or disabling condition. \n        Recreational therapy in the inpatient rehabilitation hospital \n        and unit setting is provided by qualified recreational \n        therapists when required by the patient's condition and \n        prescribed by a physician as part of a patient's plan of care.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to restore reliance on \nthe professional judgment of the treating physician and the \nrehabilitation team when determining whether a Medicare patient meets \nthe intensity of therapy requirement of an inpatient rehabilitation \nhospital or unit in order for that patient to gain access to the \nappropriate mix of medically necessary therapeutic rehabilitation \nservices in that setting, including physical therapy, occupational \ntherapy, and, as needed, speech therapy, orthotics and prosthetics, and \nrecreational therapy.\n\nSEC. 3. INCLUDING RECREATIONAL THERAPY AMONG THE THERAPY MODALITIES \n              THAT CONSTITUTE AN INTENSIVE REHABILITATION THERAPY \n              PROGRAM IN DETERMINING THE MEDICAL NECESSITY OF SERVICES \n              IN AN INPATIENT REHABILITATION FACILITY (IRF).\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1886(j) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395ww(j)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nparagraph:\n            ``(9) Including recreational therapy among therapy \n        modalities that constitute an intensive rehabilitation therapy \n        program in a rehabilitation facility.--The Secretary shall \n        include recreational therapy services among the therapeutic \n        modalities that constitute an intensive rehabilitation program \n        in determining (pursuant to applicable regulations) whether \n        inpatient services in a rehabilitation facility are reasonable \n        and necessary under section 1862(a)(1)(A).''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by section (a) shall apply \nto services furnished on or after January 1, 2015."
