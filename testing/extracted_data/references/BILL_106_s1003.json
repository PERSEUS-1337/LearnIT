FINDINGS.\n\n    The Senate finds the following:\n            (1)(A) Since 1994, the United States has imported over half \n        its oil.\n            (B) Without efforts to mitigate this dependence on foreign \n        oil, the percentage of oil imported is expected to grow to all-\n        time highs.\n            (C) This reliance on foreign oil presents a national \n        security risk, which Congress should address through policy \n        changes designed to increase the use of domestically-available \n        alternative transportation fuels.\n            (2)(A) The importing of a majority of the oil used in the \n        United States contributes negatively to the balance of trade of \n        the United States.\n            (B) Assuring the Nation's economic security demands the \n        development and promotion of domestically-available alternative \n        transportation fuels.\n            (3)(A) The reliance on oil as a transportation fuel has \n        numerous negative environmental consequences, including \n        increasing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\n            (B) Developing alternative transportation fuels will help \n        address these environmental impacts by reducing emissions.\n            (4) In order to encourage installation of alternative \n        fueling infrastructure, and make alternative fuels economically \n        favorable to the producer, distributor, marketer, and consumer, \n        tax credits provided at the point of distribution into an \n        alternative fuel vehicle are necessary.\n            (5)(A) In the short-term, United States alternative fuel \n        policy must be made fuel neutral.\n            (B) Fuel neutrality will foster private innovation and \n        commercialization using the most technologically feasible and \n        economic fuels available.\n            (C) This will allow market forces to decide the alternative \n        fuel winners and losers.\n            (6)(A) Tax credits which have been in place have led to \n        increases in the quantity and quality of alternative fuel \n        technology available today.\n            (B) Extending these credits is an efficient means of \n        promoting alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fueling \n        infrastructures.\n            (7)(A) The Federal fleet is one of the best customers for \n        alternative fuel vehicles due to its combination of large \n        purchasing power, tight record keeping, geographic diversity, \n        and high fuel usage.\n            (B) For these reasons, the National Energy Policy Act of \n        1991 required Federal fleets to purchase certain numbers of \n        alternatively-fueled vehicles.\n            (C) In most cases, these requirements have not been met.\n            (D) Efforts must be made to ensure that all Federal \n        agencies comply with Federal fleet purchase requirement laws \n        and executive orders.\n\n                        TITLE I--TAX INCENTIVES\n\nSEC. 101.
