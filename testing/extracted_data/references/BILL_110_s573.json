SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Heart Disease Education, Analysis \nand Research, and Treatment for Women Act'' or the ``HEART for Women \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular \n        diseases are the leading cause of death among women.\n            (2) Despite being the number 1 killer, only 13 percent of \n        women are aware that cardiovascular diseases, including heart \n        disease and stroke, are their greatest health risk.\n            (3) Many minority women, including African American, \n        Hispanic, Native American, and some Asian American women, are \n        at a higher risk of death from heart disease, stroke, and other \n        cardiovascular diseases, but they are less likely to know of \n        this risk.\n            (4) There is a pervasive lack of awareness among healthcare \n        providers that cardiovascular disease is the leading killer of \n        women.\n            (5) Women are less likely than men to receive certain \n        treatments for cardiovascular diseases, perhaps due to lack of \n        awareness and the presence of different symptoms in women than \n        in men.\n            (6) Women tend to experience later onset of heart disease \n        than men, and therefore more often suffer from multiple \n        conditions that mask symptoms of heart disease and complicate \n        treatment.\n            (7) Certain diagnostic tests for cardiovascular disease may \n        be less accurate in women than in men.\n            (8) Drug effectiveness and metabolism differ in women and \n        men, impacting successful treatment of cardiovascular disease.\n            (9) In addition, stroke kills 2.3 times as many females as \n        does breast cancer. Nearly 61 percent of stroke-related deaths \n        occur in females. Studies have found differences in the \n        effects, diagnosis, and treatment of stroke depending on the \n        sex of the patient. For instance--\n                    (A) stroke severity is greater in women than in \n                men;\n                    (B) women often receive fewer diagnostic tests and \n                intervention procedures than men; and\n                    (C) strokes present treatment issues unique to \n                women.\n\nSEC. 3.
