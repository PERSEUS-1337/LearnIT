FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Television influences children's perception of the \n        values and behavior that are common and acceptable in society.\n            (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n        programming are--\n                    (A) uniquely pervasive presences in the lives of \n                all American children; and\n                    (B) readily accessible to all American children.\n            (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n        indecent programming.\n            (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n        violent video programming at a young age have a higher tendency \n        to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later in life than \n        those children not so exposed.\n            (5) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n        violent video programming have a greater tendency to assume \n        that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and therefore to \n        imitate such behavior.\n            (6) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n        violent video programming have an increased fear of becoming a \n        victim of violence, resulting in increased self-protective \n        behaviors and increased mistrust of others.\n            (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n        the negative influences of violent video programming on \n        children.\n            (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n        channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n        day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n        portion of the television audience.\n            (9) A significant amount of violent programming that is \n        readily accessible to minors remains unrated specifically for \n        violence and therefore cannot be blocked solely on the basis of \n        its violent content.\n            (10) Age-based ratings that do not include content rating \n        for violence do not allow parents to block programming based \n        solely on violent content thereby rendering ineffective any \n        technology-based blocking mechanism designed to limit violent \n        video programming.\n            (11) The most recent study of the television ratings system \n        by the Kaiser Family Foundation concludes that 79 percent of \n        violent programming is not specifically rated for violence.\n            (12) Technology-based solutions, such as the V-chip, may be \n        helpful in protecting some children, but cannot achieve the \n        compelling governmental interest in protecting all children \n        from violent programming when parents are only able to block \n        programming that has, in fact, been rated for violence.\n            (13) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be \n        shown protects the interests of children whose parents are \n        unavailable, unable to supervise their children's viewing \n        behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n        solutions, are unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n        solutions, or are unable to determine the content of those \n        shows that are only subject to age-based ratings.\n            (14) After further study, pursuant to a rulemaking, the \n        Federal Communications Commission may conclude that content-\n        based ratings and blocking technology do not effectively \n        protect children from the harm of violent video programming.\n            (15) If the Federal Communications Commission reaches the \n        conclusion described in paragraph (14), the channeling of \n        violent video programming will be the least restrictive means \n        of limiting the exposure of children to the harmful influences \n        of violent video programming.\n\nSEC. 3. ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT RATING SYSTEM FOR \n              VIOLENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF V-CHIP IN BLOCKING VIOLENT \n              PROGRAMMING.\n\n    (a) Report.--The Federal Communications Commission shall--\n            (1) assess the effectiveness of measures to require \n        television broadcasters and multichannel video programming \n        distributors (as defined in section 602(13) of the \n        Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 522(13)) to rate and \n        encode programming that could be blocked by parents using the \n        V-chip undertaken under section 715 of the Communications Act \n        of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 715) and under subsections (w) and (x) of \n        section 303 of that Act (47 U.S.C. 303(w) and (x)) in \n        accomplishing the purposes for which they were enacted; and\n            (2) report its findings to the Committee on Commerce, \n        Science, and Transportation of the United States Senate and the \n        Committee on Commerce of the United States House of \n        Representatives, within 12 months after the date of enactment \n        of this Act, and annually thereafter.\n    (b) Action.--If the Commission finds at any time, as a result of \nits ongoing assessment under subsection (a), that the measures referred \nto in subsection (a)(1) are insufficiently effective, then the \nCommission shall complete a rulemaking within 270 days after the date \non which the Commission makes that finding to prohibit the distribution \nof violent video programming during the hours when children are \nreasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the audience.\n    (c) Definitions.--Any term used in this section that is defined in \nsection 715 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 715), or in \nregulations under that section, has the same meaning as when used in \nthat section or in those regulations.\n\nSEC. 4. UNLAWFUL DISTRIBUTION OF VIOLENT VIDEO PROGRAMMING THAT IS NOT \n              SPECIFICALLY RATED FOR VIOLENCE AND THEREFORE IS NOT \n              BLOCKABLE.\n\n    Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 715.
