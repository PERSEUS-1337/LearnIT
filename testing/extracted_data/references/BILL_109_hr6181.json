FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States is suffering a worsening crisis in \n        public infrastructure, including a lack or insufficiency of \n        railroad, mass transportation, power, water control, river \n        navigation, port, oil refining, and hospital infrastructure \n        facilities.\n            (2) The ``infrastructure report card'' issued by the \n        American Society of Civil Engineers estimates the need for \n        $1,700,000,000,000 in investments to repair and replace \n        obsolescent and broken-down infrastructure facilities in the \n        United States.\n            (3) The Nation's infrastructure crisis became dramatically \n        apparent after the breakdown of water control, transportation, \n        and power infrastructure facilities in the Gulf States \n        following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n            (4) Each $1,000,000,000 of Federal funding invested in \n        infrastructure facilities creates approximately 50,000 jobs and \n        $6,000,000,000 in economic activity.\n            (5) The United States continues to suffer high rates of \n        unemployment in urban and rural areas, especially among males \n        in their twenties, and individuals and households continue to \n        experience decreases in wages and real income.\n            (6) Regional, State, and local infrastructure rebuilding \n        projects require a great deal of semi-skilled and labor-\n        intensive employment.\n            (7) These projects include the necessary repair and \n        rebuilding of large numbers of the Nation's ``upstream'' dams, \n        which could provide employment to 100,000 individuals, and the \n        replacement of the 10 obsolete locks and dams on the Ohio River \n        Mainstem system, which would generate approximately 20,000 jobs \n        over a multi-year period.\n            (8) The Urban Youth Corps administered by the Departments \n        of Housing and Urban Development and Transportation, the \n        National Civilian Community Corps, and other volunteer programs \n        of the Corporation for National and Community Service have \n        greatly contributed to public works and disaster response \n        projects.\n            (9) The authority of the Corporation for National and \n        Community Service should be expanded to provide employment \n        opportunities and reverse trends in urban unemployment through \n        the establishment of a National Infrastructure Corps modeled \n        after the Community Conservation Corps created at the outset of \n        the Great Depression.\n\nSEC. 3.
