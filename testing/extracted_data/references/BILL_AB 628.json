Sec. 1317(b)) or Section 402 (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1342) of the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1251 et seq.), including wastewaters at facilities that have eliminated the discharge of wastewater, contaminated with de minimis quantities of used oil.\n(II) For purposes of this clause, \u201cde minimis quantities of used oil\u201d are small spills, leaks, or drippings from pumps, machinery, pipes, and other similar equipment during normal operations, or small amounts of oil lost to the wastewater treatment system during washing or draining operations.\n(III) This exception does not apply if the used oil is discarded as a result of abnormal manufacturing operations resulting in substantial leaks, spills, or other releases or to used oil recovered from wastewaters.\n(iii) Used oil re-refining distillation bottoms that are used as feedstock to manufacture asphalt products.\n(iv) Oil that contains polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at a concentration of 5 ppm or greater.\n(v) (I) Oil containing more than 1000 ppm total halogens, which shall be presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in Subpart D (commencing with Section 261.30) of Part 261 of Subchapter I of Chapter 1 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n(II) A person may rebut the presumption specified in subclause (I) by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste, including, but not limited to, in the manner specified in subclause (III).\n(III) The presumption specified in subclause (I) is rebutted if it is demonstrated that the used oil that is the source of total halogens at a concentration of more than 1000 ppm is solely either household waste, as defined in Section 261.4(b)(1) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or is collected from conditionally exempt small quantity generators, as defined in Section 261.5 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Nothing in this subclause authorizes any person to violate the prohibition specified in Section 25250.7.\n(2) \u201cBoard\u201d means the California Integrated Waste Management Board.\n(3) (A) \u201cRecycled oil\u201d means any oil that meets all of the following requirements specified in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive:\n(i) Is produced either solely from used oil, or is produced solely from used oil that has been mixed with one or more contaminated petroleum products or oily wastes, other than wastes listed as hazardous under the federal act, provided that if the resultant mixture is subject to regulation as a hazardous waste under Section 279.10(b)(2) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the mixture is managed as a hazardous waste in accordance with all applicable hazardous waste regulations, and the recycled oil produced from the mixture is not subject to regulation as a hazardous waste under Section 279.10(b)(2) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. If the oily wastes with which the used oil is mixed were recovered from a unit treating hazardous wastes that are not oily wastes, these recovered oily wastes are not excluded from being considered as oily wastes for purposes of this section or Section 25250.7.\n(ii)The recycled oil meets one of the following requirements:\n(I) The recycled oil is produced by a generator lawfully recycling its oil.\n(II) The recycled oil is produced at a used oil recycling facility that is authorized to operate pursuant to Section 25200 or 25200.5 solely by means of one or more processes specifically authorized by the department. The department may not authorize a used oil recycling facility to use a process in which used oil is mixed with one or more contaminated petroleum products or oily wastes unless the department determines that the process to be authorized for mixing used oil with those products or wastes will not substantially contribute to the achievement of compliance with the specifications of subparagraph (B).\n(III) The recycled oil is produced in another state, and the used oil recycling facility where the recycled oil is produced, and the process by which the recycled oil is produced, are authorized by the agency authorized to implement the federal act in that state.\n(iii) Has been prepared for reuse and meets all of the following standards:\n(I) The oil meets the standards of purity set forth in subparagraph (B).\n(II) If the oil was produced by a generator lawfully recycling its oil or the oil is lawfully produced in another state, the oil is not hazardous pursuant to the criteria adopted by the department pursuant to Section 25141 for any characteristic or constituent other than those listed in subparagraph (B).\n(III) The oil is not mixed with any waste listed as a hazardous waste in Part 261 (commencing with Section 261.1) of Subchapter I of Chapter 1 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n(IV) The oil is not subject to regulation as a hazardous waste under the federal act.\n(V) If the oil was produced lawfully at a used oil recycling facility in this state, the oil is not hazardous pursuant to any characteristic or constituent for which the department has made the finding required by subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 25250.19, except for one of the characteristics or constituents identified in the standards of purity set forth in subparagraph (B).\n(B) The following standards of purity are in effect for recycled oil, in liquid form, unless the department, by regulation, establishes more stringent standards:\n(i) Flashpoint: minimum standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials for the recycled products. However, recycled oil to be burned for energy recovery shall have a minimum flashpoint of 100 degrees Fahrenheit.\n(ii) Total lead: 50 mg/kg or less.\n(iii) Total arsenic: 5 mg/kg or less.\n(iv) Total chromium: 10 mg/kg or less.\n(v) Total cadmium: 2 mg/kg or less.\n(vi) Total halogens: 3000 mg/kg or less.
