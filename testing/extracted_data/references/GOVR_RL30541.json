    "content": "U.S. assistance to Colombia, virtually all of it related to counternarcotics efforts, has increased steadily sinceFY1995 (see Tables 1 and 6 ). The United States hasprovided equipment, supplies, and other aid for the counternarcotics efforts, initially largely to the ColombianNational Police (CNP), but recently increasingly tothe Colombian military. As of FY2000, more is being provided to the military. Most of the funding has supportedthe tracking, interdiction and arrest oftraffickers, the destruction of laboratories, and eradication efforts. Of pre-Plan Colombia assistance, a small amountsupported reforms to the judicial system, andalternative development. This amount was increased greatly in the Plan Colombia legislation. The State Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) has been the primary agency in counternarcotics efforts. INL runs the airwing which supplies aircraft for the narcotics crop eradication program in South America, in which Colombia isa major participant. INL also coordinates theactivities of other civilian agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Agency forInternational Development, and the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation (FBI), providing them with funds from the State Department's International Narcotics Control (INC)account. These agencies have worked withColombia's judicial system to improve law enforcement capabilities, criminal justice procedures, and theaccessibility and fairness of the justice system. Theyalso have assisted Colombia's eradication and interdiction efforts. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has been a major source of funding and support for Colombian counternarcotics efforts, mainly through programs whichare not considered \"traditional foreign aid\" programs. (1) Under defense legislation, DOD provides support for efforts to detect and monitor illicit narcoticsoperations, principally the maintenance of five radar sites in Colombia. DOD also conducts surveillance overflightsfrom locations outside Colombia. During1999, DOD helped establish, train and equip the first special Colombian Army counternarcotics battalion (CACB)of some 950 troops, which commencedoperations towards the end of that year. (2) Thebattalion was set up to conduct its own CN missions, as well as to provide security for the police counternarcoticsforces in their operations. DOD also sponsors a riverine CN program, training personnel of the Colombian Navyand Marines to control narcotics traffickingalong Colombia's extensive network of rivers. (3) Thenumbers of U.S. uniformed military personnel assisting in these efforts has varied in the low hundreds.  The U.S. military and other agencies also have provided other support to the Colombian military and police. Through Section 506 (a) of the Foreign AssistanceAct of 1961, as amended, DOD and other agencies (see Tables 1 and 6 ) have provided substantialamounts of equipment to the Colombian military and police. (4) In addition, the United States has funded the construction of the Joint Intelligence Center (JIC) at TresEsquinas in southwest Colombia to strengthen police andmilitary intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities, and to encourage them to share intelligence. Many of the critics of military assistance have argued that although the aid is provided for counternarcotics purposes, it can be used to further counterinsurgencyefforts. News reports in the summer of 1998 alleged that the United States had provided covert assistance to theColombian military for counternarcotics andcounterinsurgency operations, including the participation of active duty military personnel and private contractors. (5) At the same time, the press reported thepresence of U.S. special operations forces who were training with Colombian military units under the JointCombined Exchange Training program (U.S.C. Title10, Section 2011), (6) which some interpreted asproviding de facto counterinsurgency aid.  Although the Clinton Administration denied that the United States was providing counterinsurgency assistance, analysts acknowledged that some types of U.S.counternarcotics training provide lessons that can also be applied to counterinsurgency operations. The ClintonAdministration had also held that assistanceprovided to police and military forces in operations targeted at guerrilla drug production or protection activities fitwithin the definition of counternarcotics aid. InMarch 1999, however, the Clinton Administration expanded the conditions under which it provided intelligenceto Colombian security forces, routinely providinga Colombian police-military Joint Task Force with intelligence information related to the guerrillas. Although theUnited States provided the information to assistwith counternarcotics operations, the General Accounting Office reported that the U.S. Embassy in Colombia didnot have a system to ensure that the informationwas used only for counternarcotics purposes. (7)  Table 1. U.S. Assistance to Colombia, FY1999-FY2001 (Obligations and authorizations, $ millions) Sources : General Accounting Office (GAO -01-26), Department of State, Congressional BudgetJustification for Foreign Operations for FY2001; U.S. Agencyfor International Development Budget Justification for FY2001, Annex IV; and information provided by Department of State and Department of Defenseofficials. This chart includes direct U.S. foreign assistance (i.e., the categories usually counted as U.S. foreign aid,which are in italics), as well as the costs of goods and services provided to Colombia from other U.S. government programs supporting counternarcotics effortsin Colombia. The United States alsoprovides a small amount of DOD Excess Defense Articles (EDA) to Colombia. Other funds are spent in Colombiaon counternarcotics and other activities thatare considered part of U.S. programs: for instance, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spends its ownfunds on joint operations in Colombia. Figureson FY2000 and FY2001 State Department INC funding provided January 10-11, 2001. Figures on DOD Sections1004, 124, 1004/124, and 1033 fundingprovided June 29, 2001; some $10.9 million of funds in the DOD accounts was planned for an FY2001 obligation,but as of July 5, 2001 had not actually beenobligated.  * DOD Sections 124, 1004, and 1033 funding is taken from regional accounts and the tentative allocations forColombia can be shifted to respond to developingneeds in other areas. (Section 124 covers U.S. operated radar systems in Colombia and elsewhere, and other costsof U.S. detection and monitoring of drugflights.) a For FY1999, includes $173.2 million in Congressionally-mandated supplemental appropriationsfunding for helicopters, helicopter and aircraft upgrades, radar,and police assistance. FY2000 non-DOD Plan Colombia supplemental funds were all assigned to the StateDepartment INC account; the State Department istransferring them to the other agencies carrying out programs in Colombia with those funds. b The AID FY1999 figure includes $10.0 million in disaster relief funding and $3.0 million inEconomic Support Funds (ESF). AID pipeline funding of $5.0million in development funding authorized in previous years was expended in FY1999. The AID FY2000 andFY2001 figures are all ESF. These AID figures donot include funds provided to AID from the INC account.  c FMF pipeline funding of $13 million authorized prior to FY1995 and funding available from theFY1995 FMF authorization was intended to be expended frommid-FY1997 through FY1999. As presented to the 106th Congress, initially on January 11, 2000, and then with the annual budget request on February 7, 2000, the Clinton Administration aidproposal to support the Colombian government's \"Plan Colombia\" contained over $954 million in supplementalFY2000 funding and over $318 million forFY2001 spending. (This was in addition to about $150 million allocated and planned for existing programs in eachfiscal year.) The proposal's centerpiece wasthe \"Push into Southern Colombia\" program, which was intended to enable the Colombian government to extendCN activities throughout southern Colombia. There, coca cultivation was expanding rapidly throughout areas where the Colombian guerrillas have operated. Thecore of the Southern Colombia programincluded training and equipping two new army CN battalions, and purchasing Blackhawk and Huey helicopters totransport them. According to DOD sources, thetwo new battalions could complete training for operations within seven months of the date funding was approved;the Black Hawk helicopters requested for theirtransportation could be provided, and pilots trained to operate them, about 18 months from the funding date. Totalfunding for the Southern Colombia (SC)program requested by the Administration was $512 million in FY2000 and $88 million in FY2001. Of this, AIDwould receive $31 million to resettle and fundalternative economic opportunities for peasants who would be deprived of their livelihood by operations in SouthernColombia. The remaining proposedassistance, to be administered by six agencies, was divided into five other categories: (1) drug traffickinginterdiction, (2) improving CNP eradication capabilities,(3) economic development, (4) \"boosting government capacity,\" i.e., funding to support human rights monitors andimprove the justice system and the rule of law;and (5) other economic assistance and assistance for the peace process.  According to Administration sources, the Push into Southern Colombia program was the first part of a planned six-year counternarcotics effort. In testimonybefore the House Armed Services Committee on March 23, 2000, Gen Charles E. Wilhelm, Commander in Chiefof the U.S. Southern Command, outlined asix-year plan for attacking the cultivation and production of illegal narcotics. He testified that the efforts in SouthernColombia are the first phase of a three phasecounternarcotics plan of the Colombian security forces. In the second two-year phase, efforts would be concentratedon the Meta and Guaviare provinces to theeast. The third two-year phase would \"move to the north to Santander and other provinces.\" At the same hearing,Rand Beers, the Assistance Secretary of Statefor International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, stated that \"we can reasonably expect to have a seriouslook at success in four to six years.\" OtherAdministration witnesses, in other hearings, have stated that it would take one to two years for the program to showresults. House Action. On March 9, 2000, the House Appropriations Committee approved an emergency supplementalappropriations act ( H.R. 3908 , reported March 14, H.Rept. 106-521 ), that included some $1.418 billion infunding for FY2000 and FY2001counternarcotics efforts in Colombia, its neighbors, and other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean. (This wasout of a total of $1.7 billion in the bill forcounternarcotics purposes; the other $282 million is for a domestic program.) This amounted to about $146 millionmore than the Administration included forsuch purposes. This figure included, however, funds for items that were not included in the President's calculationand that it was anticipated would have beenaddressed elsewhere in FY2001 appropriations, i.e., almost $79 million more for DOD military construction fundingfor the Aruba and Cura\u00c3\u00a7ao ForwardOperating locations (FOLs) in FY2000 and FY2001, and for the Ecuador FOL in FY2001.  Among the House Appropriations Committee's increases over the President's proposal were: $42 million more for alternative development activities in Bolivia,Peru, and Ecuador; $19 million more for interdiction efforts in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and other countries; $25million more for U.S. classified activities; and$10.5 million more for U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) programs directly related to the Andeanregion. The committee reallocated $26 million fortwo Blackhawk helicopters from support for the Colombian Army Counternarcotics Battalions (CACBs) to supportfor the Colombian National Police (CNP). Among the decreases were almost $20 million less for the CACBs (in addition to the reallocationof Blackhawks), and $11 million less for riverine interdictionprograms. (See Table 4 for a breakdown of the funding.)  The House Appropriations Committee passed two amendments to the mark-up bill dealing with illegal rightist \"self-defense\" groups. One was a sense of theCongress resolution that the Secretary of State \"should immediately\" place the United Self-Defense Forces ofColombia (AUC) on the list of foreign terroristorganizations. The other provided that any helicopter provided to the Colombia army should be returned to theUnited States if it is used \"to aid or abet theoperations of an illegal self-defense group or security cooperative...\"  On March 30, the House approved the same funding levels in its action on the bill. The House rejected three amendments to cut counternarcotics funding.These were:  the Ramstad amendment (rejected 158-262) to delete all $1.7 billion ofcounternarcotics funding in the bill;  the Pelosi amendment ( rejected by voice vote) to cut $51 million from DODfunding, i.e., the amount allocated for the DOD contributionto the Push into Southern Colombia initiative; and the Paul amendment (rejected 45-367) to cut counternarcotics and other Kosovoand East Timor funding.  It also rejected, 186-239, the Obey Amendment to cut $551 million in military funding, but to provide an expedited procedure for its consideration in July.  The House approved, 380-39, the Gilman/Goss/Delahunt/Farr amendment which would condition the funding, but included a provision for the President towaive those conditions if \"required by extraordinary circumstances.\" The amendment also allocated $2 million forspecific human rights purposes, including U.S.monitoring of the armed forces, guerrillas, and paramilitary groups, and prohibited the State Department fromissuing a visa to any person who was \"crediblyalleged to have provided direct or indirect support for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), theNational Liberation Army (ELN), or the UnitedColombian Self-Defense organization (AUC), including conspiracy to allow, facilitate, or promote the illegalactivities of such groups.\" The visa prohibitioncould be waived deemed \"in the national interest.\"  The House also approved by voice vote the Sawyer amendment to earmark $50 million for assistance to displaced persons; the House Appropriations Committeeversion of the bill had allocated $24.5 million to assist currently displaced persons. The House acted on two similar Taylor amendments . The first was ruled out of order because it would have affected existing legislation in an appropriations,rather than an authorization act. That amendment would have limited the total number of U.S. troops in Colombiaat any one time to 300, excepting those presenton an emergency rescue mission or stationed as attaches or with the Marine guard at the U.S. Embassy. The second,approved by voice vote, would limit to 300the number of U.S. military personnel that could be supported by funds appropriated by the bill. On May 10, the House Armed Services Committee approved conditions on the deployment of U.S. troops to Colombia as it reported its version of the FY2001National Defense Authorization bill, H.R. 4205 . Section 1204 would limit to 500 the number of U.S. troopsthat could be deployed there at any onetime, except for diplomatic and emergency purposes. The Senate FY2001 authorization bill, S. 2549 , did notcontain such a limitation. Senate Action. On May 9, the Senate Appropriations Committee included Plan Colombia funding in itsversions of the FY2001 Military Construction ( S. 2521 , S.Rept. 106-290 ) and FY2001 Foreign Operations( S. 2522 , S.Rept. 106-291 )appropriations bills, reported that day. Funding in these bills for the Plan Colombia items requested by theAdministration and/or approved by the House in H.R. 3908 would total some $1,138.0 million in FY2000 emergency supplemental funds. The greatestdifference between the Senate AppropriationsCommittee action and H.R. 3908 was the elimination of the $388 million that the House provided for theacquisition of 30 Blackhawk helicopters. Instead, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $118.5 million for the acquisition of 60 Huey II helicoptersfor the use of Colombian ArmyCounternarcotics Battalions. (The military construction bill also included additional counternarcotics items that could be considered as related to Plan Colombia. These were $30 million toreplace an a reconnaissance aircraft that crashed in Colombia in 1999, and $44 million for Coast Guard procurementpreviously authorized in Section 812(b) ofthe Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act as contained in P.L. 105-277 . A total of $74.9 million was includedin S. 2521 for Coast Guard druginterdiction activities.)  The Military Construction bill ( S. 2521 ) would provide $85.7 million in FY2000 emergency funding for DOD support of Colombian Armycounternarcotics battalions, and for other support for Colombian and U.S. counternarcotics efforts. It also wouldprovided $116.5 million for the construction ofForward Operating Locations in Ecuador, and Aruba/Curacao. The Foreign Operations bill ( S. 2522 ) wouldprovide $934.1 million, also in FY2000emergency funding, in support for the Colombian Army Counternarcotics Battalions (CACBs) and other activities.No FY2001 funding was included under thePlan Colombia categories in either of the bills, although the bill seems to indicate that the funding can be used ineither fiscal year. (See Table 4 for a breakdownof the funding.) On May 18, the full Senate approved S. 2521 , with funding and conditions for PlanColombia unchanged. ( S. 2521 wasthen incorporated as a substitute amendment into H.R. 4425 , the House version of the bill which containedno Plan Colombia funding, and the Senatepassed its amended version of H.R. 4425 in lieu of S. 2521 .) Senate Conditions on Assistance. The Military Construction bill limited the amount of funding that could beprovided to the government of Colombia in support for its counternarcotics programs to $45 million.  The Senate appropriations committee version of the Foreign Operations bill placed extensive conditions on funding. These included:  a requirement for the trial by civilian courts of Colombian military personnel credibly alleged to be guilty of gross violations of humanrights, and their suspension from duty pending trial for such offenses or if they have been credibly alleged to haveassisted paramilitary groups, and the fullcooperation of the Colombian Armed Forces with civilian authorities in investigating, prosecuting and punishingsuch personnel (Section 6101). To obligatefunds for FY2000 and FY2001, the Secretary of State must first certify that these conditions have been met, and thatthe government of Colombia is vigorouslyprosecuting leaders and members of the paramilitaries; a prohibition on the use of funds to support aerial herbicide spraying unless the Surgeon General reports to the appropriate congressionalcommittees that the herbicide is safe and nontoxic to human health, and the Environmental Protection Agencyreports that it does not contaminate water or leachin soil (Section 6105); a limit of 250 on the number of U.S. military personnel that could be assigned to temporary or permanent duty in Colombia (exclusive ofthose assigned to the U.S. diplomatic mission there), and a limit of 100 on the number of U.S. civilian contractorsin Colombia in support of Plan Colombia. ThePresident can request that Congress waive this provision, which it could do by enacting a joint resolution. Theprovision could also be waived for a single 90-dayperiod if the President determines that U.S. troops \"are involved in hostilities\" or that such involvement \"is clearlyindicated by circumstances;\" (Section6106); a prohibition on the use of any funds other than those made available by this bill or by FY2001 military construction appropriations for PlanColombia, unless Congress approves a presidential request to use other available funding by enacting a jointresolution (Section 6106). The bill also would have required that (1) the President report to designated Congressional committees on theobjectives of U.S. counternarcotics strategy inColombia and neighboring countries, the benchmarks by which progress could be measured, and other elementsregarding U.S. policy; and (2) the Secretary ofState report within six months of enactment and every six months after regarding the status of U.S. requests forextradition to countries receiving U.S.counternarcotics aid (Section 6102). It contained a three-point statement of the Sense of Congress on counternarcotics measures (Section 6103). The \"PlanColombia\" title specifically incorporated \"Leahy Amendment\" human rights conditions contained in previouslegislation (Section 564 of P.L. 106-113 , andSection 8098 of P.L. 106-79 , see above). Senate Action on S. 2522. In June 21-22 action on S. 2522 , which was approved by theSenate on June 22, the Senate either tabled or rejected three amendments to reduce or condition funding forColombia. These were: a Senator Wellstone amendment to eliminate the $225 million Push into Southern Colombia program and instead use the funds for domesticsubstance abuse and mental health services, tabled 89-11; a Senator Gorton amendment to reduce total Plan Colombia funding to $200 million, which could be spent in Colombia and otherCaribbean, Central and South American countries at the discretion of the Secretary of State, rejected19-79; a Senator Dodd amendment to provide not less than $110 million for procurement and support of helicopters, but to permit the Departmentof Defense to decide in consultation with the Colombian military which model or models should be purchased,rejected 47-51. By voice vote, the Senate approved several amendments on Colombia. These included a Senator Shelby amendment to exempt certain intelligence andintelligence-related activities from the limitation on the assignment of U.S. personnel in Colombia; a Senator InhofeSense of the Senate condemnation of thepresumed FARC kidnapping of three Americans; Senators Sessions and Leahy amendments adding and clarifyingreporting and certification requirements; aSenator Byrd amendment loosening conditions and limitations on funds for and personnel in Colombia; and aSenator Harkin clarification of an earmark for childsoldiers. The chair tabled a Senator Boxer amendment to prohibit the use of funds from the act and from Departmentof Defense funds for four purposes related toU.S. support for and participation in counterinsurgency, law enforcement, and counternarcotics operations inColombia.  Some $1.289 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations was included for Plan Colombia in the conference version of H.R. 4425 ( H.Rept.106-710 , filed June 29,) Military Construction appropriations for FY2001. The report was passed by the House onJune 29 and by the Senate on June 30, andsigned into law on July 13 ( P.L. 106-246 ).  The conference committee version of Plan Colombia included some $154.06 million in Department of Defense counternarcotics funding (compared to $185.8million provided in the House and $85.7 million provided in the Senate. The Senate and conference version alsoincluded $30 million under the DODsupplemental title for an Airborne Reconnaissance Low aircraft, in addition to Plan Colombia funding.) Theconference report also included some $1,018.5million in State Department funding for the Plan (compared to $1,099.0 million in the House and $934.1 millionin the Senate). Under a contingent emergencysupplemental funding military construction provision, the conference report included $116.5 million for threeforward operating locations, as did the Senate,compared to $38.6 million in the House. Some $860.2 million or 67% was appropriated to support programs in Colombia. The largest sum - some $416.9 million - was for helicopter, training, andother assistance to three Colombian Army counternarcotics battalions. Some $115.6 million was provided for theanti-drug operations of the Colombian NationalPolice, and $99.8 million for Colombian interdiction efforts. Other assistance included $58.5 million in economicand alternative development and employmentassistance; $47.5 million in assistance to displaced persons (included $25 million for persons who would be affectedby the Push into Southern Colombiaprogram); $53.5 million for human rights; $65.5 million for administration of justice, rule of law, and othergovernance programs; and $3.0 million for the peaceprocess. On the most controversial issues or disparate points, the conference report:  Provided a total of $294.0 million for helicopter procurement and sustainment for the Army counternarcotics battalions and police, comparedto the Administration request and House action of $388.0 million and the Senate action of $118.5;  Fully funded House and Senate increases in funding for human rights in Colombia, but cuts funding for other governanceaccounts; Contained the Senate's human rights conditionality on funding, but also provides a national security waiver; and  Earmarked in regional funding $110 million for Bolivia, of which at least $85.0 million is to be used for alternative development, and $20million for Ecuador, of which at least $8.0 million is to be used for regional development but provides no earmarkedfunding for Peru, unlike the House andSenate bills. These and other salient provisions are compared with House and Senate legislation in Tables 4 and 5 , below. Six new limitations were placed on funding for Plan Colombia, and one restriction was placed on the use of other funds for Plan Colombia. Under Section3201(a)(3), the law also conditioned the assistance provided through the Department of State funding on theprovisions of the two existing Leahy amendments(Section 564 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2000, P.L.106-113 , and Section 8098 of the Department ofDefense Appropriations Act, 2000, P.L.106-79 , as cited above).  Limitation on Use of Helicopters. The law provided for the return to the United States of any helicopter procured with its funding that is used to aid or abet the operations of an illegal self-defense group or securitycooperative. ( H.Rept. 106-710 , p. 63.) Personnel Caps. In order to assign more than 500 U.S. military personnel for temporary or permanent duty insupport of Plan Colombia, or hire more than 300 individual civilian contractors for the same purpose, the lawprovided that Congress' approval must be securedthrough the enactment of a joint resolution, as specified in Section 3203. This condition can be waived once, in theevent that U.S. Armed Forces are involved inor facing imminent hostilities. The joint explanatory statement of the conferees stated that the caps did not applyto military personnel who are not directlysupporting Plan Colombia. ( H.Rept. 106-710 , p. 171.) Funding Cap on Department of Defense Assistance. Section 3101(a) set a cap of $45 million from DOD fundsfor the types of counternarcotics support detailed in Section 1033 of the P.L. 105-85 for programs of theGovernment of Colombia. Limitations on Use of Department of Defense Assistance. Section 3101(b) limited the use of DOD funds to thetypes of support allowable under Section 1033 (c)(1) of P.L.105-85 , the National Defense Authorization Act forFY1998. (This, in turn, referred to Section1031(b)(1) and (2) of P.L.104-201 , the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1997.) The allowable aid waslimited to various types of non-lethal assistance,including protective and utility personnel equipment; specialized equipment; navigation, communications, photo,radar and night vision repairs, equipment andparts; and components, accessories, parts, firmware, software for aircraft and patrol boats, and related radarequipment. Restriction on Visas. Section 3205 prohibited the State Department from issuing a visa to any person \"credibly alleged to have provided direct or indirect support for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia(FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), orthe United Colombian Self-Defense organization (AUC), including conspiracy to allow, facilitate, or promote theillegal activities of such groups.\" The Presidentcan waive this condition on national interest grounds. Exemptions were provided for medical reasons, prosecutionin the United States, and cooperation withinvestigations of crimes committed by FARC, ELN or AUC members. Population Planning Restriction. Section 3206 made all funding appropriated under Plan Colombia \"or anyother provision of law for fiscal year 2000\" subject to the population planning restrictions of Section 599(d) of TitleII of the Foreign Operations, ExportFinancing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2000 ( H.R. 3422 ), as enacted into law by reference insection 1000(a)(2) of P.L.106-113 , theConsolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000. Overall Limitation on Funding. Section 3204 prohibited the use of any funds for Plan Colombia other thanthose specifically appropriated by this act or by other specified FY2001 appropriations acts or those taken fromunobligated balances for other programs servingsimilar purposes, unless specifically allowed by an Act of Congress. As enacted, Plan Colombia required four Administration certifications and three reports to Congress prior to the obligation of fund for each FY2000 and FY2001,and six subsequent one-time or periodic reports. In approximate chronological order, the certification and reportingrequirements are: Initial Reports on the Proposed Uses of Funds. Within 30 days of enactment, i.e., by August 12, 2000 , andprior to any obligation of funds, the Administration must provide two reports on the proposed use of funds. Underthe State Department funding provisions, TitleIII, Chapter 2, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the AID Administrator mustreport to the appropriations committees on theproposed uses, by country for each program, project, or activity, of all funds provided through the Department ofState. ( H.Rept. 106-710 , Title III, Chapter 2, p.63.) The Conferees' explanatory statement directed the Secretary of Defense to report to the appropriationscommittees no later than 30 days after enactment, i.e., August 12, 2000 , on the proposed uses for Department of Defense funds provided under TitleIII, Chapter 1, and steps taken to ensure maximum force protection,including the rules of engagement. It also directed the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to report todefense committees 15 days before any obligation ortransfer of funds for uses not consistent with the specific purposes of the Administration request and the statementof the managers. ( H.Rept. 106-710 , p. 165.) Clinton Administration Action. The State Department submitted this report to Congress on July 27, 2000. (Postedby the Center for International Policy at http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/080102.htm . Initial Human Rights Certifications and Subsequent Reports. Prior to the obligation of FY2000 and of FY2001assistance provided through the State Department funding (Title III, Chapter 2), Section 3201 required the Secretaryof State to certify to the appropriations andforeign affairs committees that the Colombian government and the Colombian armed forces have met six humanrights criteria. These were: that the President of Colombia has directed in writing that Colombian Armed Forces personnel who are credibly alleged to have committedgross violations of human rights be brought to justice in Colombia's civilian courts;  that the Colombian Armed Forces Commander General promptly suspend from duty any ColombianArmed Forces personnel who werecredibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights or to have aided or abetted paramilitarygroups; that the Colombian Armed Forces and its Commander General were fully complying with the abovepresidential directive and with the abovesuspension criterion;  that the Colombian Armed Forces and its Commander General were cooperating fully with civilianauthorities in investigating, prosecuting,and punishing in civilian courts Colombian military personnel who are credibly alleged to have committed grossviolations of human rights; that the Colombian government vigorously prosecuted in civilian courts the leaders and members ofparamilitary groups and militarypersonnel assisting them; and  that the Colombian Armed Forces developed and deployed in their field units a Judge AdvocateGeneral Corps to investigate ColombianArmed Forces personnel for misconduct.  Another condition required a statement regarding the Colombian government counternarcotics strategy, as cited in the next section, below. The President couldwaive compliance with these conditions if he deemed it in the national interest. Before issuing this certification,the Secretary must have consulted withinternationally-recognized human rights groups on these matters.  In addition, in the joint explanatory statement, the conferees stated that they expected subsequent reports on compliance with these and related specified humanrights conditions regarding members of the military and paramilitary, and on other matters within 60 days afterenactment, i.e., September 11, 2000, and every180 days thereafter . The three additional subjects to be covered were: (1) the extent to whichinvestigations and prosecutions are proceeding of thoseresponsible for attacks against human rights defenders, government prosecutors and investigators, and officials ofthe civilian judicial system in Colombia; (2) thenumber of civilian displaced by the Push into Southern Colombia and the actions taken to address their social andeconomic needs; and (3) the actions taken bythe United States and the Colombian government to promote a negotiated settlement of the Colombian conflict.( H.Rept. 106-710 , pp. 171-172.) Clinton Administration Action. On August 22, 2000, President Clinton waived five of the six human rightscertification requirements, after the State Department had determined that the only criteria met by the Colombiangovernment was the issuance of the requiredpresidential directive on August 17. In an August 18 certification issued by the acting Secretary of State, the actingSecretary determined that while theColombian government was \"actively taking steps to meet the other conditions on assistance...more work needs tobe done before the Administration can certifythe six remaining conditions of Section 3201, five of which address human rights-related criteria.\" (For furtherinformation, see the State Department pressstatement at http://secretary.state.gov/www/briefings/statements/2000/ps000823.html , available as of August 24,2000. The lengthy Memorandum ofJustification released in connection with the Presidential waiver detailed the progress made in the criteria areas andthe Administration's continuing concernsabout them. On September 11, 2000, the Clinton Administration submitted the 60-day report. Available at http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/091101.htm .  In January 2001, the Clinton Administration determined that a second certification was not required. (All State Department funding had been obligated inFY2000.) However, on January 19, President Clinton issued a White House report on progress towards thecertification requirement, which found that whileprogress had been made, \"more needs to be done.\" Available at http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/011902.htm .As with the August certification, human rightsgroups issued their own, less favorable perspective on the situation. For their reports, see the websites of AmnestyInternational, Human Rights Watch, or theWashington Office on Latin America.) Bush Administration Action. As of the date of this report, the Bush Administration was still processing the reportrequired in March 2001, according to a State Department official. Initial Certification on Colombian Drug Strategy. Section 3201 also prohibited the obligation or expenditure offunds provided under the State Department funding in Title III, Chapter 2, until the President certified to theappropriations and foreign affairs committees thatColombia had agreed to and was implementing a strategy to eliminate coca and opium poppy production by 2005through a mix of alternative developmentprograms; manual eradication; aerial spraying of chemical herbicides; tested, environmentally safe mycoherbicides;and the destruction of illicit narcoticslaboratories. Clinton Administration Action. The President waived this requirement in his August 22 action on Plan Colombia. The Memorandum of Justification accompanying the presidential waiver determination stated that the\"Administration does not believe that this criterion can bemet. The Colombian Government in Plan Colombia has set a goal of eliminating 50 percent of the drug cropcultivation within five years (October 2005). Thistarget is in keeping with the much-heralded reductions achieved in Peru and Bolivia. A 50 percent reduction issignificant, realistic, and obtainable.\" Thedetermination also stated that the total elimination of coca and poppy production by 2005 would require moreresources than contemplated under Plan Colombia. Initial Certification of U.S. Support for Negotiated Settlement, and Subsequent Reports. Prior to the obligationof any funds for FY2000, and then again for FY2001, under Section 3207 the Secretary of State must have certifiedthat the United States government supportedColombia's military and political efforts to be \"consistent with human rights conditions in section 3101, necessaryto effectively resolve the conflicts with theguerrillas and paramilitaries that threaten the territorial integrity, economic prosperity, and rule of law in Colombia.\" As referred to under the section above on theinitial human rights certifications, the conferees also wanted a discussion of the actions taken by the United Statesand the Colombian government to promote anegotiated settlement of the Colombian conflict, as part of the follow-up reports on human rights conditions \"expected\" on September 11, 2000 and every 180days thereafter. ( H.Rept. 106-710 , p. 172.) Clinton Administration Action. Certification submitted mid-August, 2000, with a memorandum of justification.

Clinton Administration Action. Numerous reports submitted, one for each contract signed, beginning August 29,2000. Initially, at least, the contracts were unclassified.  Reports on Private Contractors. The conferees' joint explanatory statement directed the Assistant Secretary ofDefense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict to report monthly to the defensecommittees (1) identifying all private firms providing support to PlanColombia, (2) specifying the number of American citizens located abroad to execute supporting contracts, and (3)specifying the number of military personnel andU.S. government employees operating in Colombia and the surrounding region in support of Plan Colombia. ( H.Rept. 106-710 , p. 165.)  Clinton Administration Action. These reports are classified, but according to a State Department official, the firstreport was submitted in January 2001, and subsequent reports were prepared.

The report indicates thatglyphosate and other the ingredients in the mixture sprayed on coca crops in Colombia are safe when used accordingto label instructions. It notes that theColombian government has approved two of the additives, while classifying them as \"lightly toxic.\" The report isavailable at http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/012301.htm .

Bush Administration Action. This report has been prepared and is awaiting the President's approval as of early July2001, according to an official of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). Report on Presence of Military Personnel and Contractors If Specified Caps are Exceeded. A report would berequired if Congress were to allow the Administration to exceed specified caps on the placement of U.S. militarypersonnel and U.S. individual citizen contractorsin Colombia in support of Plan Colombia. If such a joint resolution were passed, the President would have to reportto Congress under section 3204 (f) within 90days of enactment, and every 60 days thereafter, on the aggregate number of all such military personnel andcontractors, their locations, activities, and lengths ofassignment. Provisions of the FY2001 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 106-398, H.R. 4205/H.R.5408). The conference version, signed into law October 20, 2000, extends DOD authority to providecounternarcotics assistance toColombia under Section 1033 of P.L. 105-85 (the DOD authorization act for FY1998 and FY1999) from FY2002through FY2006. This extension was containedin the Senate version ( S. 2549 as incorporated in H.R. 4205 as a substitute amendment). (Both Senateand conference versionsmaintained an expiration date of FY2002 for Peru, the other country covered under Section 1033.) The conferenceversion did not, however, raise the cap on theamount that could be spent under that section. While the Senate would have set a cap of assistance in any one fiscalyear at $10 million for Peru and $40 millionfor Colombia, the conference version retained the cap of $20 million for both countries combined.  The conferees also set three reporting requirements regarding counterdrug assistance. Section 1022 required a report, due, and submitted, by January 1,2001 , detailing FY2000 expenditures in direct or indirect support of the counterdrug activities of foreigngovernments. Two others were due February 1, 2001 . Section 1023 required a recommendation on whether to expand Section 1033 authority to other countries. Section1024 required a report on the Section 1033riverine program.  The conferees did not include a limitation, contained in the House version, capping at 500 the number of armed forces personnel supported by funds from and onduty in Colombia at any one time, with four exceptions. These were: those participating in the emergency rescueof U.S. military or U.S. government civilianpersonnel; those participating in natural disaster relief efforts; those assigned to the U.S. embassy as an attache,security assistance officer, or serving as a memberof the Marine security contingent; transient personnel; and transient personnel.  Provisions of the \"Leahy Amendments\". Since FY1997, Congress has restricted funding in foreign operationsappropriations acts through the \"Leahy Amendment,\" prohibiting assistance to units of foreign security forces whichhave committed gross violations of humanrights, unless the responsible members are brought to justice. This provision was included in the House, Senate,and conference versions of the FY2001 ForeignOperations appropriations bill (Section 563, P.L. 106-429 , H.R. 4811 , signed into law November 16, 2000).  Congress first attached another \"Leahy Amendment\" restriction to Department of Defense appropriations enacted in FY1999, and extended it in FY2000 andFY2001 legislation (Section 8092 of the DOD appropriations for FY2001, P.L.106-259 , H.R. 4576 , signedinto law August 9, 2000). This prohibitsthe use of any funds appropriated by the act to support training programs for units of security forces of which amember has committed a gross violation of humanrights, unless \"corrective steps have been taken.\" Both provisions have also been attached to the Plan Colombia aid,as noted above in the section on \"ConditionsPlaced on Plan Colombia Assistance.\"  Text of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Leahy Amendment. \"None of the funds made available by this Actmay be provided to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of State has credible evidenceto believe such unit has committed grossviolations of human rights, unless the Secretary determines and reports to the Committees on Appropriations thatthe government of such country is takingeffective measures to bring the responsible members of the security forces unit to justice: Provided , Thatnothing in this section shall be construed to withholdfunds made available by this Act from any unit of the security forces of a foreign country not credibly alleged to beinvolved in gross violations of human rights: Provided further , That in the event that funds are withheld from any unit pursuant to this section, theSecretary of State shall promptly inform the foreigngovernment of the basis for such action and shall, to the maximum extent practicable, assist the foreign governmentin taking effective measures to bring theresponsible members of the security forces to justice.\"  Text of the Defense Appropriations Leahy Amendment. \"SEC. 8092. TRAINING AND OTHER PROGRAMS. (a)PROHIBITION- None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to support any training programinvolving a unit of the security forces of a foreigncountry if the Secretary of Defense has received credible information from the Department of State that the unit hascommitted a gross violation of human rights,unless all necessary corrective steps have been taken. (b) MONITORING- The Secretary of Defense, in consultationwith the Secretary of State, shall ensure thatprior to a decision to conduct any training program referred to in subsection (a), full consideration is given to allcredible information available to the Departmentof State relating to human rights violations by foreign security forces. (c) WAIVER- The Secretary of Defense, afterconsultation with the Secretary of State, maywaive the prohibition in subsection (a) if he determines that such waiver is required by extraordinary circumstances.(d) REPORT- Not more than 15 days after theexercise of any waiver under subsection (c), the Secretary of Defense shall submit a report to the congressionaldefense committees describing the extraordinarycircumstances, the purpose and duration of the training program, the United States forces and the foreign securityforces involved in the training program, and theinformation relating to human rights violations that necessitates the waiver.\"  On July 18, 2000, five days after President Clinton signed the Plan Colombia legislation into law, the chairmen of three House committees and 14 otherrepresentatives wrote House Speaker Hastert and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee ChairmanSonny Callahan requesting that additionalassistance to the Colombian National Police be added during conference action on the FY2001 Foreign Operationsappropriations bill ( P.L. 106-429 , H.R. 4811 ). Chairmen Burton (Government Reform), Goss (Intelligence), and Gilman (InternationalRelations) and the other members asked for$99.5 million for additional aircraft and helicopters, spare parts, equipment, weapons, and ammunition for CNPanti-drug operations. Funding was added inconference to the bill for counternarcotics assistance; according to a State Department official some $13 million isto be allocated for support to Colombia,including helicopter-related assistance. In October 2000, the GAO reported that the United States was still developing implementation plans for Plan Colombia, and as a result \"agencies do not expect tohave many of the programs to support Plan Colombia in place until late 2001.\" (8) As of February 2001, U.S. agencies reported that assistance was flowing, withmuch hardware already delivered. Assistance delivered, in the case of military and police equipment, and otherwiseactually received in Colombia or committedthrough signed contracts with providers breaks down as follows: Delivery of Assistance to Army and Police Forces. The delivery of helicopters to the Colombian army andpolice is underway. Assistance for the army is being provided to the three counternarcotics battalions establishedwith U.S. assistance. The first began operationsin December 1999, and the second in December 2000, and the third in May 2001. Assistance to the police is beingprovided to the special counternarcotics unit. Colombia will receive in total under Plan Colombia funding 33 UH-1Ns, 30 Huey IIs, and 16 UH-60s (Blackhawks). Of these, all 33 UH -1Ns have beendelivered to the Colombian Army, 18 of them in October 2000, and 15 on February 2, 2001. Of the UH-60s, 14 willbe provided to the army and two to thepolice. The first three are scheduled for delivery in July 2001, the rest will be delivered in several tranches throughthe end of 2001. Of the Huey IIs, three arescheduled for delivery in December 2001, the remainder will be delivered through May 2002. All weaponry hasbeen delivered to the Army counternarcoticsbattalions (i.e., 120 M-60 machine guns, 36 M-24 sniper rifles, 12 Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers, and 2460 mm mortars). Delivery of other equipmentand ammunition proceeds.  Commitment of Plan Colombia Funds. By mid-2001, a substantial amount of Plan Colombia funding hadbeen not only obligated to through the signing of an agreement with the Colombian government, but also actuallycommitted through the signing of a contract withthe organization or company which would actually provide a service or good. The follow is a breakdown of theamounts of such contractual commitments enteredinto as of mid-2001. In virtually all cases where a commitment has been made, at least some of the funding hasactually been spent. Department of State Funding. By May 31, 2000, just over 84% of the funding for Colombia administered by theDepartment of State had been committed: $543.1 million of $645 million appropriated, according to informationprovided by the Bureau of InternationalNarcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Of this, the largest amount committed is for Push into Southern Colombiaprograms: some $327.6 million - or 88% -of the $372.5 million appropriated. (Of this, $365.5 million is for the purchase of helicopters and other assistancefor the Colombian Army counternarcoticsbattalions, and $7 million for the emergency resettlement and employment of persons displaced in the program area;of the $7 million, all had been committed.) Aside from a small amount of money ($3 million) with which the State Dept. is responsible for alternative andeconomic development, which was 100%committed, the category in which the highest percentage of funds has been committed is for human rights andjudicial reform. There, some 92% of the funds, or$87.6 million of $94.5 million appropriated, have been committed. (Of the appropriated amount, some $88 millionis managed by the Department of the Treasuryand the Department of Justice, which jointly coordinate 12 administration of justice programs.) For interdictionactivities funded by the State Department, 78%, or$46.4 million, of the $59.4 million appropriated has been committed, and for the Colombian National Police, 68%,or $78.4 of the $115.6 million appropriated,has been committed.  The Agency for International Development Assistance (AID) is responsible for some $119.5 million in funding for the Colombia programs, as appropriatedunder the State Department sections of the bill. Of this, some 74%, or $88.7 million, had been committed bymid-April 2001, according to figures provided byAID. In addition, AID had committed half of the $4 million appropriated for AID operating expenses by PlanColombia legislation, and all $5 million foralternative development and $4 million for the administration of justice and human rights programs appropriatedin the FY2000 core (i.e. regular appropriations)budget. Under the rubric of alternative development , all $42.5 million of the Plan Colombia funding administered by AID had been committed. This includes all of theenvironmental programs ($2.5 million), the voluntary eradication programs ($30.0 million), and the alternativedevelopment in southern Colombia ($10.0million).  In category of human rights and judicial reform , some 43% or $21.2 million of $49.5 million administered by AID had been committed. The largest amountsappropriated in this area were the least committed: only $2.7 million of the $10 million appropriated forcommunity-level alternative development was committedas of that point, and all $12 million of the assistance to local governments was scheduled to be appropriated inSeptember 2001. For six judicial assistanceprograms, all $11 million appropriated had been committed. (These were programs for judicial system policyreform, criminal code reform, and judges training,and for the casas de justicia , the public defender, and the prevention of corruption programs.) For theprotection of human rights workers program, half of the $4million appropriated had been committed, and 43% or $3 million of the $7 million appropriated for thestrengthening of human rights institutions had beencommitted. Only $1 million of the $3 million appropriated for conflict management and the peace process had beencommitted. The full $2.5 million for therehabilitation of child soldiers had been obligated. Almost 91% of the $27.5 million handled by AID for programs related to displaced persons had been committed. This included all $19.5 million appropriatedfor assistance for internally displaced persons, and $5.5 million of the $8.0 million handled by AID for thetemporary emergency resettlement and employment ofpersons displaced by the Push into Southern Colombia program.  Department of Defense Funds. Some $91.8 million was allocated to the Department of Defense for training andother assistance to the Push into Southern Colombia program, and for support for Colombian interdiction efforts. As of July 5, 2001, all but $10.9 million of thathad been obligated, and the remainder is expected to be obligated by the end of FY2001. Because of DODaccounting and disbursement procedures, however, theamounts that have actually been committed through signed contracts or other methods are not available.  In addition, as indicated by figures provided by the Department of Defense (See Table 1 ), some of the $62.3 million appropriated for classified programs isapparently being used for purposes that support both U.S. and Colombian activities.  Table 2. Overview of Plan Colombia Funding for Colombia and Status of Commitment* of Funds Provided in the StateDepartment Sections of P.L. 106-246 ($ millions) * \"Commitments\" are funds for which the United States actually has signed a contract with the provider of a good or service.  a Percents based on combined DOS/DOD. On April 9, 2001, the Bush Administration requested $731 million in FY2002 funding for a broader regionalstrategy called the Andean Counterdrug Initiative(ACI) that would include funding from the International Narcotics Control account (INC) for not only Colombia,but also Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru,and Venezuela. Subsequently, the Bush Administration referred to this and funding from other specified accountsfor these countries as the Andean RegionalInitiative (ARI), which totals some $882.29 million. (This does not include Department of Defense funding, whichhas yet to be announced.) For Colombia, the Bush Administration request for FY2002 will provide continued support for Plan Colombia legislation programs. (Note it is anticipated thatfunding provided through the Plan Colombia legislative will continue to be expended through FY2002.) The $399million requested for Colombia includes$146.5 million for economic, social and governance programs, and $252.5 million for counternarcotics and securityprograms.  The $146.5 million for social, economic, and governance programs in Colombia includes:  $61.5 million for programs to improve the justice system and the rule of law, to promote human rights,and to assist with anti-corruptionefforts and the peace process;  $60.5 million for the voluntary eradication of coca and heroin poppy crops, and for local governanceand civil societyprograms; $22.0 million for displaced persons, including $7 million in emergency relief and $15 million tosupport the education, health, and housingprograms of international organizations and non-governmental organizations; and  $2.5 million for other program support. The $252.5 million for counternarcotics and security programs in Colombia includes:  $87.5 million for support to the Colombian National Police, including funds for eradication, foraviation support, training, equipment andinfrastructure, and for logistical support; $79.5 million to training, operational support, logistical support, and capital investment for the Army'sHuey II and UH-60helicopters; $26.5 million to improve the infrastructure supporting counternarcotics operations, particularly forforce protectionpurposes; $13.5 million for Colombian Army units involved in counternarcotics operations;  $43.0 million in support for air, maritime, riverine, and ground interdiction;  $2.5 million in program support.

(See GAO report GAO-01-26.) Where contradictions existed, GAO data was preferred, and then otherprinted data was used. In particular, GAO useddata on the amounts of DOD drawdown assistance actually delivered in FY1996 through FY1998; other sourcesshow the amount authorized, i.e., $40.5 million inFY1996, $14.2 million in FY1997, and $41.1 million in FY1998. Because of a possible lack of data or inaccuracies,some yearly totals may be understated oroverstated, particularly prior to FY1996. Note: This chart includes direct U.S. foreign assistance (i.e., the categories usually counted as U.S. foreign aid, which are in italics), as well as the costs of goodsand services provided to Colombia from other U.S. government programs supporting counternarcotics efforts inColombia. The United States also provides asmall amount of DOD Excess Defense Articles (EDA) to Colombia. Other funds are spent in Colombia oncounternarcotics and other activities that areconsidered part of U.S. programs: for instance, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spends its own fundson joint operations in Colombia. DOD Section124 detection and monitoring funds cover U.S. operated radar systems in Colombia and elsewhere, and other costsof U.S. detection and monitoring of drugflights.  a In these years, there was assistance in this category of less than $50,000.
