    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Firearms Microstamping Evaluation \nand Study Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To conduct a comprehensive study of firearms \n        microstamping technology that can be incorporated into a \n        firearm during the manufacturing process in order to determine \n        whether the technology is workable and could be a cost-\n        effective law enforcement tool for use in criminal \n        investigations.\n            (2) To determine the cost to manufacturers, firearm owners, \n        and State governments of mandating the incorporation of \n        microstamping technology into a firearm.\n            (3) To determine what happens to the reliability of \n        firearms microstamping if non-metallic materials are used to \n        manufacture cartridge cases.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 12 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall enter into an \narrangement with the National Research Council of the National Academy \nof Sciences, which shall have sole responsibility for conducting under \nthe arrangement a study to examine:\n            (1) The design parameters for an effective and uniform \n        system of microstamping firearms and cartridge cases and how \n        this information will be stored and retrieved.\n            (2) To determine the cost to taxpayers of incorporating \n        microstamping technology into a firearm, including the cost of \n        any new or additional equipment for law enforcement, and \n        additional training forensic crime laboratories would need in \n        order to read the presence of a microstamp on ballistic crime \n        scene evidence.\n            (3) To identify whether there are domestic or international \n        patents applicable to any technology capable of being applied \n        in the manufacturing of a firearm, capable of placing a \n        microscopic array of characters that identify the make, model, \n        and serial number of the firearm, etched or otherwise imprinted \n        in two or more places on the interior surface or internal \n        working parts of a semiautomatic pistol firearm are transferred \n        by imprinting on each cartridge casing when the firearm is \n        discharged.\n            (4) To determine whether the normal operation of a firearm \n        over time and repeated firing adversely affects the quality, \n        reproducibility, and legibility of the firearms microstamping \n        impressions on a cartridge case, whether metallic or non-\n        metallic, fired in a microstamped firearm.\n            (5) To determine if, utilizing a broad and diverse spectrum \n        of pistols and handgun ammunition (both imported and \n        domestically produced) that is commercially available for sale \n        in the United States, a casing will be imprinted with a legible \n        microstamp.\n            (6) To determine the extra cost to manufacture firearms \n        incorporating firearms microstamping technology on a mass \n        production basis using manufacturing techniques and equipment \n        commonly in use in the firearms industry.\n            (7) The most effective method for casing recovery that can \n        be used to collect fired cases for entry into a microstamping \n        reading system and the cost of such recovery equipment.\n            (8) Which countries, if any, require the sale of \n        microstamped firearms and how effective microstamping has been \n        in investigating crimes committed with microstamped firearms.\n            (9) How many revolvers, manually operated handguns, \n        semiautomatic handguns, manually operated rifles, and \n        semiautomatic rifles are sold in the United States each year, \n        the percentage of crimes committed with revolvers, other \n        manually operated handguns, and manually operated rifles as \n        compared with semiautomatic handguns and semiautomatic rifles, \n        and the percentage of cases where spent shell casings are \n        recovered at a crime scene.\n            (10) Determine if, when implemented, microstamping would \n        encourage a shift to the use of firearms that do not \n        automatically eject spent casings, to neutralize microstamping \n        identification.\n            (11) A comprehensive list of environmental and \n        nonenvironmental factors, including modifications to a firearm \n        with common tools and interchangeable parts, that can remove or \n        change the identifying marks on a cartridge case so as to \n        preclude a scientifically reliable identification of a firearm \n        that has been microstamped, and whether these factors would \n        preclude the specimen from being admissible as evidence in a \n        court of law. This would also include leaving spent shell \n        casings from another firearm at a crime scene.\n            (12) The technical improvements in database management that \n        will be necessary to keep pace as the number of microstamped \n        firearms increases, and the estimated cost of any improvements.\n            (13) Legal issues that need to be addressed at the Federal \n        and State levels to obtain the type of information that would \n        be captured and stored as part of a national microstamping \n        identification program and the sharing of the information \n        between any State firearm identification systems and the \n        Federal firearm identification system.\n            (14) What storage and retrieval procedures guarantee the \n        integrity of information concerning a microstamped firearm for \n        an indefinite period of time and ensure proper chain of custody \n        and admissibility of microstamped evidence or images in a court \n        of law.\n            (15) The time, cost, and resources necessary to enter \n        microstamping information into a database listing all new \n        handguns sold in the United States and those possessed lawfully \n        by firearms owners.\n            (16) The time, cost, and resources necessary to retrofit \n        all firearms in the United States with microstamped parts and \n        the cost of entering that information into a database.\n            (17) The impediments to mandating the retrofitting of \n        firearms in private hands with microstamping technology, and \n        the potential cost to firearm owners of doing so.\n            (18) The cost to Federal and State law enforcement of \n        retrofitting firearms in their possession with microstamping \n        technology.\n            (19) Whether the cost of firearms microstamping technology \n        outweighs the investigative benefit to law enforcement.\n            (20) Whether State-based microstamping systems, or a \n        combination of State and Federal microstamping systems can be \n        used to create a centralized list of firearms owners.\n            (21) The cost-effectiveness of systems currently in use by \n        Federal and State law enforcement with regard to the forensic \n        identification of spent projectiles, and whether an approach \n        based on the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network \n        (NIBIN) supported by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, \n        and Explosives is superior to using State-based microstamping \n        initiatives.\n\nSEC. 4. CONSULTATION.\n\n    In carrying out this Act, the National Research Council of the \nNational Academy of Sciences shall consult with--\n            (1) Federal, State, and local officials with expertise in \n        budgeting, administering, and using a ballistic imaging system, \n        including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \n        Explosives, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n            (2) law enforcement officials who use ballistic imaging \n        systems;\n            (3) entities affected by the actual and proposed uses of \n        microstamping technology, including manufacturers, \n        distributors, importers, and retailers of firearms and \n        ammunition, firearms purchasers and owners and their organized \n        representatives, the Sporting Arms and Ammunition \n        Manufacturers' Institute, Inc., the National Shooting Sports \n        Foundation, Inc., and National Rifle Association; and\n            (4) experts in ballistics imaging, microstamping, and \n        related fields, such as the Association of Firearm and Tool \n        Mark Examiners, projectile recovery system manufacturers, and \n        universities that have conducted studies on microstamping \n        including the University of California at Davis.\n\nSEC. 5.
