FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since the creation of low-power television licenses by \n        the Federal Communications Commission, a small number of \n        license holders have operated their stations in a manner \n        beneficial to the public good providing broadcasting to their \n        communities that would not otherwise be available.\n            (2) These low-power broadcasters have operated their \n        stations in a manner consistent with the programming objectives \n        and hours of operation of full-power broadcasters providing \n        worthwhile services to their respective communities while under \n        severe license limitations compared to their full-power \n        counterparts.\n            (3) License limitations, particularly the temporary nature \n        of the license, have blocked many low-power broadcasters from \n        having access to capital, and have severely hampered their \n        ability to continue to provide quality broadcasting, \n        programming, or improvements.\n            (4) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has \n        added to the uncertainty of the future status of these stations \n        by the lack of specific provisions regarding the permanency of \n        their licenses, or their treatment during the transition to \n        high definition, digital television.\n            (5) It is in the public interest to promote diversity in \n        television programming such as that currently provided by low-\n        power television stations to foreign-language communities.\n\nSEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF LOW-POWER COMMUNITY TELEVISION BROADCASTING.\n\n    Section 336 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 336) is \namended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections \n        (g) and (h), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(f) Preservation of Low-Power Community Television \nBroadcasting.--\n            ``(1) Creation of class a licenses.--\n                    ``(A) Rulemaking required.--Within 120 days after \n                the date of enactment of the Community Broadcasters \n                Protection Act of 1999, the Commission shall prescribe \n                regulations to establish a class A television license \n                to be available to licensees of qualifying low-power \n                television stations. Such regulations shall provide \n                that--\n                            ``(i) the license shall be subject to the \n                        same license terms and renewal standards as the \n                        licenses for full-power television stations \n                        except as provided in this subsection; and\n                            ``(ii) each such class A licensee shall be \n                        accorded primary status as a television \n                        broadcaster as long as the station continues to \n                        meet the requirements for a qualifying low-\n                        power station in paragraph (2).\n                    ``(B) Notice to and certification by licensees.--\n                Within 30 days after the enactment of the Community \n                Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, the Commission \n                shall send a notice to the licensees of all low-power \n                televisions licenses that describes the requirements \n                for class A designation. Within 60 days after such date \n                of enactment, licensees intending to seek class A \n                designation shall submit to the Commission a \n                certification of eligibility based on the qualification \n                requirements of this subsection. Absent a material \n                deficiency, the Commission shall grant certification of \n                eligibility to apply for class A status.\n                    ``(C) Application for and award of licenses.--\n                Consistent with the requirements set forth in paragraph \n                (2)(A) of this subsection, a licensee may submit an \n                application for class A designation under this \n                paragraph within 30 days after final regulations are \n                adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. \n                Except as provided in paragraphs (6) and (7), the \n                Commission shall, within 30 days after receipt of an \n                application of a licensee of a qualifying low-power \n                television station that is acceptable for filing, award \n                such a class A television station license to such \n                licensee.\n                    ``(D) Resolution of technical problems.--The \n                Commission shall act to preserve the service area of \n                each low-power television licensee pending the final \n                resolution of the class A application of such licensee. \n                If, after granting certification of eligibility for a \n                class A license, technical problems arise requiring an \n                engineering solution to a full-power station's allotted \n                parameters or channel assignment in the digital \n                television Table of Allotments, the Commission shall \n                make such modifications, as necessary, to ensure \n                replication of the full-power digital television \n                applicant's service area, as provided for in section \n                73.622 of the Commission's regulations (47 CFR 73.622).\n            ``(2) Qualifying low-power television stations.--For \n        purposes of this subsection, a station is a qualifying low-\n        power television station if--\n                    ``(A)(i) during the 90 days preceding the date of \n                enactment of the Community Broadcasters Protection Act \n                of 1999--\n                            ``(I) such station broadcast a minimum of \n                        18 hours per day;\n                            ``(II) such station broadcast an average of \n                        at least 3 hours per week of programming that \n                        was produced within the market area served by \n                        such station, or the market area served by a \n                        group of commonly controlled low-power stations \n                        that carry common local programming produced \n                        within the market area served by such group; \n                        and\n                            ``(III) such station was in compliance with \n                        the Commission's requirements applicable to \n                        low-power television stations; and\n                    ``(ii) from and after the date of its application \n                for a class A license, the station is in compliance \n                with the Commission's operating rules for full-power \n                television stations; or\n                    ``(B) the Commission determines that the public \n                interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by \n                treating the station as a qualifying low-power \n                television station for purposes of this section, or for \n                other reasons determined by the Commission.\n            ``(3) Common ownership.--No low-power television station \n        authorized as of the date of enactment of the Community \n        Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 shall be disqualified for a \n        class A license based on common ownership with any other medium \n        of mass communication.\n            ``(4) Issuance of licenses for advanced television services \n        to television translator stations and qualifying low-power \n        television stations.--The Commission is not required to issue \n        any additional license for advanced television services to the \n        licensee of a class A television station under this subsection, \n        or to any licensee of any television translator station, but \n        shall accept a license application for such services proposing \n        facilities that will not cause interference to the service area \n        of any other broadcast facility applied for, protected, \n        permitted, or authorized on the date of filing of the advanced \n        television application.
