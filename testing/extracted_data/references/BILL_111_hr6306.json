FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Critical care medicine is the care for patients whose \n        illnesses or injuries present a significant danger to life, \n        limb, or organ function and require comprehensive care and \n        constant monitoring, usually in intensive care units.\n            (2) Each year, approximately five million Americans are \n        admitted into traditional, surgical, pediatric, or neo-natal \n        intensive care units.\n            (3) Nearly 80 percent of all Americans will experience a \n        critical care injury or illness as a patient, family member, or \n        friend of a patient.\n            (4) Critical care medicine consumes a significant amount of \n        financial resources, accounting for more than 13 percent of all \n        hospital costs.\n            (5) According to a 2006 report by the Health Resources and \n        Services Administration (``HRSA''), demand in the United States \n        for critical care medical services is on the rise, due in part \n        to the growing elderly population, as individuals over the age \n        of 65 consume a large percentage of critical care services.\n            (6) The HRSA report also found that the growing aging \n        population will further exacerbate an existing shortage of \n        intensivists, the physicians certified in critical care who \n        primarily deliver care in intensive care units, potentially \n        compromising the quality and availability of care.\n            (7) The demand on critical services and trained personnel \n        increases exponentially in the event of a natural disaster or \n        pandemic outbreak such as the H1N1 virus.\n            (8) Ensuring the strength of our critical care medical \n        delivery infrastructure is integral to the improvement of the \n        quality and delivery of health care in the United States.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assess the current \nstate of the United States critical care medical delivery system and \nimplement policies to improve the quality and effectiveness of care \ndelivered to the critically ill and injured.\n\nSEC. 3.
