FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n        United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n        prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs into \n        the United States.\n            (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n        apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to illegally \n        enter the United States, according to the Congressional \n        Research Service, the net growth in the number of unauthorized \n        aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 each year. The \n        Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 percent of all \n        migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, there are an \n        estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the United States.\n            (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n        shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n        Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n        markets of the United States enter the country through the \n        Southwest Border.\n            (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n        due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n        the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n        law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n        illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n        Southwest border counties.\n            (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n        declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n        enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n        activity along the Southwest border.\n            (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n        localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n        detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n        Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border are \n        provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must use \n        their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n        smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n        and other border-related crimes.\n            (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n        Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n        enforcement agencies located along the border are small, rural \n        departments charged with patrolling large areas of land. \n        Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico border are \n        some of the poorest in the country and lack the financial \n        resources to cover the additional costs associated with illegal \n        immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-related crimes.\n            (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n        enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n        challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n        international border and the lack of overall border security in \n        the region.\n\nSEC. 3. BORDER RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Grants Authorized.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary is authorized to award \n        grants to an eligible law enforcement agency to provide \n        assistance to such agency to address--\n                    (A) criminal activity that occurs in the \n                jurisdiction of such agency by virtue of such agency's \n                proximity to the United States border; and\n                    (B) the failure of the United States Government to \n                adequately secure its borders.\n            (2) Duration.--Grants may be awarded under this subsection \n        during fiscal years 2006 through 2010.\n            (3) Competitive basis.--The Secretary shall award grants \n        under this subsection on a competitive basis, except that the \n        Secretary shall give priority to applications from any eligible \n        law enforcement agency serving a community--\n                    (A) with a population of less than 50,000;

and\n                    (B) provide such additional assurances as the \n                Secretary determines to be essential to ensure \n                compliance with the requirements of this section.\n    (d) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n            (1) Eligible law enforcement agency.--The term ``eligible \n        law enforcement agency'' means a tribal, State, or local law \n        enforcement agency--\n                    (A) located in a county no more than 100 miles from \n                a United States border with--\n                            (i) Canada;
