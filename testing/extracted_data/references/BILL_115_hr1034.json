GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (in this \nAct referred to as the ``Administrator'') shall award grants to local \ngovernments or consortia of local governments, which may be acting in \ncoordination with one or more nongovernmental entities. The grants \nshall be used to develop solid waste prevention, reuse, and recycling \ntactics and operations, which may include--\n            (1) development or deployment of technologies or practices \n        to increase rates of waste prevention, reuse, recycling, or \n        composting;\n            (2) capital investment in infrastructure to start or expand \n        waste prevention, reuse, recycling, composting, or product \n        reuse programs;\n            (3) partnerships with local businesses interested in \n        incorporating new technologies or processes to reduce or \n        prevent waste in production or packaging; or\n            (4) community outreach and public education programming, \n        including programming to--\n                    (A) increase community knowledge of effective waste \n                prevention, reuse, recycling, or composting; and\n                    (B) increase behavior that will reduce overall \n                household waste generation.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANT REVIEW.\n\n    (a) Grant Awardees.--Grants shall be awarded under this Act to \napplicants that collectively represent a range of existing waste \nprevention, reuse, recycling, and composting rates. In order to be \nconsidered for this award, applicants must--\n            (1) set specific waste prevention, reuse, recycling, \n        composting, or public education goals that will bring \n        communities closer to zero waste;\n            (2) have a clearly established plan to use grant funds for \n        one or more of the purposes described in section 2; and\n            (3) meet other criteria as determined by the Administrator.\n    (b) Additional Factors.--Additional weight may be given to the \napplications of local governments or consortia that--\n            (1) have statutorily committed to zero waste principles;\n            (2) demonstrate job creation;\n            (3) have partnerships with domestic manufacturers who will \n        use locally recycled materials to spur the growth of domestic \n        manufacturing businesses and the creation of domestic \n        manufacturing jobs;\n            (4) address the disproportionate environmental, health, and \n        economic burden of waste disposal that is borne by communities \n        of color and low income;\n            (5) propose to use funds for waste prevention, reuse, or \n        recycling programs in schools;\n            (6) employ adaptive management practices to identify and \n        address unintended consequences as they arise, including \n        potential contamination of land, water, air, or food;\n            (7) have a demonstrated need for additional investment in \n        infrastructure and programs to achieve waste prevention, reuse, \n        or recycling;\n            (8) will drive technologies for product reuse, recycling, \n        composting, or waste prevention;\n            (9) demonstrate ways in which the grant will encourage \n        further investment in waste prevention, reuse, recycling, or \n        composting projects; or\n            (10) incorporate multistakeholder involvement, including \n        nonprofit, commercial, and public sector partners.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORTING.\n\n    Grant awardees shall report to the Administrator the results of \ntheir project and relevant data requested by the Administrator to track \nthe grant program's impact.\n\nSEC. 5. ANNUAL CONFERENCE.\n\n    The Administrator shall convene or co-convene an annual conference \nfor current, past, and potential grantees, and other stakeholders, to \nlearn from each other's experiences in moving toward a zero waste goal.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Recycling.--The term ``recycling'' means processing \n        material that has reached the end of its current use into \n        material utilized in the production of new products. The term \n        does not include incineration.\n            (2) Reuse.--The term ``reuse'' means extending the life of \n        a product, packaging, or resources by either using it more than \n        once for the same or a new function with little to no \n        processing, or repairing it so it can be used longer, sharing \n        or renting it, or selling or donating it to another party. The \n        term does not include incineration.\n            (3) Waste prevention.--The term ``waste prevention'' \n        includes--\n                    (A) measures or techniques that reduce the amount \n                of wastes generated during industrial production \n                processes; and\n                    (B) reuse, recycling, and other efforts to reduce \n                the amount of waste going into the waste stream.\n            (4) Zero waste.--The term ``zero waste'' is a goal that is \n        ethical, economical, efficient, and visionary, to guide people \n        in changing their lifestyles and practices to emulate \n        sustainable natural cycles, where all discarded materials are \n        designed to become resources for others to use. Zero waste \n        means designing and managing products and processes to \n        systematically avoid and eliminate the volume and toxicity of \n        waste and materials, conserve and recover all resources, and \n        not burn or bury them. Implementing zero waste will eliminate \n        all discharges to land, water, or air that are a threat to \n        planetary, human, animal, or plant health.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator \n$100,000,000 for the period encompassing fiscal years 2018 through 2023 \nfor carrying out this Act."
