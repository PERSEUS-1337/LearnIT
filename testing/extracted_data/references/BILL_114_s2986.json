CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 \n        (Public Law 99-508; 100 Stat. 1848) (referred to in this \n        section as ``ECPA'') was intended to protect the privacy of \n        electronic communications stored with providers of electronic \n        communications services and remote computing services, while \n        balancing the legitimate needs of law enforcement to access \n        records stored by such providers.\n            (2) To strike this balance, ECPA authorized governmental \n        entities to obtain certain categories of communications data \n        from providers using established, pre-existing forms of process \n        warrants and subpoenas. It also created a new form of court \n        order, in section 2703(d) of title 18, United States Code, that \n        governmental entities could use to obtain additional types of \n        communications data.\n            (3) Congress recognizes the legitimate needs of law \n        enforcement agencies in the United States to obtain, through \n        lawful process, electronic communications relevant to criminal \n        investigations, as well as the privacy interests of citizens of \n        foreign countries. Therefore, where the Government seeks to \n        obtain the contents of electronic communications of foreign \n        citizens located outside of the United States, this Act \n        authorizes the use of search warrants only if the foreign \n        government does not have a Law Enforcement Cooperation \n        Agreement with the United States or, if it does have such a Law \n        Enforcement Cooperation Agreement, the foreign government does \n        not object to disclosure.\n\nSEC. 3. EXTENSION AND CLARIFICATION OF WARRANT REQUIREMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 121 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended--\n            (1) in section 2702(a), by amending paragraph (3) to read \n        as follows:\n            ``(3) a provider of remote computing service or electronic \n        communication service to the public shall not knowingly divulge \n        to any governmental entity the contents of any communication \n        described in section 2703(a), or any record or other \n        information pertaining to a subscriber or customer of such \n        service.'';\n            (2) in section 2703--\n                    (A) by striking subsections (a) and (b) and \n                inserting the following:\n    ``(a) Contents of Wire or Electronic Communication in Electronic \nStorage.--A governmental entity may require the disclosure by a \nprovider of electronic communication service or remote computing \nservice of the contents of a wire or electronic communication that is \nin electronic storage with or otherwise stored, held, or maintained by \nthe provider, regardless of where such contents may be in electronic \nstorage or otherwise stored, held, or maintained, only pursuant to a \nwarrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of \nCriminal Procedure (or, in the case of a State court, issued using \nState warrant procedures) by a court of competent jurisdiction. An \napplication for a warrant under this section shall include a full and \ncomplete statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon and the \ninvestigative steps taken to ascertain the nationality and location of \nthe subscriber or customer whose contents are sought by the warrant. \nAny such warrant may be used to require the disclosure of contents of a \nwire or electronic communication only if the court finds that--\n            ``(1) the governmental entity has taken all reasonable \n        steps to establish the nationality and location of the \n        subscriber or customer whose contents are sought;
