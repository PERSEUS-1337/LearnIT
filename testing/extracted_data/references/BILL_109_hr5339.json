CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Fire Administration (USFA) of the \n        Department of Homeland Security encourages prevention, fire \n        sprinklers, smoke detectors, and planned escape routes as main \n        goals of avoiding casualties in residential and commercial \n        fires.\n            (2) Window bars are most prevalent in low-income areas and \n        high crime areas, where other security risks often overshadow \n        fire safety standards.\n            (3) According to the USFA, children, the elderly, persons \n        who are mobility-impaired, and firefighters are especially \n        vulnerable to fatalities or injuries involving residential \n        window bars.\n            (4) Persons have died in residential fires as a result of \n        being trapped by window bars in at least 14 States, including \n        Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, \n        Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, \n        Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.\n            (5) Some States, including Mississippi, California, Texas, \n        and, most recently, Oklahoma, have established safety standards \n        for window bars.\n            (6) On June 12, 2005, five children were killed in a house \n        fire in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when their escape was \n        prevented by ground-level, residential window bars.\n            (7) Collecting information on a national basis regarding \n        the risks and casualties caused by window bar entrapment during \n        residential fires will help in raising public awareness of such \n        risks and casualties.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF WINDOW BARS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act, the term ``window bars'' means any metal \nor other bars, grills, grates, heavy-duty screens, glazing, or other \nbarriers that are designed--\n            (1) to cover exterior and interior escape windows in \n        residential dwelling units; and\n            (2) to deter any physical security threats to the home, \n        including threats from burglars.\nSuch term does not include any such barriers that (A) protect children \nfrom falling from open windows in upper floors of buildings, and (B) \nprotect nonresidential or commercial properties.\n\nSEC. 4. SAFETY STANDARD FOR WINDOW BARS.\n\n    (a) Rulemaking Required.--The Consumer Products Safety Commission \n(in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'') shall initiate a \nrulemaking proceeding under section 553 of title 5, United States Code, \nwithin 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act to establish \na consumer product safety standard under section 7(a) of the Consumer \nProduct Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2056(a)) for window bars, except that the \nCommission may extend such 90-day period for good cause. \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, including chapter 5 of \ntitle 5, United States Code, the Commission shall promulgate a final \nrule establishing such consumer product safety standard within 12 \nmonths after the date on which the rulemaking pursuant to this \nsubsection is initiated, except that the Commission may extend such 12-\nmonth period for good cause. Such consumer product safety standard \nshall take effect upon the expiration of the 6-month period beginning \non the date on which the final rule establishing such standard is \npromulgated.\n    (b) Releasing System Requirement.--The standard established \npursuant to subsection (a) shall--\n            (1) require all window bars that are manufactured or \n        installed in the United States to incorporate releasing systems \n        that meet the minimum standards under subsection (c); and\n            (2) address releasing systems for interior- and exterior-\n        based window bars.\n    (c) Minimum Standards for Releasing Systems.--The minimum standards \nunder this subsection for releasing systems for window bars shall \nrequire that such systems--\n            (1) when actuated, can move such bars and provide egress to \n        occupants of residential dwelling units equipped with such \n        bars; and\n            (2) at a minimum, can be actuated manually from the \n        interior of a residential dwelling unit and provide escape \n        through the protected opening.\n    (d) Consultation.--In developing the standard pursuant to \nsubsection (a), the Commission shall consult with experts, including \nmanufacturers of window bars, housing and building codes authorities, \nand representatives of the United States Fire Administration, the \nNational Fire Protection Association, Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., \nofficials in States that have in effect window bar safety standards, \nand other similar public safety-related organizations.\n    (e) Enforcement.--Compliance with the consumer product safety \nstandard established pursuant to this section shall be enforced under \nthe Consumer Product Safety Act.\n\nSEC. 5. LABELING REQUIREMENT.\n\n    The Consumer Products Safety Commission shall require each \nmanufacturer selling, or offering for sale, in the United States, any \nwindow bars to include in the packaging for the window bars a written \nstatement clearly explaining how the window bars are to be configured \nand installed and the inclusion and operation of the releasing system \nincorporated pursuant to section 4(b).\n\nSEC. 6. FEDERALLY ASSISTED HOUSING.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that all public housing dwelling \nunits, all dwelling units assisted under section 8 of the United States \nHousing Act of 1937, all manufactured housing units, and all homes \npurchased using any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under the \nNational Housing Act or title 38, United States Code, should meet a \nminimal standard for use of window bars that requires such bars to \nincorporate an emergency releasing system.\n\nSEC. 7. PROVISION OF DATA.\n\n    The Commission shall establish and maintain a National Electronic \nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) code and system for collection of \ninformation and statistics on casualties associated with window bars.\n\nSEC. 8. NO EFFECT ON STATE LAW.\n\n    Notwithstanding section 26 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 \nU.S.C. 2075), this Act may not be construed to annul, alter, impair, \naffect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this Act from \ncomplying with any provision of the law of any State or any political \nsubdivision thereof, except to the extent that such provisions of State \nlaw are inconsistent with any provision of this Act, and then only to \nthe extent of the inconsistency. A provision of State law may not be \nconsidered to be inconsistent with this Act if such provision applies \nmore stringent requirements with respect to window bar releasing \nsystems than is afforded by this Act.\n\nSEC. 9. NOTICE.\n\n    The Commission shall promptly, upon the enactment of this Act, take \nsuch actions as may be appropriate to inform all manufacturers of \nwindow bars distributed in interstate commerce or installed within the \nUnited States of the provisions of this Act.\n\nSEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission for carrying out this Act such sums as may be \nnecessary for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011."
