POLICY.\n\n    (a) Security and Resilience.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, \nin coordination with the sector-specific agencies, may work with \ncritical infrastructure owners and operators and State, local, tribal, \nand territorial entities to seek voluntary participation of such \nagencies to determine how the Department of Homeland Security can best \nserve the sector-specific cybersecurity needs to manage risk and \nstrengthen the security and resilience of the Nation's critical \ninfrastructure against terrorist attacks that could have a debilitating \nimpact on national security, economic stability, public health and \nsafety, or any combination thereof.\n    (b) Objectives.--In implementing subsection (a), the Secretary \nshall seek to reduce vulnerabilities, minimize consequences, identify \nand disrupt terrorism threats, and hasten response and recovery efforts \nrelated to impacted critical infrastructures.\n    (c) Investigation of Best Means To Engage Owners and Operators.--\nThe Secretary, in coordination with the sector-specific agencies, may \ninvestigate the best means for engaging sector-specific agencies in \nparticipation in a voluntary cybersecurity information sharing, \nemergency support, and emerging threat awareness program.\n    (d) Listening Opportunity.--The Secretary shall establish voluntary \nopportunities for sector-specific agencies and critical infrastructure \nowners and operators to inform the Department of Homeland Security of \nsector-specific challenges to cybersecurity, including regarding--\n            (1) what needs they may have or may not have regarding \n        critical infrastructure protection; and\n            (2) how the Department of Homeland Security is or is not \n        helping to meet those needs that have been identified, through \n        voluntary participation.\n    (e) GAO Report.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall \nreport to the Congress by not later than 6 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act on the views, experiences, and preferences of \ncritical infrastructure owners and operators regarding the benefits of \nengaging in voluntary cybersecurity incident reporting, intelligence \ngathering, and technical support resources provided by the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n    (f) International Partners.--The Secretary shall, in consultation \nwith appropriate Federal agencies, establish terrorism prevention \npolicy to engage with international partners to strengthen the security \nand resilience of domestic critical infrastructure and critical \ninfrastructure located outside of the United States, or in its \nterritorial waters, on which the Nation depends.\n\nSEC. 3. STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES.\n\n    (a) Research and Report on the Most Efficient Means for Information \nExchange by Identifying Baseline Data and Systems Requirements for the \nFederal Government.--The Secretary shall facilitate the timely exchange \nof terrorism threat and vulnerability information as well as \ninformation that allows for the development of a situational awareness \ncapability for Federal civilian agencies during terrorist incidents. \nThe goal of such facilitation is to enable efficient information \nexchange through the identification of requirements for data and \ninformation formats and accessibility, system interoperability, and \nredundant systems and alternate capabilities should there be a \ndisruption in the primary systems.\n    (b) Implementation of an Integration and Analysis Function To \nInform Planning and Operational Decisions Regarding the Protection of \nCritical Infrastructure From Terrorism Events.--The Secretary of \nHomeland Security shall implement an integration and analysis function \nfor critical infrastructure that includes operational and strategic \nanalysis on terrorism incidents, threats, and emerging risks. Such \nfunction shall include establishment by the Secretary of integration of \ndata sharing capabilities with Fusion Centers that accomplish the \nfollowing:\n            (1) Determine the appropriate role that Fusion Centers may \n        fill in reporting data related to cybersecurity threat or \n        incident information regarding individuals or service providers \n        with access to or ongoing business relationships with critical \n        infrastructure.\n            (2) Determine whether or how the National Protection and \n        Programs Directorate and the National Cybersecurity and \n        Communications Integration Center may work with Fusion Centers \n        to report possible cybersecurity incidents.\n            (3) Determine a means for Fusion Centers to report \n        availability of critical infrastructure to support local, \n        State, Federal, tribal, and territorial law enforcement and the \n        provision of basic public services after disruption events such \n        as electric power brownouts and blackouts, accidents that \n        disrupt service, and vandalism to or near facilities.\n            (4) Categorize and prioritize cybersecurity intake risk \n        information based on relevance to critical infrastructure \n        owners or operators in the area served by the Fusion Center.\n            (5) Establish an emerging threat hotline and secure online \n        sector-specific cybersecurity incident reporting portal by \n        which information may be disseminated through Fusion Centers.\n            (6) Develop, keep up to date, and make available a Federal \n        agency directory of designated offices or individuals tasked \n        with responding to, mitigating, or assisting in recovery from \n        cybersecurity incidents involving critical infrastructure and \n        make the directory available on a voluntary basis to critical \n        infrastructure owners and operators.\n            (7) Establish a voluntary incident access portal with the \n        ability to allow users to determine the means, methods, and \n        level of incident reporting that is sector-specific and \n        relevant to the recipient as defined and controlled by the \n        recipient.\n            (8) Gather voluntary feedback from critical infrastructure \n        owners and operators on the value, relevance, and timeliness of \n        the information received, which shall include how they believe \n        information and the means used to disseminate that information \n        might be improved.\n            (9) Report to Congress every 2 years on the voluntary \n        participation of critical infrastructure owners and operators \n        in the programs established under this title.\n            (10) Implement a capability to collate, assess, and \n        integrate vulnerability and consequence information with threat \n        streams and hazard information to--\n                    (A) evaluate the impact of cybersecurity and \n                cyberphysical impacts of critical physical assets;\n                    (B) aid in prioritizing assets and managing risks \n                to critical infrastructure in impacted areas;\n                    (C) determine, through the voluntary cooperation of \n                critical infrastructure owners and operators, the \n                staffing and professional need for cybersecurity \n                critical infrastructure protection with Fusion Centers;\n                    (D) determine, through coordination with the \n                sector-specific agencies, the agency staffing needed to \n                support cybersecurity critical infrastructure \n                protection and report the findings to Congress;\n                    (E) research and report findings regarding the \n                feasibility of exploring terrorist incident \n                correlations between critical infrastructure damage, \n                destruction, and diminished capacity, and what occurs \n                during certain natural disasters;\n                    (F) anticipate interdependencies and cascading \n                impacts related to cyber telecommunications failures;\n                    (G) recommend security and resilience measures for \n                critical infrastructure prior to, during, and after a \n                terrorism event or incident;\n                    (H) evaluate interdependencies and cascading \n                impacts related to electric grid failures;\n                    (I) support post-terrorism incident management and \n                restoration efforts related to critical infrastructure;
