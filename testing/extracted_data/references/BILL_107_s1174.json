FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) recent studies have established that youth are \n        developmentally different from adults, and these developmental \n        differences need to be taken into account at all stages and in \n        all aspects of the adult criminal justice system;\n            (2) pretrial release or detention of juveniles awaiting \n        trial in adult criminal court should only occur after \n        consideration of their special characteristics and the nature \n        of their offenses;\n            (3)(A) if detained or incarcerated, juveniles under the \n        jurisdiction of an adult criminal court should be housed in \n        institutions or facilities separate from adult facilities until \n        their eighteenth birthday; and\n            (B) those juveniles should not have sight or sound contact \n        with adult inmates;\n            (4) juveniles detained or incarcerated under the \n        jurisdiction of an adult criminal court should be provided \n        access to programs that address their educational, substance \n        abuse treatment, health, mental health, and vocational needs;\n            (5) juveniles detained or incarcerated under the \n        jurisdiction of an adult criminal court should be provided with \n        the mechanisms to report instances of physical, mental, or \n        psychological abuse or intimidation, and allegations of such \n        abuse or intimidation should be promptly investigated, and if \n        proven correct, should be properly remedied;\n            (6) transfer to and sentencing of juveniles in the adult \n        criminal court system should be based on consideration of the \n        individual characteristics of the juvenile and the nature of \n        the offense committed;\n            (7) according to recent studies, juveniles who are placed \n        in adult facilities are more likely to commit future crimes;\n            (8) housing juveniles with, or in close proximity to, adult \n        inmates creates difficulties and potentially unsafe conditions \n        for jail and prison personnel, and juveniles and adult inmates, \n        since many adult jails and prisons lack the physical structure, \n        programming, and trained personnel to manage juveniles \n        effectively;\n            (9) according to the Department of Justice, the suicide \n        rate for juveniles in adult jails is nearly 8 times higher than \n        the rate in juvenile detention, and the highest rate of suicide \n        in jail occurs during the first 24 hours of commitment;\n            (10) according to the Department of Justice, juveniles in \n        adult facilities are 5 times more likely to be sexually \n        assaulted, twice as likely to be beaten by staff, and 50 \n        percent more likely to be attacked with a weapon than \n        adolescents in a juvenile facility; and\n            (11) rural States and economically depressed communities \n        have pronounced difficulties in providing secure custody for \n        juvenile offenders apart from adult inmates.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide incentives and funding \nassistance for States to reduce dangerous and unsafe conditions in the \ndetention and incarceration of juvenile offenders under the \njurisdiction of an adult criminal court, including separating those \njuvenile offenders from adult prisoners and ensuring that corrections \nofficers who supervise them receive training in supervision issues \nunique to juveniles.\n\nSEC. 4.
