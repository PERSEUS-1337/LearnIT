FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) attempts have been made to prohibit usurious interest \n        rates in America since colonial times;\n            (2) at the State level, 15 states and the District of \n        Columbia have enacted broadly applicable usury laws that \n        protect borrowers from high-cost payday loans and many other \n        forms of credit, while 34 states and the District of Columbia \n        have limited annual interest rates to 36 percent or less for 1 \n        or more types of consumer credit;\n            (3) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress enacted a \n        Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap for service members and \n        their families for covered credit products, as defined by the \n        Department of Defense, which curbed payday, car title, and tax \n        refund lending around military bases;\n            (4) notwithstanding such attempts to curb predatory \n        lending, high-cost lending persists in all 50 States due to \n        loopholes in State laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms of \n        credit, and the exportation of unregulated interest rates \n        permitted by preemption;\n            (5) due to the lack of a comprehensive Federal usury cap, \n        consumers annually pay approximately $17,500,000,000 for high-\n        cost overdraft loans, as much as $8,600,000,000 for storefront \n        and online payday loans, and nearly $900,000,000 for tax refund \n        anticipation loans;\n            (6) cash-strapped consumers pay on average 400 percent \n        annual interest for payday loans, 300 percent annual interest \n        for car title loans, up to 3,500 percent for bank overdraft \n        loans, 50 to 500 percent annual interest for loans secured by \n        expected tax refunds, and higher than 50 percent annual \n        percentage interest for credit cards that charge junk fees;\n            (7) a national maximum interest rate that includes all \n        forms of fees and closes all loopholes is necessary to \n        eliminate such predatory lending; and\n            (8) alternatives to predatory lending that encourage small \n        dollar loans with minimal or no fees, installment payment \n        schedules, and affordable repayment periods should be \n        encouraged.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.\n\n    The Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 141.
