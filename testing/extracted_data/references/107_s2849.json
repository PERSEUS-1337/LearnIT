    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Pancreatic Islet Cell \nTransplantation Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Approximately 1,000,000 individuals in the United \n        States have juvenile, or Type 1, diabetes.\n            (2) In individuals with juvenile diabetes, the body's \n        immune system attacks the pancreas and destroys islet cells \n        that produce insulin.\n            (3) Insulin is not a cure and individuals with juvenile \n        diabetes face the constant threat of devastating complications \n        as well as a drastic reduction in their quality of life and \n        shortening of their life span.\n            (4) The development of the ``Edmonton Protocol'' and \n        subsequent variations of that protocol, involving the \n        transplant of insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells into \n        individuals with juvenile diabetes, have brought us within \n        reach of a cure.\n            (5) Islet cell transplants have been hailed as the most \n        promising development in diabetes since the discovery of \n        insulin.\n            (6) Currently 80 percent of the approximately 70 patients \n        who have received islet cell transplants using variations of \n        the Edmonton Protocol have maintained normal glucose levels \n        without insulin injections after 1 year.\n            (7) One of the key hurdles in expanding the number of \n        patients enrolled in these protocols is the insufficient number \n        of pancreases available for islet cell transplantation.\n            (8) The Federal Government should promote policies and \n        regulations to increase the supply of pancreases for research, \n        to coordinate efforts and information in the emerging area of \n        islet cell transplantation, and to collect the data necessary \n        to move islet cell transplantation from an experimental \n        procedure to a standard therapy covered by insurance.\n\nSEC. 3. ORGAN PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATION CERTIFICATION.\n\n    Section 371 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 273) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) Pancreases procured by an organ procurement organization and \nused for islet cell transplantation or research shall be counted for \npurposes of certification or recertification under subsection (b).''.\n\nSEC. 4. INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON ISLET CELL TRANSPLANTATION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established within the Department of \nHealth and Human Services the Interagency Committee on Islet Cell \nTransplantation (in this section referred to as the ``Committee'').\n    (b) Membership.--The Committee shall be composed of a \nrepresentative from--\n            (1) the National Institute on Diabetes and Digestive Kidney \n        Diseases, who shall serve as chairperson of the Committee;\n            (2) the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \n        Diseases;\n            (3) the National Institute of Environmental Health \n        Sciences;\n            (4) the Health Resources and Services Administration;\n            (5) the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;\n            (6) the Department of Defense;\n            (7) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n            (8) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and\n            (9) other agencies and National Institutes of Health \n        representatives as determined appropriate by the chairperson \n        and Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n    (c) Duties.--\n            (1) Study.--The Committee shall conduct a study of--\n                    (A) the adequacy of Federal research funding for \n                taking advantage of scientific opportunities relating \n                to islet cell transplantation;\n                    (B) current policies and regulations affecting the \n                supply of pancreases for islet cell transplantation;\n                    (C) the effect of xenotransplantation on advancing \n                islet cell transplantation;\n                    (D) the effect of United Network for Organ Sharing \n                variances on pancreas retrieval and islet cell \n                transplantation; and\n                    (E) the existing mechanisms to collect and \n                coordinate outcome data from existing islet cell \n                transplantation trials.\n            (2) Recommendations.--The Committee shall develop \n        recommendations concerning the matters studied under paragraph \n        (1).\n            (3) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Committee \n        shall submit a report to the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services and the appropriate committees of Congress that shall \n        contain a detailed statement of the findings and conclusions of \n        the Committee, together with recommendations for such \n        legislation and administrative actions as the committee \n        considers appropriate to increase the supply of pancreases \n        available for islet cell transplantation.\n\nSEC. 5. STUDY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \nrequest that the Institute of Medicine conduct, or contract with \nanother entity to conduct, a study on the impact of islet cell \ntransplantation on the health-related quality of life and the economic \noutcomes for individuals with juvenile diabetes and the cost-\neffectiveness of such treatment.\n    (b) Matters Studied.--The study authorized under this section shall \nexamine and consider the health-related quality of life of juvenile \ndiabetes patients before and after pancreatic cell transplantation. \nOutcome measures shall include--\n            (1) clinical outcomes, including episodes of hypoglycemia \n        unawareness and the long-term development of diabetes-related \n        clinical complications, including nephropathy, neuropathy, \n        retinopathy, and vascular disease;\n            (2) health-related quality of life outcomes, including \n        patient levels of worry with respect to fear of hypoglycemia \n        episodes, the ability to perform basic life and work-associated \n        functions, and the impact on the quality of life of family \n        members and caregivers; and\n            (3) the cost-effectiveness of pancreatic islet cell \n        transplantation, as compared to both standard medical \n        management (such as continued daily insulin injections) and \n        whole pancreas transplantation, for patients with juvenile \n        diabetes.\n    (c) Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.--Cost-effectiveness analysis, as \ndescribed in subsection (b)(3), shall include standard health profile \ninstruments to assess post-treatment costs and benefits, including--\n            (1) direct measures, such as--\n                    (A) post-transplant health care resource \n                utilization; and\n                    (B) long-term health care resource utilization due \n                to diabetes complications, including nephropathy, \n                neuropathy, retinopathy, and vascular disease which can \n                extend to include sight loss and limb loss; and\n            (2) indirect measures, such as--\n                    (A) time lost at work; and\n                    (B) productivity analysis.\n\nSEC. 6.
