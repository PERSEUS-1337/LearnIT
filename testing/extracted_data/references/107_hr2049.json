    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in virtually every sector of society--health, defense, \n        transportation, agriculture, etc.--research is used to guide \n        policy choices;\n            (2) in education, however, research has not been \n        effectively utilized as a tool for informing policy and guiding \n        reform, with less than 0.03 percent of the $647,800,000,000 \n        spent on elementary and secondary education invested in \n        research of what educational techniques actually work and on \n        ways to improve teaching;\n            (3) the 1997 President's Committee of Advisors on Science \n        and Technology (PCAST) report entitled ``The Use of Technology \n        to Strengthen K-12 Education in the United States'' recommended \n        that our education research investment be increased to 0.5 \n        percent and that educational hypotheses be subjected to \n        appropriately rigorous evaluation;\n            (4) a significant body of research and knowledge on the \n        science of learning currently exists; however, educational \n        materials and practices are rarely aligned to this knowledge, \n        and new education theories are often incorporated in classrooms \n        on the basis of only tenuously supported data;\n            (5) a cultural divide between education researchers and \n        education practitioners--such as teachers--currently exists;\n            (6) an expert panel convened by the National Research \n        Council recommended in 1999 that more education research be \n        focused on issues of importance to education practitioners and \n        be conducted by teams of both traditional researchers and \n        teachers and other education practitioners;\n            (7) the education research effort to date is typified by a \n        largely scattershot approach, with little coordination of the \n        research effort or focus on particularly compelling questions; \n        and\n            (8) a 1999 report from the National Research Council \n        entitled ``Improving Student Learning'' recommended the \n        adoption of a national, strategic education research program \n        that would focus efforts on a limited number of the most \n        critically important research questions.\n\nSEC. 2. RESEARCH ON LEARNING.\n\n    (a) In General.--For the purpose of integrating scientific \ndisciplines in relation to research on learning, and gaining a better \nunderstanding of how such research and educational practice can be \nreconciled, the National Science Foundation shall continue to support \nresearch on learning, focusing on the following 4 areas:\n            (1) Brain research as a foundation for research on human \n        learning.\n            (2) Behavioral, cognitive, affective, and social aspects of \n        human learning.\n            (3) Science, mathematics, engineering, and technological \n        learning in formal and informal educational settings.\n            (4) Learning in complex educational systems.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the National Science Foundation for carrying out this \nsection $29,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $33,000,000 for fiscal year \n2003, and $37,000,000 for fiscal year 2004.\n\nSEC. 3.
