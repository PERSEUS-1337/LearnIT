CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress recognized that the Nation had a compelling \n        interest in preventing minors from being exposed to mailings \n        containing sexually oriented advertisements when it enacted \n        title 39, United States Code, section 3010, and title 18, \n        United States Code, sections 1735 and 1737.\n            (2) Congress required anyone sending a mailing containing \n        sexually oriented advertisements to place a mark or notice \n        prescribed by the Postal Service on the mailing envelope or \n        cover.\n            (3) E-mails may contain the same kind of sexually oriented \n        advertisements harmful to minors but there is presently no \n        comparable requirement that e-mails contain any marking or \n        notice to alert the recipient that the e-mail contains sexually \n        oriented advertisements.\n            (4) Requiring a marking or notice that an e-mail contains \n        sexually oriented advertisements will enable the parents of \n        minors to take the necessary steps to block such material and \n        thus protect their children from being exposed to such sexually \n        oriented advertisements.\n            (5) The National Institute of Standards and Technology \n        (hereinafter in this Act referred to as NIST), a nonregulatory \n        agency within the Commerce Department's Technology \n        Administration, is technologically competent to prescribe marks \n        or other signifiers that an e-mail contains sexually oriented \n        advertisements.\n    (b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the basis of \nthe findings in subsection (a), the Congress determines that--\n            (1) there is substantial government interest in the \n        regulation of unsolicited e-mails containing sexually oriented \n        advertisements that are forwarded to children; and\n            (2) the best method to regulate such unsolicited e-mails is \n        to enable the children or parents acting on behalf of the \n        children to screen or block such unsolicited e-mails using \n        marks or signifiers prescribed by the NIST.\n\nSEC. 3. CRIMINAL PROHIBITION AGAINST SENDING SEXUALLY ORIENTED MATERIAL \n              TO CHILDREN WITHOUT THE PRESCRIBED MARKINGS OR NOTICE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the NIST shall prescribe marks or notices to be \nincluded or affixed to any e-mail that contains a sexually oriented \nadvertisement forwarded to children. Such marks shall, to the extent \npossible, be made so that they may not be removed or altered.\n    (b) Punishment.--Whoever willfully and knowingly forwards to a \nminor an e-mail, that is carried on an instrumentality in or affecting \ninterstate or foreign commerce, that includes sexually oriented \nadvertisements but does not include the mark or notice as prescribed by \nthe NIST in subsection (a) of this section shall be fined under this \nAct or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n    (c) Punishment.--Whoever reproduces or manufactures any sexually \nrelated mail matter, intending or knowing that such matter will be \nforwarded to a minor in an e-mail in violation of subsection (b) of \nthis section, shall be fined under this Act or imprisoned not more than \n5 years, or both, for the first offense, and shall be fined under this \nAct or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both, for any second, or \nsubsequent offense. As used in this section the term ``sexually related \nmail matter'' means any matter described in subsection (d) of this \nsection.\n    (d) Definition.--The term ``sexually oriented advertisement'' means \nany advertisement that depicts, in actual or simulated form, or \nexplicitly describes, in a predominantly sexual context, human \ngenitalia, any act of natural or unnatural sexual intercourse, any act \nof sadism or masochism, or any other erotic subject directly related to \nthe foregoing. Material otherwise within the definition of this \nsubsection shall be deemed not to constitute a sexually oriented \nadvertisement if it constitutes only a small and insignificant part of \nthe whole, the remainder of which is not primarily devoted to sexual \nmatters.\n\nSEC. 4. CIVIL RELIEF: DAMAGES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Any parent of a minor may sue and recover damages \nand attorney's fees and court costs from whomever violates any \nprovision of this Act. In lieu of actual damages, the parent may \nrecover $10,000 for each and every violation.\n    (b) Limitation.--The parent shall not have a cause of action \nagainst the electronic mail service provider for merely transmitting \nthe offending e-mail.\n    (c) Confidential Procedure.--At the request of any party to an \naction brought pursuant to this section, the court may, in its \ndiscretion, conduct all legal proceedings in such a way as to protect \nthe secrecy and security of the computer, computer network, computer \ndata, computer program, and computer software involved in order to \nprevent possible recurrence of the same or a similar act by another \nperson and to protect any trade secrets of any party.\n    (d) Effect on Additional Remedies.--This section does not limit any \nparent's right to pursue any additional civil remedy otherwise allowed \nat law or equity."
