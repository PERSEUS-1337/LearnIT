    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONSENT OF CONGRESS.\n\n    The Congress consents to the November 12, 2002, Streamlined Sales \nand Use Tax Agreement.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the sales and use tax system \nestablished by the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, to the \nextent that it meets the minimum simplification requirements of section \n6, provides sufficient simplification and uniformity to warrant Federal \nauthorization to States that are parties to the Agreement to require \nremote sellers, subject to the conditions provided in this Act, to \ncollect and remit the sales and use taxes of such States and of local \ntaxing jurisdictions of such States. The purpose of this Act is to \neffectuate that limited authority, and not to grant additional \nauthority unrelated to the accomplishment of that purpose.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION TO REQUIRE COLLECTION OF SALES AND USE TAXES.\n\n    (a) Grant of Authority.--Once 10 States comprising at least 20 \npercent of the total population of all States imposing a sales tax, as \ndetermined by the 2000 Federal census, have petitioned for membership \nunder the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement in the manner \nrequired by the Agreement, have been found to be in compliance with the \nAgreement pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, have become Member \nStates under the Agreement, and the necessary operational aspects of \nthe Agreement have been implemented, any Member State under the \nAgreement is authorized, notwithstanding any other provision of law, to \nrequire all sellers not qualifying for the small business exception \nprovided under subsection (b) to collect and remit sales and use taxes \nwith respect to remote sales to purchasers located in such State. Such \nauthorization shall terminate for all States if the requirements of the \npreceding sentence cease to be met or if the Agreement, as amended, no \nlonger meets the minimum simplification requirements of section 6. Such \nauthorization shall also terminate for any Member State if such Member \nState no longer complies with the requirements for Member State status \nunder the terms of the Agreement. Determinations regarding compliance \nwith the requirements of this subsection shall be made by the Governing \nBoard (or, prior to the establishment of the Governing Board, by the \nStates petitioning for membership under the Agreement) subject to \nsection 5.\n    (b) Small Business Exception.--No seller shall be subject to a \nrequirement of any State to collect and remit sales and use taxes with \nrespect to a remote sale where the seller and its affiliates \ncollectively had gross remote taxable sales nationwide of less than \n$5,000,000 in the calendar year preceding the date of such sale. No \nseller shall be subject to a requirement of any State to collect and \nremit sales and use taxes with respect to a remote sale where the \nseller and its affiliates collectively meet the $5,000,000 threshold of \nthis subsection but the seller has less than $100,000 in gross remote \ntaxable sales nationwide.\n    (c) Reasonable Seller Compensation.--The authority provided in \nsubsection (a) is conditioned on acceptance and implementation by each \nMember State of a requirement that the State provide reasonable \ncompensation for expenses incurred by sellers related to the \nadministration, collection and remittance of sales and use taxes. \nFurthermore, the State shall provide compensation that covers all tax \nprocessing costs of remote sellers. The additional compensation \nprovided to remote sellers shall remain in effect for a period of 4 \nyears from the date that a State is granted the authority under this \nAct to require remote sellers to collect and remit sales taxes with \nrespect to remote purchasers located in such State.\n\nSEC. 5. DETERMINATION BY GOVERNING BOARD AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THAT \n              DETERMINATION.\n\n    (a) Petition.--Any person who may be affected by the Agreement may \npetition the Governing Board for a determination on any issue relating \nto the implementation of the Agreement.\n    (b) Review in Court of Federal Claims.--Any person who submits a \npetition under subsection (a) may bring an action against the Governing \nBoard in the United States Court of Federal Claims for judicial review \nof the action of the Governing Board on that petition if--\n            (1) the petition relates to an issue of whether--\n                    (A) a State has met or continues to meet the \n                requirements for Member State status under the \n                Agreement;\n                    (B) the Governing Board has performed a \n                nondiscretionary duty of the Governing Board under the \n                Agreement;\n                    (C) the Agreement continues to meet the minimum \n                simplification requirements set forth in section 6; or\n                    (D) any other requirement of section 4 has been \n                met; and\n            (2) the petition is denied by the Governing Board in whole \n        or in part with respect to that issue, or the Governing Board \n        fails to act on the petition with respect to that issue not \n        later than six months after the date on which the petition is \n        submitted.\n    (c) Timing of Action for Review.--An action for review under this \nsection shall be initiated not later than 60 days after the Governing \nBoard's denial of the petition, or, if the Governing Board failed to \nact on the petition, within 60 days after the end of the six-month \nperiod beginning on the day after the date on which the petition was \nsubmitted.\n    (d) Standard of Review.--In any action for review under this \nsection, the court shall set aside the actions, findings, and \nconclusions of the Governing Board found to be arbitrary, capricious, \nan abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n    (e) Jurisdiction.--\n            (1) Generally.--Chapter 91 of title 28 of the United States \n        Code is amended by adding at the end thereof:\n``Sec. 1510.

Jurisdiction regarding the streamlined sales and use tax \n                            agreement.''.\n\nSEC. 6.
