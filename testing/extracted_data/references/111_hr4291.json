    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Public Lands Rehabilitation and Job \nCreation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Park Service's (NPS) 67,000 park assets \n        include over 17,000 buildings, 4,000 housing units, 1,200 \n        campgrounds, 3,000 water and waste water systems, 5,000 miles \n        of paved roadways, and 18,000 miles of trails; in total, these \n        facilities have a replacement value in excess of $100 billion.\n            (2) The NPS's maintenance backlog can be traced to two \n        primary causes, the first being that new parks were added to \n        the National Park System with facilities that were frequently \n        in poor condition when transferred, and the second being that \n        inadequate funding and staffing over a number of years caused \n        routine maintenance to slip, slowly but steadily causing minor \n        problems to compound, leading to the need for major repairs and \n        in some cases, new construction.\n            (3) Over one-half of the backlogged infrastructure repair \n        and rehabilitation projects fall under the category of roads \n        and road-related infrastructure.\n            (4) To now reverse the backlog which has grown to nearly \n        $10 billion requires a concerted effort involving necessary \n        repairs and full funding of cyclic and routine maintenance \n        programs so that new problems can be treated at the earliest \n        possible stage.\n            (5) Although the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n        2009 (ARRA) provided a much needed infusion of funds to kick-\n        start repairs in a number of parks, the NPS has identified \n        approximately $3.2 billion in highest priority critical system \n        deferred maintenance projects (those projects most important to \n        park operations) remaining.\n            (6) Because the ARRA-funded projects have depleted the \n        number of shovel-ready projects that NPS had ready for \n        construction, the NPS recommends that any funding increase \n        should be phased in over several years in order to allow the \n        NPS to rebuild its staff and support capacity.\n            (7) The NPS identifies preventive maintenance as the key to \n        slowing the growth of the maintenance backlog.\n            (8) The NPS cyclic maintenance program is currently funded \n        at about $100 million a year and is designed to perform \n        preventive maintenance through roof repairs, painting, and road \n        resealing. The NPS maintenance management system indicates a \n        need to increase this fund to $350 million annually, an \n        increase of $250 million from current levels.\n            (9) The NPS warns that any gains made through increased \n        cyclic maintenance efforts will be minimized unless additional \n        park operational maintenance is also increased.\n            (10) At the present time, the NPS has approximately 8,000 \n        permanent and seasonal maintenance employees working within its \n        391 units. Virtually every park manager asserts that their \n        current staffing level is woefully insufficient to take on \n        identified maintenance needs, and as a result, needed repairs \n        go unaddressed, ultimately adding to an ever growing backlog.\n            (11) Evaluations by outside groups and individuals have \n        routinely identified a 50 to 100 percent maintenance staffing \n        shortfall in the parks they have visited. To increase \n        maintenance staffing by 50 percent would require an additional \n        operational increase of $350 million a year.\n            (12) The NPS estimates that in 4 to 6 months after funding \n        is provided, it can prepare needed plans and complete most of \n        its hiring efforts for additional construction and maintenance \n        work.\n            (13) With respect to National Forests, according to the \n        Wilderness Society, road removal and reclamation, rather than \n        road closings, are the best and most long-term solution to \n        addressing the negative impacts of roads on forest ecosystems. \n        With the proper training, roads and culverts can be reclaimed \n        and slopes recontoured, using the very same excavators, \n        bulldozers, and dump trucks used to build the roads in the \n        first place.\n            (14) For rural communities, road removal and reclamation \n        has the potential to create high-skill, high-wage, locally \n        based jobs, to improve community water supplies, and to enrich \n        fishing and hunting opportunities. Studies in Oregon and \n        northern California have shown that roadwork requiring heavy \n        equipment tends to be more locally based than thinning and \n        planting work, where crews often come from hundreds of miles \n        away.\n            (15) In the long run, the Forest Service estimates that \n        road and culvert reclamation would save taxpayers up to $1,200 \n        per mile in reduced maintenance costs annually. Additionally, \n        each $1 million spent on road decommissioning will support an \n        estimated 11 direct jobs for heavy equipment operators and 3.5 \n        jobs for other forest workers.\n            (16) While shovel-ready projects are good for rural \n        communities, the environment, and ultimately for taxpayers, the \n        reality is that the Forest Service currently has only a limited \n        number of shovel-ready roads-related projects on which to begin \n        work. To successfully allocate funding, the Forest Service \n        needs to identify its minimum road system, design the \n        engineering on projects to remove unneeded roads, and do the \n        project level National Environmental Policy Act analysis before \n        it can break ground. Like shovel-ready projects, this necessary \n        analysis work would also create family-wage, high-skilled, \n        green jobs.\n\nSEC. 3.
