FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Shaken Baby Syndrome is a term used to describe the \n        constellation of symptoms, trauma, and medical conditions \n        resulting from the violent shaking, or abusive impact to the \n        head, of an infant, toddler or other young child.\n            (2) Shaken Baby Syndrome is a form of child abuse affecting \n        between 1,200 and 1,600 children every year.\n            (3) Children who are age 1 or younger accounted for 41.9 \n        percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2005, and \n        children who are age 4 or younger accounted for 76.6 percent of \n        all child abuse and neglect facilities in 2005.\n            (4) The most recent National Child Abuse and Neglect Data \n        System figures reveal that almost 900,000 children were victims \n        of abuse and neglect in the United States in 2005. That abuse \n        and neglect caused unspeakable pain and suffering to the \n        Nation's most vulnerable citizens.\n            (5) It is estimated that between one-quarter and one-third \n        of Shaken Baby Syndrome victims die as a result of their \n        injuries, while one-third suffer permanent, severe disabilities \n        including paralysis, seizures, loss of hearing or vision, \n        cognitive impairments, and other disabilities, often resulting \n        in a lifetime of extraordinary medical, educational, and care \n        expenses.\n            (6) Shaken Baby Syndrome is preventable. Prevention \n        programs have demonstrated that educating new parents and other \n        caregivers about the danger of shaking young children, healthy \n        strategies for coping with infant crying, infant soothing \n        skills, and how to protect children from injury can bring about \n        a significant reduction in the number of cases of Shaken Baby \n        Syndrome.\n            (7) Efforts to prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome are supported \n        by child welfare and advocacy groups across the United States, \n        including many groups formed by parents and relatives of \n        children who have been killed or injured by the syndrome.\n            (8) Education programs have been shown to raise awareness \n        about Shaken Baby Syndrome and provide critically important \n        information about the syndrome to caregivers, day care workers, \n        child protection employees, law enforcement personnel, health \n        care providers, and legal representatives.\n            (9) Education programs can give parents healthy strategies \n        for dealing with a crying infant and change the knowledge and \n        behavior of parents of young children.\n\nSEC. 3.
