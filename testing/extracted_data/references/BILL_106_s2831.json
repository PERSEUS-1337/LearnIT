FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The life history characteristics of most sharks, \n        including slow growth, late sexual maturity, and the production \n        of few young, make them particularly vulnerable to overfishing \n        and necessitate careful management of shark fisheries.\n            (2) Many shark species that range widely would be \n        appropriate for domestic and international management \n        approaches that govern other highly migratory species.\n            (3) Most sharks are captured incidentally in fisheries \n        directed at other species for which fishing could continue to \n        remain economically viable after less abundant or less \n        economically-valuable shark species are overfished.\n            (4) The lack of adequate data and information on the status \n        and range of highly migratory shark populations, shark \n        harvesting practices, the extent of incidental catch or bycatch \n        of sharks, and the trade in shark products (including shark \n        fins) undermines effective international and national \n        management of shark populations.\n            (5) Shark-finning is the practice of removing the fins of a \n        shark and dumping its carcass back into the ocean. Shark fins \n        comprise approximately 5 percent of the weight of a shark, and \n        disposing of the carcass of a finned shark does not utilize, or \n        wastes, about 95 percent (by weight) of each shark.\n            (6) The global shark fin trade involves at least 125 \n        countries, including the United States, and the demand for \n        shark fins and other shark products has driven dramatic \n        increases in shark fishing and shark mortality around the \n        world.\n            (7) The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n        Management Act states that it is the policy of the Congress to \n        avoid unnecessary waste of fish and requires United States \n        fishery conservation and management measures to minimize \n        bycatch and, to the extent it is unavoidable, minimize the \n        mortality of such bycatch.\n            (8) The Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions \n        of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 \n        December, 1982, Relating to the Conservation and Management of \n        Straddling Stocks and Highly Migratory Species requires states \n        to, inter alia, adopt measures to ensure long-term \n        sustainability of highly migratory fish stocks based on the \n        best scientific information available, to apply the \n        precautionary approach, and to minimize waste, discards, and \n        catch of non-target species.\n            (9) The Food and Agriculture Organization Code of Conduct \n        for Responsible Fisheries provides that countries should adopt \n        management measures that minimize waste, discards, and catch of \n        non-target species.\n            (10) The Food and Agriculture Organization's International \n        Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks--\n                    (A) urges States to develop shark conservation \n                plans that--\n                            (i) minimize waste and discards from shark \n                        catches (for example, requiring retention of \n                        sharks from which fins are removed); and\n                            (ii) ensure that shark catches from \n                        directed and non-directed fisheries are \n                        sustainable; and\n                    (B) calls for submission of such plans by the year \n                2001.\n            (11) At present, while some sharks potentially may be \n        managed internationally under arrangements for highly migratory \n        species, they are not now subject to specific conservation and \n        management measures by international or regional organization \n        or arrangements.\n            (12) The conservation program for sharks for the United \n        States exclusive economic zone varies among management regions, \n        particularly with respect to the practice of shark finning, and \n        should include quotas and a ban on shark-finning.\n            (13) The establishment of a prohibition on the practice of \n        shark-finning by United States flag vessels and in waters \n        subject to the jurisdiction of the United States would not \n        reduce shark-finning being carried out by other international \n        fishing fleets or United States transshipment or landing of \n        fins taken by these fleets, or imports of processed fins. \n        Foreign fleets transship or land approximately 180 metric tons \n        of shark fins annually (about 7 percent of shark fins harvested \n        in the Pacific) through United States vessels or ports in the \n        Pacific, alone.\n            (14) Shark-finning and trade in fins harvested in this \n        manner must be addressed comprehensively at both the national \n        and international levels. Shark finning must be prohibited in \n        the United States, and, as a global leader in fisheries \n        conservation and shark management, the United States should \n        lead efforts at the United Nations and through regional \n        agreements, such as the International Convention for the \n        Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Multilateral High Level \n        Conference on the Conservation and Management of Highly \n        Migratory Species and new shark-specific regional management \n        bodies or agreements, to achieve coordinated international \n        management of sharks, including an international ban on shark-\n        finning on the high seas and in the exclusive economic zones of \n        all nations.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON SHARK-FINNING AND THE LANDING OF SHARK FINS \n              TAKEN BY SHARK-FINNING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 307 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857) is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``It is \n        unlawful--'';\n            (2) by striking ``or'' after the semicolon in subparagraph \n        (N);\n            (3) by striking the period in subparagraph (O) and \n        inserting a semicolon and ``or''; and\n            (4) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(P) to engage in shark-finning, or to land the \n                fins of a shark that were taken by shark-finning. There \n                is a rebuttable presumption that shark fins landed from \n                a fishing vessel or found on board a fishing vessel \n                were taken by shark-finning.''.\n    (b) Definition Added to Act.--Section 3 of the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (35) through (45), and any \n        reference to any such paragraph elsewhere in that Act, as \n        paragraphs (36) through (46); and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (34) the following:\n            ``(35) The term `shark-finning' means the taking of a \n        shark, removing the fin or fins (whether or not including the \n        tail) of a shark, and returning the remainder of the shark to \n        the sea.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REGULATIONS.\n\n    No later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary of Commerce shall promulgate regulations implementing the \nprohibition set forth in section 307(1)(P) of the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857(1)(P)) that--\n            (1) establish shark fin landing requirements that consider \n        species identification needs, shark processing methods, and the \n        nature and availability of markets for shark products in the \n        region in which the shark fins are landed;\n            (2) contain procedures governing release of sharks caught \n        but not retained by a fishing vessel that will ensure maximum \n        probability of survival of sharks after release;\n            (3) contain documentation and other requirements necessary \n        to assure the timely and adequate collection of data to support \n        shark stock assessments, conservation, and enforcement efforts; \n        and\n            (4) set forth the facts and circumstances under which a \n        person may rebut the presumption established in section \n        307(1)(P) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n        Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857(b), including the use of \n        documentation provided through applicable fisheries observer \n        programs and dockside inspection.\n\nSEC. 5. INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS.\n\n    The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Secretary of State, \nshall--\n            (1) notify other nations whose vessels engage in fishing on \n        sharks, as soon as possible, about the import certification \n        procedures and regulations under section 6 of this Act, as well \n        as the international cooperation and assistance provisions of \n        section 10;\n            (2) initiate discussions as soon as possible for purpose of \n        developing bilateral or multilateral agreements with other \n        nations for the prohibition on finning of sharks;\n            (3) initiate discussions as soon as possible with all \n        foreign governments which are engaged in, or which have persons \n        or companies engaged in shark-finning or in commercial fishing \n        operations that the Secretary of Commerce determines may affect \n        adversely such species of sharks, for the purpose of entering \n        into bilateral and multilateral treaties with such countries to \n        protect such species;\n            (4) seek agreements calling for an international ban on \n        shark-finning and other fishing practices adversely affecting \n        these species through the United Nations, the Food and \n        Agriculture Organization's Committee on Fisheries, and \n        appropriate regional fishery management bodies; and\n            (5) initiate the amendment of any existing international \n        treaty for the protection and conservation of species of sharks \n        to which the United States is a party in order to make such \n        treaty consistent with the purposes and policies of this \n        section.\n\nSEC. 6. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of \nState, shall provide to Congress, by not later than 1 year after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, and every year thereafter, a full report \nwhich--\n                    (1) includes a list of nations whose vessels \n                conduct shark-finning or commercial fishing operations \n                which adversely affect shark species;\n                    (2) describes the efforts taken by nations to carry \n                out this title, listed under subsection (1), and \n                evaluates the progress of those efforts;\n                    (3) includes a determination as to whether the \n                importation into the United States of sharks or shark \n                products (including fins) is adversely affecting the \n                effectiveness of national and international measures \n                for the conservation of sharks;\n                    (4) sets forth a plan of action for ensuring the \n                conclusion and entry into force of international \n                measures for the conservation of sharks; and\n                    (5) includes recommendations for measures to ensure \n                that United States actions are consistent with \n                national, international, and regional obligations \n                relating to highly migratory shark populations, \n                including those listed under the Convention on \n                International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora \n                and Fauna.\n\nSEC. 7.
