PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To identify and promote the use of innovative and \n        effective conservation practices.\n            (2) To apply targeted soil and water conservation practices \n        at the watershed, sub-watershed, and field scales.\n            (3) To increase the use of conservation practices by \n        producers.\n            (4) To collect data on how the implementation of precision \n        conservation practices affects soil health, reduces erosion and \n        nutrient runoff of soil, and enhances water quality.\n\nSEC. 3.
