FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is in the interest of the United States for the \n        Secretary of the Interior to sell leaseholds at Canyon Ferry \n        Reservoir in the State of Montana for fair market value if the \n        proceeds from the sale are used--\n                    (A) to establish a trust to provide a permanent \n                source of funding to acquire access or other property \n                interests from willing sellers to conserve fish and \n                wildlife and to enhance public hunting and fishing \n                opportunities at the Reservoir and along the Missouri \n                River;\n                    (B) to establish a fund to be used to acquire \n                access or other property interests from willing sellers \n                to increase public access to Federal land in the State \n                of Montana and to enhance hunting and fishing \n                opportunities; and\n                    (C) to reduce the Pick-Sloan project debt for the \n                Canyon Ferry Unit;\n            (2) existing trusts in the State of Montana, including the \n        Rock Creek Trust and the Montana Power Company Missouri-Madison \n        Trust, have provided substantial public benefits by conserving \n        fish and wildlife and by enhancing public hunting and fishing \n        opportunities in the State of Montana;\n            (3) many Federal lands in the State of Montana do not have \n        suitable public access, and establishing a fund to acquire \n        easements to those lands from willing sellers would enhance \n        public hunting and fishing opportunities in the State of \n        Montana;\n            (4) the sale of the leaseholds at the Reservoir will reduce \n        Federal payments in lieu of taxes and associated management \n        expenditures in connection with the ownership by the Federal \n        Government of the leaseholds while increasing local tax \n        revenues from the new owners of the leased lots; and\n            (5) the sale of the leaseholds at the Reservoir will reduce \n        expensive and contentious disputes between the Federal \n        Government and leaseholders, while ensuring that the Federal \n        Government receives full and fair value for the acquisition of \n        the property.\n\nSEC. 3.
