    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Family Justice Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the National Center for Mental Health and \n        Juvenile Justice, the successful rehabilitation of youth in the \n        juvenile justice system, and their sustained reintegration into \n        the community rely upon the mutual support of juvenile justice \n        systems and families in the accomplishment of their goals.\n            (2) Involving families benefits the youth, the family, the \n        juvenile justice system, and the community.\n            (3) Valid information and consistent communication between \n        families and juvenile justice facilities reduces confusion, \n        frustration, and disappointment.\n            (4) Training of juvenile justice personnel on the \n        importance of involving families can help the former better \n        understand the family perspective and the potential \n        opportunities for families to be educated about the system, its \n        processes and protocols.\n            (5) Families working together with juvenile justice systems \n        can improve outcomes for justice-involved youth with mental \n        health issues.\n\nSEC. 3.
