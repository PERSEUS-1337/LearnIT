    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares the following:\n(a) Almost 50 percent of clinical trial studies are not finished in time due to low patient participation, recruitment and navigation difficulties, and other barriers for patients. Due to economic and socioeconomic circumstances and lack of patient knowledge, clinical oncology trial participation and retention are both very low as they relate to eligible participants.\n(b) Overall, only 3 percent of eligible cancer patients participate in clinical trials, and of those only 5 percent of trial participants are from racial or ethnic minority communities.\n(c) One barrier that prevents patients from participating in federal Food and Drug Administration clinical trials is finances. Patients of low to moderate income are often unable to bear the burden of the ancillary costs of participating, such as airfare, lodging, rental cars, and fuel.\n(d) The American Medical Association conducted a study on cancer trial participation. The study found that from 1996 to 2002, of the 75,215 patients enrolled in the National Cancer Institute trials for breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers, only 3.1 percent were Hispanic, 9.2 percent were Black, and 1.9 percent were Asian or Pacific Islanders, while 85.6 percent were White. This lack of diversity is of concern because of its impact on researchers\u2019 ability to evaluate the effect of new treatments on different populations. It also speaks to a lack of access to potentially lifesaving trials for a large portion of the population.\n(e) It is the intent of the Legislature to establish a program to enable willing patients of low to moderate income to participate in cancer clinical trials in order to boost participation rates, ensure these trials are widely accessible, improve the development of cancer therapies, and enhance innovation.\nSEC. 2.\nChapter 2 (commencing with Section 101990) is added to Part 6 of Division 101 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  2.
