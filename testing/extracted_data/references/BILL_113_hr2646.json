FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 2000, the Secretary of Commerce declared the West \n        Coast groundfish fishery a Federal fisheries economic disaster \n        due to low stock abundance, an overcapitalized fleet, and \n        historically overfished stocks.\n            (2) Section 212 of the Department of Commerce and Related \n        Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003 (title II of division B of \n        Public Law 108-7; 117 Stat. 80) was enacted to establish a \n        Pacific Coast groundfish fishing capacity reduction program, \n        also known as a buyback program, to remove excess fishing \n        capacity.\n            (3) In 2003, Congress authorized the $35,700,000 buyback \n        loan, creating the Pacific Coast groundfish fishing capacity \n        reduction program through the National Marine Fisheries Service \n        fisheries finance program with a term of 30 years. The interest \n        rate of the buyback loan was fixed at 6.97 percent and is paid \n        back based on an ex-vessel fee landing rate not to exceed 5 \n        percent for the loan.\n            (4) The groundfish fishing capacity reduction program \n        resulted in the removal of limited entry trawl Federal fishing \n        permits from the fishery, representing approximately 46 percent \n        of total landings at the time.\n            (5) Because of an absence of a repayment mechanism, \n        $4,243,730 in interest accrued before fee collection procedures \n        were established in 2005, over 18 months after the groundfish \n        fishing capacity reduction program was initiated.\n            (6) In 2011, the West Coast groundfish fishery transitioned \n        to an individual fishing quota fishery, which is a type of \n        catch share program.\n            (7) By 2015, West Coast groundfish fishermen's expenses are \n        expected to include fees of approximately $450 per day for \n        observers, a 3-percent cost recovery fee as authorized by the \n        Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 \n        U.S.C. 1801) for catch share programs, and a 5-percent ex-\n        vessel landings rate for the loan repayment, which could reach \n        18 percent of their total gross revenue.\n            (8) In 2012, the West Coast groundfish limited entry trawl \n        fishery generated $63,000,000, an increase from an average of \n        $45,000,000 during the years 2006 to 2011. This revenue is \n        expected to continue to increase post-rationalization.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to refinance the Pacific \nCoast groundfish fishery fishing capacity reduction program to protect \nand conserve the West Coast groundfish fishery and the coastal \neconomies in California, Oregon, and Washington that rely on it.\n\nSEC. 3.
