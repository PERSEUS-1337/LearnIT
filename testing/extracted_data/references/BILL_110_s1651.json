FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United Nations estimates that there are 2,000,000 \n        Iraqis internally displaced and more than 2,000,000 Iraqi \n        refugees in neighboring countries, primarily Jordan and Syria.\n            (2) The humanitarian needs of the Iraqi refugees and \n        internally displaced persons are significant. If their needs \n        are not quickly and adequately met, these populations could \n        become a fertile recruiting ground for terrorists.\n            (3) Iraqi refugees are a significant financial burden on \n        countries in the region. The Iraq Study Group concluded that if \n        the refugee crisis ``is not addressed, Iraq and the region \n        could be further destabilized''.\n            (4) Many Iraqis who have worked in critical positions in \n        direct support of the United States Government in Iraq have \n        been killed or injured in reprisals for their support of the \n        American effort. Many more Iraqis associated with the United \n        States have fled Iraq in fear of being killed or injured.\n            (5) Although the United States cannot resettle all of \n        Iraq's refugees in the United States, the United States has a \n        fundamental obligation to help the vast number of Iraqis \n        displaced in Iraq and throughout the region by the war and the \n        associated chaos, especially those who have supported America's \n        efforts in Iraq.\n            (6) In April 2007, Assistant Secretary of State Ellen \n        Sauerbrey said the United States ``could resettle up to 25,000 \n        Iraqi refugees'' this year. In May 2007, Under Secretary of \n        State Paula Dobriansky said, ``We are committed to honoring our \n        moral debt to those Iraqis who have provided assistance to the \n        United States military and embassy.'' On June 8, 2007, \n        Secretary Rice remarked, ``The people that I'm most worried \n        about in the near term are the people who've worked for and \n        with us who might be subject to recrimination and reprisal.''.\n            (7) It is essential for the United States to develop a \n        comprehensive and effective approach to support host \n        governments and to meet the needs of Iraq's refugees and \n        internally displaced persons, especially those who are \n        associated with the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
