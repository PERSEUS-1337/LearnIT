    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Prohibition on Cloning of Human \nBeings Act of 1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) it has been reported that an adult sheep has been \n        cloned using a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer;\n            (2) the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (referred to \n        in this Act as the ``NBAC'') has reviewed the scientific and \n        ethical implications of the potential use of such technology to \n        clone human beings;\n            (3) the NBAC has determined that--\n                    (A) somatic cell nuclear transfer technology may \n                have many applications for biotechnology, livestock \n                productions, and new medical approaches including the \n                production of pharmaceutical proteins and prospects for \n                repair, regeneration, or transplant of human tissues or \n                organs; and\n                    (B) the possibility of using somatic cell nuclear \n                transfer for the purposes of creating a child entails \n                significant scientific uncertainty and medical risk, \n                which could result in harm to a child;\n            (4) the NBAC concluded unanimously that at this time it is \n        morally unacceptable for anyone in the public or private \n        sector, whether in a research or clinical setting, to attempt \n        to create a child using somatic cell nuclear transfer-cloning;\n            (5) the consensus of the NBAC is based on current \n        scientific information indicating that this technique is not \n        safe to use in humans at this time;\n            (6) in addition to issues of safety, the NBAC identified \n        many additional serious ethical concerns which they agreed \n        require a great deal more widespread and careful public \n        deliberation before this technology may be used;\n            (7) the NBAC recommended a continuation of the current \n        moratorium on the use of Federal funds to support any attempt \n        to create a child by somatic cell nuclear transfer, and an \n        immediate request to all firms, clinicians, investigators, and \n        professional societies to comply voluntarily with the intent of \n        the Federal moratorium;\n            (8) the NBAC further recommended that Federal legislation \n        be enacted to prohibit anyone from attempting, whether in a \n        research or clinical setting, to create a child through somatic \n        cell nuclear transfer cloning;\n            (9) the NBAC also recommended that the United States \n        cooperate with other countries to enforce mutually supported \n        restrictions on this activity;\n            (10) the NBAC specified that such Federal legislation \n        should include a sunset provision and that, prior to the sunset \n        date, an oversight body should review and report on the status \n        of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology and the ethical and \n        social issues associated with its use and recommend whether the \n        prohibition should be continued;\n            (11) the NBAC concluded that any regulatory or legislative \n        actions undertaken to effect the foregoing prohibition should \n        be carefully written so as not to interfere with other \n        important areas of research, such as the cloning of human DNA \n        sequences and cells, which raise neither the scientific nor the \n        ethical issues that arise from the possible creation of \n        children through somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques;\n            (12) the NBAC also found that cloning animals by somatic \n        cell nuclear transfer does not raise the same issues implicated \n        in attempting to use the technique to create a child, and its \n        continuation should only be subject to existing regulations \n        regarding the humane use of animals; and\n            (13)(A) biomedical research facilities, including those \n        conducting cloning, and reproductive services facilities engage \n        in and affect interstate commerce;\n            (B) the products of biomedical research, including cloning, \n        and the services provided by reproductive services facilities \n        move in interstate commerce;\n            (C) patients travel regularly across State lines in order \n        to access reproductive services facilities; and\n            (D) biomedical research facilities, including those \n        conducting cloning, and reproductive services facilities engage \n        scientists, doctors, and other staff in an interstate market, \n        and contract for research and purchase medical and other \n        supplies in an interstate market.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) prohibit any attempt, in this country or elsewhere, to \n        clone a human being, that is, to use the product of somatic \n        cell nuclear transfer to create a human being genetically \n        identical to an existing or deceased human being;\n            (2) prohibit the use of Federal funds for any of the \n        activities described in paragraph (1); and\n            (3) provide for further review of the ethical and \n        scientific issues associated with the use of somatic cell \n        nuclear transfer in humans.\n\nSEC. 4. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Part H of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 498C.
