PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to improve academic and social outcomes \nfor students and reduce both juvenile crime and the risk that youth \nwill become victims of crime by providing productive activities during \nafter school hours.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Today's youth face far greater social risks than did \n        their parents and grandparents.\n            (2) Students spend more of their waking hours alone, \n        without supervision, companionship, or activity, than the \n        students spend in school.\n            (3) Law enforcement statistics show that youth who are ages \n        12 through 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and \n        being victims of violent acts between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.\n            (4) The consequences of academic failure are more dire in \n        2001 than ever before.\n            (5) After school programs have been shown in many States to \n        help address social problems facing our Nation's youth, such as \n        drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang involvement.\n            (6) Many of our Nation's governors endorse increasing the \n        number of after school programs through a Federal/State \n        partnership.\n            (7) Over 450 of the Nation's leading police chiefs, \n        sheriffs, and prosecutors, along with presidents of the \n        Fraternal Order of Police and the International Union of Police \n        Associations, which together represent 360,000 police officers, \n        have called upon public officials to provide after school \n        programs that offer recreation, academic support, and community \n        service experience, for school-age children and teens in the \n        United States.\n            (8) One of the most important investments that we can make \n        in our children is to ensure that they have safe and positive \n        learning environments in the after school hours.\n\nSEC. 4. GOALS.\n\n    The goals of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To increase the academic success of students.\n            (2) To promote safe and productive environments for \n        students in the after school hours.\n            (3) To provide alternatives to drug, alcohol, tobacco, and \n        gang activity.\n            (4) To reduce juvenile crime and the risk that youth will \n        become victims of crime during after school hours.\n\nSEC. 5.
