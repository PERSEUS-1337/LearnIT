FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Certain species of salmon and steelhead in the Columbia \n        and Snake River Basin are on the brink of extinction as a \n        consequence of various factors, including hydroelectric \n        projects, harvest management practices, habitat degradation, \n        altered in stream flow, and unsound hatchery practices.\n            (2) These salmon and steelhead have major economic, \n        ecological, educational, recreational, scientific, cultural, \n        and spiritual significance to the Nation and its people.\n            (3) The Federal Government and ratepayers in the Pacific \n        Northwest have spent more than $6,000,000,000 on salmon \n        recovery efforts.\n            (4) Thirteen salmon and steelhead species in the Columbia \n        and Snake River Basin are listed for protections under the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (6 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n            (5) Salmon and steelhead extinction could cost taxpayers \n        billions of dollars.\n            (6) Salmon and steelhead are symbols of the Pacific \n        Northwest, support thousands of jobs in coastal and inland \n        communities, and serve as an indicator of the health of \n        Northern California and Pacific Northwest river ecosystems.\n            (7) Salmon and steelhead of the Snake River are a vital \n        economic resource to communities in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, \n        Idaho, and California. Restoring Snake River salmon to healthy, \n        self-sustaining, harvestable levels will have significant \n        economic benefits for these communities. Understanding these \n        benefits is imperative to setting public policy on salmon \n        restoration efforts in the Northwest.\n            (8) The original range of Snake River salmon included not \n        only their existing habitat in central Idaho, northeast Oregon, \n        southeast Washington, the lower Columbia River, and the coastal \n        waters of Alaska, California, Oregon, and Washington, but also \n        currently inaccessible habitat in the upper Snake River Basin, \n        including southern Idaho, southeast Oregon, and northern \n        Nevada.\n            (9) The United States Government has signed treaties with \n        Indian tribes in Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Idaho and \n        with the Government of Canada creating a legally enforceable \n        trust responsibility to restore salmon populations to \n        sustainable, harvestable levels.\n            (10) Since the construction of 4 Federal dams on the lower \n        Snake River in Washington, salmon and steelhead populations in \n        the Snake River have significantly declined, and all salmon and \n        steelhead in the Snake River are extinct or listed as \n        endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of \n        1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n            (11) Recent studies indicate that the time remaining to \n        protect remaining Snake River salmon and steelhead is short, \n        with scientists estimating that, if changes do not occur, many \n        if not all of the remaining Snake River salmon and steelhead \n        populations will be extinct in our lifetime.\n            (12) A federally funded group of State, tribal, Federal, \n        and independent scientists found that partially removing the 4 \n        lower Snake River dams in Washington is the surest way to \n        protect and recover Snake River salmon and steelhead.\n            (13) Several communities that rely on the 4 lower Snake \n        River dams would be affected by partial dam removal.\n            (14) A Federal court has found that the 4 lower Snake River \n        dams violate water quality standards under the Federal Water \n        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.).\n            (15) Energy production in the Northwest is heavily \n        dependent upon hydropower and thus, the prospects for salmon \n        recovery and hydropower management are inextricably linked.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure the protection and recovery of Columbia and \n        Snake River salmon and steelhead to self-sustaining, \n        harvestable levels, while providing for reliable, reasonably \n        priced energy in the Northwest and an economically sustainable \n        salmon recovery program, and to maximize the potential economic \n        benefits from potential dam removal while mitigating for its \n        impacts; and\n            (2) to ensure that the Northwest and the Nation have \n        completed the necessary planning and evaluation to efficiently \n        manage salmon recovery, implement biologically effective \n        measures, and respond rapidly if major new actions are \n        necessary to protect and recover salmon and steelhead in the \n        Columbia and Snake River Basin.\n\nSEC. 3.
