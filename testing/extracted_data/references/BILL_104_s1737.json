FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the superlative natural and scenic resources of the \n        Yellowstone area led Congress in 1872 to establish Yellowstone \n        National Park as the world's first national park;\n            (2) a 20.5 mile segment of the Clarks Fork of the \n        Yellowstone River was designated in 1990 as a component of the \n        National Wild and Scenic Rivers system, the only such \n        designation within the State of Wyoming, in order to preserve \n        and enhance the natural, scenic, and recreational resources of \n        such segment;\n            (3) the Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area was \n        designated in 1978 to protect the wilderness and ecological \n        values of certain lands north and east of Yellowstone National \n        Park;\n            (4) in recognition of its natural resource values and \n        international significance, Yellowstone National Park was \n        designated a World Heritage Site in 1978;\n            (5) past and ongoing mining practices have degraded the \n        resource values of Henderson Mountain and adjacent lands \n        upstream of Yellowstone National Park, the Absaroka-Beartooth \n        National Wilderness Area and the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone \n        National Wild and Scenic River, and acid mine pollution and \n        heavy metal contamination caused by such practices have \n        polluted the headwater sources of Soda Butte Creek and the \n        Lamar River, the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River and the \n        Stillwater River;\n            (6) on September 1, 1995 approximately 19,100 acres of \n        Federal land upstream of Yellowstone National Park, the Clarks \n        Fork of the Yellowstone National Wild and Scenic River and the \n        Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area were segregated \n        from entry under the general mining laws for a two-year period, \n        in order to protect the watersheds within the drainages of the \n        Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River, Soda Butte Creek and the \n        Stillwater River and to protect the water quality and fresh \n        water fishery resources within Yellowstone National Park;\n            (7) because of proposed mineral development upstream of \n        Yellowstone National Park, and other reasons, the World \n        Heritage Committee added Yellowstone National Park to the \n        ``List of World Heritage in Danger'' in December, 1995; and\n            (8) proposed mining activities in the area present a clear \n        and present danger to the resource values of the area as well \n        as those of Yellowstone National Park, the Clarks Fork of the \n        Yellowstone National Wild and Scenic River and the Absaroka-\n        Beartooth National Wilderness Area, and it is, therefore, in \n        the public interest to protect these lands and rivers from such \n        mining activities.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of the Act is to make permanent the present temporary \nsegregation of lands upstream of Yellowstone National Park, Absaroka-\nBeartooth National Wilderness Area and the Clarks Fork of the \nYellowstone National Wild and Scenic River from entry under the general \nmining laws, restrict the use of certain Federal lands, and to provide \nassurance that the exercise of valid existing mineral rights does not \nthreaten the water quality, fisheries and other resource values of this \narea.\n\nSEC. 4. AREA INCLUDED.\n\n    The area affected by this Act shall be comprised of approximately \n24,000 acres of lands and interests in lands within the Gallatin and \nCuster National Forests as generally depicted on the map entitled \n``Yellowstone Protection Act of 1996''. The map shall be on file and \navailable for public inspection in the offices of the Chief of the \nForest Service, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.\n\nSEC. 5. MINERALS AND MINING.\n\n    (a) Withdrawal.--After enactment of this Act, and subject to valid \nexisting rights, the lands segregated from entry under the general \nmining laws pursuant to the order contained on page 45732 of the \nFederal Register (September 1, 1995) shall not be--\n            (1) open to location of mining claims under the general \n        mining laws of the United States;\n            (2) available for leasing under the mineral leasing and \n        geothermal leasing laws of the United States; and\n            (3) available for disposal of mineral materials under the \n        Act of July 31, 1947, commonly known as the Material Act of \n        1947 (30 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).\n    (b) Limitation on Patent Issuance.--Subject to valid existing \nrights, no patents under the general mining laws shall be issued for \nany claim located in the area described in section 4.\n    (c) Prohibition.--(1) Subject to valid existing rights, no Federal \nlands within the area described in section 4 may be used in connection \nwith any mining related activity, except for reclamation.\n    (2) Subject to valid existing rights, no Federal department or \nagency shall assist by loan, grant, license, or otherwise in the \ndevelopment or construction of cyanide heap- or vat-leach facilities, \ndams, or other impoundment structures for the storage of mine tailings, \nwork camps, powerplants, electrical transmission lines, gravel or rock \nborrow pits or mills within the area described in section 4. However, \nnothing in this section shall limit reclamation.\n    (d) Reclamation.--Any mining or mining related activities occurring \nin the area described in section 4 shall be subject to operation and \nreclamation requirements established by the Secretary of Agriculture, \nincluding requirements for reasonable reclamation of disturbed lands to \na visual and hydrological condition as close as practical to their \npremining condition.\n    (e) Mining Claim Validity Reviews.--The Secretary of the Interior, \nin consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, shall complete \nwithin three years of the date of enactment of this Act, a review of \nthe validity of all claims under the general mining laws within the \narea described in section 4.
