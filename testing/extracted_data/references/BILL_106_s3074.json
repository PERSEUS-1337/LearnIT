FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is an epidemic of fraud directed against aliens \n        engaged in dealings with the Immigration and Naturalization \n        Service.\n            (2) Fraudulent immigration consultants target aliens \n        working their way through the maze of immigration law and \n        extract hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for \n        promises of help in dealing with the Immigration and \n        Naturalization Service.\n            (3) For example, phony immigration consultants--who lure \n        clients by approaching aliens in line at Immigration and \n        Naturalization Service buildings or by advertising in foreign-\n        language newspapers--promise, for a fee, to help immigrants \n        obtain residency or green cards by using personal back-channel \n        connections at the Immigration and Naturalization Service or by \n        filing a supposedly necessary application.\n            (4) Rather than legitimately assist aliens with the \n        Immigration and Naturalization Service, fraudulent consultants \n        then take one or a succession of fees and either do nothing, or \n        worse, file meritless asylum petitions designed to result in \n        rejection and deportation.\n            (5) Fraudulent immigration consultants often pose as \n        immigration lawyers. In particular, some who target Spanish-\n        speaking immigrants become notaries public in order to \n        advertise as ``notarios,'' who are attorneys in Latin America.\n            (6) Aliens victimized by fraudulent consultants are usually \n        too fearful of deportation, or unsure where to turn, to report \n        the fraud to Government officials. Consequently, fraudulent \n        consultants operate with near-impunity.\n            (7) Because fraudulent immigration consultants work in the \n        shadows and provide services that are unregulated in many \n        States, it is impossible to determine how many such \n        illegitimate businesses exist. State officials and immigrants' \n        advocacy groups estimate, however, that the problem of aliens \n        exploited by bogus consultants has grown in recent years, and \n        that thousands of fraudulent consultants are at work across the \n        country.\n            (8) Federal and State efforts to rein in fraudulent \n        immigration consultants have not succeeded in ending the abuse. \n        At the Federal level, there is no jurisdiction to prosecute \n        fraudulent consultants unless they participate in the \n        submission of false documents to the Immigration and \n        Naturalization Service. Since many phony consultants scam \n        aliens without filing paperwork with the Immigration and \n        Naturalization Service, they cannot be reached by Federal law \n        enforcement.\n            (9) The Department of Justice intended to establish five \n        Federal-State task forces to combat fraud by immigration \n        consultants in major cities with large immigrant populations. \n        Only one such task force has been established, however--in Los \n        Angeles.\n            (10) Enforcement by State authorities is sporadic. Many \n        make no effort to pursue and prosecute bogus consultants. And \n        even when con artists are convicted, most jurisdictions punish \n        fraud against aliens as misdemeanors.\n\nSEC. 3.
