FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As Thomas Jefferson declared to New London Methodists \n        in 1809, ``[n]o provision in our Constitution ought to be \n        dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience \n        against the enterprises of the civil authority''.\n            (2) Jefferson's statement expresses a conviction on respect \n        for conscience that is deeply embedded in the history and \n        traditions of our Nation and codified in numerous State and \n        Federal laws, including laws on health care.\n            (3) Until enactment of the Patient Protection and \n        Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148, in this section \n        referred to as ``PPACA''), the Federal Government has not \n        sought to impose specific coverage or care requirements that \n        infringe on the rights of conscience of insurers, purchasers of \n        insurance, plan sponsors, beneficiaries, and other \n        stakeholders, such as individual or institutional health care \n        providers.\n            (4) PPACA creates a new nationwide requirement for health \n        plans to cover ``essential health benefits'' and ``preventive \n        services'' (including a distinct set of ``preventive services \n        for women''), delegating to the Department of Health and Human \n        Services the authority to provide a list of detailed services \n        under each category, and imposes other new requirements with \n        respect to the provision of health care services.\n            (5) While PPACA provides an exemption for some religious \n        groups that object to participation in Government health \n        programs generally, it does not allow purchasers, plan \n        sponsors, and other stakeholders with religious or moral \n        objections to specific items or services to decline providing \n        or obtaining coverage of such items or services, or allow \n        health care providers with such objections to decline to \n        provide them.\n            (6) By creating new barriers to health insurance and \n        causing the loss of existing insurance arrangements, these \n        inflexible mandates in PPACA jeopardize the ability of \n        individuals to exercise their rights of conscience and their \n        ability to freely participate in the health insurance and \n        health care marketplace.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure that health care stakeholders retain the \n        right to provide, purchase, or enroll in health coverage that \n        is consistent with their religious beliefs and moral \n        convictions, without fear of being penalized or discriminated \n        against under PPACA; and\n            (2) to ensure that no requirement in PPACA creates new \n        pressures to exclude those exercising such conscientious \n        objection from health plans or other programs under PPACA.\n\nSEC. 3. RESPECT FOR RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148; 42 U.S.C. 18022(b)) is amended \nby adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(6) Respecting rights of conscience with regard to \n        specific items or services.--\n                    ``(A) For health plans.--A health plan shall not be \n                considered to have failed to provide the essential \n                health benefits package described in subsection (a) (or \n                preventive health services described in section 2713 of \n                the Public Health Service Act), to fail to be a \n                qualified health plan, or to fail to fulfill any other \n                requirement under this title on the basis that it \n                declines to provide coverage of specific items or \n                services because--\n                            ``(i) providing coverage (or, in the case \n                        of a sponsor of a group health plan, paying for \n                        coverage) of such specific items or services is \n                        contrary to the religious beliefs or moral \n                        convictions of the sponsor, issuer, or other \n                        entity offering the plan; or\n                            ``(ii) such coverage (in the case of \n                        individual coverage) is contrary to the \n                        religious beliefs or moral convictions of the \n                        purchaser or beneficiary of the coverage.\n                    ``(B) For health care providers.--Nothing in this \n                title (or any amendment made by this title) shall be \n                construed to require an individual or institutional \n                health care provider, or authorize a health plan to \n                require a provider, to provide, participate in, or \n                refer for a specific item or service contrary to the \n                provider's religious beliefs or moral convictions. \n                Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, a \n                health plan shall not be considered to have failed to \n                provide timely or other access to items or services \n                under this title (or any amendment made by this title) \n                or to fulfill any other requirement under this title \n                because it has respected the rights of conscience of \n                such a provider pursuant to this paragraph.\n                    ``(C) Nondiscrimination in exercising rights of \n                conscience.--No Exchange or other official or entity \n                acting in a governmental capacity in the course of \n                implementing this title (or any amendment made by this \n                title) shall discriminate against a health plan, plan \n                sponsor, health care provider, or other person because \n                of such plan's, sponsor's, provider's, or person's \n                unwillingness to provide coverage of, participate in, \n                or refer for, specific items or services pursuant to \n                this paragraph.\n                    ``(D) Construction.--Nothing in subparagraph (A) or \n                (B) shall be construed to permit a health plan or \n                provider to discriminate in a manner inconsistent with \n                subparagraphs (B) and (D) of paragraph (4).\n                    ``(E) Private rights of action.--The various \n                protections of conscience in this paragraph constitute \n                the protection of individual rights and create a \n                private cause of action for those persons or entities \n                protected.
