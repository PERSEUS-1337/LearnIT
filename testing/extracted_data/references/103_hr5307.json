    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the right to public trials and other court proceedings \n        is protected by the First and Sixth Amendments to the \n        Constitution;\n            (2) while members of the public once commonly attended \n        trials in person, today they must rely on the print and \n        electronic media to learn about court proceedings;\n            (3) Americans' understanding of the courts and their \n        important work, as well as respect for the judicial system, is \n        enhanced when photographic and electronic media coverage is \n        permitted;\n            (4) while 47 States now allow photographic and electronic \n        media coverage of some or all of their courts, Federal courts \n        have been entirely closed to such coverage, aside from a \n        limited experimental program;\n            (5) the presence of cameras and microphones in the \n        courtroom does not deny litigants due process of law, or \n        interfere with the fundamental fairness of the trial, as the \n        Supreme Court recognized more than a decade ago in Chandler v. \n        Florida; and\n            (6) photographic and electronic media coverage of the \n        courts does not, when appropriately regulated, either disrupt \n        the proceedings or undermine the fair administration of \n        justice.\n\nSEC. 2. MEDIA COVERAGE OF COURT PROCEEDINGS.\n\n    Chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 1659. Media coverage of court proceedings\n    ``(a) Media Coverage.--\n            ``(1) In criminal proceedings.--The Judicial Conference \n        shall, within 1 year after the effective date of this section, \n        authorize an experimental program in which the presiding judge \n        of a court of the United States may, in his or her discretion, \n        and subject to the provisions of this section, permit \n        photographic or electronic media coverage of criminal court \n        proceedings, including trials. At least 15 Federal judicial \n        districts shall participate in the experimental program.\n            ``(2) In civil proceedings.--Any presiding judge of a court \n        of the United States may, in his or her discretion, and subject \n        to the provisions of this section, permit photographic or \n        electronic media coverage of civil court proceedings, including \n        trials.\n            ``(3) General limitations.--The court may in any case \n        refuse, limit, or terminate photographic or electronic media \n        coverage in the interests of justice to protect the rights of \n        the parties and the dignity of the court, or to assure the fair \n        administration of justice. No changes in the scheduling, form, \n        or procedure of any court proceeding may be made, by virtue of \n        this section, for the benefit of the media in providing \n        photographic or electronic media coverage under this section.\n    ``(b) Permission To Use Media Coverage.--\n            ``(1) Requests for permission.--A request for permission to \n        use photographic or electronic media coverage of a court \n        proceeding under this section shall be made on a form approved \n        by the Judicial Conference that is filed within a reasonable \n        time before the portion of the proceeding for which media \n        coverage is requested. The clerk of the court shall promptly \n        notify the parties to the proceeding of the request.\n            ``(2) Action of the court on requests.--A decision of the \n        court granting or denying a request for photographic or \n        electronic media coverage shall be in writing and shall be \n        included in the record of the court proceedings.

At such conference, \n        the presiding judge shall review with counsel and the media who \n        will participate in the photographic or electronic media \n        coverage the restrictions to be imposed on such coverage. \n        Counsel shall convey to the court any concerns of prospective \n        witnesses with respect to the photographic or electronic media \n        coverage.\n    ``(c) Prohibited Coverage.--\n            ``(1) Prohibitions.--Proceedings held in chambers, \n        proceedings closed to the public, and jury selection shall not \n        be photographed, recorded, or broadcast under this section.

Closeup photography of jurors is prohibited.\n            ``(2) Arraignments and suppression hearings.--Photographic \n        or electronic media coverage of arraignments and suppression \n        hearings shall not be permitted unless the proceedings are open \n        to the public.\n            ``(3) Witnesses at criminal trials.--Upon the request of a \n        witness in any criminal proceeding for which photographic or \n        electronic media coverage is permitted under this section, the \n        presiding judge may, for good cause shown based on the \n        circumstances of that witness, order that the visual image of \n        the witness be obscured.\n    ``(d) Equipment and Personnel.--The court may require media \npersonnel to demonstrate that equipment proposed to be used for \nphotographic or electronic media coverage under this section complies \nwith this section.

Unless the court in its discretion \norders otherwise, the following applies:\n            ``(1) Only 2 television cameras and 2 still photographers, \n        with not more than 4 cameras and 6 lenses, are permitted.\n            ``(2) Equipment shall not produce distracting sound or \n        light. Signal lights or devices indicating when equipment is \n        operating shall not be visible.\n            ``(3) If the court permits existing courtroom sound and \n        lighting systems to be modified, the modifications shall be \n        installed, maintained, and removed without cost to the Federal \n        Government. Microphones and wiring shall be unobtrusively \n        located in places approved by the court and shall be operated \n        by 1 person.\n            ``(4) Operators shall not move equipment or enter or leave \n        the courtroom while the court is in session, or otherwise cause \n        a distraction.\n            ``(5) Equipment or clothing shall not bear the insignia or \n        marking of a media agency.\n    ``(e) Pooling.--If media agencies are unable to agree on \narrangements for pooled coverage of a proceeding, the court shall deny \nphotographic and electronic media coverage of the proceeding under this \nsection.\n    ``(f) Other Photographing, Recording, or Broadcasting.--Any \nphotographing, recording, or broadcasting of court proceedings, other \nthan that permitted under this section, is prohibited unless \nspecifically authorized by the court, except that the court may not \nwaive any provision of subsection (c).\n    ``(g) Review Committee.--\n            ``(1) Creation.--There shall be created a committee to \n        evaluate whether photographic or electronic media coverage of \n        criminal court proceedings should be permitted after June 30, \n        1998, or whether such coverage so disrupts or interferes with \n        the fairness of criminal court proceedings as to justify its \n        prohibition.\n            ``(2) Membership.--The committee shall consist of 16 \n        members, 4 to be appointed by the Judicial Conference, 4 to be \n        appointed by the Attorney General of the United States, 2 to be \n        appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 2 to \n        be appointed by the minority leader of the House of \n        Representatives, 2 to be appointed by the majority leader of \n        the Senate, and 2 to be appointed by the minority leader of the \n        Senate.
