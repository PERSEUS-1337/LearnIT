SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Openness Promotes Effectiveness in \nour National Government Act of 2005'' or the ``OPEN Government Act of \n2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Freedom of Information Act was signed into law on \n        July 4, 1966, because the American people believe that--\n                    (A) our constitutional democracy, our system of \n                self-government, and our commitment to popular \n                sovereignty depends upon the consent of the governed;\n                    (B) such consent is not meaningful unless it is \n                informed consent; and\n                    (C) as Justice Black noted in his concurring \n                opinion in Barr v. Matteo (360 U.S. 564 (1959)), ``The \n                effective functioning of a free government like ours \n                depends largely on the force of an informed public \n                opinion. This calls for the widest possible \n                understanding of the quality of government service \n                rendered by all elective or appointed public officials \n                or employees.'';\n            (2) the American people firmly believe that our system of \n        government must itself be governed by a presumption of \n        openness;\n            (3) the Freedom of Information Act establishes a ``strong \n        presumption in favor of disclosure'' as noted by the United \n        States Supreme Court in United States Department of State v. \n        Ray (502 U.S. 164 (1991)), a presumption that applies to all \n        agencies governed by that Act;\n            (4) ``disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of \n        the Act,'' as noted by the United States Supreme Court in \n        Department of Air Force v. Rose (425 U.S. 352 (1976));\n            (5) in practice, the Freedom of Information Act has not \n        always lived up to the ideals of that Act; and\n            (6) Congress should regularly review section 552 of title \n        5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of \n        Information Act), in order to determine whether further changes \n        and improvements are necessary to ensure that the Government \n        remains open and accessible to the American people and is \n        always based not upon the ``need to know'' but upon the \n        fundamental ``right to know''.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION OF FEE STATUS FOR NEWS MEDIA.\n\n    Section 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) of title 5, United States Code, is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n``In making a determination of a representative of the news media under \nsubclause (II), an agency may not deny that status solely on the basis \nof the absence of institutional associations of the requester, but \nshall consider the prior publication history of the requester. Prior \npublication history shall include books, magazine and newspaper \narticles, newsletters, television and radio broadcasts, and Internet \npublications. If the requestor has no prior publication history or \ncurrent affiliation, the agency shall consider the requestor's stated \nintent at the time the request is made to distribute information to a \nreasonably broad audience.''.\n\nSEC. 4. RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS.\n\n    Section 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \nadding at the end the following: ``For purposes of this section, a \ncomplainant has `substantially prevailed' if the complainant has \nobtained a substantial part of its requested relief through a judicial \nor administrative order or an enforceable written agreement, or if the \ncomplainant's pursuit of a nonfrivolous claim or defense has been a \ncatalyst for a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the \nopposing party that provides a substantial part of the requested \nrelief.''.\n\nSEC. 5. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS FOR ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS REJECTIONS OF \n              REQUESTS.\n\n    Section 552(a)(4)(F) of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(F)''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(ii) The Attorney General shall--\n            ``(I) notify the Special Counsel of each civil action \n        described under the first sentence of clause (i); and\n            ``(II) annually submit a report to Congress on the number \n        of such civil actions in the preceding year.\n    ``(iii) The Special Counsel shall annually submit a report to \nCongress on the actions taken by the Special Counsel under clause \n(i).''.\n\nSEC. 6.
