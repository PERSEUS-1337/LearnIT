    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Clinical Research Act of 2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Strong academic health centers are essential to a \n        vigorous clinical research enterprise.\n            (2) Breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences over the \n        past 5 decades have provided an unprecedented supply of \n        information for improving human health and preventing disease.\n            (3) Translating the information gained through these basic \n        discoveries into knowledge that will impact clinical practice \n        and ultimately human health requires strong clinical research \n        institutions.\n            (4) Without a sound infrastructure to accomplish this \n        translation in a systematic and coherent way, the sum of data \n        and information produced by the basic science enterprise will \n        not result in tangible public benefit.\n            (5) The clinical research environment is increasingly \n        encumbered by facility decay, incompatible databases, shortage \n        of qualified investigators, rising costs, inadequate funding, \n        and mounting unreimbursed regulatory burdens such as human \n        subject research protections and additional record-keeping \n        requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and \n        Accountability Act of 1996.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n        the National Institutes of Health.\n            (2) Eligible academic health center.--The term ``eligible \n        academic health center'' means--\n                    (A) an academic institution that receives an annual \n                average of not less than $20,000,000 in grant funds \n                from the Department of Defense, the Department of \n                Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Health and \n                Human Services for basic, applied, or clinical \n                biomedical or behavioral research in the fields of \n                dentistry, medicine, and nursing; or\n                    (B) a consortium of such academic institutions.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Health and Human Services.\n\nSEC. 4. CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT GRANTS.\n\n    (a) Authorization.--For the purposes described in subsection (b), \nthe Director shall award a clinical research support grant in the \namount determined under subsection (c) to each eligible academic health \ncenter that submits an application in accordance with this section.\n    (b) Purpose.--A funding agreement for a grant under this section is \nthat the eligible academic health center involved will use the grant \nonly for the following purposes:\n            (1) To defray the costs of unfunded Federal requirements \n        for the protection of human research subjects, including the \n        costs of complying with the Health Insurance Portability and \n        Accountability Act of 1996 (Pub. Law 104-191) and maintaining \n        institutional review boards.\n            (2) To support activities leading to innovative ways to \n        meet the requirements described in paragraph (1) in an \n        efficient and cost effective manner.\n    (c) Allocation.--Of the amount appropriated to carry out this \nsection for a fiscal year, the Director shall allocate such \nappropriated amount among the eligible academic health centers \nreceiving a grant under this section in an amount that bears the same \nrelation to such appropriated amount as the investment in clinical \nresearch of the grantee involved bears to the total investment in \nclinical research of all grantees under this section.\n    (d) Applications.--To be eligible for a grant under this section, \nan eligible academic health center shall submit an application to the \nDirector in such manner, at such time, and containing such information \nand assurances as the Director may require.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this section, \nthere is authorized to be appropriated $40,000,000 for each of the \nfiscal years 2005 through 2009.\n\nSEC. 5.
