    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Social Security Number Online \nProtection Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The inappropriate display of social security account \n        numbers has contributed to a growing range of illegal \n        activities, including fraud, identity theft, stalking, and \n        other crimes that have a substantial effect on interstate \n        commerce and public safety.\n            (2) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n        individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a social \n        security account number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for \n        old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits under \n        title II of the Social Security Act, or to seek employment. An \n        unintended consequence of these requirements is that social \n        security account numbers have become one of the tools that can \n        be used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the \n        privacy of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. \n        Because the Federal Government created and maintains this \n        system, and because the Federal Government does not permit \n        individuals to exempt themselves from those requirements, it is \n        appropriate for the Federal Government to take steps to stem \n        the abuse of social security account numbers.\n            (3) In most jurisdictions throughout the United States, \n        State and local law requires that certain public documents, \n        such as business filings, property records, and birth and \n        marriage certificates, be made available to the general public. \n        These documents may contain an individual's social security \n        account number. An increasing number of official records \n        repositories, such as repositories maintained by a Secretary of \n        State's office or a local clerk's office, are storing such \n        records on the Internet. While online availability of public \n        records improves access, it also increases the risk that social \n        security account numbers will be widely displayed and misused.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON THE DISPLAY TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC ON THE \n              INTERNET OF THE LAST 4 DIGITS OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT \n              NUMBERS BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended by \ninserting after chapter 123 the following new chapter:\n\n``CHAPTER 124--PROHIBITION ON THE DISPLAY TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC ON THE \n  INTERNET OF THE LAST 4 DIGITS OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBERS BY \n                      STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS\n\n``Sec. 2731. Prohibition on the display to the general public on the \n              Internet of the last 4 digits of social security account \n              numbers by State and local governments\n    ``(a) In General.--A State, a political subdivision of a State, or \nany officer, employee, or contractor of a State or a political \nsubdivision of a State, shall not display to the general public on the \nInternet the last 4 digits of any social security account number.\n    ``(b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to supersede, alter, or affect any restriction or limitation \non the display to the general public on the Internet of all, or any \npart of, social security account numbers provided for in any Federal or \nState statute, regulation, order, or interpretation, if the restriction \nor limitation is greater than that provided under this section.\n``Sec. 2732.
