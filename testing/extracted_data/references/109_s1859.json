    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable and Reliable Gas Act of \n2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. LIST OF FUELS.\n\n    (a) List of Fuels.--Section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Clean Air Act (42 \nU.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)) (as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 \n(Public Law 109-58; 119 Stat. 1106)) is amended by striking the second \nclause (v) and inserting the following:\n    ``(vi)(I) The Administrator shall have no authority, when \nconsidering a State implementation plan or a State implementation plan \nrevision, to approve under this paragraph any fuel included in such \nplan or revision if the effect of such approval would be to increase \nthe total number of fuels approved under this paragraph as of September \n1, 2004 in all State implementation plans.\n    ``(II) The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of \nEnergy, shall determine the total number of fuels approved under this \nparagraph as of September 1, 2004, in all State implementation plans \nand shall publish a list of such fuels, including the states and \nPetroleum Administration for Defense District in which they are used, \nin the Federal Register no later than 90 days after enactment.\n    ``(III) The Administrator shall remove a fuel from the list \npublished under subclause (II) if a fuel ceases to be included in a \nState implementation plan or if a fuel in a State implementation plan \nis identical to a Federal fuel formulation implemented by the \nAdministrator and shall reduce the total number of fuels authorized \nunder the list published under subclause (II) appropriately.\n    ``(IV) Subclause (I) shall not limit the Administrator's authority \nto approve a control or prohibition respecting any new fuel under this \nparagraph in a State's implementation plan or a revision to that \nState's implementation plan after the date of enactment of this Act if \nsuch new fuel completely replaces a fuel on the list published under \nsubclause (II).\n    ``(V) The Administrator shall have no authority under this \nparagraph, when considering any particular State's implementation plan \nor a revision to that State's implementation plan, to approve any fuel \nunless that fuel was, as of the date of such consideration, approved in \nat least one State implementation plan in the applicable Petroleum \nAdministrator for Defense District. However, the Administrator may \napprove as part of a State implementation plan or State implementation \nplan revision a fuel with a summertime Reid Vapor Pressure of 7.0 psi. \nIn no event shall such approval by the Administrator cause an increase \nin the total number of fuels on the list published under subclause (II) \nas of the date of consideration.\n    ``(VI) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to have any effect \nregarding any available authority of States to require the use of any \nfuel additive registered in accordance with subsection (b), including \nany fuel additive registered in accordance with subsection (b) after \nthe enactment of this subclause.\n    ``(vii)(I) The provisions of clause (vi), including the limitations \nof the authority of the Administrator and the cap on the total number \nof fuels permitted, shall remain in effect until the harmonization of \nfuels under subclause V of this clause is accomplished. Once such \nharmonization has been accomplished, clause (v) shall sunset and the \nlimitations of the authority of the Administrator under subclause (IV) \nof this clause shall apply.\n    ``(II) The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of \nEnergy (hereinafter in this clause referred to as the `Secretary'), \nshall identify and publish in the Federal Register, within 12 months \nafter the enactment of this subclause and after notice and opportunity \nfor public comment, a list of 5 gasolines and diesel fuels to be used \nin States that have not received a waiver under section 209(b) of this \nAct. The list shall be referred to as the `Federal Fuels List' and \nshall include one Federal on-road diesel fuel (which shall grandfather \nthe sulfur phase down in the Administrator's ultra low sulfur diesel \nfuel regulations in effect as of the date of enactment and shall permit \nthe implementation of one alternative diesel fuel, approved under this \nsubparagraph before enactment of this subclause for a State that has \nnot received a section 209(b) waiver, only in the State in which it was \napproved prior to enactment), one conventional gasoline for ozone \nattainment areas, one reformulated gasoline (RFG) meeting the \nrequirements of subsection (k), and 2 additional gasolines with Reid \nvapor pressure (RVP) controls for use in ozone attainment areas of \nvarying degrees of severity. None of the fuels identified under this \nsubclause shall control fuel sulfur or toxics levels beyond levels \nrequired by regulations of the Administrator.\n    ``(III) Gasolines and diesel fuels shall be included on the Federal \nFuels List based on the Administrator's analysis of their ability to \nreduce ozone emissions to assist States in attaining established ozone \nstandards under this Act, and on an analysis by the Secretary that the \nadoption of the Federal Fuels List will not result in a reduction in \nsupply or in producibility, including that caused by a reduction in \ndomestic refining capacity as a result of the adoption of the Federal \nFuels List. In the event the Secretary concludes that adoption of the \nFederal Fuels List will result in a reduction in supply or in \nproducibility, the Administrator and the Secretary shall report that \nconclusion to Congress, and suspend implementation of this clause. The \nAdministrator and the Secretary shall conduct the study required under \nsection 1541(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 on the timetable \nrequired in that section to provide Congress with legislative \nrecommendations for modifications to the proposed Federal Fuels List \nonly if the Secretary concludes that adoption of the Federal Fuels List \nwill result in a reduction in supply or in producibility.\n    ``(IV) Upon publication of the Federal Fuels List, the \nAdministrator shall have no authority, when considering a State \nimplementation plan or State implementation plan revisions, to approve \nunder this subparagraph any fuel included in such plan or plan revision \nif the proposed fuel is not one of the fuels on the Federal Fuels List; \nor to approve a State's plan or plan revision to move from one fuel on \nthe Federal Fuels List to another unless, after consultation with the \nSecretary, the Administrator publishes in the Federal Register, after \nnotice and opportunity for public comment, a finding that, in the \nAdministrator's judgment, such plan or plan revision to adopt a \ndifferent fuel on the Federal Fuels List will not cause fuel supply or \ndistribution disruptions in the affected area or contiguous areas. The \nAdministrator's finding shall include an assessment of reasonably \nforeseeable supply or distribution emergencies that could occur in the \naffected area or contiguous area and how adoption of the particular \nfuel revisions would effect alternative supply options during \nreasonably foreseeable supply or distribution emergencies.\n    ``(V) The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, shall \ndevelop a plan to harmonize the currently approved fuels in State \nimplementation plans with the fuels included on the Federal Fuels List \nand shall promulgate implementing regulations for this plan not later \nthan 18 months after enactment of this subclause. This harmonization \nshall be fully implemented by the States by December 31, 2008.''.\n    (b) Boutique Fuels.--Section 1541 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 \n(Public Law 109-58; 119 Stat. 1106) is amended by striking subsection \n(c) and inserting the following:\n    ``(c) Study and Report to Congress on Boutique Fuels.--\n            ``(1) Joint study.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency and the Secretary of Energy shall undertake a \n        study of the effects on air quality, on the number of fuel \n        blends, on fuel availability, on fuel fungibility, and on fuel \n        costs of the State plan provisions adopted pursuant to section \n        211(c)(4)(C) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)).\n            ``(2) Focus of study.--The primary focus of the study \n        required under paragraph (1) shall be to determine how to \n        develop a Federal fuels system that maximizes motor fuel \n        fungibility and supply, preserves air quality standards, and \n        reduces motor fuel price volatility that results from the \n        proliferation of boutique fuels, and to recommend to Congress \n        such legislative changes as are necessary to implement such a \n        system. The study should include the impacts on overall energy \n        supply, distribution, and use as a result of the legislative \n        changes recommended. The study should include an analysis of \n        the impact on ozone emissions and supply of a mandatory \n        reduction in the number of fuel blends to 5, including one on-\n        road Federal diesel fuel (which shall grandfather the sulfur \n        phase down in the Administrator's ultra low sulfur diesel fuel \n        regulations and shall permit the implementation of, one \n        alternative diesel fuel, blend approved under this subparagraph \n        before enactment of this subclause for a State that has not \n        received a section 209(b) waiver, only in the State in which it \n        was approved prior to enactment), one conventional gasoline for \n        ozone attainment areas, one reformulated gasoline (RFG) meeting \n        the requirements of subsection (k), and 2 additional gasolines \n        blends with Reid vapor pressure (RVP) controls for use in ozone \n        attainment areas of varying degrees of severity.\n            ``(3) Conduct of study.--In carrying out their joint duties \n        under this section, the Administrator and the Secretary shall \n        use sound science and objective science practices, shall \n        consider the best available science, shall use data collected \n        by accepted means and shall consider and include a description \n        of the weight of the scientific evidence.
