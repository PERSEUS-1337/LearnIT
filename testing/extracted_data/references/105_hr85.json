FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the number of criminal bombing incidents in the United \n        States has doubled since 1988;\n            (2) each year, hundreds of millions of pounds of explosives \n        are purchased without a permit being required;\n            (3) about one-third of the bombs used in crime in recent \n        years have contained black powder or smokeless powder as \n        filler;\n            (4) the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center, a \n        series of bombings in western New York State, the bombing of \n        the Federal building in Oklahoma City, and the bombing in \n        Centennial Park in Atlanta demonstrate the grave dangers of \n        bomb attacks;\n            (5) effective regulation of interstate commerce in \n        explosives is possible only with changes in the regulatory \n        framework;\n            (6) explosive materials, by their nature, are composed of \n        numerous different substances, many of which have travelled in \n        interstate or foreign commerce; and\n            (7) the protection of the safety and property of the \n        citizenry, including the infrastructure vital to the conduct of \n        interstate and foreign commerce, requires more careful \n        regulation of explosives transactions.\n\nSEC. 3.
