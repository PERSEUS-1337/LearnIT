PROGRAM GUIDANCE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) considerable effort and expenditure has been devoted \n        since 1981 to the modernization of the National Airspace \n        System, with limited results;\n            (2) long-standing management, organizational, and cultural \n        impediments at the Federal Aviation Administration have led to \n        cost overruns, schedule delays, program terminations, and other \n        wasteful inefficiencies;\n            (3) a lack of coordination between the technology \n        developers and operational sections of the Federal Aviation \n        Administration has led to research, engineering, and \n        development programs that are unbalanced because they either \n        are too technology driven or have operational requirements that \n        are unrealistic or unwarranted;\n            (4) the research, engineering, and development functions of \n        the Federal Aviation Administration have been carried out \n        without the benefit of critical management education and \n        competencies;\n            (5) the failure to employ contemporary management \n        techniques and industry best practices has led to inadequate \n        contractor oversight and poor risk management; and\n            (6) significant improvements in modernizing the National \n        Airspace System will require fundamental changes in the Federal \n        Aviation Administration's acquisition management system and in \n        the orientation of the officials who implement the system.\n    (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n            (1) the term ``affordable'' means having life-cycle costs \n        that are in consonance with the long-range funding and \n        operational design plans for the National Airspace System;\n            (2) the term ``evolutionary acquisition'' means an \n        acquisition strategy in which a core capability is fielded with \n        a modular structure that allows for changes as requirements are \n        refined;\n            (3) the term ``life-cycle costs'' means the total costs to \n        the Federal Government of a system over its useful life, \n        including the costs of research, development, acquisition, \n        support, and disposal;\n            (4) the term ``nondevelopmental'' means not requiring \n        significant further development to be made usefully \n        operational; and\n            (5) the term ``pre-planned product improvement'' means an \n        acquisition strategy that defers technically difficult or \n        unknown system requirements to mitigate risks or to field a \n        system that incorporates design considerations that facilitate \n        future changes.\n    (c) Operational Principles.--The Federal Aviation Administration \nshall develop, implement, and maintain a disciplined acquisition \nmanagement system that facilitates the transforming of broadly stated \nrequirements into affordable, operationally effective and suitable \nproducts and services to meet the needs of users of the National \nAirspace System. Such acquisition management system shall be based on \nand incorporate the following principles:\n            (1) The employment and integration of--\n                    (A) a process to establish and validate \n                requirements;\n                    (B) full life-cycle acquisition management; and\n                    (C) planning, programming, and budgeting.\n            (2) Full involvement of both acquisition and operational \n        Federal Aviation Administration personnel in the processes \n        described in paragraph (1) (A), (B), and (C).\n            (3) Early and continuous involvement of National Airspace \n        System operators and users, advisory committees, and industry \n        vendors and experts in establishing and stabilizing sound, \n        realistic operational requirements.\n            (4) Assignment of acquisition officials based on \n        demonstrated leadership, professionalism, and proven \n        acquisition management competencies, consistent with their \n        positional responsibility and authority.\n            (5) Full life-cycle, event-driven acquisition strategies \n        which explicitly link major interim program decisions and \n        contractual commitments to demonstrated accomplishments in \n        research, engineering, and development.\n            (6) The balancing of system design requirements and \n        constraints based on cost-benefit sensitivity analysis.\n            (7) Consideration of maximum practicable use of \n        nonmaterial, nondevelopmental, or commercial solutions before \n        embarking on protracted research, engineering, and development \n        activities by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n            (8) Consideration of evolutionary acquisition and pre-\n        planned product improvement strategies to mitigate risks and \n        expeditiously field products and services.\n            (9) Use of contemporary management techniques and industry \n        best practices to--\n                    (A) compare the current status of a program to \n                where it should be;\n                    (B) reassess the goals of a program and the plans \n                for achieving those goals;\n                    (C) assess program risks and strategies for \n                mitigating those risks; and\n                    (D) assess whether the program is affordable.\n    (d) Document of April 1, 1996.--The Congress recognizes that the \nacquisition management system set forth in the document dated April 1, \n1996, issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, is substantially \ncompatible with the principles stated in subsection (c) of this \nsection. The Federal Aviation Administration may implement that \nproposed system as a suitable compliance with the requirements of this \nsection, and may modify elements of that system to the extent that \nthose modifications conform with the principles stated in subsection \n(c) of this section."
