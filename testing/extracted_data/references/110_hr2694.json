FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Consumers are entitled to diagnose, service, maintain, \n        or repair their own motor vehicles if they so choose, or to \n        choose a service provider to perform these services for their \n        motor vehicles.\n            (2) Consumers are entitled to all information about safety \n        alerts, recalls, and other events relevant to the operation of \n        their vehicles and to have this information available to their \n        service providers in order to ensure the fuel efficient and \n        safe operation of their motor vehicles.\n            (3) Promoting competition in price and quality for the \n        diagnosis of problems, service, maintenance, and repair of \n        motor vehicles will benefit consumers.\n            (4) Regular diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair of \n        motor vehicles, motor vehicle equipment, and motor vehicle \n        systems such as pollution control, transmission, antilock \n        brakes, electronic and mechanical systems, heating and air-\n        conditioning, and steering are essential to improve fuel \n        economy, protect the environment, and promote the safety of \n        modern motor vehicles.\n            (5) Better fuel economy can reduce our dependence on \n        foreign oil and help protect the environment. Proper \n        maintenance of a motor vehicle can significantly improve its \n        gas mileage. Fixing a motor vehicle that is noticeably out of \n        tune can improve its gas mileage by an average of 4 percent. \n        Replacing a clogged air filter can improve a motor vehicle's \n        mileage by as much as 10 percent. Fixing a serious maintenance \n        problem, such as a faulty oxygen sensor, can improve a motor \n        vehicle's mileage by as much as 40 percent.\n            (6) Computers of various kinds increasingly are being used \n        by manufacturers in motor vehicle equipment and motor vehicle \n        systems. On-board computer technology controls virtually all of \n        the vehicle's systems, and only service technicians with the \n        necessary information can access the computers to perform \n        diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair of the vehicle.\n            (7) Manufacturers have made available to their authorized \n        dealers and service providers the information, tools, and \n        replacement equipment necessary to diagnose problems and to \n        service, maintain, and repair motor vehicles that incorporate \n        computers in their motor vehicle systems.\n            (8) Manufacturers have failed to make available, or have \n        inhibited, restricted, or limited the availability to consumers \n        and independent service providers of the information, tools, \n        and replacement equipment necessary to diagnose, service, \n        maintain, and repair consumers' motor vehicles. A statistically \n        valid and reliable survey of 10,000 consumers reported that 14 \n        percent were turned away in calendar year 2006 and told to go \n        to an authorized dealer because the independent car repair shop \n        ``did not have the tools, equipment or information required to \n        do'' the required service. Of these 14 percent, 62 percent \n        stated that they were inconvenienced by the turn away. Of these \n        turned away, 25 percent said that they would not or probably \n        would not return to the independent garage because of the \n        inconvenience incurred.\n            (9) Overall, independent service providers lose an average \n        of 5.6 percent in productivity per month because of the lack of \n        information and tools, which translates into an annual revenue \n        loss of approximately $5.8 billion.\n            (10) Consumers expressed a clear preference for independent \n        repair shops for two significant reasons--convenience and \n        price. By a ratio of 25 to 17, they expressed a preference for \n        independent repair shops when convenience is the principle \n        factor, and by a ratio of 13 to 5 when price is the principle \n        factor choice.\n            (11) Consumers whose service providers cannot repair their \n        motor vehicles because neither the consumer nor the service \n        provider has access to the necessary information and tools lose \n        both time and money and may have no realistic choice but to \n        turn to an authorized dealer. Independent service providers \n        suffer a business loss because they have to turn away consumers \n        or expend time and effort contacting manufacturers' \n        representatives to try to obtain the necessary information.\n            (12) Consumers in the United States have benefited from the \n        availability of a wide choice of service providers for their \n        motor vehicles. The American economy has also benefited from \n        the availability of an aftermarket tools and parts supply that \n        provides jobs to over 5 million workers in 495,000 businesses, \n        and generates $200 billion in annual sales.\n            (13) Vehicle owners in the United States should have the \n        right--\n                    (A) to all information necessary to allow the \n                diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair of their \n                vehicles;\n                    (B) to have access to information, tools, and \n                replacement equipment so that they can, if they wish, \n                diagnose problems themselves and maintain, service, and \n                repair their own vehicles; and\n                    (C) to the availability at both authorized and \n                independent service providers of the tools, replacement \n                equipment, and information necessary to diagnose \n                problems in vehicles and to service, maintain, and \n                repair them.\n            (14) Discriminating between authorized dealers and \n        independent service providers and restricting the availability \n        of information, tools and replacement equipment limits who can \n        diagnose, service, maintain, and repair motor vehicles and what \n        tools and replacement equipment may be used to repair those \n        vehicles, limits consumer choice, limits competition, and \n        impedes the safe and energy-efficient operation of motor \n        vehicles.\n            (15) Access for consumers and all service providers of \n        information, tools, and replacement equipment necessary to the \n        diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair of motor vehicles \n        can be accomplished without infringing manufacturers' \n        legitimate trade secrets.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To protect consumers' rights to choose a service \n        provider for the diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair of \n        their motor vehicles;\n            (2) To promote safety and energy efficiency by requiring \n        motor vehicle manufacturers to make available to consumers and \n        their service providers the information, parts and tools \n        necessary to facilitate regular diagnosis, service, \n        maintenance, and repair of motor vehicles, motor vehicle \n        equipment, and motor vehicle systems; and\n            (3) To promote competition in price and quality for the \n        diagnosis of problems, and the service, maintenance, and repair \n        of motor vehicles by giving consumers the widest possible \n        choice of service providers.\n\nSEC. 3. MANUFACTURER REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Duty To Disclose Information.--The manufacturer of a motor \nvehicle sold, leased, or otherwise introduced into commerce in the \nUnited States shall provide to the motor vehicle owner, and to all \nservice providers on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, all \ninformation necessary to diagnose, service, maintain, or repair the \nmotor vehicle, and all information necessary to fully utilize the tools \nand motor vehicle equipment (including replacement equipment) needed to \ndiagnose, service, maintain, and repair the motor vehicle. Such \ninformation shall include--\n            (1) information about safety alerts, recalls, service \n        bulletins and the need for adjustments to maintain energy \n        efficiency;\n            (2) information necessary to access and integrate \n        replacement equipment into the motor vehicle; and\n            (3) all other information of any kind needed or used to \n        diagnose, service, maintain, repair, activate, certify, or \n        install any motor vehicle equipment (including replacement \n        equipment) in a motor vehicle.\n    (b) Duty To Make Tools Available.--The manufacturer of a motor \nvehicle sold, leased, or otherwise introduced into commerce in the \nUnited States shall offer for sale to consumers, and to all service \nproviders on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, any tool \nnecessary to diagnose, service, maintain, or repair a motor vehicle, \nand shall provide the information necessary to enable aftermarket tool \ncompanies to manufacture tools with the same functional characteristics \nas those tools made available by the manufacturers to authorized \ndealers.\n    (c) Replacement Equipment.--The manufacturer of a motor vehicle \nsold, leased, or otherwise introduced into commerce in the United \nStates shall offer for sale to consumers, and to all service providers \non reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, all equipment necessary to \ndiagnose, service, maintain, or repair a motor vehicle.\n    (d) Protection of Trade Secrets.--\n            (1) A manufacturer may not be required to publicly disclose \n        information that, if made public, would divulge methods or \n        processes entitled to protection as trade secrets.\n            (2) No information may be withheld by a manufacturer on the \n        ground that it is a trade secret if that information is \n        provided (directly or indirectly) to authorized dealers or \n        service providers.\n\nSEC. 4.
