FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Iran voted in the United Nations General Assembly on \n        December 10, 1948, to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human \n        Rights, thereby committing to guarantee the ``life, liberty, \n        and security of person'' of all people and rejecting ``cruel, \n        inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment''.\n            (2) The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n        guarantees certain human rights and fundamental freedoms, \n        including political and civil rights, along with economic, \n        social, and cultural rights, including a prohibition on torture \n        and a guarantee of sentencing according to the law.\n            (3) The Islamic Republic of Iran is a party to 4 major \n        United Nations human rights treaties: the Convention on the \n        Rights of the Child (which it ratified on July 13, 1994), the \n        International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n        Racial Discrimination (which it ratified on August 29, 1968), \n        and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n        and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \n        Rights (both of which it ratified on June 24, 1975).\n            (4) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is \n        violating its international and constitutional obligations to \n        respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of its \n        citizens, including by--\n                    (A) using torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading \n                treatment or punishment, including flogging, and \n                amputations;\n                    (B) carrying out an increasingly high rate of \n                executions in the absence of internationally recognized \n                safeguards, including public executions and executions \n                of juvenile offenders;\n                    (C) using stoning as a method of execution and \n                maintaining a high number of persons in prison who \n                continue to face sentences of execution by stoning;\n                    (D) carrying out arrests, violent repression, and \n                sentencing of women exercising their right to peaceful \n                assembly, a campaign of intimidation against women's \n                rights defenders, and continuing discrimination against \n                women and girls;\n                    (E) permitting or carrying out increasing \n                discrimination and other human rights violations \n                against persons belonging to religious, ethnic, \n                linguistic, or other minorities;\n                    (F) imposing ongoing, systematic, and serious \n                restrictions of freedom of peaceful assembly and \n                association and freedom of opinion and expression, \n                including the continuing closures of media outlets, \n                arrests of journalists, and the censorship of \n                expression in online forums such as blogs and websites; \n                and\n                    (G) imposing severe limitations and restrictions on \n                freedom of religion and belief, including by carrying \n                out arbitrary arrests, indefinite detentions, and \n                lengthy jail sentences for those exercising their \n                rights to freedom of religion or belief and proposing a \n                provision in a draft penal code that sets out a \n                mandatory death sentence for apostasy, the abandoning \n                of one's faith.\n            (5) On June 19, 2009, the United Nations High Commissioner \n        for Human Rights expressed concerns about the increasing number \n        of arrests not in conformity with the law and the illegal use \n        of excessive force in responding to protests following the June \n        12, 2009, elections in Iran, resulting in at least dozens of \n        deaths and hundreds of injuries.\n            (6) On August 1, 2009, authorities in the Islamic Republic \n        of Iran began a mass trial of more than 100 individuals in \n        connection with election protests, most of whom were held for \n        weeks, in solitary confinement, with little or no access to \n        their lawyers or families, and many of whom showed signs of \n        torture or abuse.\n            (7) The Supreme Leader of Iran issued a statement on \n        October 28, 2009, effectively criminalizing dissent in the \n        aftermath of the national election of June 12, 2009.\n            (8) On November 4, 2009, security forces in the Islamic \n        Republic of Iran used brutal force to disperse thousands of \n        protesters, resulting in a number of injuries and arrests, in \n        violation of international standards regarding the \n        proportionate use of force against peaceful demonstrations.\n            (9) At least 8 citizens of Iran were killed and an \n        undetermined number were injured on December 27, 2009, when \n        security forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran violently broke \n        up peaceful gatherings during the Ashura holiday.\n            (10) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n        recently sentenced numerous Iranian citizens to death without \n        due process for politicized crimes relating to the peaceful \n        demonstrations that followed the June 12, 2009, elections, \n        including ``waging war against God'', and has begun carrying \n        out those execution sentences, including the death by hanging \n        of 2 individuals on January 28, 2010.\n\nSEC. 3.
