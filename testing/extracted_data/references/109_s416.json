    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Intermediary Lending \nPilot Program Act of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Small and emerging businesses, particularly startups \n        and businesses that lack sufficient or conventional collateral, \n        continue to face barriers accessing midsized loans in amounts \n        between $35,000 and $200,000, with affordable terms and \n        conditions.\n            (2) Consolidation in the banking industry has resulted in a \n        decrease in the number of small, locally controlled banks with \n        not more than $100,000,000 in assets and has changed the method \n        by which banks make small business credit decisions with--\n                    (A) credit scoring techniques replacing \n                relationship-based lending, which often works to the \n                disadvantage of small or startup businesses that do not \n                conform with a bank's standardized credit formulas; and\n                    (B) less flexible terms and conditions, which are \n                often necessary for small and emerging businesses.\n            (3) In the environment described in paragraphs (1) and (2), \n        nonprofit intermediary lenders, including community development \n        corporations, provide financial resources that supplement the \n        small business lending and investments of a bank by--\n                    (A) providing riskier, up front, or subordinated \n                capital;\n                    (B) offering flexible terms and underwriting \n                procedures; and\n                    (C) providing technical assistance to businesses in \n                order to reduce the transaction costs and risk exposure \n                of banks.\n            (4) Several Federal programs, including the Microloan \n        Program under section 7(m) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n        636(m)) and the Intermediary Relending Program of the \n        Department of Agriculture, have demonstrated the effectiveness \n        of working through nonprofit intermediaries to address the \n        needs of small business concerns that are unable to access \n        capital through conventional sources.\n            (5) More than 1,000 nonprofit intermediary lenders in the \n        United States are--\n                    (A) successfully providing financial and technical \n                assistance to small and emerging businesses;\n                    (B) working with banks and other lenders to \n                leverage additional capital for their business \n                borrowers; and\n                    (C) creating employment opportunities for low \n                income individuals through their lending and business \n                development activities.\n\nSEC. 3.
