    "content": "That this Act may be \ncited as the ``National Topsoil Preservation Act of 1993''.\n    Sec. 2. The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) topsoil is a valuable, unique, and peculiar natural \n        resource upon which future generations will be dependent and \n        that while ownership of land in the United States, both \n        privately and under the control of government agencies, \n        provides those in control with certain rights, it also carries \n        with it a responsibility not to destroy the topsoil or so \n        intermingle or bury it that it will not be easily and \n        economically accessible for use at a later date;\n            (2) in order to promote the general welfare and to protect \n        the natural resources of the Nation for both present and future \n        generations, it is necessary in the use and management of the \n        Nation's land resources to provide minimum standards which \n        incorporate environmental, ecological, social, esthetic, \n        economic, conservation, and other factors and prevent the \n        destruction of topsoil and unnecessary interruption of plant \n        reproduction and soil-building processes; and\n            (3) failure to establish minimum standards for the use of \n        land which will protect against the loss of topsoil in and of \n        itself causes those using inadequate standards to move to areas \n        where destructive practices are permitted and therefore such \n        failure to establish such minimum standards affect and is a \n        burden upon commerce among the States.\n    Sec. 3. Each project or activity which is carried out on Federal \nland (including lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the \nInterior), for which any direct or indirect Federal assistance is \nprovided, or which is carried out by the Secretary of the Interior or \nany other agency or instrumentality of the United States, and which \ninvolves the moving or covering of topsoil in changing an area of land \nfrom its natural state shall be subject to this Act. Such projects and \nactivities shall hereinafter in this Act be referred to as \n``projects''.\n    Sec. 4. (a) There is hereby established a National Land Resources \nProtection Commission, hereinafter in this Act referred to as ``the \nCommission'', which shall be composed of the Secretary of the Interior \nand four other members. The President shall designate the Secretary of \nthe Interior as Chairman of the Commission.\n    (b) Members of the Commission shall be appointed by the President, \nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for terms of four \nyears beginning July 1 of the year following each Presidential \nelection. Vacancies on the Commission shall be filled in the same \nmanner as original appointments but only for the unexpired term and any \nmember of the Commission may be removed by the President at any time. \nEach member shall receive compensation at the rate of $67,500 per \nannum.\n    (c) The Commission is authorized, subject to the civil service and \nclassification laws, to select, appoint, employ, and fix the \ncompensation of such officers and employees as are necessary to carry \nout the provisions of this Act and to prescribe their authority and \nduties.\n    (d) The Commission shall hold such meetings, conduct such hearings, \nand establish such rules and regulations in accordance with chapter 5, \ntitle 5, United States Code, relating to administrative procedure, as \nmay be reasonably necessary to enable it to carry out the provisions of \nthis Act.\n    (e) The Commission may delegate responsibilities hereunder within \nany particular State to a commission or commissions within that State \nunder terms and conditions assuring that at least the Federal minimum \nstandards established under the provisions of this Act will be adhered \nto in such State. In each State where responsibilities have been \ndelegated hereunder, the Commission shall exercise a continuing \noversight to assure that the purposes of this Act are being constantly \ncarried out and the Commission is also authorized to cancel such \ndelegation of authority at any time.\n    (f) The Commission or any member may administer oaths or \naffirmations or take evidence; and may by a majority vote subpoena and \ncompel the attendance of witnesses or the production of materials.\n    Sec. 5. (a) The Commission shall establish minimum standards for \nall projects which assure that a minimum of twelve inches of topsoil or \nsuch lesser amount of topsoil as may exist shall be stockpiled from \nthose areas of each project where the shape or contour of the land is \nchanged or where the land is covered. Such topsoil shall not be \nintermingled with other materials or buried so that it will not be \neasily and economically accessible for use at a later date; and, to the \nextent it is sufficient or adequate to do so, such topsoil shall be \nused to form a top layer of uniform depth and a minimum of twelve \ninches deep on all areas of the completed project where soil will be \nexposed to natural elements. Any excess topsoil from such stockpile \nwhich is not so used or needed to cover such exposed areas to a depth \nof twelve inches or more shall be stockpiled permanently in a place \nwhere it will improve plant production or be easily and economically \naccessible for use at a later date.\n    (b) Where sufficient subsoil which is nontoxic to plantlife will \nnot otherwise be available on the exposed areas of a completed project \nand to the extent available from the project, the Commission shall \nrequire the separate stockpiling and replacement in a sublayer of \nsufficient quantities of appropriate soil to provide such a nontoxic \nlayer of subsoil as if necessary for the production of such plantlife \nas is normally considered environmentally, ecologically, esthetically, \nand economically acceptable to the area.\n    (c) The overriding objective of this section is to require that the \nareas of a completed project where the earth is normally exposed shall \nbe left in at least substantially as good a condition to sustain \nvegetation as existed prior to the beginning of the project and to \nprotect against the destruction of the productive capacity of existing \ntopsoil which has currently been exposed to the elements or used to \nsustain plantlife; and the Commission shall establish rules and \nregulations and provide interpretations consistent with such objective.\n    (d) For the purposes of this Act, the term ``topsoil'' shall mean \nthe surface layer of soil, commonly known as the A-horizon, which \ncontains organic and mineral matter in such quantities as are needed to \nprovide the fertility necessary for the production of vegetation.\n    Sec. 6. The Commission shall establish minimum standards to assure \nthat projects covered by this Act will not cause pollution of existing \nstreams, land slides, flooding or substantially change the volume of \nwater to be carried by natural waterways on land adjoining the \nimmediate construction area except where such change is consistent with \nan approved State or Federal water resource policy or law.\n    Sec. 7. No soil shall be moved on any project where the moving or \ncovering of topsoil covers an area in excess of one hundred thousand \nsquare feet until a license or letter of approval to do so has been \nissued by the Commission or by a commission to whom authority has been \ndelegated under section 4(e) of this Act. A letter of approval from the \ndirector of the appropriate State soil conservation service shall be \ndeemed sufficient for purposes of the preceding sentence with regard to \nany agricultural lands being restructured for the purpose of increased \nproductivity, soil conservancy, water conservancy, or reduction of air \nor water pollution.\n    Sec. 8. On all projects where the Commission deems it necessary to \nassure the fulfillment of the purposes of this Act, the Commission may \nrequire prior to the beginning of any moving of earth, the submission \nof a plan prepared by a professional engineer or surveyor. Where \nappropriate, aerial photographs showing details in sufficient contour \nto the satisfaction of the Commission or a United States Department of \nthe Interior Geological Survey topographic map may be substituted to \nshow the area in its current state. Such plan may require the showing \nof boundaries of the area of land affected and the elevation involved, \ndrainage plans below, above, and away from the area of land affected \nboth before and after construction, the topography of the land involved \nand its relationship to adjoining property, the direct flow of the \nwater and its relationship to natural waterways, a definite and \ndetailed plan in accordance with section 5 herein for removing and \nstockpiling and replacing the soil from the land in separate layers and \na segregated state so as to assure that it will be kept and replaced in \na usable condition for sustaining vegetation, and such other \ninformation as the Commission deems necessary to assure that the \nparticular project will not violate the minimum standards established \nunder this Act. The Commission may also require the posting of such \nbond or deposit of cash or securities as it deems necessary to assure \nthat such standards will be met prior to completion of the project and \nwithin a reasonable time during the completion of various stages of the \nproject.\n    Sec. 9. The Commission shall submit a report to the Congress by \nJuly 31 of each year setting forth the activities of the Commission and \nshall also submit to the Congress such other reports as may be \nrequested by committees of the Congress established by either the \nUnited States Senate or the United States House of Representatives.\n    Sec. 10. There is authorized to be appropriated not more than \n$6,000,000 annually for the administration of this Act for each fiscal \nyear commencing after September 30, 1993.\n\n                       compliance with budget act\n\n    Sec. 11. No authority under this Act to enter into contracts or to \nmake payments shall be effective except to the extent and in such \namounts as provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Any provision of \nthis Act which, directly or indirectly, authorizes the enactment of new \nbudget authority shall be effective only for fiscal years beginning \nafter September 30, 1993."
