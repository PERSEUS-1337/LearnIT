FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The World Health Organization formally recognizes \n        infertility as a disease, and the Centers for Disease Control \n        and Prevention have stated that infertility is an emerging \n        public health priority.\n            (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, approximately 3,000,000 have infertility.\n            (3) Medical insurance coverage for infertility treatments \n        is sparse and inconsistent at the State level--only 8 States \n        have passed laws to require comprehensive infertility coverage, \n        and under those State laws most employer-sponsored plans are \n        exempt; therefore, coverage for treatments such as in vitro \n        fertilization is limited. According to Mercer's 2005 National \n        Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans, in vitro \n        fertilization was covered by 19 percent of large employer-\n        sponsored health plans and only 11 percent of small employer-\n        sponsored health plans. Even in States with coverage mandates, \n        out-of-pocket expenses for these treatments are significant.\n\nSEC. 3.
