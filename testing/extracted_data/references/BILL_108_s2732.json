FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) school transportation issues have concerned parents, \n        local educational agencies, lawmakers, the National Highway \n        Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation \n        Safety Board, and the Environmental Protection Agency for \n        years;\n            (2) millions of children face potential future health \n        problems because of exposure to noxious fumes emitted from \n        older school buses;\n            (3) the Environmental Protection Agency established the \n        Clean School Bus USA program to replace 129,000 of the oldest \n        diesel buses that cannot be retrofitted in an effort to help \n        children and the environment by improving air quality;\n            (4) unfortunately, many rural local educational agencies \n        are unable to participate in that program because of the \n        specialized fuels needed to sustain a clean bus fleet;\n            (5) many rural local educational agencies are operating \n        outdated, unsafe school buses that are failing inspection \n        because of automotive flaws, resulting in a depletion of school \n        bus fleets of the local educational agencies; and\n            (6) many rural local educational agencies are unable to \n        afford to buy newer, safer buses.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish within the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency a Federal cost-sharing program to \nassist rural local educational agencies with older, unsafe school bus \nfleets in purchasing newer, safer school buses.\n\nSEC. 3.
