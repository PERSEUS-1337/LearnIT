FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the World Health Organization, arsenic is \n        a natural component of the Earth's crust and is widely and \n        variably distributed throughout the environment in the air, \n        water, and land. It is also used commercially in herbicides and \n        poultry feed.\n            (2) Arsenic is most toxic in its inorganic form.\n            (3) Inorganic arsenic is a known carcinogen and long-term \n        oral exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic is associated \n        with developmental defects, cardiovascular disease, \n        neurotoxicity, and diabetes, according to the World Health \n        Organization.\n            (4) According to the European Food Safety Authority, the \n        estimated exposure of young children to inorganic arsenic is 2 \n        to 3 times the exposure of adults to inorganic arsenic.\n            (5) According to the European Food Safety Authority, diet \n        is the main source of arsenic exposure for most individuals.\n            (6) According to the Food and Drug Administration, due to \n        absorption from the soil and water, arsenic is present in many \n        foods, including grains, fruits, and vegetables.\n            (7) Rice takes up inorganic arsenic from soil and water \n        more readily than other grains, according to the Food and Drug \n        Administration.\n            (8) Rice is a staple food in the diet of many individuals \n        in the United States and is often one of the first foods fed to \n        infants. According to the Food and Drug Administration, \n        inorganic arsenic has been detected in an infant's first foods, \n        such as infant rice cereal and brown rice syrup used in an \n        increasing number of products including toddler formula and \n        snack bars. Inorganic arsenic is also found in other rice \n        products including children's breakfast cereals and rice \n        itself. Rice may continue to be a large part of the diet of \n        children who have swallowing difficulties and gastrointestinal \n        reflux, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n            (9) The Food and Drug Administration's analysis of \n        approximately 1,300 samples found that the average levels of \n        inorganic arsenic for various rice and rice products are 0.1 to \n        7.2 micrograms per serving.\n            (10) The Environmental Protection Agency limits \n        concentrations of arsenic in all forms in drinking water to 10 \n        parts per billion. The Food and Drug Administration has \n        established a limit of 10 parts per billion in bottled water, \n        and has also proposed a limit of 10 parts per billion in apple \n        juice. However, there are no Federal limits for arsenic in most \n        foods, including rice for adults and children or baby foods.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF LIMITATION ON INORGANIC ARSENIC IN RICE AND \n              RICE PRODUCTS.\n\n    (a) Regulation Required.--For the purpose of protecting the public \nhealth, not later than the day that is 2 years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nacting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and acting under the \nSecretary's authority under chapter IV of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 341 et seq.), shall promulgate a final \nregulation establishing the minimum quantity of inorganic arsenic \ncontained in rice or a rice product which shall cause the rice or rice \nproduct, respectively, to be deemed to be adulterated under section 402 \nof such Act (21 U.S.C. 343).\n    (b) Scope of Regulation.--The minimum quantity established under \nsubsection (a) shall apply to rice and rice products containing \ninorganic arsenic regardless of whether the arsenic is present as a \nresult of a natural process, an ingredient added to a food, the use of \na pesticide, or other means.\n    (c) Regulation Includes Tolerances.--The regulation under \nsubsection (a) shall include the establishment of a tolerance under \nsection 406 and section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(21 U.S.C. 346; 346a).\n    (d) Minimum Stringency.--The standard established under subsection \n(a) (and any subsequent revision thereto) for inorganic arsenic \ncontained in rice or a rice product shall--\n            (1) be based on the maximum achievable reduction in health \n        risks to individuals, taking into account the cancer effects, \n        neurodevelopmental effects, and other health effects of arsenic \n        exposure;\n            (2) be protective of the long-term health of children, \n        taking into account--\n                    (A) the differing eating patterns of children;\n                    (B) the rate of brain development in children;\n                    (C) any differences in the metabolization of \n                arsenic in children, as compared to adults; and\n                    (D) the fact that children have a longer expected \n                life span than adults; and\n            (3) include separate standards for rice milk and other \n        frequently consumed rice-based foods, especially rice-based \n        foods frequently consumed by infants and children.\n    (e) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Food.--The term ``food'' has the meaning given such \n        term in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \n        Act (21 U.S.C. 321(f)).\n            (2) Inorganic arsenic.--The term ``inorganic arsenic'' \n        means inorganic arsenic and its metabolites.\n            (3) Rice.--The term ``rice'' means a food that is rice.\n            (4) Rice product.--The term ``rice product'' means a food \n        that contains an ingredient made from rice.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORT ON INORGANIC ARSENIC IN RICE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States \nshall submit a report to the Congress on inorganic arsenic in rice \ngrown in the United States.\n    (b) Contents.--The report under subsection (a) shall include--\n            (1) an analysis of--\n                    (A) the agronomy and production management \n                practices that will reduce inorganic arsenic in rice;\n                    (B) the germplasm analysis and breeding that may \n                reduce inorganic arsenic in rice;\n                    (C) the analytical technology improvements needed \n                to address the issue of inorganic arsenic in rice; and\n                    (D) the current efforts of Federal agencies to \n                reduce inorganic arsenic in the food supply;\n            (2) recommendations for actions by the Federal Government \n        in order to reduce the presence of inorganic arsenic in rice \n        grown in the United States; and\n            (3) recommendations for additional research on inorganic \n        arsenic in rice, including the estimated cost for such \n        research."
