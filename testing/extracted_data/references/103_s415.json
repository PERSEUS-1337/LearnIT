    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Boot Camp Prison Act of 1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Federal prisons are greatly overcrowded. Although \n        the Federal prison system had a maximum capacity of only 50,707 \n        inmates as of December 17, 1992, on that date it housed 72,191 \n        inmates.\n            (2) The prisoner populations of both Federal and State \n        prisons have been increasing rapidly and are expected to \n        continue to increase in part because of the effect of the \n        Federal Sentencing Guidelines. In fiscal year 1993, the Federal \n        prison population will be approximately 79,000, growing to \n        about 92,000 in fiscal year 1995 and 109,000 in fiscal year \n        1998.\n            (3) The average cost of constructing a medium security \n        Federal prison is $53,173 per bed. The average cost of housing \n        a Federal inmate is $20,072 per year. This country needs to \n        find an effective and affordable alternative to our current \n        prison situation.\n            (4) Boot camp prisons are an excellent solution to this \n        problem. Instituted originally in 1984 in the State prison \n        systems of Oklahoma and Georgia, the concept of boot camp \n        prisons has now spread to 25 States. Although incarceration in \n        a boot camp costs more per year because of counseling and \n        educational services, an inmate stays for a shorter period of \n        time (between 90 and 120 days), thus reducing total costs and \n        overcrowding. The boot camp prison system in the New York \n        Department of Correctional Services saved that State's \n        taxpayers an estimated $150,000,000 as of December 31, 1991.\n\nSEC. 3. BOOT CAMPS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Attorney General shall establish within the Bureau of \nPrisons 10 military-style boot camp prisons (referred to in this \nsection as ``boot camps'').\n    (b) Locations.--The boot camps shall be located on closed military \ninstallations on sites to be chosen by the Director of the Bureau of \nPrisons.\n    (c) Regimen.--The boot camps shall provide--\n            (1) a highly regimented schedule of strict discipline, \n        physical training, work, drill, and ceremony characteristic of \n        military basic training;\n            (2) remedial education;\n            (3) counseling as appropriate; and\n            (4) treatment for substance abuse.\n    (d) Capacity.--Each boot camp shall be designed to accommodate \nbetween 200 and 300 inmates for periods of not less than 90 days and \nnot greater than 120 days.

The remaining inmates shall be State \nprisoners who are accepted for participation in the boot camp program \npursuant to subsection (f).\n    (e) Federal Prisoners.--Section 3582 of title 18, United States \nCode, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(e) Boot Camp Prison as a Sentencing Alternative.--(1) The court, \nin imposing sentence in the circumstances described in paragraph (2), \nmay designate the defendant as eligible for placement in a boot camp \nprison. The Bureau of Prisons shall determine whether a defendant so \ndesignated will be assigned to a boot camp prison.\n    ``(2) A defendant may be designated as eligible for placement in \nboot camp prison if--\n            ``(A) the defendant--\n                    ``(i) is under 25 years of age;\n                    ``(ii) is able-bodied;\n                    ``(iii) has been convicted of a serious but \n                nonviolent offense;\n                    ``(iv) has no serious prior conviction for which he \n                or she has served more than 10 days of incarceration; \n                and\n                    ``(v) consents to the designation; and\n            ``(B) the sentencing court finds that the defendant's total \n        offense level under the Federal sentencing guidelines is level \n        15 or less.\n    ``(3) If the Director of the Bureau of Prisons finds that an inmate \nplaced in a boot camp prison pursuant to this subsection has willfully \nrefused to comply with the conditions of confinement in the boot camp, \nthe Director may transfer the inmate to any other correctional facility \nin the Federal prison system.\n    ``(4) Successful completion of assignment to a boot camp shall \nconstitute satisfaction of any period of active incarceration, but \nshall not affect any aspect of a sentence relating to a fine, \nrestitution, or supervised release.''.\n    (f) State Prisoners.--(1) The head of a State corrections \ndepartment or the head's designee may apply for boot camp placement for \nany person who has been convicted of a criminal offense in that State, \nor who anticipates entering a plea of guilty of such offense, but who \nhas not yet been sentenced.

In responding to such applications, the Bureau of \nPrisons shall determine, on the basis of the availability of space, \nwhether a defendant who becomes eligible for assignment to a boot camp \nprison at the time of sentencing will be so assigned.\n    (2) A person convicted of a State criminal offense shall be \neligible for assignment to a boot camp if he or she--\n            (A) is under 25 years of age;\n            (B) has no prior conviction for which he or she has served \n        more than 10 days incarceration;\n            (C) has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment that will \n        be satisfied under the law of the sentencing State if the \n        defendant successfully completes a term of not less than 90 \n        days nor more than 120 days in a boot camp;\n            (D) has been designated by the sentencing court as eligible \n        for assignment to a boot camp; and\n            (E) has consented to the designation.\n    (3) If the Director of the Bureau of Prisons finds that an inmate \nplaced in a boot camp prison pursuant to this subsection has willfully \nrefused to comply with the conditions of confinement in the boot camp, \nthe Director may transfer the inmate back to the jurisdiction of the \nState sentencing court.\n    (4) A State that refers a prisoner to a boot camp shall reimburse \nthe Bureau of Prisons for the full cost of the incarceration of the \nprisoner, except that if the prisoner successfully completes the boot \ncamp program, the Bureau of Prisons shall return to the State 20 \npercent of the amount paid for that prisoner.
