FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal Government funds basic and applied research \n        with the expectation that new ideas and discoveries that result \n        from the research, if shared and effectively disseminated, will \n        advance science and improve the lives and welfare of people of \n        the United States and around the world;\n            (2) the Internet makes it possible for this information to \n        be promptly available to every scientist, physician, educator, \n        and citizen at home, in school, or in a library; and\n            (3) the United States has a substantial interest in \n        maximizing the impact and utility of the research it funds by \n        enabling a wide range of reuses of the peer-reviewed literature \n        that reports the results of such research, including by \n        enabling computational analysis by state-of-the-art \n        technologies.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF FEDERAL AGENCY.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``Federal agency'' means an Executive agency \nas defined under section 105 of title 5, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 4.
