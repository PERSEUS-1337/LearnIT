    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe heading of Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 10600) of Part 2 of Division 2 of Title 2 of the Government Code is amended to read:\nCHAPTER  5. Joint Pension Administration and Sustainability Committee\nSEC. 2.\nSection 10600 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n10600.\n(a) The Legislature finds that the retirement of officers and employees of the state, school districts, and many cities, counties, and public jurisdictions in the state, is provided under several independently administered and highly complex systems that all share the distinctive feature of being organized to achieve results over the 30- to 40-year time frame that corresponds to the typical length of workers\u2019 careers.\n(b) These pension systems are organized and administered under highly technical statutes and protected by constitutional provisions. Certain provisions in the California Constitution, which are patterned upon the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, commonly known as ERISA, require that pension funds be invested for the sole interests of the beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits and establish a standard of conduct that makes persons managing the pension systems fiduciaries with respect to how they manage the money.\n(c) Development and change in these systems are interrelated and have important long-range implications both with respect to cost and to the retirement expectations of public employees and also the state and national economy, as the ability of persons to enter into retirement with a source of income to spend on goods and services in retirement provides an important source of demand for goods and services during economic downturns to assist eventual recovery as well as assisting the ability of public entities to transition their workforces to younger entry level employees as older workers are able to retire even during an economic downturn, thereby creating openings.\n(d) The Legislature recognizes the need to coordinate this change and development and for continuing study and analysis of these systems and legislation affecting them.\n(e) Therefore, it is the desire of the Legislature to provide for such continuing study and analysis by a joint legislative committee.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 10601 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n10601.\n(a) The Joint Pension Administration and Sustainability Committee is hereby created.
