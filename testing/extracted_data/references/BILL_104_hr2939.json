FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) several rivers flow between, or are common to, two or \n        more State boundaries;\n            (2) in many cases, there is not a single entity which has \n        complete jurisdictional responsibility for the fishery \n        resources in these rivers;\n            (3) a strong partnership between Federal and State \n        governmental authorities and citizen groups is vital in \n        coordinating and facilitating cooperative research and in \n        resolving problems associated with large river ecosystems;\n            (4) many fishery management problems are caused by \n        federally regulated activities (including activities resulting \n        in point and nonpoint pollution) and federally constructed \n        projects (including dams and navigation facilities);\n            (5) in some rivers, the once rich assemblages of fish fauna \n        and diverse habitats have been lost and formerly abundant \n        native fish now exist only as endangered or depleted \n        populations;\n            (6) without positive management actions, native species in \n        some rivers will continue to decline, fostering even greater \n        conflicts among water users;\n            (7) construction of waterway developments (including \n        navigation, flood control, water level fluctuation, power \n        generation, irrigation, and general water depletion projects) \n        is accelerating and increasingly degrading large river \n        ecosystems nationwide;\n            (8) the United States public will face reduced \n        opportunities for recreational, commercial, subsistence, and \n        aesthetic uses of river systems without demonstrable change in \n        management strategies in the near future;\n            (9) several programs have been proposed or are underway to \n        resolve conflicts in these management strategies;\n            (10) in one of these programs, Federal, State, and local \n        fishery resource managers in the Mississippi River drainage \n        basin have entered into the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative \n        Resource Agreement under which the managers share information, \n        resources, facilities, and funding for preparation, \n        development, and implementation of long-range strategic plans \n        for management of the drainage basin's interjurisdictional \n        fishery resources;\n            (11) the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource \n        Agreement merits detailed evaluation as a model for the \n        development of long-range strategic plans for the management of \n        interjurisdictional rivers fishery resources; and\n            (12) to ensure that these programs are appropriately \n        coordinated and to conserve the fishery resources in \n        interjurisdictional rivers, there is a need for strategies to \n        improve coordination, cooperation, research, and information \n        sharing.\n\nSEC. 3. MISSISSIPPI INTERSTATE COOPERATIVE RESOURCE AGREEMENT.\n\n    (a) Evaluation.--The Secretary, in cooperation with the Mississippi \nInterstate Cooperative Resource Association, shall conduct a pilot test \nof the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement.\n    (b) Contents.--A pilot test conducted under this section may \ninclude, among other matters, the following:\n            (1) Identification and description of each of the river \n        ecosystems of the Mississippi River drainage system and the \n        associated fishery resources and fish habitats of such river \n        ecosystems.\n            (2) Identification and description of--\n                    (A) the known impacts, on fishery resources of the \n                Mississippi River drainage basin, of agriculture, \n                navigation, flood control, power generation, \n                irrigation, and municipal water supply projects, \n                including the impacts of nonpoint source pollution, \n                dredging, channel maintenance, water level management, \n                sediment and contaminant transport, vessel traffic, \n                water withdrawal, and changes in salinity and various \n                hydrologic conditions; and\n                    (B) techniques for mitigating those impacts.\n            (3) Analysis of existing resource data with regard to \n        regional depletion of important fish stocks (including \n        paddlefish, lake sturgeon, walleye, and other high priority \n        nonanadromous species) and the potential for restoration of \n        such fish stocks.\n            (4) Identification of major information gaps and \n        technological needs to improve the cooperative management of \n        interjurisdictional fishery resources.\n            (5) A comprehensive study of the status, and the \n        management, research, and restoration needs, of the \n        interjurisdictional fishery resources of the Mississippi River \n        drainage system.\n            (6) Development of recommendations regarding the scope, \n        schedule, regional priorities, and roles of participants in the \n        Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement for \n        undertaking cooperative management and research projects.\n            (7) Development of plans and testing projects for the \n        restoration and enhancement of depleted fish stocks (including \n        lake sturgeon, paddlefish, walleye, and other high priority \n        nonanadromous species) and associated habitats of such fish \n        stocks.\n            (8) Evaluation of the feasibility and expected success of \n        the program under the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative \n        Resource Agreement and the merits of extending such program of \n        cooperative management strategy to other interjurisdictional \n        river basins in the United States.\n            (9) Estimates of funds required to implement \n        recommendations and plans developed under paragraphs (6), (7), \n        and (8).\n    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 36 months after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall transmit to the Congress \na report containing the evaluation of the pilot test to be conducted \nunder this section.\n\nSEC. 4.
