FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The global financial crisis cost Americans $19 trillion \n        in lost wealth.\n            (2) The global financial crisis was caused by financial \n        firms taking great financial risks without disclosing those \n        risks to their investors or their regulators, and by regulatory \n        failures to adequately police the financial services markets \n        for crime, unfair or deceptive practices, fraud, lack of \n        transparency, and mismanagement.\n            (3) Deceptive, illegal, and speculative financial practices \n        have harmed public confidence in the integrity and fairness of \n        many United States financial institutions, and threaten the \n        basic strengths of the United States economic system.\n            (4) American citizens provided the money to stabilize the \n        financial sector, making $600 billion available to 800 \n        financial institutions, automakers, and insurance companies.\n            (5) The global financial crisis, along with the wars, \n        unsustainable tax cuts, and a continuing unemployment crisis \n        and looming loss of unemployment benefits, if unaddressed, will \n        deprive a generation of a meaningful role in the larger \n        economy.\n            (6) Nurses, teachers, public safety officers, and other \n        public sector workers have faced drastic funding cuts, harming \n        our long-term public safety and prospects for economic growth.\n            (7) According to economists, a small tax on transfer of \n        ownership of every financial trade could generate hundreds of \n        billions annually in revenue, which when invested could help \n        create sufficient jobs in both the public and private sectors \n        to replace the 8 million jobs lost in the recent recession and \n        add even more jobs on an ongoing basis.\n            (8) A transfer tax will help limit reckless short-term \n        speculation that threatens financial stability.\n            (9) A securities transfer tax would have a negligible \n        impact on the average investor.\n            (10) The United States had a transfer tax from 1914 to \n        1966: The Revenue Act of 1914 (Act of Oct. 22, 1914 (ch. 331, \n        38 Stat. 745)) levied a 0.2 percent tax on all sales or \n        transfers of stock which was doubled in 1932 to help overcome \n        the budgetary challenges during the Great Depression.\n            (11) Forty nations have a financial transactions tax and \n        more than 1,000 economists have endorsed it.\n            (12) Revenue generated by this tax will be available to--\n                    (A) strengthen financial security and expand \n                opportunity for low- and moderate-income families, \n                including strengthening the social safety net and \n                expanding resources for child care, Social Security, \n                and savings incentives;\n                    (B) expand resources for State and Federal \n                investments that protect our health, rebuild our \n                crumbling physical infrastructure, and create good \n                paying jobs by--\n                            (i) expanding and improving Medicare and \n                        Medicaid;\n                            (ii) investing in education, student debt \n                        relief, job training, public sector jobs, and \n                        green jobs;\n                            (iii) providing housing assistance to low-\n                        income households;\n                            (iv) investing in transportation including \n                        transit and an infrastructure bank that \n                        promotes environmentally responsible domestic \n                        manufacturing and construction industries; and\n                            (v) protecting our environment and building \n                        a clean energy economy, including efforts to \n                        combat climate change; and\n                    (C) fund international sustainable prosperity \n                programs such as health care investments, AIDS \n                treatment, research and prevention programs, and \n                international assistance.\n\nSEC. 3.
