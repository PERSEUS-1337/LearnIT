FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) effective elementary schools and secondary schools \n        require competent teachers and strong leadership;\n            (2) local educational agencies would benefit greatly by \n        increasing the pool of qualified individuals from which to \n        recruit teachers;\n            (3) many talented professionals who have demonstrated a \n        high level of subject matter knowledge outside the education \n        profession may wish to pursue careers in education, but have \n        not fulfilled the requirements to be certified or licensed as \n        teachers; and\n            (4) loan forgiveness programs and other programs that \n        encourage such professionals and other interested persons to \n        become certified or licensed teachers would allow local \n        educational agencies to utilize the expertise of such \n        professionals and interested persons, and improve the pool of \n        qualified individuals available to local educational agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to improve the supply of well-qualified \nelementary school and secondary school teachers by encouraging and \nassisting interested persons in completing the teacher certification or \nlicensing requirements in their States.\n\nSEC. 4.
