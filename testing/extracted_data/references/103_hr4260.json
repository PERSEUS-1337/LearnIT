FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly 4 of 5 peer reviewed research projects deemed \n        worthy of funding by the National Institutes of Health are not \n        funded.\n            (2) Less than 2 percent of the nearly one trillion dollars \n        our Nation spends on health care is devoted to health research, \n        while the defense industry spends 15 percent of its budget on \n        research.\n            (3) Public opinion surveys have shown that Americans want \n        more Federal resources put into health research and support by \n        having a portion of their health insurance premiums set aside \n        for this purpose.\n            (4) Ample evidence exists to demonstrate that health \n        research has improved the quality of health care in the United \n        States. Advances such as the development of vaccines, the cure \n        of many childhood cancers, drugs that effectively treat a host \n        of diseases and disorders, a process to protect our Nation's \n        blood supply from the HIV virus, progress against \n        cardiovascular disease including heart attack and stroke, and \n        new strategies for the early detection and treatment of \n        diseases such as colon, breast, and prostate cancer clearly \n        demonstrates the benefits of health research.\n            (5) Among the most effective methods to control health care \n        costs are prevention and cure of disease and disability, thus, \n        health research which holds the promise of cure and prevention \n        of disease and disability is a critical component of any \n        comprehensive health care reform plan.\n            (6) The state of our Nation's research facilities at the \n        National Institutes of Health and at universities is \n        deteriorating significantly. Renovation and repair of these \n        facilities are badly needed to maintain and improve the quality \n        of research.\n            (7) Because the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \n        freezes discretionary spending for the next 5 years, the \n        Nation's investment in health research through the National \n        Institutes of Health is likely to decline in real terms unless \n        corrective legislative action is taken.\n            (8) A health research fund is needed to maintain our \n        Nation's commitment to health research and to increase the \n        percentage of approved projects which receive funding at the \n        National Institutes of Health to at least 33 percent.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL FUND FOR HEALTH RESEARCH.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of the \nUnited States an account, to be known as the ``National Fund for Health \nResearch'' (hereafter referred to in this section as the ``Fund''), \nconsisting of such amounts as are transferred to the Fund under \nsubsection (b) and any interest earned on investment of amounts in the \nFund.\n    (b) Transfers to Fund.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n        transfer to the Fund an amount equal to the amounts designated \n        under paragraph (2) and received in the Treasury.\n            (2) Amounts.--\n                    (A) In general.--With respect to each calendar year \n                beginning with the first full calendar year during \n                which a comprehensive health care reform program \n                utilizing a regional and corporate health alliance \n                structure has been implemented, each such alliance \n                shall set aside and transfer to the Treasury of the \n                United States the applicable amount under subparagraph \n                (B) and under section 6097 of the Internal Revenue Code \n                of 1986.\n                    (B) Applicable amount.--The applicable amount under \n                this subparagraph with respect to a regional or \n                corporate alliance shall be equal to--\n                            (i) with respect to the first full calendar \n                        year described in subparagraph (A), .25 percent \n                        of all health premiums received by the alliance \n                        for such year;\n                            (ii) with respect to the second calendar \n                        year described in subparagraph (A), .50 percent \n                        of all health premiums received by the alliance \n                        for such year;\n                            (iii) with respect to the third calendar \n                        year described in subparagraph (A), .75 percent \n                        of all health premiums received by the alliance \n                        for such year; and\n                            (iv) with respect to the fourth and \n                        succeeding calendar years described in \n                        subparagraph (A), 1 percent of all health \n                        premiums received by the alliance for such \n                        year.\n            (3) Designation of overpayments and contributions.--\n                    (A)  In general.--Subchapter A of chapter 61 of the \n                Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to returns and \n                records) is amended by adding at the end the following \n                new part:\n\n   ``PART IX--DESIGNATION OF OVERPAYMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE \n                   NATIONAL FUND FOR HEALTH RESEARCH\n\n``Sec. 6097.
