FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular \n        diseases remain the leading cause of death among females in the \n        United States, killing more than 500,000 women each year.\n            (2) About 1 in 5 females have some form of cardiovascular \n        disease, killing more American women than the next 14 causes of \n        death combined.\n            (3) In women, cardiovascular disease is frequently \n        undetected and untreated until the disease has become severe, \n        causing 38 percent of women who have heart attacks to die \n        within 1 year.\n            (4) Obesity increases women's risk for some of the leading \n        causes of death: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain \n        cancers.\n            (5) Better nutrition and lifestyle changes can effectively \n        prevent and treat obesity.\n            (6) Osteoporosis afflicts more than 20,000,000 American \n        women.\n            (7) More than \\1/2\\ of all women over 65 have osteoporosis.\n            (8) One out of every 2 women over 50 will have an \n        osteoporosis-related fracture during her lifetime.\n            (9) The national annual costs associated with osteoporosis \n        are estimated at $14,000,000,000.\n            (10) Physical activity is necessary for bone acquisition \n        and maintenance throughout adulthood.\n            (11) Muscular strength and balance may be very significant \n        in future risk reduction for osteoporosis.\n            (12) There is consensus that adequate vitamin D and calcium \n        intakes are required for bone health.\n            (13) Research has demonstrated that--\n                    (A) the uninsured often have significantly poorer \n                health than the insured; and\n                    (B) being uninsured is an obstacle to receiving \n                preventive health care services.\n            (14) The WISEWOMAN program has--\n                    (A) provided one-stop shopping for preventive \n                health services such as cholesterol and blood pressure \n                screening for close to 8,000 women and identified risk \n                factors for heart disease such as obesity, high \n                cholesterol, high blood pressure, sedentary behavior \n                and poor diet; and\n                    (B) found that many of the women screened have \n                returned for additional interventions and follow-up, \n                resulting in improved weight management, lower blood \n                pressure and lower cholesterol.\n            (15) Expansion of the WISEWOMAN model program to additional \n        States would help reduce women's risk of illness and death from \n        heart disease and other preventable diseases and provide \n        further insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of \n        making comprehensive, integrated preventive services available \n        to low-income and uninsured women.\n\nSEC. 3. SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS FOR ADDITIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES \n              FOR WOMEN.\n\n    Section 1509 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300n-4a) \nis amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 1509.
