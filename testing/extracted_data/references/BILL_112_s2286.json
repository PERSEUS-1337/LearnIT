FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook Study Act \n        of 2005 (Public Law 109-370) authorized the study of the \n        Farmington River downstream from the segment designated as a \n        recreational river by section 3(a)(156) of the Wild and Scenic \n        Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1277(a)(156)) to its confluence with the \n        Connecticut River, and the segment of the Salmon Brook \n        including its main stem and east and west branches for \n        potential inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \n        System;\n            (2) the studied segments of the Lower Farmington River and \n        Salmon Brook support natural, cultural, and recreational \n        resources of exceptional significance to the citizens of \n        Connecticut and the Nation;\n            (3) concurrently with the preparation of the study, the \n        Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook Wild and Scenic Study \n        Committee prepared the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook \n        Management Plan, June 2011, that establishes objectives, \n        standards, and action programs that will ensure the long-term \n        protection of the outstanding values of the river segments \n        without Federal management of affected lands not owned by the \n        United States;\n            (4) the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook Wild and \n        Scenic Study Committee has voted in favor of Wild and Scenic \n        River designation for the river segments, and has included this \n        recommendation as an integral part of the management plan;\n            (5) there is strong local support for the protection of the \n        Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook, including votes of \n        support for Wild and Scenic designation from the governing \n        bodies of all ten communities abutting the study area;\n            (6) the State of Connecticut General Assembly has endorsed \n        the designation of the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook \n        as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System \n        (Public Act 08-37); and\n            (7) the Rainbow Dam and Reservoir are located entirely \n        outside of the river segment designated by section 3 of this \n        Act, and, based on the findings of the study of the Lower \n        Farmington River pursuant to Public Law 109-370, operation of \n        this hydroelectric project (including associated transmission \n        lines and other project works) is compatible with the \n        designation made by section 3 of this Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
