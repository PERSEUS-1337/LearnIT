FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) When a community suffers a significant loss of jobs \n        over a relatively short period of time whether from industrial \n        or corporate restructuring, new requirements in Federal laws or \n        regulations, reduction in defense expenditures, depletion of \n        natural resources, natural disasters, changing trade patterns \n        or other reasons, it can experience sudden economic distress.\n            (2) Federal departments and agencies with existing programs \n        that support workers and communities in States and local areas \n        in their efforts to recover from this economic distress do so \n        in a capacity defined by the mission of the department or \n        agency.\n            (3) Federal departments and agencies providing such \n        assistance include the Department of Agriculture, Department of \n        Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Education, \n        Department of Labor, Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development, the Department of the Treasury, and the Small \n        Business Administration.\n            (4) To date, no Federal department or agency has unique \n        authority to coordinate these often independent efforts across \n        the Federal Government in the same manner as the Federal \n        Emergency Management Agency is charged to coordinate the \n        Federal response to a disaster or the Department of Defense's \n        Office of Economic Adjustment is charged to coordinate the \n        Federal response for communities experiencing base closures and \n        realignments.\n            (5) There is a recognized need for the Federal Government \n        to be able to coordinate its response to communities \n        experiencing sudden economic distress both at the national \n        level and in the community itself, and to further be able to \n        coordinate the Federal response with State and local efforts.\n            (6) The Office of Economic Adjustment of the Department of \n        Defense has successfully provided such coordination across the \n        Federal Government for communities experiencing defense base \n        closures and is a good model on which to base any government-\n        wide coordination effort with respect to communities \n        experiencing sudden economic distress.\n            (7) The mission of the Economic Development Administration \n        of the Department of Commerce includes helping States and local \n        areas to design and implement strategies for facilitating \nadjustment to changes in their economic situation that are causing or \nthreaten to cause serious structural damage to the underlying economic \nbase which may occur suddenly, and as a result, is the most appropriate \nplace in the Federal Government to locate an office to coordinate \nFederal response to communities experiencing sudden economic distress.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to help communities to adjust to such economic \n        dislocation by providing for targeted and integrated Federal \n        responses by authorizing the Secretary of Commerce to \n        coordinate the Federal response through an Office of Community \n        Economic Adjustment which will employ methods and techniques \n        proven successful by the Defense Department's Office of \n        Economic Adjustment in connection with defense base closures; \n        and\n            (2) to increase authorization of appropriations for \n        community adjustment programs of the Economic Development \n        Administration to provide the Secretary of Commerce with more \n        resources for grant assistance for communities to support the \n        development and implementation of adjustment strategies that \n        are designed to restore vital economic activity and create new \n        jobs.\n\nSEC. 3 OFFICE OF COMMUNITY ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT.\n\n    Title V of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 \n(42 U.S.C. 3191) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 508.
