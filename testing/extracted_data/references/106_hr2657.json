CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) urban and inner city school districts have greater \n        difficulty attracting and retaining qualified teachers than \n        their suburban counterparts; and\n            (2) the cost of property is higher in urban areas and inner \n        cities that in suburban areas.\n\nSEC. 3.

In the \n        case of eligible properties under paragraph (9)(B)(i), the \n        provisions of subsection (h) shall apply to such properties, \n        except to the extent specifically provided otherwise in this \n        subsection.\n            ``(2) Primary residence.--An eligible property may be sold \n        pursuant to a discount under paragraph (3) only if the property \n        is used, for not less than the 3-year period beginning upon \n        such sale, as the primary residence of a teacher.
