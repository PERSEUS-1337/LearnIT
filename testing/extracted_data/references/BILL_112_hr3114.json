PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to develop, implement, and expand \neducational and work experience opportunities for court-involved, \npreviously incarcerated, and otherwise disadvantaged youth and young \nadults through service and conservation corps and other community-based \nservice organizations.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) On any given day, more than 500,000 juvenile court \n        cases in the United States end in incarceration or probation.\n            (2) The per diem cost of locking up one young person in a \n        juvenile facility ranges from $24 in Wyoming to $726 in \n        Connecticut, but the American Correctional Association \n        estimates that, on average, it costs States $240.99 per day, or \n        around $88,000 a year, for every young person in a juvenile \n        facility.\n            (3) States spend nearly $6,000,000,000 a year incarcerating \n        youth.\n            (4) Youth who are imprisoned are up to 50 percent more \n        likely to recidivate than their counterparts who remain in \n        their communities.\n            (5) Nearly 70 percent of youth in residential facilities \n        have been adjudicated for nonviolent offenses and could be \n        safely managed within their communities.\n            (6) The most effective programs at reducing recidivism \n        rates and promoting positive life outcomes for youth are \n        administered within communities, outside of the criminal \n        juvenile justice system.\n            (7) In the United States there are more than 150 service \n        and conservation corps, the direct descendants of the Civilian \n        Conservation Corps of the 1930s, that operate in all 50 States, \n        provide educational and economic opportunities to more than \n        30,000 young people each year, and make important contributions \n        in the communities in which they are located.\n            (8) The Civic Justice Corps Model, developed by The Corps \n        Network in conjunction with the Gates and Open Society \n        Foundations, utilizes community service projects to deliver \n        life skills, education, workforce readiness, and supportive and \n        transitional services to formerly incarcerated and court-\n        involved youth and young adults between the ages of 16 and 25.\n            (9) Data from 14 original Civic Justice Corps sites \n        demonstrate 80 percent post-program participant placement rates \n        and 11 percent recidivism rates among program participants (as \n        opposed to the prevailing recidivism rate of 50 to 70 percent).\n\nSEC. 4.
