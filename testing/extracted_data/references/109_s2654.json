SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    ``(a) Short Title.--This part may be cited as the `Youth Financial \nEducation Act'.\n    ``(b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) In order to succeed in our dynamic American economy, \n        young people must obtain the skills, knowledge, and experience \n        necessary to manage their personal finances and obtain general \n        financial literacy. All young adults should have the \n        educational tools necessary to make informed financial \n        decisions.\n            ``(2) Despite the critical importance of financial literacy \n        to young people, the average high school graduate lacks basic \n        skills in the management of personal financial affairs. A \n        nationwide survey conducted in 2004 by the Jump$tart Coalition \n        for Personal Financial Literacy examined the financial \n        knowledge of 4,074 12th graders. On average, survey respondents \n        answered only 52 percent of the questions correctly, up only \n        slightly from the 50 percent average score in 2002.\n            ``(3) An evaluation by the National Endowment for Financial \n        Education High School Financial Planning Program undertaken \n        jointly with the Cooperative State Research, Education, and \n        Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture demonstrates \n        that as little as 10 hours of classroom instruction can impart \n        substantial knowledge and affect significant change in how \n        teens handle their money.\n            ``(4) State educational leaders have recognized the \n        importance of providing a basic financial education to students \n        in kindergarten through grade 12 by integrating financial \n        education into State educational standards, but by 2004, only 7 \n        States required students to complete a course that covered \n        personal finance before graduating from high school.\n            ``(5) Teacher training and professional development are \n        critical to achieving youth financial literacy. Teachers should \n        be given the tools they need to educate our Nation's youth on \n        personal finance and economics.\n            ``(6) Personal financial education helps prepare students \n        for the workforce and for financial independence by developing \n        their sense of individual responsibility, improving their life \n        skills, and providing them with a thorough understanding of \n        consumer economics that will benefit them for their entire \n        lives.\n            ``(7) Financial education integrates instruction in \n        valuable life skills with instruction in economics, including \n        income and taxes, money management, investment and spending, \n        and the importance of personal savings.\n            ``(8) The consumers and investors of tomorrow are in our \n        schools today.
