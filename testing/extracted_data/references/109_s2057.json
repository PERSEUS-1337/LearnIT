FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the National Center for Education \n        Statistics, an estimated $127,000,000,000 in repairs, \n        renovations, and modernizations is needed to put schools in the \n        United States into good overall condition.\n            (2) Approximately 14,000,000 United States students attend \n        schools that report the need for extensive repair or \n        replacement of 1 or more buildings.\n            (3) According to a 2005 study conducted by American School \n        & University magazine, $29,088,000,000 was spent to address the \n        Nation's education infrastructure needs in 2004, with the \n        average total cost of a new high school being $27,000,000.\n            (4) Academic research has proven that there is a direct \n        correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n        student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n        found that students assigned to schools in poor condition could \n        be expected to have test scores that are 10.9 percentage points \n        lower than students in schools in excellent condition. Similar \n        studies demonstrated improvement of up to 20 percent in test \n        scores when students were moved from a facility in poor \n        condition to a new facility.\n            (5) The Director of the Education and Employment Issues \n        division of the Government Accounting Office (currently known \n        as the Education, Workforce, and Income Security division of \n        the Government Accountability Office) testified that nearly 52 \n        percent of schools, affecting 21,300,000 students, reported \n        insufficient technology elements for 6 or more areas.\n            (6) Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n        difficulties securing financing for school facility \n        improvement.\n            (7) The challenges facing the Nation's public elementary \n        schools and secondary schools and libraries require the \n        concerted efforts of all levels of government and all sectors \n        of communities.\n            (8) The United States competitive position within the world \n        economy is vulnerable if the future workforce of the United \n        States continues to be educated in schools and libraries not \n        equipped for the 21st century.\n            (9) The deplorable state of collections in public school \n        libraries in the United States has increased the demands on \n        public libraries. In many instances, public libraries \n        substitute for school libraries, creating a higher demand for \n        material and physical space to house literature and educational \n        computer equipment.\n            (10) Research shows that 50 percent of a child's \n        intellectual development takes place before age 4. The Nation's \n        public and school libraries play a critical role in a child's \n        early development because the libraries provide a wealth of \n        books and other resources that can give every child a head \n        start on life and learning.\n\nSEC. 3. STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) Cooperative agreements.--The Secretary of Education \n        (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary''), after \n        consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, may enter into \n        cooperative agreements with States under which--\n                    (A) the States establish State infrastructure banks \n                and multistate infrastructure banks for the purpose of \n                providing the loans described in subparagraph (B);
