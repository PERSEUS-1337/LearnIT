FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The economy of the United States cannot achieve strong, \n        sustained growth without adequate levels of savings to fuel \n        productive activity. Inadequate savings have been shown to lead \n        to lower productivity, stagnating wages, and reduced standards \n        of living.\n            (2) Savings levels in the United States have steadily \n        declined over the past 25 years, and have lagged behind the \n        industrialized trading partners of the United States.\n            (3) These anemic savings levels have contributed to the \n        country's long-term downward trend in real economic growth, \n        which averaged close to 3.5 percent over the last 100 years but \n        has slowed to 2.4 percent over the past quarter century.\n            (4) Repealing the estate and gift tax would contribute to \n        the goals of expanding savings and investment, boosting \n        entrepreneurial activity, and expanding economic growth.\n            (5) Abolishing the estate tax would restore a measure of \n        fairness to the Federal tax system. Families should be able to \n        pass on the fruits of labor to the next generation without \n        realizing a taxable event.\n\nSEC. 3.
