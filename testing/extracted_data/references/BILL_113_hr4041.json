Virginia \n        that segregated bus and rail stations were unconstitutional.\n            (2) The rigid system of racial segregation that prevailed \n        in the United States during the 1960s did not permit a Black \n        person to sit next to a White person on any bus traveling \n        through interstate commerce and in most locations in the South. \n        Bus stations had ``Whites Only'' waiting areas and Blacks were \n        not permitted to wait in those areas despite the Supreme Court \n        making it the law of the land.\n            (3) The Freedom Riders, with the intent to end segregation \n        in public transportation throughout the South, paved the way \n        for full racial integration of the United States transit \n        system. They overcame prejudice, discrimination, and violence. \n        They sparked a movement that changed our Nation.\n            (4) The Congress of Racial Equality (C.O.R.E.) selected \n        thirteen volunteers for nonviolent response training to join in \n        the Freedom Rides from Washington, DC, to New Orleans, LA. The \n        Freedom Riders used their strategies of nonviolence throughout \n        the South to challenge the region's Jim Crow laws directly and \n        enforce the Supreme Court decision in Boynton.\n            (5) On the morning of May 4, 1961, the Freedom Riders, \n        comprised of seven Blacks and six Whites, boarded two buses, \n        with Blacks and Whites seated together. Those thirteen Freedom \n        Riders were: Genevieve Hughes Houghton, Charles Person, Hank \n        Thomas, John Lewis, Edward Blankenheim, James Farmer, Walter \n        Bergman, Frances Bergman, Joseph Perkins, Jimmy McDonald, Mae \n        Francis Moultrie, Benjamin Elton Cox, and Albert Bigelow. Most \n        segregated States considered even this level of integration a \n        crime. At various stops along the way, the Freedom Riders would \n        enter areas designated ``Whites'' and ``Colored'' and would eat \n        together at segregated lunch counters to defy local laws.\n            (6) Initially, the Freedom Riders had encountered only \n        minor clashes until a stop in South Carolina. In Rock Hill, an \n        angry mob severely beat John Lewis, now a Congressman from the \n        5th District of Georgia, when he entered the bus station. Henry \n        ``Hank'' Thomas was jailed when he entered the bus station in \n        Winnsboro. Authorities delivered him to a waiting mob long \n        after the station had closed that evening. A local Black \n        minister rescued Thomas, enabling him to rejoin the group in \n        Columbia. However, Lewis was so badly beaten he could not \n        continue the Freedom Rides.\n            (7) Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other civil rights \n        leaders met with the group in Atlanta to dissuade their \n        continuance through the Deep South due to death threats. \n        Despite these warnings, more Freedom Riders joined in Atlanta. \n        Dedicated to their mission to end segregation in the South and \n        trained in nonviolent movements, the Freedom Riders continued \n        on their journey.\n            (8) On Mother's Day, May 14, 1961, the Freedom Riders were \n        on two different buses. An angry mob in Anniston, Alabama, \n        firebombed the first bus. When the Freedom Riders rushed out, \n        still choking from the thick smoke of the burning bus, the \n        waiting angry mob beat them with lead pipes and baseball bats \n        as the bus exploded. Ambulances refused to transport the Black \n        Freedom Riders to the hospital. The mob beat the Freedom Riders \n        on the second bus and forced them to sit in the back. As they \n        journeyed to Birmingham, another mob savagely beat the Freedom \n        Riders.\n            (9) The Nashville (TN) Student Group, a local group of \n        students who had been successful in desegregating the lunch \n        counters and movie theaters in Nashville (TN), vowed not to let \n        these acts of violence curtail the goal of the Freedom Rides. \n        They sent their members to continue the Freedom Rides and \n        called out to other student groups to do the same.\n            (10) As the violence grew, the Attorney General of the \n        United States called in the National Guard and the U.S. \n        Marshals to protect the Freedom Riders as they journeyed \n        through Alabama. This protection was short-lived. The Federal \n        authorities turned the Freedom Riders over to the local \n        authorities in Mississippi who then arrested the Freedom Riders \n        for disturbing the peace.\n            (11) The government of Mississippi imprisoned many of the \n        Freedom Riders in Parchman Prison known for its horrific \n        conditions, such as subjecting the Freedom Riders to strip \n        searches, work on chain gangs, and light shining in their cells \n        24 hours a day. Despite these conditions, the Freedom Riders \n        refused bail because they were determined to spread the message \n        of their nonviolent movement.\n            (12) Five months after the first Freedom Rides left on \n        their historic ride, the Interstate Commerce Commission in \n        conjunction with the U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy \n        issued a Federal order banning segregation at all interstate \n        public facilities based upon ``race, color or creed''. The law \n        became effective on November 1, 1961.\n            (13) In 2011, the President of the United States paid \n        tribute to the Freedom Riders with a Presidential Proclamation \n        honoring the 50th Anniversary of the first Freedom Ride by \n        brave Americans whose selfless act of courage helped pave the \n        way for others to continue on the road to Civil Rights in \n        America.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) Presentation Authorization.--The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make \nappropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of the \nCongress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to the Freedom Riders, \ncollectively, in recognition of their unique contribution to Civil \nRights, which inspired a revolutionary movement to equality in \ninterstate travel.\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award referred to \nin subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with \nsuitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the \nSecretary.\n    (c) Smithsonian Institution.--\n            (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal \n        under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the \n        Smithsonian Institution, where it will be available for display \n        as appropriate and available for research.\n            (2) Sense of the congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n        that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal \n        awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere, \n        particularly at appropriate locations associated with the \n        Freedom Riders.\n\nSEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n    The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold \nmedal struck pursuant to section 2 under such regulations as the \nSecretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient to cover the cost \nthereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \noverhead expenses, and the cost of the gold medal.\n\nSEC. 4.
