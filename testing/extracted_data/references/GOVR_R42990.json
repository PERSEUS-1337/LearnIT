    "content": "The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA; P.L. 105-220 ) is the primary federal program that supports workforce development. WIA includes four main titles: Title I\u2014Workforce Investment Systems\u2014provides job training and related services to unemployed or underemployed individuals. Title I programs, which are primarily administered through the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), include three state formula grant programs, multiple national programs, Job Corps, and demonstration programs. In addition, Title I authorizes the establishment of a One-Stop delivery system through which state and local WIA training and employment activities are provided and through which certain partner programs must be coordinated; Title II\u2014Adult Education and Literacy\u2014provides education services to assist adults in improving their literacy and completing secondary education; Title III\u2014Workforce Investment-Related Activities\u2014amends the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 to integrate the U.S. Employment Service (ES), which provides job search and job matching assistance to unemployed individuals, into the One-Stop system established by WIA; and Title IV\u2014Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998\u2014amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which provides employment-related services to individuals with disabilities. The authorizations for appropriations for most programs under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 ( P.L. 105-220 ) expired at the end of FY2003. Since that time, WIA programs have been funded through the annual appropriations process. In the 108 th and 109 th Congresses, bills to reauthorize WIA were passed in both the House and the Senate; however, no further action was taken. In the 112 th Congress, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) released discussion drafts in June 2011 of legislation to amend and reauthorize WIA. While markup of this legislation was scheduled, it was ultimately postponed indefinitely. No legislation has been introduced. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce, however, ordered reported H.R. 4297 \u2014the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012. This bill was introduced on March 29, 2012, by Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the chair of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training (for herself, Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon of California, and Representative Joseph Heck of Nevada). A legislative hearing on H.R. 4297 was held before the full Committee on Education and the Workforce on April 17, 2012. On June 7, 2012, the committee, after considering 23 amendments to H.R. 4297 , ordered the bill reported by a vote of 23 to 15. No further action was taken on H.R. 4297 in the 112 th Congress. In the 113 th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce has ordered reported H.R. 803 \u2014the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills Act (SKILLS Act). This bill was introduced on February 25, 2013, by Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the chair of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training. A legislative hearing on H.R. 803 was held before the full Committee on Education and the Workforce on February 26, 2013. On March 6, 2013, the committee, after considering four amendments to H.R. 803 , ordered the bill reported by a vote of 23 to 0. No Democrats on the committee cast a vote on the measure, maintaining that they were not provided adequate input in the process. H.R. 803 was debated in the House of Representatives on March 15, 2013, and passed by a vote of 215-202. This report summarizes each of the WIA titles and highlights the major features of H.R. 803 pertaining to each title. The report also compares the proposed provisions of H.R. 803 to current law in the following tables: Table 1. Major Provisions of Title I. This table covers provisions governing the \"workforce investment systems\" that provide for, among other things, state formula grants, state and local planning procedures, and the establishment of the One-Stop delivery system. WIA established the One-Stop delivery system as a way to co-locate and coordinate the activities of multiple employment programs for adults, youth, and various targeted subpopulations. The delivery of these services occurs primarily through more than 3,000 career centers nationwide. Table 2. Major Provisions of Title II. This table covers provisions for adult education and literacy activities. Table 3. Major Provisions of Title III. This table covers changes to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, which was also amended in Title III of WIA. Wagner-Peyser provides authorization for the Employment Service, which provides job matching and job search assistance for unemployed individuals. Table 4. Major Provisions of Title IV of WIA and Title V of H.R. 803 . This table addresses amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, in particular to the Vocational Rehabilitation and other employment-related provisions of that act, which authorizes various employment services for individuals with disabilities. Title I of the Workforce Investment Act\u2014Workforce Investment Systems\u2014authorizes the establishment of a One-Stop delivery system through which state and local WIA training and employment activities are provided and through which certain partner programs must be coordinated. Title I also authorizes funding for the three major state formula grant programs (Adult, Youth, and Dislocated Worker), Job Corps (a DOL-administered program for low-income youth), and several other national programs that are directed toward subpopulations with barriers to employment (e.g., Native Americans). H.R. 803 takes a fundamentally different approach from current law to the federal role in the delivery of workforce development services by consolidating multiple programs into a single block grant that is allocated to states by formula. At the same time, H.R. 803 maintains the existing One-Stop delivery system as the delivery mechanism for employment and training services. Below is a brief summary of the major provisions of H.R. 803 . This list is followed by a thematic comparison in Table 1 of current law and H.R. 803 . H.R. 803 repeals 24 programs, activities, and provisions in WIA Title I, the Wagner-Peyser Act, and related workforce development legislation. Major Title I programs that are repealed include Youth Activities, Native American programs, Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker programs, Reintegration of Ex-Offender programs, and YouthBuild. In addition, H.R. 803 modifies several other programs to increase coordination with the WIA system. For example, H.R. 803 specifies that certain refugee assistance programs in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) coordinate training services with WIA programs. As part of the elimination and consolidation of multiple programs, H.R. 803 combines funding from 19 programs to create a new, single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF). From the $6.25 billion in the WIF, the Secretary of Labor would set aside $31.2 million for technical assistance and evaluations, $62.5 million for Native American employment and training programs, $1.56 billion for Job Corps, and $218.6 million for national emergency/dislocated worker activities. From the remaining $4.37 billion, $11 million would be set aside for outlying areas and $4.26 billion would be allocated to states through a new four-factor formula consisting of measures of unemployment, civilian labor force, long-term unemployment, and youth poverty. For the first three years of authorization (FY2014-FY2016), H.R. 803 provides that states would receive 100% of the relative share of funding they received under the 19 programs whose funding is consolidated into the WIF. For the remaining years of authorization (through FY2020), states would receive no less than 90% of their previous year's relative share of funding. At the state level (i.e., after funds are allocated from DOL to the states), H.R. 803 requires that each state set aside up to 15% of the state allotment for various statewide activities, including rapid response, statewide grants for individuals with barriers to employment, and administrative\u00a0costs. H.R. 803 changes the composition and majority requirements of both state and local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). Under current law, WIBs are required to have representatives from business, labor, government, and other organizations with workforce development experience, the majority of which must represent businesses. H.R. 803 would make business representatives the only required members of WIBs, and require that two-thirds of the WIB membership be comprised of business representatives. In addition, H.R. 803 requires that local WIBs reserve a percentage of funds to carry out training activities. Under current law, there is no required percentage to be spent on training. H.R. 803 expands the requirements for state and local plans to require that WIBs indicate how they will serve the employment and training needs of various subpopulations, including at-risk and out-of-school youth, disabled workers, ex-offenders, Native Americans, migrant and seasonal farmworkers, refugees and entrants, and veterans (including disabled and homeless veterans). In addition, H.R. 803 requires that state and local plans indicate strategies to develop or strengthen industry or sector partnerships. In addition to enhanced provisions for state and local plans, H.R. 803 expands the scope of existing options for State Unified Plans. H.R. 803 allows governors to propose additional consolidation of funds into the WIF. Specifically, governors may propose to consolidate some or all of the funds from programs dedicated to employment and training activities into the WIF, subject to the approval of the secretary with jurisdiction over the program under consideration for consolidation. For example, governors may propose to consolidate some or all of the funding dedicated to employment and training in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) grant into the WIF, subject to approval by the Secretary of HHS. H.R. 803 combines \"core\" and \"intensive\" services into a new single category of \"work ready services.\" Under current law, an individual typically needs to move through core and intensive services before being considered for training (this is known as the \"sequence of services\" provision in WIA). Under H.R. 803 , however, an individual may be determined eligible for training after an interview, evaluation, assessment, or case management by a One-Stop operator or partner, but the individual need not have necessarily received work ready services. Under current law, there is a priority of service for low-income individuals when resources are limited at One-Stop centers. H.R. 803 eliminates this priority. H.R. 803 adds incumbent worker training as an allowable training activity at the local level. Currently, incumbent worker training is an allowable statewide activity but not an allowable local activity. Finally, H.R. 803 requires that each local area hire at least one \"veteran employment specialist\" to carry out employment and training activities for veterans in the local area. The bill specifies that the hiring preference for this specialist should be for a disabled or other veteran. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) is the primary federal legislation that supports basic education for out-of-school adults. Commonly called \"adult education,\" the programs funded by AEFLA typically support educational services at the secondary level and below, as well as English language training. Almost all AEFLA funding is allotted to the states via formula grants. States are required to subgrant the large majority of their funds to local providers that deliver educational services. The SKILLS Act reauthorizes AEFLA from FY2014 through FY2020 and makes largely administrative changes to the existing program. It also changes the program's accountability measures to align with the standardized measures of the SKILLS Act. The SKILLS Act authorizes $606,294,933 per year for FY2014 through FY2020. This authorization level equals the FY2012 funding level. Under current law, approximately 5% of the AEFLA appropriation is set aside for national programs and incentive grants. The SKILLS Act reduces the set-aside to 2% for modified and streamlined National Activities. The SKILLS Act does not substantially modify the formula that distributes state grants or matching requirements. It also maintains the current requirements for the portions of each state grant that must be allotted to specified activities.  To receive federal funds, each state must have an approved state plan. The SKILLS Act reduces the duration of each state's plan from five years to three years and permits a state's adult education plan to be part of a State Unified Plan (described in Title I). The SKILLS Act also increases the scope of each state's required plan in several ways, such as increasing the range of stakeholders (e.g., representatives from other social service programs and postsecondary education) that must be consulted in the formulation of the state plan. The SKILLS Act also updates language and makes minor changes to state and local activities. Most notably, it replaces considerations that states must make when awarding local grants with a group of \"measurable goals\" that local grantees must demonstrate. Title III of the Workforce Investment Act\u2014Workforce Investment-Related Activities\u2014makes amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 (29 U.S.C. 49 et seq. ), which authorizes the Employment Service (ES). The ES is the central component of most states' One-Stop delivery systems, as ES services are universally accessible to job seekers and employers and ES offices may not exist outside of the One-Stop delivery system. ES is one of the required partners in the One-Stop delivery system. Its central mission is to facilitate the match between individuals seeking work and employers seeking workers. It has been a central component of the workforce development system through WIA. Title III adds Section 15 (\"Employment Statistics\") to Wagner-Peyser, which requires the Secretary of Labor to develop, provide, and improve various types of labor market information. H.R. 803 repeals Sections 1-14, which authorize the Employment Service. Funding from the ES is consolidated into the new Workforce Investment Fund. The Rehabilitation Act, as amended, authorizes grants to support programs related to employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities. The programs it funds are generally administered by the Department of Education. In FY2012, nearly 90% of the funds appropriated under the Rehabilitation Act were for Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) state grants. The SKILLS Act authorizes the VR state grants program as well as other programs under the Rehabilitation Act from FY2014 through FY2020. The programs' performance indicators are also modified to align with the standardized metrics described in Title I. The VR grants to states program is mandatory spending. The SKILLS Act authorizes $3,121,712,000 per year for the VR State Grants program for FY2014 through FY2020. This authorization is equal to the FY2012 appropriation level. Funding for the VR State Grants program, however, is determined by a formula in the Rehabilitation Act that provides an inflationary increase each year. The SKILLS Act does not amend or repeal this formula. As such, the program's funding would be determined by this formula and not its authorization level. The SKILLS Act increases emphasis on transitional services to students with disabilities. Transitional services vary by student but can generally be understood as a coordinated set of services for an eligible individual between the ages of 16 and 21 to assist that individual in moving from school activities to post-school activities and employment.  The SKILLS Act requires each state to set aside at least 10% of its VR state grant funds for transition services. The act also requires each state's VR plan to include strategies for serving the transition population as well as a description of how the VR services will coordinate with transition services provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  In addition to the VR State Grants program, the SKILLS Act authorizes approximately $317 million per year for other grant programs that are administered by the Department of Education. These programs are authorized at their FY2012 funding levels for each year from FY2014 to FY2020; the authorization level is the same each year. The largest authorization among these programs is National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) grants, which is authorized at $109 million per year. The SKILLS Act also extends authorization through FY2020 for the National Council on Disability ($3.3 million per year) and the Access Board ($7.4 million per year). The SKILLS Act repeals four authorizations. The Supported Employment State Grants program ($29 million appropriation in FY2012) is repealed and its functions are absorbed by the VR state agencies. Three competitive grant programs (two of which were unfunded in FY2012) are also\u00a0repealed."
