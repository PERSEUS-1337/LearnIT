COST SHARING FOR LAND-BASED AND CONFINED DREDGED MATERIAL \n              DISPOSAL FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) Treatment as General Navigation Feature.--Notwithstanding any \nother provision of law, the cost of providing, after the date of \nenactment of this Act, land-based and confined aquatic dredged material \ndisposal facilities associated with the construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of any Federal navigation project for any harbor or other \nfederally maintained waterway, including the cost of diking and \napplying dredged material to beneficial use, and other improvements \nnecessary for the proper disposal of dredged material at such \nfacilities shall be considered a general navigation feature of the \nproject and shall be subject to cost sharing as a general navigation \nfeature in accordance with section 101(a) of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2211(a); 100 Stat. 4082-4083).\n    (b) Cost Sharing for Operation and Maintenance.--The Federal share \nof the cost of operation and maintenance of each disposal facility to \nwhich subsection (a) applies shall be determined in accordance with \nsection 101(b) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (33 \nU.S.C. 2211(b); 100 Stat. 4083).\n    (c) Eligible Operation and Maintenance Costs.--For the purposes of \nsection 210 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. \n2238; 100 Stat. 4106), eligible operation and maintenance costs shall \ninclude--\n            (1) the Federal share of the costs of constructing dredged \n        material disposal facilities associated with the operation and \n        maintenance of all Federal navigation projects for harbors and \n        other federally maintained waterways;\n            (2) the Federal share of the cost of operating and \n        maintaining dredged material disposal facilities associated \n        with the construction, operation, and maintenance of all such \n        navigation projects;\n            (3) the Federal share of the costs of environmental \n        dredging and disposal facilities for contaminated sediments \n        which are in or which affect the maintenance of such Federal \n        navigation channels and the mitigation of environmental impacts \n        resulting from Federal dredging activities; and\n            (4) the Federal share for the dredging, management and \n        disposal of contaminated sediments, or other environmental \n        remediation in critical port and harbor areas in order to \n        facilitate commercial navigation, as determined by the \n        Secretary.\nIn selecting and carrying out projects made eligible for assistance by \nparagraph (4), the Secretary of the Army shall give preference to \nprojects in a port area to the extent that annual payments of the \nharbor maintenance tax imposed by section 9505 of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 exceed Federal expenditures made from the Harbor \nMaintenance Trust Fund for projects carried out in such port area.\n    (d) Limitations on Use of Funds.--No funds comprising the Federal \nshare of costs of construction of a dredged material disposal facility \nfor operation and maintenance of Federal navigation projects for \nharbors and other federally maintained waterways shall be expended for \nsuch construction until the Secretary of the Army determines that such \nfunds are not otherwise required to cover other eligible operation and \nmaintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation. The Secretary \nshall assure that funds expended for construction of such facilities \nare equitably apportioned in accordance with identified regional needs.\n    (e) Applicability.--This section shall apply to the construction of \ndredged material disposal facilities for which a contract for \nconstruction or construction of usable increment thereof, or the \nconstruction of the associated navigation project or usable increment \nthereof, has not been awarded on or before the date of the enactment of \nthis Act. With the consent of the non-Federal interest, the Secretary \nof the Army shall amend project cooperative agreements in effect on the \ndate of the enactment of this Act to provide for the Federal share of \nproject costs of dredged material disposal facilities as provided in \nthis section.\n    (f) No Increase in Non-Federal Share.--Nothing in this section \nshall be construed as increasing, or resulting in the increase of, the \nnon-Federal share of the costs of any dredged material disposal \nfacility authorized to be provided before the date of the enactment of \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 3.

The non-Federal project sponsor may recover the \ncosts assigned to the additional capacity through fees assessed on 3rd \nparties whose dredged sediments are deposited in the facility and who \nenter into agreements with the non-Federal sponsor for the use of such \nfacility. The amount of such fees may be determined by the non-Federal \nsponsor.\n    (b) Use of Disposal Facilities.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Army--\n                    (A) may permit the use of any dredged material \n                disposal facility under the jurisdiction of, or managed \n                by, the Department of the Army by a non-Federal \n                interest if the Secretary determines that such use will \n                not compromise the availability of the facility for \n                project purposes; and\n                    (B) may impose fees to recover capital, operation, \n                and maintenance costs associated with such use.\n            (2) Use of fees.--Notwithstanding section 401(c) of the \n        Federal Water Pollution Control Act, any monies received \n        through collection of fees under this subsection shall be \n        available to the Secretary, and shall be used by the Secretary, \n        for the operation and maintenance of the disposal facility from \n        which they were collected.\n    (c) Federal Participation in Non-Federal Disposal Facilities.--The \nSecretary of the Army is authorized to participate in the construction \nand use of dredged material disposal facilities developed by non-\nFederal interests if such facilities are necessary to the construction \nor operation and maintenance of a Federal navigation project, without \nrespect to whether or not such facilities could be used in \nenvironmental restoration of the applicable water body. The Secretary \nis further authorized to pay disposal fees associated with Federal use \nof such facilities.\n    (d) Special Rules.--Any reference in this Act to a non-Federal \nsponsor's obligation to provide ``lands, easements, rights-of-way, \nrelocations and dredged material disposal areas,'' shall, with respect \nto ``dredged material disposal areas,'' be limited to the acquisition \nof property and shall not include any costs associated with the \nconstruction or preparation of such areas or any related engineering, \ndesign, permitting, environmental mitigation, or restoration costs. \nUnless otherwise specifically provided to the contrary, costs involving \npreparation or improvement of an acquired disposal area to render it \nusable for receipt of dredged material shall be considered a part of \nproject costs and as such shall be fully subject to the applicable \ncost-sharing formulas.\n    (e) Management Techniques.--The Secretary of the Army shall use, to \nthe extent feasible, management techniques to extend the useful life of \nall land-based and confined aquatic dredged material disposal \nfacilities managed by the Secretary and constructed by the Secretary \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
