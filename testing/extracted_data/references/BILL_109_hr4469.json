FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Chronic diseases, defined as any condition that \n        requires regular medical attention or medication, are the \n        leading cause of death and disability for women in the United \n        States across racial and ethnic groups.\n            (2) According to the National Vital Statistics Report of \n        2001, the 5 leading causes of death among Hispanic, American \n        Indian, and African-American women are heart disease, cancer, \n        diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and unintentional injuries.\n            (3) Unhealthy behaviors alone lead to more than 50 percent \n        of premature deaths in the United States.\n            (4) Poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and \n        alcohol and drug abuse are the health risk behaviors that most \n        often lead to disease, premature death, and disability, and are \n        particularly prevalent among many groups of minority women.\n            (5) Over 60 percent of Hispanic and African-American women \n        are classified as overweight and over 30 percent are classified \n        as obese. Over 60 percent of American Indian women are \n        classified as obese.\n            (6) American Indian women have the highest mortality rates \n        related to alcohol and drug use of all women in the United \n        States.\n            (7) High poverty rates coupled with barriers to health \n        preventive services and medical care contribute to racial and \n        ethnic disparities in health factors, including premature \n        death, life expectancy, risk factors associated with major \n        diseases, and the extent and severity of illnesses.\n            (8) There is increasing evidence that early life \n        experiences are associated with adult chronic disease and that \n        prevention and intervention services provided within the \n        community and the home may lessen the impact of chronic \n        outcomes, while strengthening families and communities.\n            (9) Community health workers, who are primarily women, can \n        be a critical component in conducting health promotion and \n        disease prevention efforts in medically underserved \n        populations.\n            (10) Recognizing the difficult barriers confronting \n        medically underserved communities (poverty, geographic \n        isolation, language and cultural differences, lack of \n        transportation, low literacy, and lack of access to services), \n        community health workers are in a unique position to reduce \n        preventable morbidity and mortality, improve the quality of \n        life, and increase the utilization of available preventive \n        health services for community members.\n            (11) Research has shown that community health workers have \n        been effective in significantly increasing screening and \n        medical follow-up visits among residents with limited access or \n        underutilization of health care services.\n            (12) States on the United States-Mexico border have high \n        percentages of impoverished and ethnic minority populations: \n        border States accommodate 60 percent of the total Hispanic \n        population and 23 percent of the total population below 200 \n        percent poverty in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
