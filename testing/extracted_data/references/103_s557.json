    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Citizens Against Marketing \nScams Act of 1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings and declaration:\n            (1) Unprecedented Federal law enforcement investigations \n        have uncovered a national network of illicit telemarketing \n        operations.\n            (2) Most of the telemarketing industry is legitimate, \n        employing over 3,000,000 people through direct and indirect \n        means.\n            (3) Illicit telemarketers, however, are an increasing \n        problem which victimizes our Nation's senior citizens in \n        disproportionate numbers.\n            (4) Interstate telemarketing fraud has become a problem of \n        such magnitude that the resources of the Department of Justice \n        are not sufficient to ensure that there is adequate \n        investigation of, and protection from, such fraud.\n            (5) Telemarketing differs from other sales activities in \n        that it can be carried out by sellers across State lines \n        without direct contact. Telemarketers can also be very mobile, \n        easily moving from State to State.\n            (6) It is estimated that victims lose billions of dollars a \n        year as a result of telemarketing fraud.\n            (7) Consequently, Congress should enact legislation that \n        will--\n                    (A) enhance Federal law enforcement resources;\n                    (B) ensure adequate punishment for telemarketing \n                fraud; and\n                    (C) educate the public.\n\nSEC. 3.
