FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On December 7, 1941, Japanese forces attacked Clark \n        Field, Luzon, Philippines Islands.\n            (2) By May 6, 1942, military personnel from the United \n        States and the Philippines had bravely and staunchly fought off \n        enemy attacks for more than 5 months under strenuous conditions \n        that resulted in starvation and disease.\n            (3) By maintaining their position and engaging the enemy \n        for as long as they did, the soldiers at Bataan were able to \n        redefine the momentum of the war and provide other United \n        States and Allied forces throughout the Pacific with time to \n        plan and prepare for subsequent crucial battles.\n            (4) On April 9, 1942, then-Brigadier General Edward King \n        surrendered the combined forces of the United States and the \n        Philippines on the Bataan Peninsula into enemy hands.\n            (5) Over the next week, the soldiers from the United States \n        and the Philippines were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 \n        miles without any food, water, or medical care in what came to \n        be know as the Bataan Death March.\n            (6) During this forced march, thousands of soldiers died, \n        either from starvation, lack of medical care, sheer exhaustion, \n        or abuse by their captors.\n            (7) Within the first 40 days at Camp O'Donnell, 1,600 more \n        prisoners from the United States died.\n            (8) On May 6, 1942, then-Lieutenant General Jonathan M. \n        Wainwright surrendered the island fortress of Corregidor and \n        its fortified islands into enemy hands.\n            (9) Over the next 10 days, prisoners from Corregidor were \n        held in the open, exposed to the elements with little or no \n        food or water.\n            (10) They were subsequently transported to the old Bilibid \n        Prison in Manila and held several more days until they were \n        loaded into cattle rail cars for transport, followed by a \n        forced march of over 20 miles to Cabanatuan.\n            (11) The conditions at the camp were substandard, leading \n        to increased disease and malnutrition among the prisoners.\n            (12) On June 6, 1942, United States prisoners were \n        transferred from Camp O'Donnell to Cabanatuan.\n            (13) In July 1942, all Filipino prisoners were paroled.\n            (14) The prisoners who remained in the camps suffered from \n        continued mistreatment, malnutrition, lack of medical care, and \n        horrific conditions.\n            (15) In 1945, all prisoners were liberated.\n            (16) Over the subsequent decades, these prisoners formed \n        support groups, were honored in local and State memorials, and \n        told their story to all people of the United States.\n            (17) Many of these soldiers have now passed away, and those \n        who remain continue to tell their story.\n            (18) The people of the United States are forever indebted \n        to these men for--\n                    (A) the courage they demonstrated during the first \n                5 months of World War II in fighting against enemy \n                soldiers; and\n                    (B) the perseverance they demonstrated during 3 1/2 \n                years of capture, imprisonment, and atrocious \n                conditions, while maintaining dignity, honor, \n                patriotism, and loyalty.\n\nSEC. 2.
