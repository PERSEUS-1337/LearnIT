FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Significant quantities of rare earths are used in the \n        production of clean energy technologies, including advanced \n        automotive propulsion batteries, electric motors, high-\n        efficiency light bulbs, solar panels, and wind turbines. These \n        technologies are used to advance the United States energy \n        policy of reducing dependence on foreign oil and decreasing \n        greenhouse gas emissions through expansion of cleaner sources \n        of energy.\n            (2) Many modern defense technologies such as radar and \n        sonar systems, precision-guided weapons, cruise missiles, and \n        lasers cannot be built, as designed and specified, without the \n        use of rare earths and materials produced from them.\n            (3) Rare earths also provide core functionality to a \n        variety of high technology applications in computing, pollution \n        abatement, power generation, water treatment, oil refining, \n        metal alloying, communications, health care, agriculture, and \n        other sectors.\n            (4) Though at least 40 percent of the world's rare earth \n        reserves are located within the United States and its ally \n        nations, our country now depends upon imports for nearly 100 \n        percent of its rare earth needs.\n\nSEC. 3. ACTIONS TO PROMOTE RARE EARTH DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Establishment.--There is established within the \n        Department of the Interior a task force to be known as the \n        ``Rare Earth Policy Task Force'' (referred to in this section \n        as the ``Task Force''), which shall report to the President \n        through the Secretary of the Interior.\n            (2) Composition.--The Task Force shall be composed of the \n        following:\n                    (A) The Secretary of the Interior (or a designee of \n                such Secretary), who shall serve as chair of the Task \n                Force.\n                    (B) The Secretary of Energy (or a designee of such \n                Secretary).\n                    (C) The Secretary of Agriculture (or a designee of \n                such Secretary).\n                    (D) The Secretary of Defense (or a designee of such \n                Secretary).\n                    (E) The Secretary of Commerce (or a designee of \n                such Secretary).\n                    (F) The Secretary of State (or a designee of such \n                Secretary).\n                    (G) The Director of the Office of Management and \n                Budget (or a designee of the Director).\n                    (H) The Chairman of the Council on Environmental \n                Quality (or a designee of the Chairman).\n                    (I) Such other members as the Secretary of the \n                Interior considers appropriate.\n    (b) Duties.--The Task Force shall assist Federal agencies in \nreviewing laws (including regulations) and policies that discourage \ninvestment in, exploration for, and development of domestic rare earths \npursuant to Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the Act of \nJune 4, 1897, the National Forest Management Act of 1976, and any other \napplicable statutory authorities related to domestic mining operations.\n    (c) Annual Reports.--At least once each year, the Task Force shall \nsubmit to the President, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nof the Senate, the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of \nRepresentatives, and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of \nRepresentatives a report that identifies the substantive and procedural \nrequirements of Federal, State, tribal, and local laws (including \nregulations) and Executive orders that are inconsistent with, \nduplicative of, or structured so as to restrict effective \nimplementation of projects that will increase investment in, \nexploration for, and development of domestic rare earths.\n    (d) Termination.--The Task Force shall terminate 10 years after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. RARE EARTH MATERIALS PROGRAM PLAN.\n\n    (a) Plan.--\n            (1) In general.--Within 180 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act and biennially thereafter, the Secretary \n        of the Interior shall prepare and submit to the appropriate \n        congressional committees a plan for research, development, \n        demonstration, and commercial application to ensure the long-\n        term, secure, and sustainable supply of rare earth materials \n        sufficient to satisfy the national security, economic well-\n        being, and industrial production needs of the United States.\n            (2) Specific requirements.--The plan shall include a \n        description of--\n                    (A) the research and development activities to be \n                carried out under the plan during the subsequent 2 \n                years;\n                    (B) the expected contributions of those activities \n                to the creation of innovative methods and technologies \n                for the efficient and sustainable provision of rare \n                earth materials to the domestic economy; and\n                    (C) how the plan will promote the broadest possible \n                participation in those activities by academic, \n                industrial, and other contributors.\n            (3) Consultation.--In preparing each plan under paragraph \n        (1), the Secretary of the Interior shall consult with \n        appropriate representatives of industry, institutions of higher \n        education, Department of Energy national laboratories, \n        professional and technical societies, and other entities, as \n        determined by the Secretary.\n    (b) Activities.--The plan shall support activities to--\n            (1) better characterize and quantify virgin stocks of rare \n        earth materials using theoretical geochemical research;\n            (2) explore, discover, and recover rare earth materials \n        using advanced science and technology;\n            (3) improve methods for the extraction, processing, use, \n        recovery, and recycling of rare earth materials;\n            (4) improve the understanding of the performance, \n        processing, and adaptability in engineering designs of rare \n        earth materials;\n            (5) identify and test alternative materials that can be \n        substituted for rare earth materials in particular \n        applications;\n            (6) engineer and test applications that--\n                    (A) use recycled rare earth materials;\n                    (B) use alternative materials; or\n                    (C) seek to minimize rare earth materials content;\n            (7) collect, catalogue, archive, and disseminate \n        information on rare earth materials, including scientific and \n        technical data generated by the research and development \n        activities supported under the plan, and assist scientists and \n        engineers in making the fullest possible use of the data \n        holdings; and\n            (8) facilitate information sharing and collaboration among \n        program participants and stakeholders.\n    (c) Improved Processes and Technologies.--To the maximum extent \npracticable, the Secretary of the Interior shall support new or \nsignificantly improved processes and technologies as compared to those \ncurrently in use in the rare earth materials industry.\n    (d) Expanding Participation.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \nencourage--\n            (1) multidisciplinary collaborations among participants in \n        activities under the plan; and\n            (2) extensive opportunities for students at institutions of \n        higher education, including institutions listed under section \n        371(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n        1067q(a)).\n    (e) Consistency.--The plan shall be consistent with the policies \nand programs in the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research \nand Development Act of 1980 (30 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).\n    (f) International Collaboration.--In carrying out activities under \nthe plan, the Secretary of the Interior may collaborate, to the extent \npracticable, on activities of mutual interest with the relevant \nagencies of foreign countries with interests relating to rare earth \nmaterials."
