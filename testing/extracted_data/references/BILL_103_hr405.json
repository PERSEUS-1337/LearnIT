PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF EXAMINATION INFORMATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Each appropriate banking agency shall make \navailable to the public copies of reports of all examinations of each \nfailed depository institution that received funds, as defined in \nsection 6, or of a holding company of such institution, that was \nperformed by that banking agency or its predecessor, during the 5-year \nperiod preceding the transfer, failure, or receipt of funds. Each \nappropriate banking agency other than the National Credit Union \nAdministration Board shall consult with the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation prior to making such \nreports available to the public.\n    (b) Delay of Publication.--\n            (1) Threats to safety or soundness of institution.--If the \n        appropriate banking agency makes a determination in writing \n        that release of an examination report would seriously threaten \n        the safety or soundness of an insured depository institution, \n        such agency may initially delay release of the examination \n        report for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 12 months \n        from the date of the transfer, failure, or receipt of funds \n        described in section 6. Such determination may be renewed on an \n        annual basis.\n            (2) Ongoing investigations.--If the appropriate banking \n        agency or the Resolution Trust Corporation determines in \n        writing that release of a portion of an examination report \n        would hinder an ongoing investigation of alleged negligence, or \n        of other activity that would give rise to either administrative \n        or civil proceedings, the portion of the examination report \n        directly pertaining to the alleged negligence or other \n        activity, may be withheld from release during the \n        investigation, until a notice of charges is issued, a complaint \n        is filed, or for a period not to exceed 24 months from the date \n        of the transfer, failure, or receipt of funds described in \n        section 6, whichever is earlier.\n            (3) Delay pending criminal investigation.--If the \n        appropriate banking agency and the Attorney General of the \n        United States or the attorney general of a State, in the case \n        of a State-chartered depository institution, jointly determine \n        that release of a portion of an examination report would hinder \n        an ongoing investigation of alleged criminal activity, the \n        portion of the examination report directly pertaining to the \n        alleged crime may be withheld from release until the \n        termination of such investigation, the issuance of an \n        indictment, or for a period of not to exceed 5 years from the \n        date of the transfer, failure or receipt of funds described in \n        section 6, whichever is earlier. The Attorney General of the \n        United States or the attorney general of a State shall provide \n        the Comptroller General of the United States with access to \n        information regarding any such criminal investigation, and \n        shall identify any law enforcement agencies or resources \n        assigned to the investigation.\n    (c) Exclusion of Open Institutions.--\n            (1) Open institutions.--This section shall not apply to any \n        open insured depository institution and shall not be construed \n        to require disclosure to the public of any report of \n        examination of any open insured depository institution.\n            (2) Affiliated solvent institutions.--In connection with \n        the release of an examination report of a holding company of a \n        failed institution, nothing in this section shall be construed \n        as requiring the release of any examination report information \n        regarding any solvent depository institution that is also a \n        subsidiary of such holding company.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENTS.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any rule, regulation, \nor order issued thereunder, all agreements or settlements of claims \nbetween the Resolution Trust Corporation or the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation and any other party, where such agreement or \nclaim relates to an institution described in section 6 shall be made \navailable to the public.\n\nSEC. 4.
