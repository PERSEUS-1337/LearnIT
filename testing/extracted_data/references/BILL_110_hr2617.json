FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The shortage of qualified teachers in the United States \n        has reached critical levels.\n            (2) Education experts agree that looming teacher retirement \n        and shortages of effective teachers in low-performing schools \n        create a great demand for quality teachers.\n            (3) Nearly 50 percent of new teachers leave in the first 5 \n        years.\n            (4) These numbers have a direct impact on the quality of \n        the education of the children of the United States.\n            (5) Inexperienced teachers are less effective than teachers \n        with several years of experience. Successful teacher \n        preparation programs, providing ongoing support, can make \n        novice teachers effective more rapidly. The majority of new \n        teachers lack such support, and so leave the profession before \n        becoming effective.\n            (6) Teacher candidates must see expert practices modeled \n        and must then practice them with ongoing mentoring support. \n        Teacher preparation often fails to provide the opportunity to \n        learn under the direct supervision of expert teachers working \n        in schools that effectively serve high-need students. Student \n        teaching is too often conducted in classrooms that do not model \n        effective practice, or in classrooms that do not serve high-\n        need students, and the lessons learned do not generalize to \n        effective teaching in high-need schools.\n            (7) It is critical to develop programs that increase the \n        probability recruits will succeed and stay in the high-need \n        classrooms where they are needed. Because many teacher \n        candidates choose to teach where they grew up or went to \n        college, it is important to have strong programs in hard-to-\n        staff urban and rural locations. Teacher residency programs \n        effectively build teacher supply, since they recruit and \n        prepare candidates in the districts that sponsor them. Teacher \n        residency programs have demonstrated the capacity to recruit, \n        prepare, retain, and provide effective support for teachers in \n        high-need schools.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS FOR TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Part C of title II of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                ``Subpart 6--Teacher Residency Programs\n\n``SEC. 2371. GRANTS FOR TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--From amounts made available to carry out this \nsection, the Secretary shall make grants to high-need local educational \nagencies to assist such agencies to establish and support teacher \nresidency programs. Such agencies are encouraged to work with non-\nprofit community-based organizations that have experience in teacher \nresidency programs.\n    ``(b) Teacher Residency Programs.--\n            ``(1) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n        `teacher residency program' means a school-based teacher \n        preparation program in which a prospective teacher--\n                    ``(A) teaches alongside a teacher of record (who is \n                designated as the mentor teacher) for at least 1 \n                academic year;\n                    ``(B) receives coursework in the teaching of the \n                content area in which the teacher will become certified \n                to teach;\n                    ``(C) receives instruction in planning, content, \n                pedagogy, student learning, and assessment, management \n                of the classroom environment, and professional \n                responsibilities, including interaction with families \n                and colleagues and use of assessment data to modify and \n                improve instruction;\n                    ``(D) attains full State certification to teach \n                prior to completion of the program; and\n                    ``(E) receives a midpoint review.\n            ``(2) Design.--To receive assistance under this section, a \n        teacher residency program shall be designed to meet the \n        following characteristics of successful programs:\n                    ``(A) Teacher residency programs integrate pedagogy \n                and classroom practice by partnering with institutions \n                of higher education to ensure residents engage in \n                rigorous master's level coursework while undertaking a \n                guided teaching apprenticeship. Lessons learned from \n                the residency program will be used to inform teacher \n                training at the institution of higher education.\n                    ``(B) Residents teach alongside an experienced \n                mentor teacher. Experienced mentor teachers complement \n                the residency program so that classroom clinical \n                practice is tightly aligned with coursework. \n                Experienced mentor teachers may receive additional \n                compensation for participating in the program.\n                    ``(C) Experienced mentor teachers shall have extra \n                responsibilities as teacher leaders of the teacher \n                residency program, as mentors for residents, and as \n                teacher coaches during the induction of novice \n                teachers. These responsibilities include establishing, \n                within the program, a learning community in which all \n                individuals are expected to continually improve their \n                capacity to advance student learning.\n                    ``(D) The director of the teacher residency program \n                shall establish and publish clear criteria for \n                selection of experienced mentor teachers based on \n                measures of teacher effectiveness and the appropriate \n                subject area knowledge. Evaluation of teacher \n                effectiveness shall be based on observation of domains \n                including each of the following:\n                            ``(i) Planning and preparation, including \n                        demonstrated knowledge of content, pedagogy, \n                        and assessment, including the use of formative \n                        assessment to improve student learning.\n                            ``(ii) Appropriate instruction that engages \n                        students with different learning styles.\n                            ``(iii) Collaboration with colleagues to \n                        improve instruction.\n                            ``(iv) Appropriate and fair analysis of \n                        gains in student learning.
