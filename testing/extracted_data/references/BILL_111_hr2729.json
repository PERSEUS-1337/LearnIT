FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Environmental Research Parks are unique \n        outdoor laboratories that provide opportunities for \n        environmental studies on protected lands around Department of \n        Energy facilities.\n            (2) In 1972, the Atomic Energy Commission established its \n        first official environmental research park at the Savannah \n        River site in South Carolina.\n            (3) In 1976, the Department of Energy defined the mission \n        for the research parks in accordance with the recommendations \n        of the multiagency review team for environmental research \n        activities at the Savannah River site.\n            (4) The mission of the research parks is to--\n                    (A) conduct research and education activities to \n                assess and document environmental effects associated \n                with energy and weapons use;\n                    (B) explore methods for eliminating or minimizing \n                adverse effects of energy development and nuclear \n                materials on the environment;\n                    (C) train people in ecological and environmental \n                sciences; and\n                    (D) educate the public.\n            (5) The National Environmental Research Parks are located \n        within six major ecological regions of the United States, \n        covering more than half of the Nation.\n            (6) The parks are especially valuable research sites \n        because within their borders they provide secure settings for \n        scientists to conduct long-term research on a broad range of \n        subjects including--\n                    (A) plant succession;\n                    (B) biomass production;\n                    (C) population ecology;\n                    (D) radioecology;\n                    (E) ecological restoration; and\n                    (F) thermal effects on freshwater ecosystems.\n            (7) The parks maintain several long-term data sets that are \n        available nowhere else in the United States or in the world on \n        amphibian populations, bird populations, and soil moisture and \n        plant water stress. These data sets are uniquely valuable for \n        the detection of long-term shifts in climate.\n            (8) The maintenance of these parks by the Department of \n        Energy is consistent with statutory obligations to promote \n        sound environmental stewardship of Federal lands and to \n        safeguard sites containing cultural and archeological \n        resources.\n            (9) Public education and outreach activities carried out on \n        these sites provide unique learning opportunities, promote a \n        stronger connection between these Federal facilities and the \n        surrounding communities, and enhance public confidence that the \n        Department of Energy is fulfilling its environmental \n        stewardship responsibilities.\n\nSEC. 2. NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH PARKS.\n\n    (a) Designation.--The Secretary of Energy shall designate the six \nNational Environmental Research Parks located on Department of Energy \nsites as protected outdoor research reserves for the purposes of \nconducting long-term environmental research on the impacts of human \nactivities on the natural environment. The six National Environmental \nResearch Parks shall include--\n            (1) the Savannah River National Environmental Research \n        Park;\n            (2) the Idaho National Environmental Research Park;\n            (3) the Los Alamos National Environmental Research Park;\n            (4) the Fermi Lab National Environmental Research Park;\n            (5) the Oak Ridge National Environmental Research Park; and\n            (6) the Nevada National Environmental Research Park.\n    (b) Purposes.--Each site shall support--\n            (1) environmental research and monitoring activities to \n        characterize and monitor present and future site conditions, \n        and serve as control areas for comparison with environmental \n        impacts of Department of Energy land management, energy \n        technology development, remediation, and other site activities \n        outside the National Environmental Research Park areas. Areas \n        of research and monitoring on the sites may include--\n                    (A) ecology of the site and the region;\n                    (B) population biology and ecology;\n                    (C) radioecology;\n                    (D) effects of climate variability and change on \n                ecosystems;\n                    (E) ecosystem science;\n                    (F) pollution fate and transport research;\n                    (G) surface and groundwater modeling; and\n                    (H) environmental impacts of development and use of \n                energy generation technologies, including renewable \n                energy technologies; and\n            (2) public education and outreach activities consistent \n        with subsection (d).\n    (c) Cooperative Agreement.--To ensure the independence of the \nresearch, monitoring, public education, and outreach activities \nconducted on each site, the Secretary shall enter into a cooperative \nagreement with a university, community college, or consortium of \ninstitutions of higher education with expertise in ecology and \nenvironmental science of the region in which the National Environmental \nResearch Park is located.\n    (d) Environmental Education and Outreach.--Each site shall support \nan outreach program to inform the public of the diverse ecological \nactivities conducted at the park and to educate students at various \nlevels in environmental science. Program activities may include--\n            (1) on-site and in-classroom education programs for \n        elementary and secondary students;\n            (2) presentations to school, civic, and professional \n        groups;\n            (3) exhibits at local and regional events;\n            (4) development of educational projects and materials for \n        students at all levels;\n            (5) undergraduate and community college internships and \n        graduate research opportunities; and\n            (6) regularly scheduled public tours.\n    (e) Coordination.--The Secretary of Energy shall designate a \nNational Environmental Research Park Coordinator within the Department \nof Energy Office of Science.
