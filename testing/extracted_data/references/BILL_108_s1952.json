FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides that, if \n        the United States Trade Representative determines that the \n        rights of the United States under any trade agreement are being \n        denied, the Trade Representative shall take action to enforce \n        such rights.\n            (2) The Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the \n        Uruguay Round Agreements Act provided that the United States \n        Trade Representative would base any section 301 determination \n        as to whether there has been a violation or denial of United \n        States rights under the Uruguay Round Agreements on panel or \n        Appellate Body findings adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body \n        of the World Trade Organization.\n            (3) In a panel report adopted by the Dispute Settlement \n        Body on January 27, 2000, the Dispute Settlement Body \n        determined that section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is not \n        inconsistent with United States obligations under the Uruguay \n        Round Agreements, particularly in light of the decision of the \n        United States to use section 301 only after exhausting its \n        rights under the Dispute Settlement Understanding.\n            (4) On January 28, 2000, a panel of the World Trade \n        Organization determined that Mexico's antidumping order on high \n        fructose corn syrup imported from the United States violated \n        Mexico's commitments under the Uruguay Round Agreements.\n            (5) On February 24, 2000, the Dispute Settlement Body \n        adopted the report of the panel.\n            (6) On April 10, 2000, the United States and Mexico agreed \n        to a September 22, 2000, deadline for Mexico to come into \n        compliance with the panel report as adopted by the Dispute \n        Settlement Body.\n            (7) On September 20, 2000, just 2 days prior to the date \n        Mexico had agreed to come into compliance with the panel \n        report, Mexico issued a revised antidumping threat \n        determination in an obvious attempt to evade its commitment to \n        come into compliance with the panel report adopted by the \n        Dispute Settlement Body.\n            (8) On June 22, 2001, a panel, convened pursuant to Article \n        21.5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, found that \n        Mexico's revised antidumping threat determination failed to \n        bring Mexico into compliance with its commitments under the \n        World Trade Organization.\n            (9) On October 22, 2001, the Appellate Body affirmed the \n        ruling of the Article 21.5 panel and recommended that Mexico \n        come into compliance with its obligations under the World Trade \n        Organization.\n            (10) On November 21, 2001, the Dispute Settlement Body \n        adopted the Appellate Body ruling that affirmed the findings of \n        the Article 21.5 panel.\n            (11) On January 1, 2002, in a transparent attempt to evade \n        the determinations of the Dispute Settlement Body regarding \n        Mexico's antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup, and in \n        an affront to the rules-based system of the World Trade \n        Organization, Mexico imposed a de facto discriminatory 20 \n        percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup, \n        the intent and effect of which is to continue Mexico's \n        antidumping order on United States high fructose corn syrup by \n        other means by restricting access to the Mexican market.\n            (12) On April 20, 2002, with its discriminatory tax on soft \n        drinks containing high fructose corn syrup now in place, and in \n        a continuous event with the imposition of this tax, Mexico \n        lifted its antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup. \n        Importantly, Mexico lifted its antidumping order only after \n        ensuring that imports of United States high fructose corn syrup \n        would not enter the Mexican market due to the imposition of the \n        tax on soft drinks. Mexico's lifting of its antidumping order \n        enabled it to make the disingenuous claim that it had come into \n        compliance with the findings adopted by the Dispute Settlement \n        Body regarding Mexico's antidumping order.\n            (13) The imposition of the tax on soft drinks and the \n        lifting of the antidumping order by Mexico are related aspects \n        of a unified effort by Mexico to deny the rights of the United \n        States with respect to the trade of high fructose corn syrup.\n            (14) The effects of the import restrictions of Mexico's \n        antidumping order continue with even more egregious results \n        through the imposition of a 20 percent tax on high fructose \n        corn syrup. Imports of high fructose corn syrup from the United \n        States dropped from 110,893 metric tons in 2001 (the year prior \n        to the lifting of the antidumping order) to 4,868 metric tons \n        in 2002 (the first year of the tax).\n            (15) The United States has exhausted proceedings under the \n        Dispute Settlement Understanding, and the Dispute Settlement \n        Body has on more than 1 occasion adopted findings adverse to \n        Mexico.\n\nSEC. 3.
