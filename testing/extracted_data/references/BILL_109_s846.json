SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n            (1) Multiemployer pension plans have been a major force in \n        the delivery of employee benefits to active and retired \n        American workers and their dependents for over half a century.\n            (2) There are approximately 1,700 multiemployer defined \n        benefit pension plans in which approximately 9,700,000 workers \n        and retirees participate.\n            (3) Three-quarters of the approximately 60,000 to 65,000 \n        employers that participate in multiemployer plans have fewer \n        that 100 employees.\n            (4) Multiemployer plans allow for greater access and \n        affordability for smaller employers and pension portability for \n        their employees as they move from one job to another, and \n        permit workers to earn a pension where they might otherwise not \n        be able to do so.\n            (5) The 2000-2002 drop in the stock market and decline in \n        equity values has affected all investors, including \n        multiemployer plans.\n            (6) The decline in value sustained by multiemployer defined \n        benefit pension plans have threatened the stability of this \n        private sector source of secure retirement income.\n            (7) Participating employers could face onerous excise taxes \n        and other penalties as a result of the serious, adverse \n        financial impact due to these market losses.\n            (8) In 2004, the United States Senate recognized the \n        severity of this situation and passed by an overwhelmingly, \n        large bipartisan margin of 86 to 9 temporary relief provisions \n        for single and multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \nSenate--\n            (1) expresses its strong support for multiemployer defined \n        benefit pension plans;\n            (2) recognizes the importance of an environment in which \n        multiemployer plans can continue their vital role in providing \n        benefits to working men and women;\n            (3) recognizes that multiemployer pension plan relief must \n        be designed for the multiemployer labor-relations environment \n        that supports the plans; and\n            (4) supports legislation to strengthen and protect the \n        viability of multiemployer pension plans for the continued \n        benefit of current and retired members, and their families and \n        survivors, and to strengthen the ability of all plans to \n        address funding problems that occur.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        "
