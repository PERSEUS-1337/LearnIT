FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) mobile device theft costs consumers billions of dollars \n        each year, according to the Federal Communications Commission;\n            (2) 1 in 3 robberies include the theft of a mobile device;\n            (3) carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, the Federal \n        Communications Commission, and State governments have worked to \n        address the growing trend of mobile device theft, but more \n        remains to be done;\n            (4) consumers deserve to have the most secure technology \n        available to protect them and their information;\n            (5) technological protections continue to develop, evolve, \n        and improve in ways that are good for the economy and the \n        consumers of the United States, and for public safety in the \n        United States;\n            (6) the wireless industry should work with law enforcement \n        to educate consumers about the security tools that are \n        available to them and how to keep their data, their devices, \n        and themselves safe;\n            (7) because engineering and security needs change rapidly, \n        the mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer \n        advocates are best suited to proactively develop solutions to \n        protect consumers, drive innovation, and deter theft; and\n            (8) major cities such as San Francisco, New York, and \n        London have seen recent decreases in smartphone theft since \n        carriers and manufacturers began rolling out sophisticated new \n        technological functions to protect consumers from theft.\n\nSEC. 3.
