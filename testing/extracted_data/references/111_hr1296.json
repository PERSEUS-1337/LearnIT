    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Access for All America Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Providing universal coverage for health care for all \n        Americans will be incomplete if access to medical and other \n        health services is not improved.\n            (2) Currently, 56,000,000 Americans, both insured and \n        uninsured, have inadequate access to primary care due to a \n        shortage of physicians and other like providers in their \n        community.\n            (3) Several demonstrations are underway at the Federal and \n        State level to link patients to a primary care ``medical home'' \n        as a means of assuring access, controlling costs, and improving \n        quality.\n            (4) Yet, there already exists a proven medical home model \n        that accomplishes these goals and has done so over the past 40 \n        years while serving over 18,000,000 Americans.\n            (5) Community health centers, also known as Federally \n        Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), have been found to more than \n        pay for themselves by providing coordinated, comprehensive \n        medical, dental, behavioral health, and prescription drug \n        services that reduce unnecessary emergency room visits, \n        ambulatory-sensitive hospitalizations, and avoidable specialty \n        care.\n            (6) The result is that the American Academy of Family \n        Physicians' Robert Graham Center found that medical expenses \n        for health center patients are 41 percent lower compared to \n        patients seen elsewhere, an average savings of $1,810 per \n        person per year.\n            (7) The Lewin Group found that providing access to a \n        medical home for every American would produce health care \n        savings of $67,000,000,000 per year, more than 8 times the \n        subsidy needed to sustain the 1,100 current health centers and \n        to create 3,900 new or expanded health center sites to \n        accomplish full access.\n            (8) Hand in hand with the expansion of the community health \n        center program, a renewed investment in the National Health \n        Service Corps is essential to reverse the decline in the supply \n        of primary care physicians and dentists.\n            (9) Both the expansion of the community health center \n        program and the investment in the National Health Service Corps \n        can be accomplished for less than 1 percent of total health \n        care spending today.\n            (10) Finally, to encourage broader adoption of the cost-\n        effective community health center model of care beyond \n        underserved areas and populations and to encourage the pursuit \n        and practice of primary care as a career, all willing primary \n        care practitioners should be encouraged to collaborate with \n        community health centers.\n\nSEC. 3. SPENDING FOR FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHCS).\n\n    Section 330(r) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b(r)) \nis amended by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\n            ``(1) General amounts for grants.--For the purpose of \n        carrying out this section, in addition to the amounts \n        authorized to be appropriated under subsection (d), there is \n        authorized to be appropriated the following:\n                    ``(A) For fiscal year 2010, $2,988,821,592.\n                    ``(B) For fiscal year 2011, $3,862,107,440.\n                    ``(C) For fiscal year 2012, $4,990,553,440.\n                    ``(D) For fiscal year 2013, $6,448,713,307.\n                    ``(E) For fiscal year 2014, $7,332,924,155.\n                    ``(F) For fiscal year 2015, $8,332,924,155.\n                    ``(G) For fiscal year 2016, and each subsequent \n                fiscal year, the amount appropriated for the preceding \n                fiscal year adjusted by the product of--\n                            ``(i) one plus the average percentage \n                        increase in costs incurred per patient served; \n                        and\n                            ``(ii) one plus the average percentage \n                        increase in the total number of patients \n                        served.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
