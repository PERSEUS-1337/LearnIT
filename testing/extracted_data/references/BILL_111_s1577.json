FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Despite improved therapies, asthma affects \n        approximately 22,000,000 adults and 6,800,000 children under \n        the age of 18 in the United States.\n            (2) Approximately 1,000,000 hospital emergency room visits \n        are attributed to asthma annually.\n            (3) Asthma can be life-threatening if not properly managed. \n        Most asthma-related deaths are preventable, yet such deaths \n        continue to occur in the United States.\n            (4) Asthma-related health care costs are estimated at \n        $14,000,000,000 annually.\n            (5) With early recognition of the signs and symptoms of \n        asthma, proper diagnosis and treatment, and patient education \n        and self-management, asthma is a controllable disease.\n            (6) Public health interventions have been proven effective \n        in the treatment and management of asthma. Population-based \n        research supported by the National Institutes of Health has \n        effectively demonstrated the benefits of combining aggressive \n        medical treatment with patient education to improve the \n        management of asthma. The National Asthma Education and \n        Prevention Program helps raise awareness that asthma is a \n        serious chronic disease, and helps promote more effective \n        management of asthma through patient and professional \n        education.\n            (7) The alarming rise in prevalence, asthma-related deaths, \n        and expenditures demonstrate that, despite extensive knowledge \n        on effective asthma management strategies, current Federal \n        policy and funding regarding the education, treatment, and \n        management of asthma is inadequate.\n            (8) Additional Federal direction, funding, and support is \n        necessary to increase awareness of asthma as a chronic illness, \n        its symptoms, and the environmental factors (indoor and \n        outdoor) that affect the disease, as well as to promote \n        education programs that teach patients how to better manage \n        asthma.\n\nSEC. 3.
