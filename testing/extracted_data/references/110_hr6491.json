    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Organized Retail Crime Act of \n2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Organized retail crime involving the obtaining by fraud \n        and theft of retail merchandise from entities engaged in \n        interstate commerce is a nationwide problem of an increasing \n        scale and is expected to cost American companies and consumers \n        more than $30,000,000,000 annually.\n            (2) The increasing losses by retailers as a result of \n        organized retail crime make certain goods and products less \n        available and accessible to American consumers.\n            (3) The uncontrolled redistribution and unsafe storage of \n        stolen and fraudulently obtained consumer products such as baby \n        formula, over-the-counter drugs, and other products by persons \n        engaged in such organized retail crime is a health and safety \n        hazard to American consumers.\n            (4) The unregulated black-market sales of such fraudulently \n        obtained and stolen merchandise results in an estimated \n        $1,600,000,000 annual loss in much needed sales and income tax \n        revenues to State and local governments.\n            (5) The illegal income from the expanding theft and resale \n        of stolen retail goods is reasonably believed to benefit \n        persons and organizations engaged in other forms of criminal \n        activity such as drug trafficking, gang activity, and \n        terrorism.\n            (6) Organized retail crime rings often obtain retail \n        merchandise through the use of checks for which there are \n        insufficient funds or that are forged or stolen, frequently \n        returning the merchandise to fraudulently obtain refunds. Such \n        practices create major problems for the retail industry and the \n        national banking system.\n            (7) Organized retail crime rings are increasingly using \n        counterfeit, forged, misappropriated, and improperly \n        transferred Universal Product Code labels and other devices \n        employed to identify articles for sale as a method for \n        achieving their ends.\n            (8) The dramatic growth of organized retail crime and the \n        unfettered resale of such stolen and fraudulently obtained \n        goods in national and international Internet-based marketplaces \n        has resulted in effective evasion by such resellers of State \n        and local regulations on secondhand goods and article resellers \n        which had traditionally been used to control the possession, \n        resale, and transfer of stolen goods.\n            (9) The unrestricted expansion of anonymous Internet-based \n        marketplaces for stolen and fraudulently obtained goods has \n        resulted in a dramatic increase in the deployment of organized \n        retail crime rings seeking to sell stolen goods in Internet-\n        based marketplaces.\n            (10) Conduct constituting organized retail crime and \n        conduct facilitating organized retail crime both substantially \n        affect interstate commerce.\n    (b) Statement of Purpose.--In light of the above findings, the \npurposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To protect consumers, retailers, the national banking \n        system, and State and local governments from the more than \n        $30,000,000,000 annual problem of organized retail crime as \n        well as the related adverse health and safety risks it creates.\n            (2) To continue to allow legitimate transactions to occur \n        on online marketplaces while addressing the growing problem of \n        fencing stolen merchandise over the Internet (``e-fencing'') \n        that facilitates organized retail crime.\n\nSEC. 3.
