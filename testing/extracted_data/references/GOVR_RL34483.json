    "content": "The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-378 ) reauthorizes programs for runaway and homeless youth, expands congressional oversight of these programs, and establishes new activities. The major provisions of the law relate to funding for the Basic Center Program, Transitional Living Program, and Street Outreach Program; requirements for grantees that receive BCP and TLP grants; and accountability of programs and activities authorized under RHYA. Funding. P.L. 110-378 authorizes FY2009 appropriation levels for the BCP, TLP, and related activities that exceed the levels authorized for FY2004 by $35 million (these are the only recent years for which Congress has specified authorized appropriation levels). The law also increases the authorized annual minimum levels of BCP funding available for states and territories. It further requires HHS to reallocate unused BCP funds from one state to another. The amount allocated to states for FY2009 and FY2010 may not be lower than the amount appropriated to the states in FY2008. Requirements. P.L. 110-378 allows youth to remain in a program funded under the BCP and TLP longer they were able to under the prior law, although the law imposes additional criteria for youth who stay longer at TLP-funded programs. The law also changes the definition of \"homeless youth\" to permit youth older than age 18 and 22 to stay at BCP- and TLP-funded programs, respectively, but only under certain circumstances. Another change made by the law specifies that in funding grants for research and other projects related to runaway and homeless youth, HHS is to give priority to applicants that serve diverse youth and represent diverse geographic regions of the U.S. (The term \"diverse\" is not defined.) Other requirements pertain to BCP and TLP plans submitted by grant applicants. Accountability. P.L. 110-378 requires HHS to promulgate regulations that specify performance standards for public and non-profit entities that receive BCP, TLP, and SOP grants. The law further requires HHS to periodically submit to Congress an incidence and prevalence study of runaway and homeless youth ages 13 to 26, as well as the characteristics of a representative sample of these youth. HHS must consult with the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness in developing the study. The law also directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to evaluate the process by which organizations apply for BCP, TLP, and SOP, including HHS's response to these applicants. GAO is to submit a report on its findings to Congress. The discussion below provides more details of these provisions. The prior law ( P.L. 108-96 ) to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act authorized funding for all parts of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, except the Street Outreach Program, at $105 million for FY2004 and such sums as may be necessary for FY2005 through FY2008. The Street Outreach Program was authorized to receive such sums as may be necessary for FY2004 through FY2008. For all parts of RHYA, except the SOP and the new incidence and prevalence study provisions, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 authorizes $140 million for FY2009 and such sums as may be necessary for FY2010 through FY2013. The law authorizes $25 million for the SOP for FY2009 and such sums as may be necessary for FY2010 through FY2013. Finally, the law authorizes such sums as may be necessary for the study for FY2009 through FY2013. Funding for the Basic Center Program and related training and other activities is allocated among states (including the District of Columbia) and the territories, and is distributed by HHS on a competitive basis to community-based organizations. As the law existed prior to the enactment of P.L. 110-378 , each state and territory received a minimum annual allotment of $100,000 and $45,000, respectively, in BCP funds. P.L. 110-378 increases the annual minimum funding available for each state to $200,000 and for each territory to $70,000. The law also provides that funding for each state in FY2009 and FY2010 is to be no less than the amount allotted to that state for FY2008 (the bill is silent on a minimum for territories in those years). Further, unlike prior law, P.L. 110-378 enables the HHS Secretary to reallot any funds that have not been obligated before the end of a fiscal year for a state to the other states. The law does not specify the criteria for re-allotting the funds. The new law does not change the funding structure for the Transitional Living Program and Street Outreach Program. Funds for these programs are allocated competitively by HHS to community-based organizations. P.L. 110-378 changes program requirements related to (1) the length of time that youth are eligible to stay in Basic Center Program and Transitional Living Program facilities; (2) the definition of homeless youth and runaway youth; (3) BCP and TLP plans submitted by applicants; and (4) applicants that are to be prioritized under the Street Outreach Program. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 authorizes longer periods in which a youth may stay at a program funded by the BCP or TLP. Current regulation specifies that youth may remain at a BCP shelter for up to 15 days. However, P.L. 110-378 permits youth to stay at a shelter for up to 21 days. The new law continues to allow youth to remain at TLP projects for up to 540 days (18 months) or longer for youth under age 18 and adds that a youth may remain in the program for a continuous period of 635 days (approximately 21 months) under \"exceptional circumstances.\" This term means circumstances in which a youth would benefit to an unusual extent from additional time in the program. The new law further authorizes that a youth in a TLP who has not reached age 18 on the last day of the 635-day period may, in exceptional circumstances and if otherwise qualified for the program, remain in the program until his or her 18 th birthday. Under the law as it existed prior to the enactment of the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008, \"homeless youth\" for purposes of the BCP was defined as an individual younger than age 18 for whom it is not possible to live in a safe environment with a relative and for whom no other safe alternative living arrangement exists. P.L. 110-378 amends the first clause to define \"homeless youth\" as an individual younger than age 18, or an older maximum age if the BCP center is located in a state or locality with a law or regulation that permits this higher age. For purposes of the TLP, the prior law defined \"homeless youth\" as an individual age 16 through 21 for whom it is not possible to live in a safe environment with a relative and for whom no other safe alternative living arrangement exists. P.L. 110-378 changes the first clause of the definition to include an individual ages 16 through 22, or an age exceeding 22 years old on the last day the youth is permitted under law to be at the shelter, so long as the participant enters the TLP project prior to reaching age 22. (As mentioned above, P.L. 110-378 permits a stay of 540 days, or up to 635 days if the youth would greatly benefit from being in the program.) Finally, under current regulation, a \"runaway youth\" is defined as a person under age 18 who absents himself or herself from home or place of legal residence without the permission of his or her family . P.L. 110-378 enacts similar language that defines \"runaway youth\" as an individual who leaves home or place of residence without the permission of his or her parent or legal guardian. As required under the previous law, applicants for TLP funding were required to submit a plan to the HHS Secretary specifying that they would provide, directly or indirectly, shelter and services, among other types of assistance. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 amends the law to require that applicants provide, by a grant, agreement, or contract, shelter, services, and other assistance. Also under P.L. 110-378 , applicants for TLP and BCP grants must develop an adequate emergency preparedness and management plan. Under the law as it existed prior to enactment of the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008, HHS was to prioritize non-profit private agencies with experience in providing services to runaway and homeless youth, including youth living on the street, when awarding grants under the Street Outreach Program. P.L. 110-378 requires that HHS also give priority to public agencies with experience in serving runaway and homeless youth. P.L. 110-378 also makes changes to the priority areas for awarding grants for research, evaluation, demonstration, and service projects concerning runaway and homeless youth. Under the prior law, HHS could prioritize projects that addressed one of nine priority areas. P.L. 110-378 modifies the language regarding two of these priority areas. For one of the priority areas, regarding access to quality health care, the law changes the reference from projects addressing mental health care to projects addressing behavioral health care. For the other priority area, regarding access to education, the law adds that the projects should decrease high school dropout rates, increase rates of attaining a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent, or increase placement and retention in postsecondary education or advanced workforce training programs. The law also inserts as a tenth priority area projects that assist youth in obtaining and maintaining safe and stable housing. Finally, P.L. 110-378 makes a change pertaining to applicants that apply for grants to implement projects in one of the priority areas. Under the previous law, HHS was to give priority consideration to applicants with experience working with runaway and homeless youth. P.L. 110-378 adds that HHS is to ensure selected applicants represent diverse geographic regions of the U.S. and carry out projects that serve diverse youth. \"Diverse\" is not defined in the law. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 includes provisions that seek to improve accountability of programs and activities authorized by RHYA, including requiring HHS to establish performance standards for BCP, TLP, and SOP grantees; directing GAO to evaluate the process by which grants are awarded under the three programs; and requiring HHS to periodically submit a report to Congress that contains estimates of runaway and homeless youth and certain characteristics of the population. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 requires that within one year after its enactment (October 8, 2009), HHS is to issue rules that specify performance standards for public and non-profit entities that receive BCP, TLP, and SOP grants. In developing the regulations, HHS is to consult with stakeholders in the runaway and homeless youth policy community. The law further requires that HHS integrate the performance standards into the grantmaking, monitoring, and evaluations processes for the BCP, TLP, and SOP. As they existed prior to the enactment of P.L. 110-378 , the RHYA statute and accompanying regulations did not explicitly set forth performance standards for the grantees. However, grantees were (and are) collectively expected to meet certain performance measures established by the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) process. The performance measures are as follows: achieve the proportion of youth served in the TLP entering safe and appropriate settings directly after exiting care at 85% by FY2008 and maintain this level through FY2010 (this is known as a long-term outcome measure); improve funding efficiency by increasing the percentage of youth who complete the TLP by graduating or who leave ahead of schedule because of other opportunities (this is known as a long-term efficiency measure); increase the percentage of TLP youth participants who are engaged in community service and service learning activities while in the program (this is known as a outcome measure); and increase the proportion of youth who are prevented from running away through BCP in-home or off-site services (this is known as an outcome measure). Data for these outcome measures are collected from each grantee through the NEO-RHYMIS (National Extranet Optimized Runaway and Homeless Youth Management Information System) reporting system, which includes a range of data elements on the characteristics and short-term outcomes of youth receiving services through the BCP, TLP, and SOP. Further, during the grant application process, described below, applicants must discuss the results or benefits expected from their programs. For example, applicants are advised to identify quantitative outcomes for their proposed projects that will fulfill the program purpose and scope of services, as described in RHYA and the grant announcement. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 directs the Government Accountability Office to examine the process by which organizations apply for BCP, TLP, and SOP grants. Specifically, GAO is to submit to Congress findings and recommendations relating to (1) HHS's written responses to and other communications with unsuccessful applicants to determine if the information in the responses is conveyed clearly; (2) the content of the grant applications and other associated documents to determine if these materials are presented in a way that gives an applicant a clear understanding of the information that is to be provided and the terminology used in the materials; (c) the peer review process (if any) for the grants; (d) the typical time frame for responding to applicants and the efforts made by HHS to communicate about delayed funding decisions; and (e) the plans for implementation of technical assistance and training authorized under RHYA, and the effect of such programs on the application process for the grantees. Applicants for BCP, TLP, and SOP grants are currently evaluated and rated by an independent review panel made up of non-federal reviewers who are experts in the field of runaway and homeless youth issues. The review panel uses evaluation criteria to assign a score up to 100 for each applicant and to identify the application's strengths and weaknesses. The criteria are established in regulation and described in greater detail in the grant announcements. As set forth in the grant announcements, these criteria include the extent to which the application identifies the services that will be provided, as required by and consistent with RHYA, among other requirements; demonstrates the organizational capacity necessary to oversee federal grants through an explanation of the organization's fiscal controls and governance structure, among other requirements; identifies quantitative outcomes for the proposed project that will fulfill the program purpose and scope of services as described in RHYA and the grant announcement, among other requirements; describes clear and appropriate program objectives that will fulfill the program purpose, as well as a clear need for the proposed project through a discussion of the conditions of youth and families in the area to be served, among other requirements; includes an organizational chart that demonstrates the relationship between all positions, including consultants, sub-grants and/or contractors, to be funded through the grant, among other requirements; and includes a detailed line-item budget for the federal and non-federal share of project costs and demonstrates how cost estimates were derived. As further described in the grant announcements, the review panel's assigned scores assist the FYSB Associate Commissioner and program staff in considering applications. Applications are generally ranked in order of the average scores assigned by reviewers; however, the scores, in combination with other factors, determine whether an application is funded. These other factors include, but are not limited to, comments of reviewers and government officials, HHS staff evaluation and input, geographic distribution, previous program performance of applicants, compliance with grant terms under previous HHS grants, audit reports, investigative reports, and an applicant's progress in resolving any final audit disallowance on previous FYSB or other federal agency grants. According to HHS, because RHYA grants are highly competitive, well-qualified applicants may not receive funding. Further, in some years, applicants with scores in the 90s have not been awarded grants because such a large number of applicants receive scores of 100 or close to 100. HHS does not have an appeals process for unsuccessful applicants. However, in accordance with HHS's Awarding Agency Grants Administration Manual (AAGAM), unsuccessful applicants are notified by letter that they were not awarded funding, with a full explanation of the reasons the application was not funded. The letter contains a compilation of review comments outlining the strengths and weaknesses of their application as identified by the panel of non-federal reviewers. Compilations are also available for successful applications, however, they are only sent at the request of these applicants. Scores are not automatically sent to any applicants but are available upon request. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and other factors, and RHYA, as authorized through FY2008, was silent on whether HHS or any other entity was to approximate this number. Runaway and homeless youth often eschew the shelter system for locations or areas that are not easily accessible to shelter workers and others who count the homeless and runaways. Determining the number of homeless and runaway youth is further complicated by the lack of a standardized methodology for counting the population and inconsistent definitions of what it means to be homeless or a runaway. In response to a 2002 congressional request through the appropriations process, HHS submitted a report to Congress in 2003 that discusses a plan for developing estimates of the incidences of runaway, throwaway, homeless, and street experiences among youth, as well as a plan for regularly monitoring incidence trends. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 seeks to determine the number of youth who have run away or are homeless by requiring HHS to estimate at five year intervals, beginning within two years of the enactment of P.L. 110-378 (October 8, 2010), the incidence and prevalence of the runaway and homeless youth population ages 13 to 26. The law also directs HHS to assess the characteristics of these youth. HHS is required to conduct a survey of and direct interviews with a representative sample of homeless youth ages 13 to 26 to determine past and current socioeconomic characteristics; barriers to obtaining housing and other services; and other information HHS determines useful, in consultation with states and other entities concerned with youth homelessness. HHS is to consult with the federal Interagency Council on Homelessness about the studies overall. The new law does not specify the methodology for carrying out the studies, except to say that HHS should make the estimate based on the best quantitative and qualitative social science research methods available. Further, if HHS enters into an agreement with a non-federal entity to carry out the assessment, the entity is to be a non-governmental organization or individual determined by HHS to have expertise in this type of research. As mentioned above, the law authorized such sums as may be necessary for FY2009 through FY2013 to conduct the study. The studies must be submitted to the House Education and Labor Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee, and made available to the public. During the 110 th Congress, the House and Senate conducted hearings on the challenges facing runaway and homeless youth and the federally funded services to assist the population. The issues raised included inadequate levels of funding for RHYA grantees, limited information about the outcomes of runaway and homeless youth, and the need for greater education and workforce opportunities for these youth. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 incorporates provisions that, in part, address the three issues. At a hearing conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 29, 2008, service providers and advocates for runaway and homeless youth raised concerns that funds appropriated under RHYA have not been adjusted for increases in the cost of living. A provider in Vermont explained that his RHYA-funded programs have been level-funded since 1994, while costs have risen significantly. These same concerns were highlighted at a July 24, 2007, hearing on runaway, homeless, and missing children, conducted by the House Education and Labor Committee Subcommittee on Healthy Families and Communities. Further, the Government Accountability Office described in its February 2008 report on disconnected youth that funding has remained stagnant for federal youth programs, including those funded by RHYA. The report states: \"While overall Transitional Living Program funding increased in FY2002 to support a greater number of programs, the amount available to individual local programs\u2014capped at $200,000\u2014has not changed since 1992. One [runaway and homeless] program director explained that considering increases in the cost of operation, this amount funds only part of one staff rather than three as in previous years.\" An analysis of per grantee award amounts from FY2004 through FY2007 indicates that BCP and TLP funding has remained stable or has declined slightly. For example, $44.4 million in BCP funds was awarded to 345 grantees for FY2004, resulting in an average grant of $128,734. For FY2007, approximately $43.3 million was awarded to 336 grantees, with an average grant amount of about $128,821. Average TLP award amounts declined over the period from FY2004 through FY2007. For FY2004, 194 grantees shared $36,744,000 in TLP funds, resulting in an average grant of $189,402. The average grant award decreased to $181,558 for FY2007, when 190 grantees shared $34,496,000 in TLP funds. In response to concerns about funding, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 increases the authorization of appropriations in at least one year (FY2009) for the BCP, TLP, and SOP, and increases the minimum BCP awards for states and territories. However, for most programs\u2014including those authorized under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act\u2014Congress has passed, and the President has enacted, a continuing resolution for FY2009 ( P.L. 110-329 ), which in most cases, provides for the same level of funding as in FY2008. The resolution extends until March 9, 2009, and does not reflect final funding levels for FY2009. At the hearings held by the Senate Judiciary Committee and House Education and Labor Subcommittee on Healthy Families and Communities, former runaway and homeless youth discussed the challenges of living on the street, such as the inability to find work and connect to school. One witness at the Senate Judiciary hearing described the assistance he received at a TLP-funded program that now employs him as a manager for the program. He explained that through intensive case management, he was empowered to stop using drugs and to live independently. Yet little is known about the outcomes of runaway and homeless youth generally. Local grantee organizations have limited information about youth after they receive services, and research on whether youth experience homelessness as adults is dated. Some grantees may decide to follow up with youth who received services, but HHS does not require longitudinal data collection. HHS's 2007 report to Congress, Promising Strategies to End Youth Homelessness , states that longer-term studies of runaway and homeless youth are challenging because of the youth's transient nature. Further, knowledge about effective strategies for serving these youth is limited and few, if any, studies appear to have been conducted to determine the costs and benefits of these interventions. To glean more information about the runaway and homeless youth population, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 requires HHS to determine the incidence and prevalence of runaway and homeless youth and to report on the socio-demographic and other characteristics of the population. Although not a specified goal of the act, this information may help practitioners and social science researchers develop effective interventions for the population. Efforts are currently underway at HHS to learn more about the youth who are served by the Transitional Living Program. In August 2007, HHS approved a sub-contract to Abt Associates to conduct an evaluation of the TLP at select grantee sites. The study seeks to describe the outcomes of youth who participate in the program and to isolate and describe factors that may have contributed to their successes or challenges, including service delivery approaches, personal characteristics, and local circumstances. HHS (through the Family and Youth Services Bureau) and Abt researchers have conducted three site visits to TLP grantees (in Dallas, Texas; Portland, Oregon; and Wichita, Kansas) and a series of consultations with HHS and outside experts to inform the design of the study. FYSB has not yet selected the TLP survey sites for the study itself; however, the sites will likely have extensive experience working with runaway and homeless youth and have been awarded continuous TLP funding for at least three years after the survey commences. These sites will work to ensure that after receiving training, staff will be sufficiently capable of administering the survey instruments. The sites will also need to be large enough to capture an adequate sample size. Youth participants will complete surveys at entry and while receiving services through a survey administered by their TLP programs. They will also complete surveys for up to one year after leaving the program. Youth will self-report the data to a website six months and twelve months after exiting. Evaluators will compare the individual outcomes of each youth to his or her benchmark data. The youth surveys are pending executive branch review, and FYSB expects to begin collecting the data by the end of calendar year 2008. FYSB anticipates making preliminary information available before the last surveys are completed. Further, FYSB expects to maintain the self-reporting website indefinitely as a means of tracking TLP graduates after the formal study is complete. HHS issued a proposed information collection request for public comment about the evaluation in the Federal Register on August 25, 2008. On June 19, 2007, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support held a hearing on disconnected and disadvantaged youth, with a focus on runaway youth. Witnesses described \"disconnected youth\" as those youth who have weak social networks of family, friends, and communities that can provide assistance such as employment connections, health insurance coverage, housing, tuition and other financial assistance, and emotional support. They also discussed measurable characteristics to indicate whether youth are disconnected, such as the lack of high school or college attendance coupled with not having a job over a specific period of time (e.g., one year). Runaway and homeless youth are vulnerable to becoming disconnected because of separation from their families, absence from school, and non-participation in the economy. Family conflict\u2014rooted in abuse and neglect, school problems, and drug and alcohol abuse\u2014can compel youth to leave home. Family disconnectedness is also evident among many runaway and homeless youth involved in the foster care system. These youth are brought to the attention of child welfare services because of incidents of abuse and neglect. Further, youth \"aging out\" of the foster care system experience homelessness at a greater rate than their counterparts in the general population due, in part, to family disconnectedness. Some gay and lesbian youth also experience family disassociation when they come out about their sexuality. Some runaway and homeless youth spend time out of school while they are away from a permanent home. The FY2007 NEO-RHYMIS survey indicated that about 20% of youth were not attending school regularly before entering the Basic Center Program. Of youth in the Transitional Living Program, 21% had dropped out of school. Some homeless youth face barriers to attending school because of transportation problems and the absence of parents and guardians who can provide records and permission for youth to participate in school activities. Finally, some runaway and homeless youth are removed from the formal economy and resort to illegal activity, including stealing and selling drugs in exchange for cash. Other such youth are too young to work legally or experience mental health and other challenges that make working difficult. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 seeks to fund research projects that focus on connecting youth to work and school. The act amends RHYA to require HHS to give priority to research, evaluation, demonstration, and service projects that increase access to education and career pathways for runaway and homeless youth. These projects must be intended to help decrease high school dropout rates, increase rates of attaining a secondary school diploma or its equivalent, or increase placement and retention in postsecondary education or advanced workforce training programs."
