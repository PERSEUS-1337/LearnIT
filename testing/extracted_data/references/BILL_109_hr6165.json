SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Training \nResponders for Accidents and Improving Notification Act'' or the \n``TRAIN Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Railroads move about 1,700,000 carloads of hazardous \n        materials annually, about 6 percent of total freight rail \n        traffic.\n            (2) While the vast majority of shipments arrive safely at \n        their destination, serious incidents involving these materials \n        have the potential to cause widespread disruption or injury.\n            (3) On January 6, 2005, northbound Norfolk Southern freight \n        train 192, while traveling 47 miles per hour through \n        Graniteville, South Carolina, encountered an improperly lined \n        switch that diverted the train from the main line onto an \n        industry track, where it struck the unoccupied, parked train \n        P22.\n            (4) The collision derailed two locomotives and 16 of the 42 \n        freight cars of train 192, as well as the locomotive and one of \n        the two cars of train P22.\n            (5) Among the derailed cars from train 192 were 3 tank cars \n        containing chlorine, one of which was breached, releasing \n        chlorine gas.\n            (6) The train engineer and 8 other people died as a result \n        of chlorine gas inhalation. More than 500 people who suffered \n        from respiratory difficulties were taken to local hospitals. Of \n        these, 75 were admitted for treatment. Because of the chlorine \n        release, about 5,400 people within a 1-mile radius of the \n        derailment site were evacuated for several days. Total damages \n        exceeded $6,900,000.\n            (7) The National Transportation Safety Board determined \n        that the probable cause of the collision and derailment was the \n        failure of the crew of train 192 to return a main line switch \n        to the normal position after the crew completed work at an \n        industry track.\n            (8) Contributing to the failure was the absence of any \n        feature or mechanism that would have reminded crewmembers of \n        the switch position and thus would have prompted them to \n        complete this final critical task before departing the work \n        site.\n            (9) As a result of the accident investigation, the National \n        Transportation Safety Board made safety recommendations to the \n        Federal Railroad Administration.\n            (10) It is appropriate for the Federal Railroad \n        Administration to implement the National Transportation Safety \n        Board's recommendations, as improperly lined switches is the \n        leading cause of human factor-caused accidents.\n\nSEC. 2. IMPLEMENTATION OF NTSB RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n    Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations that implement \nthe following recommendations contained in the National Transportation \nSafety Board's railroad accident report entitled ``Collision of Norfolk \nSouthern Freight Train 192 With Standing Norfolk Southern Local Train \nP22 With Subsequent Hazardous Materials Release at Graniteville, South \nCarolina'', adopted November 29, 2005:\n            (1) Regulations that require, along mail lines in \n        nonsignaled territory, railroads to install an automatically \n        activated device, independent of the switch banner, that will, \n        visually or electronically, compellingly capture the attention \n        of employees involved with switch operations and clearly convey \n        the status of the switch both in daylight and in darkness.\n            (2) Regulations that require railroads, in nonsignaled \n        territory and in the absence of switch position indicator \n        lights or other automated systems that provide train crews with \n        advance notice of switch positions, to operate those trains at \n        speeds that will allow them to be safely stopped in advance of \n        misaligned switches.\n            (3) Regulations that require railroads to implement \n        operating measures, including positioning tank cars toward the \n        rear of trains and reducing speeds through populated areas, to \n        minimize impact forces from accidents and reduce the \n        vulnerability of tank cars transporting chlorine, anhydrous \n        ammonia, and other liquefied gases designated as poisonous by \n        inhalation.\n            (4) Regulations that require railroads to provide emergency \n        escape breathing apparatus for all crewmembers on freight \n        trains carrying hazardous materials, along with appropriate \n        training for such crewmembers on how to use the apparatus.\n\nSEC. 3. EMERGENCY RESPONDER GRANTS.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Part B of subtitle V of title 49, United States \nCode, is amended by adding at the end the following new chapter:\n\n               ``CHAPTER 225--EMERGENCY RESPONDER GRANTS\n\n``Sec.\n``22501.
