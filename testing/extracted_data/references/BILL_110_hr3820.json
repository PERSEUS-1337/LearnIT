FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Commercial motor vehicle crashes remain a primary \n        source of concern in the United States, particularly in light \n        of the increasing numbers of trucks and motorcoaches on the \n        Nation's roads and their critical role in the transportation of \n        hazardous materials.\n            (2) A 2004 report by the National Cooperative Highway \n        Research Program found that when a large truck is involved in a \n        crash, it is about 2.6 times as likely to result in a fatality \n        compared with passenger cars.\n            (3) The number of fatalities associated with large truck \n        crashes is a significant portion of all crash fatalities in the \n        United States. In 2005, 5,212 individuals died and 114,000 \n        individuals were injured as a result of large truck-related \n        crashes in the United States. Overall, from 2001 to 2005, there \n        have been 25,533 large truck-related fatalities in the United \n        States.\n            (4) In addition to the tremendous human loss, these crashes \n        also impose a significant economic cost on society. The \n        Department of Transportation estimates that highway crashes \n        cost society $230.6 billion a year, about $820 per person. A \n        2006 report issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n        Administration determined that the estimated cost of each crash \n        involving a truck with a gross vehicle weight rating of more \n        than 10,000 pounds is $91,112 while the average cost of a fatal \n        crash is $3,604,518.\n            (5) Investments by vehicle suppliers and truck and \n        motorcoach manufacturers in research and innovative design have \n        created a new generation of advanced safety systems and \n        technologies.\n            (6) Advanced safety technologies will directly address, and \n        help mitigate the effects of, commercial motor vehicle crash \n        scenarios.\n            (7) The Department of Transportation has set a goal to \n        reduce the traffic fatality rate to 1.0 per hundred million \n        vehicle miles traveled by 2011.\n            (8) The accelerated production, sale, and deployment of \n        advanced safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles can \n        speed the progress toward this critical goal and reduce the \n        daily injuries and fatalities on the Nation's roads and \n        highways. This progress would also help to mitigate the \n        societal cost of these crashes.\n            (9) Therefore, Congress finds that it is in the interest of \n        the United States to increase the deployment of advanced \n        vehicle safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles in the \n        domestic market by providing businesses with tax incentives, \n        designed to make such systems more affordable for purchase.\n\nSEC. 3. CREDIT FOR ADVANCED COMMERCIAL VEHICLE SAFETY SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to business related \ncredits) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 45O.
