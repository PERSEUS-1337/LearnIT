    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Israeli-Palestinian Peace \nEnhancement Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The security of the State of Israel is a major and \n        enduring national security interest of the United States.\n            (2) A lasting peace in the Middle East region can only take \n        root in an atmosphere free of violence and terrorism.\n            (3) The Palestinian people have been ill-served by leaders \n        who, by resorting to violence and terrorism to pursue their \n        political objectives, have brought economic and personal \n        hardship to their people and brought a halt to efforts seeking \n        a negotiated settlement of the conflict.\n            (4) The United States has an interest in a Middle East in \n        which two states, Israel and Palestine, will live side by side \n        in peace and security.\n            (5) In his speech of June 24, 2002, and in other \n        statements, President George W. Bush outlined a comprehensive \n        vision of the possibilities of peace in the Middle East region \n        following a change in Palestinian leadership.\n            (6) The Palestinian state must be a reformed, peaceful, and \n        democratic state that abandons forever the use of terror.\n            (7) On April 29, 2003, the Palestinian Legislative Council \n        confirmed in office, by a vote of 51 yeas, 18 nays, and 3 \n        abstentions, the Palestinian Authority's first prime minister, \n        Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), and his cabinet.\n            (8) In his remarks prior to the vote of the Palestinian \n        Legislative Council, Mr. Abbas declared: ``The government will \n        concentrate on the question of security . . . The unauthorized \n        possession of weapons, with its direct threat to the security \n        of the population, is a major concern that will be relentlessly \n        addressed . . . There will be no other decision-making \n        authority except for the Palestinian Authority.''.\n            (9) In those remarks, Mr. Abbas further stated: ``We \n        denounce terrorism by any party and in all its forms both \n        because of our religious and moral traditions and because we \n        are convinced that such methods do not lend support to a just \n        cause like ours but rather destroy it.''.\n            (10) Israel has repeatedly indicated its willingness to \n        make painful concessions to achieve peace once there is a \n        partner for peace on the Palestinian side.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this title are--\n            (1) to express the sense of Congress with respect to United \n        States recognition of a Palestinian state; and\n            (2) to demonstrate United States willingness to provide \n        substantial economic and humanitarian assistance, and to \n        support large-scale multilateral assistance, after the \n        Palestinians have achieved the reforms outlined by President \n        Bush and have achieved peace with the State of Israel.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) peace between Israel and the Palestinians cannot be \n        negotiated until the Palestinian system of government has been \n        transformed along the lines outlined in President Bush's June \n        24, 2002, speech;\n            (2) substantial United States and international economic \n        assistance will be needed after the Palestinians have achieved \n        the reforms described in section 620K(c)(2) of the Foreign \n        Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by section 1506 of this Act) \n        and have made a lasting and secure peace with Israel;\n            (3) the Palestinian people merit commendation on the \n        confirmation of the Palestinian Authority's first prime \n        minister, Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), and his cabinet;\n            (4) the new Palestinian administration urgently should take \n        the necessary security-related steps to allow for \n        implementation of a performance-based road map to resolve the \n        Israeli-Palestinian conflict;\n            (5) the United States Administration should work vigorously \n        toward the goal of two states living side-by-side in peace \n        within secure and internationally-recognized boundaries free \n        from threats or acts of force; and\n            (6) the United States has a vital national security \n        interest in a permanent, comprehensive, and just resolution of \n        the Arab-Israeli conflict, and particularly the Palestinian-\n        Israeli conflict, based on the terms of United Nations Security \n        Council Resolutions 242 and 338.\n\nSEC. 5. RECOGNITION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE.\n\n     It is the sense of Congress that a Palestinian state should not be \nrecognized by the United States until the President determines that--\n            (1) a new leadership of a Palestinian governing entity, not \n        compromised by terrorism, has been elected and taken office; \n        and\n            (2) the newly-elected Palestinian governing entity--\n                    (A) has demonstrated a firm and tangible commitment \n                to peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel and to \n                ending anti-Israel incitement, including the cessation \n                of all officially sanctioned or funded anti-Israel \n                incitement;\n                    (B) has taken appropriate measures to counter \n                terrorism and terrorist financing in the West Bank and \n                Gaza, including the dismantling of terrorist \ninfrastructures and the confiscation of unlawful weaponry;\n                    (C) has established a new Palestinian security \n                entity that is fully cooperating with the appropriate \n                Israeli security organizations;\n                    (D) has achieved exclusive authority and \n                responsibility for governing the national affairs of a \n                Palestinian state, has taken effective steps to ensure \n                democracy, the rule of law, and an independent \n                judiciary, and has adopted other reforms ensuring \n                transparent and accountable governance; and\n                    (E) has taken effective steps to ensure that its \n                education system promotes the acceptance of Israel's \n                existence and of peace with Israel and actively \n                discourages anti-Israel incitement.\n\nSEC. 6. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO A PALESTINIAN STATE.\n\n    Chapter 1 of part III of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \nU.S.C. 2351 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating the second section 620G (as added by \n        section 149 of Public Law 104-164 (110 Stat. 1436)) as section \n        620J; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 620K.
