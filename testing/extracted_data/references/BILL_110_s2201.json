TAX-FAVORED WITHDRAWALS FROM RETIREMENT PLANS FOR MORTGAGE \n              DELINQUENCY RELIEF.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nshall not apply to any qualified mortgage delinquency relief \ndistribution.\n    (b) Aggregate Dollar Limitation.--\n            (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the \n        aggregate amount of distributions received by an individual \n        which may be treated as qualified mortgage delinquency relief \n        distributions for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess \n        (if any) of--\n                    (A) $100,000, over\n                    (B) the aggregate amounts treated as qualified \n                mortgage delinquency relief distributions received by \n                such individual for all prior taxable years.\n            (2) Treatment of plan distributions.--If a distribution to \n        an individual would (without regard to paragraph (1)) be a \n        qualified mortgage delinquency relief distribution, a plan \n        shall not be treated as violating any requirement of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 merely because the plan treats \n        such distribution as a qualified mortgage delinquency relief \n        distribution, unless the aggregate amount of such distributions \n        from all plans maintained by the employer (and any member of \n        any controlled group which includes the employer) to such \n        individual exceeds $100,000.\n            (3) Controlled group.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the \n        term ``controlled group'' means any group treated as a single \n        employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 \n        of such Code.\n    (c) Amount Distributed May Be Repaid.--\n            (1) In general.--Any individual who receives a qualified \n        mortgage delinquency relief distribution may, at any time \n        during the 3-year period beginning on the day after the date on \n        which such distribution was received, make one or more \n        contributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount \n        of such distribution to an eligible retirement plan of which \n        such individual is a beneficiary and to which a rollover \n        contribution of such distribution could be made under section \n        402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16) of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as the case may be.\n            (2) Treatment of repayments of distributions from eligible \n        retirement plans other than iras.--For purposes of such Code, \n        if a contribution is made pursuant to paragraph (1) with \n        respect to a qualified mortgage delinquency relief distribution \n        from an eligible retirement plan other than an individual \n        retirement plan, then the taxpayer shall, to the extent of the \n        amount of the contribution, be treated as having received the \n        qualified mortgage delinquency relief distribution in an \n        eligible rollover distribution (as defined in section 402(c)(4) \n        of such Code) and as having transferred the amount to the \n        eligible retirement plan in a direct trustee to trustee \n        transfer within 60 days of the distribution.\n            (3) Treatment of repayments for distributions from iras.--\n        For purposes of such Code, if a contribution is made pursuant \n        to paragraph (1) with respect to a qualified mortgage \n        delinquency relief distribution from an individual retirement \n        plan (as defined by section 7701(a)(37) of such Code), then, to \n        the extent of the amount of the contribution, the qualified \n        mortgage delinquency relief distribution shall be treated as a \n        distribution described in section 408(d)(3) of such Code and as \n        having been transferred to the eligible retirement plan in a \n        direct trustee to trustee transfer within 60 days of the \n        distribution.\n    (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n            (1) Qualified mortgage

  Code).\n            (2) Eligible retirement plan.--The term ``eligible \n        retirement plan'' shall have the meaning given such term by \n        section 402(c)(8)(B) of such Code.\n
