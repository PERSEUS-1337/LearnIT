    "content": "Changing economic, social, and political conditions at home and abroad have led some analysts to question whether the United States will remain globally competitive in the coming decades. The possibility that the United States has lost or could lose its historical advantages in scientific and technological advancement\u2014and the prosperity and security attributed to that advancement\u2014has become a primary rationale for a portfolio of otherwise disparate federal programs, policies, and activities. Sometimes identified as \"innovation\" or \"competitiveness\" policy, these programs, policies, and activities address research and development, education, workforce development, tax, patent, immigration, economic development, telecommunications, or other policy issues perceived as critical to the U.S. scientific and technological enterprise. The 2007 America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ) is an example of this type of policymaking. Designed to \"invest in innovation through research and development, and to improve the competitiveness of the United States,\" the law authorized $32.7 billion in appropriations between FY2008 and FY2010 for programs and activities in physical sciences and engineering research and in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Congress reauthorized certain provisions of P.L. 110-69 \u2014including funding for physical sciences and engineering research and STEM education\u2014when it passed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ). The 2010 COMPETES Act authorized $45.5 billion in appropriations between FY2011 and FY2013.  Given the pivotal role that funding levels played in the design, implementation, and congressional debate about the COMPETES Acts, policymakers have paid close attention to trends in these accounts. This report, which was written to aid Congress in tracking these trends, includes two tables summarizing authorization levels and funding for selected COMPETES-related accounts across both authorization periods (i.e., FY2008 to FY2010 and FY2011 to FY2013).
