FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that denial of employment \nopportunities to individuals because they are or have been unemployed \nis discriminatory and burdens commerce by--\n            (1) reducing personal consumption and undermining economic \n        stability and growth;\n            (2) squandering human capital essential to the Nation's \n        economic vibrancy and growth;\n            (3) increasing demands for State and Federal unemployment \n        insurance benefits, reducing trust fund assets, and leading to \n        higher payroll taxes for employers, cuts in benefits for \n        jobless workers, or both;\n            (4) imposing additional burdens on publicly funded health \n        and welfare programs; and\n            (5) depressing income, property, and other tax revenues \n        that states, localities and the Federal Government rely on to \n        support operations and institutions essential to commerce.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to prohibit consideration \nof an individual's status as unemployed in screening for or filling \npositions except where a requirement related to employment status is a \nbona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to successful \nperformance in the job and to eliminate the burdens imposed on commerce \nby excluding such individuals from employment.\n\nSEC. 3.
