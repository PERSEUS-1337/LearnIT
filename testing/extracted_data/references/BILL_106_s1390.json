FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that in \n        1962, less than 1 percent of the nation's adolescents had ever \n        tried an illicit drug. By 1979, drug use among young people had \n        escalated to the highest levels in history: 34 percent of \n        adolescents (ages 12-17), 65 percent of high school seniors \n        (age 18), and 70 percent of young adults (ages 18-25) had used \n        an illicit drug in their lifetime.\n            (2) Drug use among young people was not confined to initial \n        trials. By 1979, 16 percent of adolescents, 39 percent of high \n        school seniors, and 38 percent of young adults had used an \n        illicit drug in the past month. Moreover, 1 in 9 high school \n        seniors used marijuana daily.\n            (3) In 1979, the year the largest number of seniors used \n        marijuana, their belief that marijuana could hurt them was at \n        its lowest (35 percent) since surveys have tracked these \n        measures.\n            (4) Three forces appeared to be driving this escalation in \n        drug use among children and young adults. Between 1972 and \n        1978, a nationwide political campaign conducted by drug \n        legalization advocates persuaded 11 State legislatures to \n        ``decriminalize'' marijuana. (Many of those States have \n        subsequently ``recriminalized'' the drug.) Such legislative \n        action reinforced advocates' assertion that marijuana was \n        ``relatively harmless.''\n            (5) The decriminalization effort gave rise to the emergence \n        of ``head shops'' (shops for ``heads,'' or drug users--``coke \n        heads,'' ``pot heads,'' ``acid heads,'' etc.) which sold drug \n        paraphernalia--an array of toys, implements, and instructional \n        pamphlets and booklets to enhance the use of illicit drugs. \n        Some 30,000 such shops were estimated to be doing business \n        throughout the nation by 1978.\n            (6) In the absence of Federal funding for drug education \n        then, most of the drug education materials that were available \n        proclaimed that few illicit drugs were addictive and most were \n        ``less harmful'' than alcohol and tobacco and therefore taught \n        young people how to use marijuana, cocaine, and other illicit \n        drugs ``responsibly''.\n            (7) Between 1977 and 1980, 3 national parent drug-\n        prevention organizations--National Families in Action, PRIDE, \n        and the National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth (now \n        called the National Family Partnership)--emerged to help \n        concerned parents form some 4,000 local parent prevention \n        groups across the nation to reverse all of these trends in \n        order to prevent children from using drugs. Their work created \n        what has come to be known as the parent drug-prevention \n        movement, or more simply, the parent movement. This movement \n        set 3 goals: to prevent the use of any illegal drug, to \npersuade those who had started using drugs to stop, and to obtain \ntreatment for those who had become addicted so that they could return \nto drug-free lives.\n            (8) The parent movement pursued a number of objectives to \n        achieve these goals. First, it helped parents educate \n        themselves about the harmful effects of drugs, teach that \n        information to their children, communicate that they expected \n        their children not to use drugs, and establish consequences if \n        children failed to meet that expectation. Second, it helped \n        parents form groups with other parents to set common age-\n        appropriate social and behavioral guidelines to protect their \n        children from exposure to drugs. Third, it encouraged parents \n        to insist that their communities reinforce parents' commitment \n        to protect children from drug use.\n            (9) The parent movement stopped further efforts to \n        decriminalize marijuana, both in the States and at the Federal \n        level.\n            (10) The parent movement worked for laws to ban the sale of \n        drug paraphernalia. If drugs were illegal, it made no sense to \n        condone the sale of toys and implements to enhance the use of \n        illegal drugs, particularly when those products targeted \n        children. As town, cities, counties, and States passed anti-\n        paraphernalia laws, drug legalization organizations challenged \n        their Constitutionality in Federal courts until the early \n        1980's, when the United States Supreme Court upheld Nebraska's \n        law and established the right of communities to ban the sale of \n        drug paraphernalia.\n            (11) The parent movement insisted that drug-education \n        materials convey a strong no-use message in compliance with \n        both the law and with medical and scientific information that \n        demonstrates that drugs are harmful, particularly to young \n        people.\n            (12) The parent movement encouraged others in society to \n        join the drug prevention effort and many did, from First Lady \n        Nancy Reagan to the entertainment industry, the business \n        community, the media, the medical community, the educational \n        community, the criminal justice community, the faith community, \n        and local, State, and national political leaders.\n            (13) The parent movement helped to cause drug use among \n        young people to peak in 1979. As its efforts continued \n        throughout the next decade, and as others joined parents to \n        expand the drug-prevention movement, between 1979 and 1992 \n        these collaborative prevention efforts contributed to reducing \n        monthly illicit drug use by two-thirds among adolescents and \n        young adults and reduced daily marijuana use among high-school \n        seniors from 10.7 percent to 1.9 percent. Concurrently, both \n        the parent movement and the larger prevention movement that \n        evolved throughout the 1980's, working together, increased high \n        school seniors' belief that marijuana could hurt them, from 35 \n        percent in 1979 to 79 percent in 1991.\n            (14) Unfortunately, as drug use declined, most of the 4,000 \n        volunteer parents groups that contributed to the reduction in \n        drug use disbanded, having accomplished the job they set out to \n        do. But the absence of active parent groups left a vacuum that \n        was soon filled by a revitalized drug-legalization movement. \n        Proponents began advocating for the legalization of marijuana \n        for medicine, the legalization of all Schedule I drugs for \n        medicine, the legalization of hemp for medicinal, industrial \n        and recreational use, and a variety of other proposals, all \n        designed to ultimately attack, weaken, and eventually repeal \n        the nation's drug laws.\n            (15) Furthermore, legalization proponents are also \n        beginning to advocate for treatment that maintains addicts on \n        the drugs to which they are addicted (heroin maintenance for \n        heroin addicts, controlled drinking for alcoholics, etc.), for \n        teaching school children to use drugs ``responsibly,'' and for \n        other measures similar to those that produced the drug epidemic \n        among young people in the 1970's.\n            (16) During the 1990's, the message embodied in all of this \n        activity has once again driven down young people's belief that \n        drugs can hurt them. As a result, the reductions in drug use \n        that occurred over 13 years reversed in 1992, and adolescent \n        drug use has more than doubled.\n            (17) Today's parents are almost universally in the \n        workplace and do not have time to volunteer. Many families are \n        headed by single parents. In some families no parents are \n        available, and grandparents, aunts, uncles, or foster parents \n        are raising the family's children.\n            (18) Recognizing that these challenges make it much more \n        difficult to reach parents today, several national parent and \n        family drug-prevention organizations have formed the Parent \n        Collaboration to address these issues in order to build a new \n        parent and family movement to prevent drug use among children.\n            (19) Motivating parents and parent groups to coordinate \n        with local community anti-drug coalitions is a key goal of the \n        Parent Collaboration, as well as coordinating parent and family \n        drug-prevention efforts with Federal, State, and local \n        governmental and private agencies and political, business, \n        medical and scientific, educational, criminal justice, \n        religious, and media and entertainment industry leaders.\n\nSEC. 3.
