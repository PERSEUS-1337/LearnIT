Plan to increase strategic regional partnerships.\nSec. 8. Definitions.\n\nSEC. 2. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Iran, which has long sought to foment instability and \n        promote extremism in the Middle East, is now seeking to exploit \n        the dramatic political transition underway in the region to \n        undermine governments traditionally aligned with the United \n        States and support extremist political movements in these \n        countries.\n            (2) At the same time, Iran may soon attain a nuclear \n        weapons capability, a development that would fundamentally \n        threaten vital United States interests, destabilize the region, \n        encourage regional nuclear proliferation, further empower and \n        embolden Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, \n        and provide it the tools to threaten its neighbors, including \n        Israel.\n            (3) With the assistance of Iran over the past several \n        years, Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas have increased their \n        stockpiles of rockets, with more than 60,000 rockets now ready \n        to be fired at Israel. Iran continues to add to its arsenal of \n        ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, which threaten Iran's \n        neighbors, Israel, and United States Armed Forces in the \n        region.\n            (4) Preventing Iran from achieving nuclear weapons \n        capability is among the most urgent national security \n        challenges facing the United States.\n            (5) Successive United States administrations have stated \n        that a nuclear weapons-possessing Iran is unacceptable.\n            (6) President Obama stated on January 24, 2012, ``Let there \n        be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting \n        a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to \n        achieve that goal.''.\n            (7) In order to prevent Iran from developing nuclear \n        weapons, the United States, in cooperation with its allies, \n        must utilize all elements of national power including \n        diplomacy, robust economic sanctions, and credible, visible \n        preparations for a military option.\n            (8) Nevertheless, to date, diplomatic overtures, sanctions, \n        and other non-kinetic actions toward Iran have not caused the \n        Government of Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program.\n            (9) With the impact of additional sanctions uncertain, \n        additional pressure on the Government of Iran could come from \n        the credible threat of military action against Iran's nuclear \n        program.\n    (b) Declaration of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United \nStates to take all necessary measures, including military action if \nrequired, to prevent Iran from threatening the United States, its \nallies, or Iran's neighbors with a nuclear weapon.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES MILITARY PREPAREDNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) military exercises conducted in the Persian Gulf and \n        Gulf of Oman emphasize the United States resolve and the policy \n        of the United States described in section 2(b) by enhancing the \n        readiness of the United States military and allied forces, as \n        well as signaling to the Government of Iran the commitment of \n        the United States to defend its vital national security \n        interests; and\n            (2) the President, as Commander in Chief, should require \n        the United States military to develop a comprehensive plan to \n        augment the presence of the United States Fifth Fleet in the \n        Middle East and to conduct military deployments, exercises, or \n        other visible, concrete military readiness activities to \n        underscore the policy of the United States described in section \n        2(b).\n    (b) Plan.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall prepare a \n        plan to augment the presence of the United States Fifth Fleet \n        in the Middle East and to conduct military deployments, \n        exercises, or other visible, concrete military readiness \n        activities to underscore the policy of the United States \n        described in section 2(b).\n            (2) Matters to be included.--The plan required under \n        paragraph (1) shall include, at a minimum, steps necessary to \n        support the policy of the United States described in section \n        2(b), including--\n                    (A) pre-positioning sufficient supplies of \n                aircraft, munitions, fuel, and other materials for both \n                air- and sea-based missions at key forward locations in \n                the Middle East and Indian Ocean;\n                    (B) maintaining sufficient naval assets in the \n                region necessary to signal United States resolve and to \n                bolster United States capabilities to launch a \n                sustained sea and air campaign against a range of \n                Iranian nuclear and military targets, to protect \n                seaborne shipping, and to deny Iranian retaliation \n                against United States interests in the region;\n                    (C) discussing the viability of deploying at least \n                two United States aircraft carriers, an additional \n                large deck amphibious ship, and a Mine Countermeasures \n                Squadron in the region on a continual basis, in support \n                of the actions described in subparagraph (B); and\n                    (D) conducting naval fleet exercises similar to the \n                United States Fifth Fleet's major exercise in the \n                region in March 2007 to demonstrate ability to keep the \n                Strait of Hormuz open and to counter the use of anti-\n                ship missiles and swarming high-speed boats.\n            (3) Submission to congress.--The plan required under \n        paragraph (1) shall be submitted to the congressional defense \n        committees not later than 120 days after the date of enactment \n        of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
