SOUTHERN SEA OTTER MILITARY READINESS AND CONSERVATION ACT.\n\n    (a) Findings and Purpose.--The Congress finds and declares the \nfollowing:\n            (1) The United States Fish and Wildlife Service--\n                    (A) developed a relocation and management plan for \n                southern sea otters as authorized by Public Law 99-625 \n                (Nov. 7, 1986, 100 Stat. 3500);\n                    (B) promulgated governing regulations on August 11, \n                1987 (52 Fed. Reg. 29754), in accordance with section \n                1(b) of Public Law 99-625; and\n                    (C) has administered the plan since August 1987.\n            (2) National defense-related activities at San Nicolas \n        Island have not had adverse affects on southern sea otters, but \n        continued expansion of the southern sea otter population into \n        the area designated by Public Law 99-625 as the management zone \n        may result in national security impacts. Military training \n        programs evolve, as they are linked to real world events, \n        necessitating greater flexibility in the types and amounts of \n        training events the military departments conduct.\n            (3) Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources \n        Management Plans for military installations in California \n        adequately address the special management needs of threatened \n        and endangered species, and provide conservation benefits to \n        the near shore marine environments through watershed and land-\n        based management actions.\n            (4) Public Law 99-625 provided the authority under the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Marine Mammal Protection \n        Act of 1972 for otters established at San Nicolas Island to be \n        designated a nonessential experimental population and this \n        designation should be continued to provide for the flexibility \n        needed for military readiness requirements guaranteed by Public \n        Law 99-625.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to enhance \nconservation of the southern sea otter and its growth toward an optimum \nsustainable population while allowing reasonable assurances for \nmilitary readiness activities, as defined in section 315(f) of the Bob \nStump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (Public \nLaw 107-314; 116 Stat. 2509; 16 U.S.C. 703 note), to continue.\n    (c) Establishment of the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness \nAreas.--Chapter 136 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by \nadding at the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 2283.
