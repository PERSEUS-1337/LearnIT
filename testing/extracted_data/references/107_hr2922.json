    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bulk Cash Smuggling Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Effective enforcement of the currency reporting \n        requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United \n        States Code, and the regulations prescribed under such \n        subchapter, has forced drug dealers and other criminals engaged \n        in cash-based businesses to avoid using traditional financial \n        institutions.\n            (2) In their effort to avoid using traditional financial \n        institutions, drug dealers and other criminals are forced to \n        move large quantities of currency in bulk form to and through \n        the airports, border crossings, and other ports of entry where \n        the currency can be smuggled out of the United States and \n        placed in a foreign financial institution or sold on the black \n        market.\n            (3) The transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form \n        may now be the most common form of money laundering, and the \n        movement of large sums of cash is one of the most reliable \n        warning signs of drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, \n        racketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes.\n            (4) The intentional transportation into or out of the \n        United States of large amounts of currency or monetary \n        instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory \n        reporting provisions of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title \n        31, United States Code, is the equivalent of, and creates the \n        same harm as, the smuggling of goods.\n            (5) The arrest and prosecution of bulk cash smugglers are \n        important parts of law enforcement's effort to stop the \n        laundering of criminal proceeds, but the couriers who attempt \n        to smuggle the cash out of the United States are typically low-\n        level employees of large criminal organizations, and thus are \n        easily replaced. Accordingly, only the confiscation of the \n        smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of criminal \n        activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical \n        part.\n            (6) The current penalties for violations of the currency \n        reporting requirements are insufficient to provide a deterrent \n        to the laundering of criminal proceeds. In particular, in cases \n        where the only criminal violation under current law is a \n        reporting offense, the law does not adequately provide for the \n        confiscation of smuggled currency. In contrast, if the \n        smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, the cash could \n        be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the smuggling offense.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a \n        criminal offense.\n            (2) To authorize forfeiture of any smuggled cash and other \n        monetary instruments, together with any other property involved \n        in the smuggling offense.\n            (3) To emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash \n        smuggling.\n            (4) To prescribe guidelines for determining the amount of \n        property subject to forfeiture in various situations.\n\nSEC. 3.

be \n        forfeited pursuant to section 413(p) of the Controlled \n        Substances Act, the court shall enter a personal money judgment \n        against the defendant for the amount that would be subject to \n        forfeiture.\n    ``(c) Civil Forfeiture.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Any property involved in a violation of \n        subsection (a), or a conspiracy to commit such
