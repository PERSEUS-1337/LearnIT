    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bucket Drowning Prevention Act of \n1993.''\n\nSEC. 2. LABELING STANDARD REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    On October 1, 1994, or 240 days after the date of the enactment of \nthis title, whichever first occurs, there is established and effective \na consumer product safety standard under section 9 of the Consumer \nProduct Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058), to eliminate or reduce the risk of \ninjury or death resulting from infants falling into 4-gallon to 6-\ngallon buckets containing liquid. Such standard, when established, \nshall require straight sided or slightly tapered, open head containers \nwith a capacity of more than 4 gallons and less than 6 gallons \n(referred to in this Act as a ``bucket''), to bear one warning label in \nEnglish and Spanish. The label shall meet the following requirements:\n            (1) The label shall be permanent so that such label cannot \n        be removed, torn or defaced without the aid of tools or \n        solvents.\n            (2) The label shall be at least 7 inches in height, and \n        3\\1/2\\ inches in width, or any larger size as the labeler may \n        choose.\n            (3) The label shall be centered on one side of the bucket \n        just below the point where the handle is inserted.\n            (4) The label shall have a border or other form of contrast \n        around its edges to delineate it from any other information on \n        the bucket.\n            (5) The label shall bear (A) the signal word ``WARNING'' in \n        both English and Spanish, in bold uppercase lettering, and (B) \n        in upper and lower case lettering the words ``Children Can Fall \n        Into Bucket and Drown. Keep Children Away From Buckets With \n        Even a Small Amount of Liquid.'', with an equivalent Spanish \n        translation in at least the same type size as English. The \n        signal word panel shall be preceded by a safety alert symbol \n        consisting of an exclamation mark in a triangle.\n            (6) The label shall be clear and conspicuous and in \n        contrasting colors.\n            (7) The label shall include a picture of a child falling \n        into a bucket containing liquid. An encircled slash symbol \n        shall be superimposed over, and surround the pictorial. The \n        picture shall be positioned between the signal word panel and \n        the message panel.\n\nSEC. 3. CERTAIN BUCKETS NOT AFFECTED.\n\n    The standard established by section 2 applies only to buckets \nmanufactured or imported on or after the effective date of such \nstandard, and buckets manufactured or imported before such effective \ndate may be sold without the warning label required by section 2 even \nthough such sales occur after that date. The Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, by rule, shall prohibit a manufacturer, filler, \ndistributor, and retailer from stockpiling buckets to which consumer \nproduct safety standards established by section 2 of this title would \nhave applied but for the preceding sentence. For purposes of this \nsection, the term ``stockpiling'' shall have the same meaning as that \nprovided by section 9(g)(2) of the Consumer Product Safety Act.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS.\n\n    (a) Removal of Label.--Once placed on a bucket pursuant to the \nstandard provided by section 2, it shall be a prohibited act under \nsection 19 of the Consumer Product Safety Act for any person in the \nchain of distribution of the bucket to intentionally cover, obstruct, \ntear, deface or remove the label.\n    (b) Consumer Product Safety Standard.--The standard established by \nsection 2 of this title shall be considered a consumer product safety \nstandard established under the Consumer Product Safety Act.\n\nSEC. 5. EXISTING LABELS.\n\n    Notwithstanding section 2, any bucket label in use on September 1, \n1993, may, if such label is substantially in conformance with the \nrequirements of paragraphs (3), (4), (5), and (6) of section 2, \ncontinue to be placed on buckets until 12 months after the date of the \nenactment of this title. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, \nbuckets subject to the provisions of this section must bear both an \nEnglish and Spanish language label on and after the effective date of \nthe standard established by section 2.\n\nSEC. 6. AMENDMENTS.\n\n    Section 553 of title 5, United States Code, shall apply with \nrespect to the Consumer Product Safety Commission's issuance of any \namendments or changes to the bucket labeling standard established by \nsection 2 of this title. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product \nSafety Act shall not apply to such amendments or changes.\n\nSEC. 7. RESPONSIBILITY FOR LABELING.\n\n    (a) Labeling.--The standard established by section 2 requires the \nlabeling of buckets covered by such standard to be the responsibility \nof the manufacturer of any such buckets, unless otherwise specified by \ncontract between the manufacturer, and either the filler, distributor, \nor retailer of such buckets. Under no circumstances shall any such \nbucket enter the stream of commerce without such label.\n    (b) Time for Placing Labels.--The required label must be on the \nbucket at the time it is sold or delivered to the end user of the \nbucket or its contents or, in the case of a bucket intended to be sold \nto the public in an empty state, at the time it is shipped to a \nretailer for sale to the public.\n\nSEC. 8. PERFORMANCE STANDARD.\n\n    (a) Performance Standard.--Within 30 days following the date of \nenactment of this title, the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall \ncommence a proceeding under the Consumer Product Safety Act for the \nissuance of a performance standard for buckets to address the drowning \nhazard associated with this product. Section 553 of title 5, United \nStates Code, shall apply with respect to the issuance of such standard. \nSections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act shall not apply to \nthe issuance of such standard. Such standard shall take effect at such \ntime as may be prescribed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nbut in no event later than 15 months following the date of the \nenactment of this title. The Consumer Product Safety Commission shall \nconsider any American Society for Testing and Materials voluntary \nperformance standard in existence prior to such date of enactment.\n    (b) Labeling Requirements.--The labeling requirements under section \n2 shall not apply to buckets certified by the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission as meeting the performance standard in subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 9. CONSULTATION.\n\n    To avoid duplicative and conflicting labeling, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission shall complete a consultation with relevant Federal \nagencies within 30 days following the date of enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 10. REQUIREMENT FOR CPSC STUDY.\n\n    (a) The Consumer Product Safety Commission shall conduct a study to \ndetermine:\n            (1) consumer use patterns of new and used 4- to 6- gallon \n        steel and metal buckets; and\n            (2) the prevalence of incidents of death or injury to \n        children associated with the use of such containers.\nThe study also shall be designed to identify use patterns that may \nsignify that such containers are being used by consumers in and around \na household, residence, school or otherwise. The study shall be \ncompleted within 12 months of the date of enactment. The study shall be \nrepeated for two consecutive years following completion of the initial \nstudy. The study shall be repeated if necessary to track any changes in \nuse patterns or to identify incidents of death or injury.\n    (b) During the pendency of this study and in the absence of any \nregulation of 4- to 6-gallon containers by the Commission thereafter, \nmetal containers which would otherwise be required to comply with the \nlabeling requirements of section 3 are exempt from such requirements. \nFor the purposes of section 26 of the Consumer Product Safety Act, such \nexemption shall be considered a consumer product safety standard. Upon \nreview of the results of the study, the CPSC shall decide whether to \ncontinue this exemption, to require compliance by metal containers, or \nto consider further study in the future."
