    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Chronic Wasting Disease State \nSupport Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITION OF CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``chronic wasting disease'' means the animal \ndisease afflicting deer and elk that--\n            (1) is a transmissible disease of the nervous system \n        resulting in distinctive lesions in the brain; and\n            (2) belongs to the group of diseases known as transmissible \n        spongiform encephalopathies, which group includes scrapie, \n        bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and Cruetzfeldt-Jakob \n        disease.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain \n        undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to \n        wildlife management, and nothing in this Act interferes with or \n        otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing \n        wildlife generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring the \n        incidence of chronic wasting disease.\n            (2) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neurological disease \n        found in cervids, is a fundamental threat to the health and \n        vibrancy of deer and elk populations, and the increased \n        occurrence of chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse \n        locations in recent months necessitates an escalation in \n        research, surveillance, monitoring, and management activities \n        focused on containing, managing, and eradicating this lethal \n        disease.\n            (3) As the States move to manage existing incidence of \n        chronic wasting disease and insulate non-infected wild and \n        captive cervid populations from the disease, the Federal \n        Government should endeavor to provide integrated and holistic \n        financial and technical support to these States.\n            (4) In its statutory role as supporting agent, relevant \n        Federal agencies should provide consistent, coherent, and \n        integrated support structures and programs for the benefit of \n        State wildlife and agricultural administrators, as chronic \n        wasting disease can move freely between captive and wild \n        cervids across the broad array of Federal, State, and local \n        land management jurisdictions.\n            (5) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \n        Agriculture, and other affected Federal authorities can provide \n        consistent, coherent, and integrated support systems under \n        existing legal authorities.\n\n             TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ACTIVITIES\n\nSEC. 101.
