FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) as a result of unfair and incomplete provisions in the \n        United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement--\n                    (A) Canadian exports of durum wheat, spring wheat, \n                and barley have increased beyond the level such exports \n                can be absorbed into the United States market;\n                    (B) these exports have depressed domestic grain \n                prices, causing severe financial losses to American \n                farmers and increasing the costs and difficulties of \n                implementing domestic farmer support programs; and\n                    (C) Canadian grain exports continue to increase \n                without bounds, increasing the damage to United States \n                farmers each year;\n            (2) the Congress approved the United States-Canada Free-\n        Trade Agreement subject to--\n                    (A) the statement in the Statement of \n                Administrative Action that the United States would \n                ``pursue consultations with Canada regarding the price \n                setting policy of the CWB (Canadian Wheat Board) as it \n                affects goods exported to the United States....directed \n                toward establishing a method to determine the price at \n                which the CWB is selling agricultural goods to the \n                United States and the CWB's acquisition price for those \n                goods''; and\n                    (B) the provision of the implementing legislation \n                requiring that ``the President will enter into \n                immediate consultation with the Government of Canada to \n                obtain the exclusion from the transport rates \n                established under Canada's Western Grain Transportation \n                Act of agricultural goods that originate in Canada and \n                are shipped via east coast ports for consumption in the \n                United States,'',\n        yet to date there has been no progress on these consultations; \n        and\n            (3) the failure of the United States successfully to pursue \n        the consultations described in subsection (b) led to a flawed \n        binational panel decision that renders meaningless the plain \n        language of Article 701(3) of the United States-Canada Free-\n        Trade Agreement, which states that ``Neither Party, including \n        any public entity that it establishes or maintains, shall sell \n        agricultural goods for export to the territory of the other \n        Party at a price below the acquisition price of the goods plus \n        any storage, handling or other cost incurred by it with respect \n        to those goods.''.\n\n                   TITLE I--GRAIN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY.\n\n    (a) Negotiations.--The President shall immediately pursue \nnegotiations with the Government of Canada to establish a method to \ndetermine the price at which the Canadian Wheat Board is selling \nagricultural goods to the United States and the Board's acquisition \nprice for such goods, as required under the fourth paragraph of chapter \n7(B,1,c) of the Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the \nUnited States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988.\n    (b) Action Upon Failure.--If, within 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, negotiations under subsection (a) fail--\n            (1) to establish the method of determining prices under \n        subsection (a), or\n            (2) to establish procedures for obtaining the data \n        necessary to implement such method,\nCanada shall be treated as in violation of Article 2101 of the United \nStates-Canada Free-Trade Agreement and all imports of Canadian grain to \nthe United States shall be suspended until the President certifies that \nsuccessful negotiations under subsection (a) have been completed.\n\nSEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY.\n\n    (a) Negotiations.--The President shall immediately pursue the \nconsultations with the Government of Canada described in section \n304(a)(2) of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement \nImplementation Act of 1988, relating to the exclusion from the \ntransport rates established under Canada's Western Grain Transportation \nAct of agricultural goods that originate in Canada and are shipped via \neast coast ports for consumption in the United States.\n    (b) Action Upon Failure.--If, within 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, negotiations under subsection (a) fail to obtain \nthe exclusion described in subsection (a), all imports of Canadian \ngrain receiving the benefits of the transport rates shall be suspended \nuntil the President certifies that successful negotiations under \nsubsection (a) to terminate such benefits have been completed.\n\nSEC. 103. ACQUISITION PRICE OF GRAIN.\n\n    (a) Negotiations.--The President shall immediately pursue \nnegotiations with the Government of Canada to clarify the meaning of \nthe term ``acquisition price'' in Article 701(3) of the United States-\nCanada Free-Trade Agreement (and any other provision accompanying such \nagreement) so that such term includes--\n            (1) the value of any transportation subsidy applied to \n        grain entering the United States;\n            (2) all payments to producers by the Canadian Wheat Board \n        or any government agency; and\n            (3) any other payments or subsidy incurred by the Canadian \n        Wheat Board, any government agency, or any private interest in \n        the acquisition, handling, storage, and transportation of the \n        grain.\n    (b) Action Upon Failure.--If, within 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, negotiations under subsection (a) fail to \nclarify the meaning of the term ``acquisition price'', all imports of \nCanadian grain shall be suspended until the President certifies that \nsuccessful negotiations under subsection (a) have been completed.\n\nSEC. 104. ASSISTANCE IN COUNTERVAILING DUTY CASES.\n\n    Each Federal agency (other than the United States International \nTrade Commission) shall provide full technical assistance and support \nto any petitioner in any countervailing duty or antidumping action \nunder title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.) with \nrespect to the subsidies provided by Canada in connection with the \nexportation of wheat or barley to the United States.\n\n                 TITLE II--AGRICULTURAL TRADE PROGRAMS\n\nSEC. 201.
