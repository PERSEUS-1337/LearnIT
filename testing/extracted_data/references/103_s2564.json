    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that, in carrying out title I of the \nClean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (referred to in this Act as the \n``Administrator'') has failed to--\n            (1) adequately consider alternative programs to centralized \n        vehicle emission testing programs, as required by section \n        182(c)(3)(C)(vi) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7511a(c)(3)(C)(vi)); \n        and\n            (2) provide adequate credit to States for the alternative \n        programs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require the \nAdministrator to--\n            (1) reassess the determinations of the Administrator with \n        respect to the equivalency of centralized and decentralized \n        programs under section 182(c)(3)(C)(vi) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n        7511a(c)(3)(C)(vi)); and\n            (2) issue new regulations governing the programs that--\n                    (A) result in minimum disruption to the ability of \n                States to comply with other requirements of such Act \n                (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); and\n                    (B) provide States a reasonable opportunity to \n                comply with the new regulations and implement \n                decentralized testing programs.\n\nSEC. 2. IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCED VEHICLE INSPECTION PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a \nState shall not be required to implement an enhanced vehicle inspection \nand maintenance program under section 182(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act \n(42 U.S.C. 7511a(c)(3)) prior to March 1, 1996.\n    (b) Reassessment of Regulations.--\n            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall--\n                    (A) immediately rescind the regulations issued on \n                November 5, 1992 (57 Fed. Reg. 52950), relating to \n                operation of the program described in subsection (a) on \n                a centralized basis; and\n                    (B) during the period beginning on the date of \n                enactment of this Act and ending on March 1, 1996--\n                            (i) reassess the determinations made by the \n                        Administrator with respect to operation of the \n                        program described in subsection (a) on a \n                        centralized basis, taking into consideration \n                        comments submitted by States; and\n                            (ii) issue new regulations relating to \n                        operation of the program described in \n                        subsection (a) on a centralized basis or \n                        decentralized basis, at the option of each \n                        State.\n            (2) Requirements.--The regulations issued under paragraph \n        (1)(B)(ii) shall--\n                    (A) in accordance with the intent of section \n                182(c)(3)(C)(vi) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n                7511a(c)(3)(C)(vi))--\n                            (i) make reasonably available to States the \n                        option of operation of the program described in \n                        subsection (a) on a decentralized basis; and\n                            (ii) establish criteria that a State must \n                        meet in order to demonstrate that a \n                        decentralized program of the State is equally \n                        effective as a centralized program; and\n                    (B)(i) provide each State a reasonable opportunity \n                to submit (at the option of the State) a new revision \n                to a plan under section 182(c)(3) of such Act (42 \n                U.S.C. 7511a(c)(3)) based on the new regulations, which \n                revision shall replace any revision to a plan \n                previously submitted by the State under section \n                182(c)(3) of such Act; and\n                    (ii) include a schedule that provides States a \n                reasonable opportunity to implement any new revisions \n                to plans that they submit.\n            (3) Judicial review.--Notwithstanding section 706 of title \n        5, United States Code, or any other provision of law, if the \n        regulations issued pursuant to paragraph (1)(B)(ii) are \n        reviewed by a court, the court shall hold unlawful and set \n        aside the regulations if the regulations are found to be \n        unsupported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n    (c) Prohibition on Imposition of Sanctions.--Until such time as the \nAdministrator has carried out subsection (b)(1)--\n            (1) the Administrator may not issue a finding, disapproval, \n        or determination under section 179(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 7509(a)), or apply a sanction specified in section \n        179(b) of such Act, to a State with respect to a failure to \n        implement a program described in subsection (a), or any portion \n        of such a program; and\n            (2) the Administrator and the Administrator of the Federal \n        Highway Administration of the Department of Transportation may \n        not take any adverse action, against a State with respect to a \n        failure described in paragraph (1), under--\n                    (A) section 176 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n                7506);\n                    (B) chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code;\n                    (C) subpart T of part 51, or subpart A of part 93, \n                of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (commonly \n                known as the ``transportation conformity rule''); or\n                    (D) part 6, 51, or 93 of title 40, Code of Federal \n                Regulations (commonly known as the ``general conformity \n                rule'').\n    (d) Full Credit for Decentralized Programs.--Until such time as the \nAdministrator has carried out subsection (b)(1), for the purpose of the \nattainment demonstration and the reasonable further progress \ndemonstration required under section 182(c)(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 \nU.S.C. 7511a(c)(2)), the Administrator shall--\n            (1) deem that the emission reductions calculated by States \n        for inspection and maintenance under their State implementation \n        plans would be achieved as if the planned program had been \n        implemented; or\n            (2) if appropriate, consider the operation of the program \n        described in subsection (a) on a decentralized basis as \n        equivalent to the operation of the program on a centralized \n        basis in any case in which a State demonstrates that a \n        determination of such an equivalency is reasonable."
