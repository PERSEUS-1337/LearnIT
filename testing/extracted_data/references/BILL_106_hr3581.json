FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Constitution requires that the number of persons in \n        the Nation be enumerated every 10 years in order to permit the \n        apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several \n        States;\n            (2) information collected through a decennial census is \n        also used to determine--\n                    (A) the boundaries of congressional districts \n                within the States;\n                    (B) the boundaries of the districts for the \n                legislature of each State and the boundaries of other \n                political subdivisions within the States; and\n                    (C) the allocation of billions of dollars of \n                Federal and State funds;\n            (3) the 1990 decennial census missed over 8,000,000 \n        Americans, and was the first one in history to be less accurate \n        than the previous decennial census;\n            (4) the 1990 decennial census missed 4.4 percent of all \n        African-Americans, 5 percent of all Hispanics, 2.3 percent of \n        all Asian-Pacific Americans, and 4.5 percent of all American-\n        Indians, thereby denying these communities adequate political \n        representation and their fair share of Federal funding;\n            (5) in the 1990 decennial census, only 2 out of every 3 \n        households returned their census forms;\n            (6) in order to obtain an accurate census, the Bureau of \n        the Census sends enumerators to visit every household that does \n        not return a census form, which is an extremely costly and \n        time-consuming process;\n            (7) the mailback response rate has been declining over the \n        past several decennial censuses, and is expected to decline yet \n        again in the 2000 census;\n            (8) the Bureau of the Census has estimated that the \n        mailback response rate for the 2000 decennial census will be \n        approximately 61 percent;\n            (9) a recent report by the General Accounting Office found \n        that if the mailback response rate for the 2000 decennial \n        census is less than 61 percent, or if the Bureau of the Census \n        is unable to hire enough enumerators at its proposed wage \n        scale, the Bureau would have to adopt a contingency plan to \n        guarantee an accurate count; such a plan would require the \n        Bureau to spend more money than is currently budgeted for the \n        2000 decennial census;\n            (10) the Bureau of the Census estimates that it will need \n        to recruit nearly 3,500,000 applicants to fill about 860,000 \n        positions for the 2000 decennial census, a staffing goal that \n        will be difficult to achieve because the labor market has \n        become increasingly tight;\n            (11) in 1993, the Bureau concluded that legislation \n        providing that pay for temporary census enumerators in the 2000 \n        decennial census which did not reduce benefits under Federal \n        assistance programs would make it easier for the Bureau to hire \n        neighborhood people as temporary census enumerators in low-\n        income neighborhoods;\n            (12) Congress must act before the start of the decennial \n        census to guarantee that additional funding will be available \n        in the event that the Bureau of the Census is forced to devote \n        additional resources to obtain an accurate count; and\n            (13) if Congress fails to so act, the result may be a less \n        accurate decennial census that disproportionately harms our \n        Nation's minorities, children, and urban and rural poor.\n\nSEC. 2. ADDITIONAL FUNDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--For necessary expenses to conduct the 2000 \ndecennial census, there is appropriated, out of any money in the \nTreasury not otherwise appropriated, an additional $100,000,000 for \nfiscal year 2000, to remain available until expended.\n    (b) Condition.--The amount appropriated under this Act shall be \navailable for obligation or expenditure only if, and to the extent \nthat, the Secretary of Commerce first submits to Congress a written \ndetermination (supported by specific findings) that--\n            (1) those funds are necessary to obtain an accurate and \n        timely 2000 decennial census; and\n            (2) sufficient funds are not otherwise available for the \n        purposes involved.\n\nSEC. 3. PROVISIONS TO PROMOTE THE RECRUITMENT OF TEMPORARY CENSUS \n              EMPLOYEES.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n            (1) the term ``2000 census position'' means a temporary \n        position in the Bureau of the Census established for purposes \n        relating to the 2000 decennial census;\n            (2) the term ``temporary'' is used in the same way as \n        described in section 24(b) of title 13, United States Code;\n            (3) the term ``census'' means a census of population within \n        the meaning of section 141(g) of title 13, United States Code;\n            (4) the terms ``uniformed services'' and ``Secretary \n        concerned'' have the meanings given those terms by section 101 \n        of title 37, United States Code; and\n            (5) the term ``voluntary separation incentive payment'' \n        includes such a payment, whether offered on a Governmentwide \n        basis or otherwise.\n    (b) Authorization for Members of Uniformed Services To Hold \nTemporary Census Employment.--A member of the uniformed services, with \nthe approval of the Secretary concerned, may be appointed to and \ncompensated for service in a 2000 census position without regard to the \nmember's duty status, including status on active duty. Such an \nappointment, if accepted, shall not affect the member's status in the \nmember's uniformed service or the member's pay and allowances as such a \nmember.\n    (c) Temporary Census Employment Not To Affect Right To Retain a \nVoluntary Separation Incentive Payment.--The acceptance of an \nappointment to a 2000 census position shall not be taken into account \nfor purposes of applying section 3(d) of Public Law 103-226 or any \nsimilar provision of law, rule, or regulation requiring the repayment \nof a voluntary separation incentive payment by reason of an \nindividual's accepting reemployment with the Government.\n    (d) Compensation for Service as a Temporary Census Employee Not To \nCause Ineligibility for or any Reduction in Certain Benefits.--\n            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n        law, the earning or receipt by an individual of compensation \n        for service performed by such individual in a 2000 census \n        position shall not have the effect of causing--\n                    (A) such individual or any other individual to \n                become ineligible for any benefits described in \n                paragraph (2); or\n                    (B) a reduction in the amount of any benefits \n                described in paragraph (2) for which such individual or \n                any other individual would otherwise be eligible.\n            (2) Benefits described.--This subsection shall apply with \n        respect to benefits provided under any Federal program or under \n        any State or local program financed in whole or in part with \n        Federal funds.\n            (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n        be considered to apply with respect to the Internal Revenue \n        Code of 1986.\n    (e) Applicability.--Subsections (b) and (c) shall apply with \nrespect to an appointment to a 2000 census position accepted after the \ndate of enactment of this Act and before January 1, 2001.
