For the purposes of this section, \u201cvalidating\u201d is a process whereby an urban retail water supplier uses a technical expert to confirm the basis of all data entries in the urban retail water supplier\u2019s water loss audit report and to appropriately characterize the quality of the reported data. The validation process shall follow the principles and terminology laid out by the American Water Works Association in the third edition of Water Audits and Loss Control Programs, Manual M36 and in the Free Water Audit Software, version 5.0. A validated water loss audit report shall include the name and technical qualifications of the person engaged for validation.\n(C) The technical qualifications required of a person to engage in validation, as described in subparagraph (B).\n(D) The certification requirements for a person selected by an urban retail water supplier to provide validation of its own water loss audit report.\n(E) The method of submitting a water loss audit report to the department.\n(2) The department shall update rules adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) no later than six months after the release of subsequent editions of the American Water Works Association\u2019s Water Audits and Loss Control Programs, Manual M36. Except as provided by the department, until the department adopts updated rules pursuant to this paragraph, an urban retail water supplier may rely upon a subsequent edition of the American Water Works Association\u2019s Water Audits and Loss Control Programs, Manual M36 or the Free Water Audit Software.\n(b) On or before October 1, 2017, and on or before October 1 of each year thereafter, each urban retail water supplier shall submit a completed and validated water loss audit report for the previous calendar year or the previous fiscal year as prescribed by the department pursuant to subdivision (a). Water loss audit reports submitted on or before October 1, 2017, may be completed and validated with assistance as described in subdivision (c).\n(c) Using funds available for the 2016\u201317 fiscal year, the board shall contribute up to four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) towards procuring water loss audit report validation assistance for urban retail water suppliers.\n(d) Each water loss audit report submitted to the department shall be accompanied by information, in a form specified by the department, identifying steps taken in the preceding year to increase the validity of data entered into the final audit, reduce the volume of apparent losses, and reduce the volume of real losses.\n(e) At least one of the following employees of an urban retail water supplier shall attest to each water loss audit report submitted to the department:\n(1) The chief financial officer.\n(2) The chief engineer.\n(3) The general manager.\n(f) The department shall deem incomplete and return to the urban retail water supplier any final water loss audit report found by the department to be incomplete, not validated, unattested, or incongruent with known characteristics of water system operations. A water supplier shall resubmit a completed water loss audit report within 90 days of an audit being returned by the department.\n(g) The department shall post all validated water loss audit reports on its Internet Web site in a manner that allows for comparisons across water suppliers. The department shall make the validated water loss audit reports available for public viewing in a timely manner after their receipt.\n(h) Using available funds, the department shall provide technical assistance to guide urban retail water suppliers\u2019 water loss detection programs, including, but not limited to, metering techniques, pressure management techniques, condition-based assessment techniques for transmission and distribution pipelines, and utilization of portable and permanent water loss detection devices.\n(i) No earlier than January 1, 2019, and no later than July 1, 2020, the board shall adopt rules requiring urban retail water suppliers to meet performance standards for the volume of water losses. In adopting these rules, the board shall employ full life cycle cost accounting to evaluate the costs of meeting the performance standards. The board may consider establishing a minimum allowable water loss threshold that, if reached and maintained by an urban water supplier, would exempt the urban water supplier from further water loss reduction requirements."
