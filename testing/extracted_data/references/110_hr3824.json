    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Relocation Empowerment and Placement \nAssistance for Iraqi Refugees Act of 2007'' or the ``REPAIR Act of \n2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has relied on Iraqi nationals who \n        have risked their lives and worked diligently side by side with \n        United States and coalition forces.\n            (2) The United States is grateful to these individuals for \n        the risks they took in assisting the United States and \n        coalition forces.\n            (3) Many of these Iraqi nationals desire to come to the \n        United States to seek protection from threats they face at home \n        because of the work they did for the United States.\n            (4) Special immigrant status is available in limited \n        numbers to Iraqi nationals who have worked directly for the \n        United States Armed Forces as translators.\n            (5) Special immigrant status allows translators and their \n        immediate families to gain admission to the United States, \n        apply for permanent residency, and eventually acquire United \n        States citizenship.\n            (6) Special immigrant status is not available, however, to \n        those individuals who otherwise assisted United States efforts \n        but who were not translators, including cooks, drivers, guides, \n        security personnel, and mechanics.\n            (7) Currently, an individual who applies for special \n        immigrant status for service as a translator is required to \n        file form I-360 with the Nebraska Service Center (NSC) of \n        United States Citizenship and Immigration Services for \n        adjudication at a United States diplomatic or consular post \n        outside of Iraq. The filing fee for the I-360 form is $375.\n            (8) Iraqis are being forced to leave Iraq and travel \n        through potentially hostile territory to obtain special \n        immigrant status and visas.\n            (9) To apply for special immigrant status, an applicant \n        must provide a copy of the applicant's passport or birth \n        certificate showing the applicant is a national of Iraq, \n        provide proof from the United States Armed Forces or United \n        States Chief of Mission in Iraq that the applicant worked as a \n        translator for the Armed Forces at least 12 months, pass a \n        background check and screening by the Armed Forces or the Chief \n        of Mission, provide a letter of recommendation from the Chief \n        of Mission, a general, or a flag officer, and provide a copy of \n        the front and back of the applicant's Arrival Departure Record \n        (Form I-94) if the applicant applies in the United States for \n        such status.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENTS OF POLICY.\n\n    The following shall be the policies of the United States:\n            (1) To waive any filing or administrative fees in \n        connection with applications for special immigrant status for \n        those brave and committed Iraqi nationals who have risked their \n        lives to assist the United States Armed Forces as translators.\n            (2) To allow Iraqis to apply for special immigrant status \n        and visas in Iraq at the United States Embassy in Baghdad and \n        at the United States Consulate in Irbil.\n            (3) To allow Iraqis working in any capacity with the Armed \n        Forces to apply for special immigrant status and visas for \n        admission to the United States in the same manner that Iraqi \n        translators currently can.\n            (4) To broaden domestic relocation assistance to Iraqis to \n        include housing credits, cultural counseling, meetings with \n        social workers, and advice on how to work with schools and \n        employment systems.\n\nSEC. 4.
