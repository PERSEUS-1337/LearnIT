FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The National Institutes of Health (referred to in this \n        section as the ``NIH'') is the leading biomedical research \n        entity in the world. It supports researchers in every State as \n        they discover treatments and cures to prevent and reduce human \n        suffering. Thanks in large part to NIH-funded medical research, \n        Americans today are living longer and healthier. Life \n        expectancy in the United States has jumped from 47 years in \n        1900 to 78 years in 2009, and disability in people over age 65 \n        has dropped dramatically in the past 3 decades.\n            (2) Over the past 40 years, NIH-supported research \n        contributed to the discovery of 153 new Food and Drug \n        Administration-approved drugs, vaccines, or new indications for \n        current drugs.\n            (3) The application success rate is now at an all-time low. \n        From 1980 to 2003, the last year of the doubling, the grant \n        application success rate ranged between 25 and 35 percent. By \n        2013, the grant success rate had fallen to 16.8 percent.\n            (4) Recent Federal funding cuts threaten to diminish United \n        States leadership in the world. The international community has \n        recognized the role biomedical research plays in generating \n        economic growth. England, China, Brazil, South Korea, India, \n        Singapore, Germany, France and Japan are increasing their \n        investment, despite the worldwide recession. Only the United \n        States has decreased its investment, from 0.215 percent of \n        Gross Domestic Product in 2003 (the last year of the doubling) \n        to 0.174 percent in 2013. In 8 years, if current trends \n        continue, China will surpass the United States in total \n        government biomedical research investment.\n            (5) NIH is vital to the United States economy. In fiscal \n        year 2012, the NIH extramural program supported around 50,000 \n        competitive research grants and 300,000 scientists and research \n        personnel at more than 2,500 universities, medical schools, and \n        other research institutions across our 50 States.\n            (6) Economists have estimated the return on each dollar of \n        investment in NIH to generate anywhere from $1.80 to $3.20 in \n        economic output. The Federal investment of $3,800,000,000 in \n        the Human Genome Project from 1988 to 2003 helped drive \n        $796,000,000,000 in economic output, which is a return of $141 \n        for every $1 invested.\n            (7) In 2013, sales of products built around licensed NIH \n        and Food and Drug Administration inventions included 358 \n        licensees reporting a total of $7,000,000,000 in sales.\n            (8) The historic doubling of Federal funding for the \n        National Institutes of Health ended in fiscal year 2003. Since \n        that time, NIH appropriations have not kept up with biomedical \n        inflation. NIH has lost more than 20 percent of its purchasing \n        power for medical research since 2003.\n            (9) If NIH had kept up with biomedical inflation, NIH's \n        appropriation would have totaled $37,000,000,000 in 2013, \n        instead of the $28,900,000,000 that was actually appropriated, \n        a loss of $8,100,000,000 or 28 percent. To restore funding to \n        the 2003 post-doubling level would require Congress to \n        appropriate $46,500,000,000 in fiscal year 2021, the final year \n        of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Public Law 112-25).\n            (10) High health care costs from a variety of common \n        conditions threaten Federal, State, and local budgets, as well \n        as the budgets of American families. Recent estimates indicate \n        that the economic costs of Alzheimer's disease is over \n        $200,000,000,000 each year but will rise to over \n        $1,000,000,000,000 by 2050 unless a prevention or cure is \n        found. In 2006, economists found that a future 1 percent \n        reduction in mortality rates from cancer would save \n        $500,000,000,000 to current and future Americans. A cure for \n        cancer was estimated to save $50,000,000,000,000 to Americans, \n        more than 3 times the gross domestic product of the United \n        States in 2012. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        reports that annual costs from undiagnosed diabetes was \n        $245,000,000,000 each year. And a recent study projects that by \n        2030, nearly 44 percent of the United States population will \n        face some form of cardiovascular disease costing a total of \n        $1,208,000,000,000 between 2012 and 2030.\n            (11) Budget cap adjustments are how Congress traditionally \n        prioritizes areas of spending that produce economic growth and \n        reduce costs that contribute to the Federal debt.\n\nSEC. 3.
