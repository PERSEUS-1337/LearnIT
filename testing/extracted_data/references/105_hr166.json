CLARIFICATION OF ACTIONS AGAINST STATES TO ENFORCE VETERANS' \n              REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.\n\n    (a) Action Against a State.--Section 4323 of title 38, United \nStates Code, is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking out ``a State (as an \n        employer) or'';\n            (2) in subsection (a)(2), by inserting ``against a private \n        employer'' after ``commence an action'' in the matter preceding \n        subparagraph (A);\n            (3) in clauses (ii) and (iii) of subsection (c)(1)(A), by \n        inserting ``or the United States, as appropriate,'' after \n        ``person'' both places it appears;\n            (4) by redesignating the second sentence of subsection (b) \n        as paragraph (3) of subsection (a); and\n            (5) by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:\n    ``(b)(1) A person who receives from the Secretary a notification \npursuant to section 4322(e) relating to a State (as an employer) may \nrequest that the Secretary refer the complaint to the Attorney General. \nIf the Attorney General is reasonably satisfied that the person on \nwhose behalf the complaint is referred is entitled to the rights or \nbenefits sought, the Attorney General may commence an action for \nappropriate relief in an appropriate United States district court. The \naction shall be brought in the name of the United States. In the case \nthat such relief includes an award of compensation under subsection \n(c)(1), such compensation shall be held in a special deposit account \nand shall be paid, on order of the Attorney General, directly to the \nperson. Any such moneys not paid to a person because of inability to do \nso within a period of 3 years shall be covered into the Treasury of the \nUnited States as miscellaneous receipts.\n    ``(2) A person may commence an action against a State as an \nemployer for relief with respect to a complaint if that person--\n            ``(A) has chosen not to apply to the Secretary for \n        assistance under section 4322(a);\n            ``(B) has chosen not to request that the Secretary refer \n        the complaint to the Attorney General under paragraph (1); or\n            ``(C) has been refused representation by the Attorney \n        General with respect to the complaint under such paragraph.\n    ``(3)(A) In the case of an action commenced against a State as an \nemployer under paragraph (2), the action shall be brought in the name \nof the United States.\n    ``(B) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of \nsubstantially all material evidence and information the person \npossesses shall be served on the United States pursuant to Rule 4(d)(4) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n    ``(C)(i) The person bringing the action shall have the right to \nconduct the action. If the United States so requests, it shall be \nserved with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be \nsupplied with copies of all deposition transcripts (at the expense of \nthe United States). When a person proceeds with the action, the court, \nwithout limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the \naction, may nevertheless permit the United States to intervene at a \nlater date upon a showing of good cause.\n    ``(ii) If the United States intervenes and thereafter proceeds with \nthe action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting \nthe action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the \naction. Such person shall have the right to continue as a party to the \naction.\n    ``(iii) The United States may settle the action with the defendant \nnotwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if \nthe court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is \nfair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances.\n    ``(D) After intervention by the United States, upon a showing by \nthe defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the \nlitigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of \nharassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary \nexpense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the \nlitigation.\n    ``(4) If the United States does not intervene under paragraph (3) \nand the person bringing the action prevails or settles the claim, the \nperson shall receive appropriate relief, including an amount for \ncompensation or liquidated damages under subsection (c)(1). The amount \nshall be paid out of the proceeds of the action or settlement. The \nperson prevailing in the action or settling the claim shall also \nreceive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have \nbeen necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. \nAll such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the \ndefendant.\n    ``(5) In the case of an action brought under this subsection, the \nappropriate district court is the court for any district in which the \nState exercises any authority or carries out any function.\n    ``(6) The United States is not liable for expenses which a person \nincurs in bringing an action under this subsection.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall \napply to all actions commenced under chapter 43 of title 38, United \nStates Code, that are not final on the date of the enactment of this \nAct. In the case of any such action, the court shall, upon motion of a \nparty, substitute parties to the action so that such action may proceed \nin accordance with section 4323 of such title, as amended by subsection \n(a) of this section."
