FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Hours after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, \n        Imperial Japanese forces launched an attack on the Philippines, \n        cutting off vital lines of communication to members of the \n        Armed Forces of the United States (referred to in this Act as \n        the ``Armed Forces'') and Filipino troops in the Far East under \n        the command of General Douglas MacArthur.\n            (2) On December 8, 1941, the 200th Coast Artillery \n        Regiment, successors to the New Mexico National Guardsmen who \n        made up part of the famed ``Rough Riders'' of the Spanish-\n        American War, were the ``first to fire''.\n            (3) Despite being cut off from supply lines and \n        reinforcements, members of the Armed Forces and Philippine \n        troops quickly executed a plan to delay the Japanese invasion \n        and defend the Philippines against that invasion.\n            (4) By April 1942, troops from the United States and the \n        Philippines had bravely and staunchly fought off enemy attacks \n        in Bataan for more than 4 months under strenuous conditions \n        that resulted in widespread starvation and disease.\n            (5) By maintaining their position and engaging the enemy \n        for as long as they did, the troops at Bataan were able to \n        change the momentum of the war, delaying the Japanese timetable \n        to take control of the Southeast Pacific for needed war \n        materials. Because of the heroic actions of the defenders of \n        Bataan, members of the Armed Forces and other Allied forces \n        throughout the Pacific had time to regroup and prepare for the \n        successful liberation of the Pacific and the Philippines.\n            (6) On April 9, 1942, Major General Edward King, whose \n        troops suffered from starvation and a lack of supplies, \n        surrendered the soldiers from the United States and the \n        Philippines into enemy hands.\n            (7) Over the next week, troops from the Armed Forces and \n        the Philippines were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 \n        miles without any food, water, or medical care in what came to \n        be known as the ``Bataan Death March''.\n            (8) During this forced march, thousands of soldiers died, \n        either from starvation, lack of medical care, sheer exhaustion, \n        or abuse by their captors.\n            (9) Conditions at the prisoner of war camps were appalling, \n        leading to increased disease and malnutrition among the \n        prisoners.\n            (10) The prisoners at Camp O'Donnell died at a rate of \n        nearly 400 per day because of the poor conditions of the camp.\n            (11) On June 6, 1942, the prisoners at Camp O'Donnell were \n        transferred to Camp Cabanatuan, north of Camp O'Donnell.\n            (12) Nearly 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino prisoners of war \n        died at Camp O'Donnell and survivors were gradually paroled \n        from September through December 1942.\n            (13) Between September of 1942 and December of 1944, \n        prisoners of war from the Armed Forces who had survived the \n        horrific death march were shipped north for forced labor aboard \n        ``hell ships'' and succumbed in great numbers because of the \n        abysmal conditions. Many of those ships were mistakenly \n        targeted by Allied naval forces because the Japanese military \n        convoys were not properly labeled as carrying prisoners of war. \n        The sinking of the Arisan Maru alone claimed nearly 1,800 lives \n        of members of the Armed Forces.\n            (14) The prisoners who remained in the camps suffered from \n        continued mistreatment, malnutrition, lack of medical care, and \n        horrific conditions until they were liberated in 1945.\n            (15) The veterans of Bataan represented the best of the \n        United States and the Philippines, hailed from various locales \n        across both countries, and represented true diversity.\n            (16) Over the subsequent decades, the veterans of Bataan \n        formed support groups, were honored in local and State \n        memorials, and told their stories to all people of the United \n        States.\n            (17) The United States Navy has continued to honor the \n        history and stories of the veterans of Bataan by naming 2 ships \n        after the battle, including 1 ship that is still in service, \n        the USS Bataan (LHD-5), in memory of their valor and honorable \n        resistance against Imperial Japanese forces.\n            (18) Many of the survivors of Bataan have died and those \n        who remain continue to tell their stories.\n            (19) The people of the United States and the Philippines \n        are forever indebted to these men for--\n                    (A) the courage and tenacity they demonstrated \n                during the first 4 months of World War II fighting \n                against enemy soldiers; and\n                    (B) the perseverance they demonstrated during 3 \n                years of capture, imprisonment, and atrocious \n                conditions, while maintaining dignity, honor, \n                patriotism, and loyalty.\n\nSEC. 2.
