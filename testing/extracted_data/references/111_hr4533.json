    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Technology Bill of Rights for the \nBlind Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Rapid advances in microchip and digital technology have \n        led to increasingly complex user interfaces for everyday \n        products like consumer electronic devices, home appliances, and \n        office technology devices. Many new devices in these categories \n        require user interaction with visual displays, on-screen menus, \n        touch screens, and other interfaces that are inaccessible to \n        blind or low-vision individuals. Rarely, for example, are \n        settings on televisions, home stereo systems, or dishwashers \n        controlled by knobs, switches, or buttons that can be readily \n        identified and whose settings can be easily discerned with or \n        without the addition of tactile markings by the consumer.\n            (2) The use of inaccessible interfaces on office equipment \n        such as copiers and fax machines makes these devices unusable \n        by the blind, and many office software packages are either \n        substantially or totally inaccessible to blind people who use \n        assistive technology. This lack of access is a potential threat \n        to a blind person's existing job and a barrier to obtaining a \n        new job.\n            (3) Increasingly, electronic kiosks are being used to sell \n        consumer goods and services, including tickets for public \n        transit and air transportation, and to provide important public \n        information. If a kiosk is not accessible in a nonvisual \n        manner, a blind person has no way to make a purchase, check in \n        for a flight, or access important public information.\n            (4) This growing threat to the independence and \n        productivity of blind people is unnecessary because electronic \n        devices can easily be constructed with user interfaces that are \n        not exclusively visual. Text-to-speech technology has become \n        inexpensive and is in wider use than ever before. It is used in \n        everything from automated telephone systems to weather \n        broadcasts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration. Additionally, office software can be designed \n        to work with screen access technology used by the blind at \n        little or no extra cost as long as such compatibility is taken \n        into consideration at the beginning of the design process.\n            (5) Some manufacturers have incorporated nonvisual \n        technology into their products by creating talking menus or \n        enabling them to articulate the content on the display, a \n        practice that makes such products more usable by all consumers, \n        whether blind or sighted. For example, Apple, Inc., has \n        incorporated innovative nonvisual interfaces into the latest \n        versions of its iPhone and iPod product lines.\n            (6) There is no reason why all manufacturers cannot produce \n        electronic devices fully accessible to blind and low-vision \n        individuals.\n            (7) Text-to-speech technology is not the only mechanism by \n        which consumer electronic devices, electronic kiosks, home \n        appliances, and office technology devices can be made \n        accessible to blind and low-vision individuals. In some cases, \n        tactile markings or audible tones may be sufficient to make \n        such devices fully accessible.\n            (8) Blind and low-vision individuals should be able to \n        obtain and operate consumer electronic devices, electronic \n        kiosks, home appliances, and office technology devices with the \n        same ease as those with normal vision.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY AND REPORT ON ACCESS TO COVERED DEVICES BY BLIND \n              CONSUMERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall conduct a study on methods by \nwhich blind consumers can gain nonvisual access to covered devices.\n    (b) Research and Consultation.--In conducting the study required by \nsubsection (a), the Secretary shall--\n            (1) review all available research on methods by which blind \n        consumers can gain nonvisual access to covered devices;\n            (2) commission such additional research as the Secretary \n        considers necessary;\n            (3) consult with groups representing blind consumers; and\n            (4) consult with manufacturers of covered devices and \n        organizations that represent such manufacturers.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment \nof this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the \nfindings of the study required by subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4. MINIMUM NONVISUAL ACCESS STANDARDS FOR COVERED DEVICES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the submission of \nthe report under section 3(c), the Secretary shall promulgate a minimum \nnonvisual access standard for each type of covered device that will \nensure nonvisual access to such respective type of device by blind \nconsumers.\n    (b) Effective Date.--A minimum nonvisual access standard shall \napply to a covered device that is manufactured after the date that is 2 \nyears after the date on which such standard is promulgated.\n\nSEC. 5. OFFICE OF NONVISUAL ACCESS COMPLIANCE.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--As soon as practicable but not later than 2 \nyears after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \nestablish an Office of Nonvisual Access Compliance.
