FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Direct Student Loan Program will result in \n        an increase of at least 500 full-time equivalent employees at \n        the United States Department of Education and the hiring of \n        over 15,000 Federal contract employees, assuming full \n        implementation of the program.\n            (2) The involvement of private sector financial \n        institutions and not-for-profit corporations chartered for the \n        purpose of providing or supporting Federal student assistance \n        results in increased efficiency, maintenance of quality of \n        service to students and institutions, and innovation in and the \n        use of modern data processing technology.\n            (3) The Federal Family Education Loan Program is subject to \n        excessive regulation resulting in burdensome administrative \n        requirements for students, schools, and other program \n        participants, the reduction of which would ease administrative \n        burdens and improve program management.\n            (4) The program costs of the Federal Direct Student Loan \n        program are inaccurately reflected under the provisions of the \n        Federal Credit Reform Act due to the exclusion of accounting \n        for certain administrative costs associated with the program \n        under that Act.\n            (5) The budget scoring of Federal student loans under the \n        Federal Credit Reform Act led to projections of savings which \n        are highly unlikely to occur in reality for the Federal Direct \n        Student Loan Program.\n\n TITLE I--REFORMS TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE FEDERAL CREDIT REFORM \n   ACT WITH RESPECT TO BUDGET SCORING THE COST OF THE FEDERAL DIRECT \n                          STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM\n\nSEC. 101.
