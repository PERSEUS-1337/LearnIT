FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast States of \n        Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama on August 29, 2005.\n            (2) An estimated 1,000,000 Americans from the Gulf Coast \n        were forced to flee their homes as a result of Hurricane \n        Katrina.\n            (3) Many of the displaced victims of Hurricane Katrina are \n        currently residing in shelters across the country, including in \n        Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Wisconsin, Arkansas, \n        Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, and other States.\n            (4) Many of these shelters, including Kelly USA in San \n        Antonio and the Astrodome in Houston, are only intended to \n        serve as temporary homes for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n            (5) In addition to the temporary shelters, Americans have \n        opened their homes to welcome the victims of Hurricane Katrina. \n        Many Americans who have opened their homes also pay expenses \n        such as food, clothing, school supplies, transportation, or \n        personal items for the benefit of those victims of Hurricane \n        Katrina residing with them.\n            (6) Due to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, many \n        Americans from the Gulf Coast cannot return to their homes for \n        many months. As a result, it is necessary to find intermediate-\n        term and long-term housing for the victims of Hurricane \n        Katrina.\n            (7) Long-term housing can be difficult to locate in certain \n        areas. In addition, locating long-term housing can be a lengthy \n        process.\n            (8) Intermediate-term housing is appropriate for the \n        victims of Hurricane Katrina until long-term housing can be \n        located.\n            (9) Opening private homes to victims of Hurricane Katrina \n        is vital to the overall effort to find intermediate-term \n        housing for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To provide incentives for Americans to open their homes \n        to fellow Americans from the Gulf Coast who were devastated by \n        Hurricane Katrina.\n            (2) To partially offset expenses paid by Americans who open \n        their homes to victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n            (3) To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \n        tax credit to partially offset the costs of food, clothing, \n        school supplies, transportation, or personal items paid by \n        Americans who house victims of Hurricane Katrina for the \n        benefit of such victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nSEC. 3.
