FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Government has historically failed to \n        adequately and systematically consider energy issues in the \n        development of foreign and national security policy.\n            (2) Energy issues should be an integral part of the foreign \n        and national security policymaking process and should be taken \n        into consideration at all stages of policy planning and \n        development.\n            (3) The United States growing dependence on foreign energy \n        supplies constrains its pursuit of a broad range of foreign \n        policy and national security goals and objectives.\n            (4) The United States growing dependence on foreign energy \n        supplies poses increased economic and military vulnerabilities.\n            (5) The United States Government is not organized \n        efficiently to manage its dependence on foreign sources of \n        energy, and a restructuring is needed to better ensure the \n        integration of the political, economic, technical, and security \n        aspects of energy policymaking through a formal interagency \n        process.\n\nSEC. 3.
