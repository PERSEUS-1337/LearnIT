FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) grants under the Brownfields Economic Development \n        Initiative of the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n        provide local governments with a flexible source of funding to \n        pursue brownfields redevelopment through land acquisition, site \n        preparation, economic development, and other activities;\n            (2) to be eligible for such grant funds, a community must \n        be willing to pledge community development block grant funds as \n        partial collateral for a loan guarantee under section 108 of \n        the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, and this \n        requirement is a barrier to many local communities that are \n        unable or unwilling to pledge such block grant funds as \n        collateral; and\n            (3) by providing grants for the economic development of \n        brownfield sites independent from section 108 loan guarantees \n        and the related pledge of community development block grant \n        funds, more communities will have access to funding for \n        redevelopment of brownfield sites.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide units of \ngeneral local government and Indian tribes with increased accessibility \nto brownfields redevelopment funds by permitting the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development to make grants for brownfields \ndevelopment independent from section 108 loan guarantees.\n\nSEC. 3.
