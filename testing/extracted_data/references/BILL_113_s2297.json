FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes the \n        crucial role of school nurses in the seamless provision of \n        comprehensive health services to children and youth, as well as \n        in the development of a coordinated school health program.\n            (2) The school nurse functions as a leader and the \n        coordinator of the school health services team, facilitating \n        access to a medical home for each child and supporting academic \n        achievement.\n            (3) School nurses promote wellness and disease prevention \n        to improve health outcomes for our Nation's children. In \n        addition, school nurses perform early intervention services \n        such as periodic assessments for vision, hearing, and dental \n        problems, in an effort to remove barriers to learning.\n            (4) Recent national data indicates 45 percent of public \n        schools have a school nurse all day, every day, while another \n        30 percent of schools have a school nurse who works part time \n        in one or more schools.\n            (5) The American Nurses Association has reported that when \n        there is no registered nurse on the school premises, the \n        responsibility to administer the necessary medications and \n        treatments, and appropriate monitoring of the children, falls \n        on the shoulders of administrators, educators, and staff who \n        are ill-prepared to perform these tasks.\n            (6) Statistics from the National Center for Education \n        Statistics indicate that 15 to 18 percent of the 52,000,000 \n        students who currently spend their day in school have a chronic \n        health condition.\n            (7) A recent study indicated that from 2002 to 2008, the \n        percentage of children in special education with health \n        impairments, due to chronic or acute health problems, increased \n        by 60 percent. School nurses use their specialized knowledge, \n        assessment skills, and judgment to manage children's \n        increasingly complex medical conditions and chronic health \n        illnesses.\n            (8) Among adolescents aged 12 to 19 years old, the \n        prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes increased from 9 percent \n        to 23 percent between 1999 and 2008. More than 30 percent of \n        children aged 2 to 19 years old are obese or overweight \n        (defined as having a body mass index of greater than the 85th \n        percentile). In 2008, more than 10,000,000 children in the \n        United States had asthma. The prevalence of food allergies \n        among children under the age of 18 increased 19 percent from \n        1997 to 2007.\n            (9) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, \n        students today face increased social and emotional issues, \n        which enhance the need for preventive services and \n        interventions for acute and chronic health issues. School \n        nurses are actively engaged members of school-based mental \n        health teams and spend nearly 32 percent of their time \n        providing mental health services, including universal and \n        targeted interventions, screenings to identify early warning \n        signs and provide referrals to medical providers, and crisis \n        planning.\n            (10) In 2011, the Bureau of the Census reported 9.7 percent \n        of children under the age of 19, which equals 7,600,000 \n        children under the age of 19, were without health insurance. \n        Data shows that uninsured children achieve lower educational \n        outcomes than those with health coverage. Children who cannot \n        afford to see a medical provider miss more days of school, \n        experience increased severity of illness, and suffer from \n        disparities in health.\n            (11) More than 1,600,000 children experience homelessness \n        each year in the United States. Homeless children develop \n        increased rates of acute and chronic health conditions, and the \n        stress of their living situation can negatively affect their \n        development and ability to learn. As a result, schools have \n        become the primary access to health care for many children and \n        adolescents. School nurses serve on the front lines as a safety \n        net for the Nation's most vulnerable children.\n            (12) Communicable and infectious diseases account for \n        millions of school days lost each year. Data illustrate that \n        when students have access to a registered nurse in school, \n        immunization rates increase.\n            (13) A 2011 study showed that a school nurse in the \n        building saves principals, teachers, and clerical staff a \n        considerable amount of time that they would have spent \n        addressing health concerns of students, including saving \n        principals almost an hour a day, saving teachers almost 20 \n        minutes a day, and saving clerical staff more than 45 minutes a \n        day. This would amount to a savings of about 13 hours per day \n        in the aggregate for such school personnel.\n            (14) Determining a balanced student-to-school nurse ratio \n        by using a formula-based approach, taking into consideration \n        the overall health acuity of the student body and the workload \n        of school nurses, offers a reasonable means for achieving \n        better student outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3.
