AWARD OF PURPLE HEART TO MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES KILLED \n              OR WOUNDED IN TERRORIST ATTACKS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Final Report of the National Commission on \n        Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as the \n        ``9/11 Commission Report'') recognizes that there is a certain \n        ideology that gives rise to terrorism.\n            (2) This ideology that gives rise to terrorism can even \n        influence citizens and residents of the United States to \n        perpetrate attacks within the United States against members of \n        the Armed Forces.\n            (3) Two such attacks have already occurred within the \n        United States, one at a recruiting station in Little Rock, \n        Arkansas, on June 1, 2009, and one at Fort Hood, Texas, on \n        November 5, 2009.\n            (4) According to investigative reports released by the \n        Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives \n        and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n        of the Senate at least 33 threats, plots, and strikes related \n        to domestic terrorism against United States military \n        communities have been uncovered since September 11, 2001.\n            (5) These threats, plots, and strikes demonstrate that \n        members of the Armed Forces are at risk of terrorist attack not \n        only when deployed overseas, but also while stationed within \n        the United States.\n            (6) The Department of Defense has recognized the threat \n        posed by terrorist attacks, including those perpetrated by a \n        member of the Armed Forces, by issuing revised regulations, \n        including Army Regulation 381-12 regarding the Military \n        Intelligence Threat Awareness and Reporting Program, to require \n        reporting of potential terrorist insider threat activity, \n        including when a member of the Armed Forces is ``advocating the \n        use of unlawful violence or force to achieve goals that are \n        political, religious, or ideological in nature''.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nSecretary of Defense (and the Secretary of Homeland Security with \nrespect to the Coast Guard) should duly honor those members of the \nArmed Forces who are killed or wounded in terrorist attacks within the \nUnited States that are inspired by the ideology that gives rise to \nterrorism, as defined by the Final Report of the National Commission on \nTerrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as the ``9/11 \nCommission Report'').\n    (c) Award of Purple Heart.--\n            (1) Award required.--Chapter 57 of title 10, United States \n        Code, is amended by inserting after section 1129 the following \n        new section:\n``Sec. 1129a.
