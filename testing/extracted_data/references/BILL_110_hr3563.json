FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Prostate cancer has reached epidemic proportions, \n        particularly among African-American men, and strikes and kills \n        men in numbers comparable to the number of women who lose their \n        lives from breast cancer.\n            (2) Life-saving breakthroughs in screening, diagnosis, and \n        treatment of breast cancer resulted from the development of \n        advanced imaging technologies led by the Federal Government.\n            (3) Men should have accurate and affordable prostate cancer \n        screening exams and minimally-invasive treatment tools, similar \n        to what women have for breast cancer.\n            (4) While it is important for men to take advantage of \n        current prostate cancer screening techniques, a recent NCI-\n        funded study demonstrated that the most common available \n        methods of detecting prostate cancer (PSA blood test and \n        physical exams) are not foolproof, causing numerous false \n        alarms and false reassurances.\n            (5) The absence of advanced imaging technologies for \n        prostate cancer causes the lack of accurate information \n        critical for clinical decisions, resulting in missed cancers \n        and lost lives, as well as unnecessary and costly medical \n        procedures, with related complications.\n            (6) With prostate imaging tools, men and their families \n        would face less physical, psychological, financial and \n        emotional trauma and billions of dollars could be saved in \n        private and public health care systems.\n\nSEC. 3. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER IMAGING \n              TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n    (a) Expansion of Research.--The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary''), acting through \nthe Director of the National Institutes of Health and the Administrator \nof the Health Resources and Services Administration, and in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall carry out a program \nto expand and intensify research to develop innovative advanced imaging \ntechnologies for prostate cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment \ncomparable to state-of-the-art mammography technologies.\n    (b) Early Stage Research.--In implementing the program under \nsubsection (a), the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration, shall carry out a grant \nprogram to encourage the early stages of research in prostate imaging \nto develop and implement new ideas, proof of concepts, and pilot \nstudies for high-risk technologic innovation in prostate cancer imaging \nthat would have a high potential impact for improving patient care, \nincluding individualized care, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.\n    (c) Large Scale Later Stage Research.--In implementing the program \nunder subsection (a), the Secretary, acting through the Director of the \nNational Institutes of Health, shall utilize the National Institute of \nBiomedical Imaging and Bioengineering and the National Cancer Institute \nfor advanced stages of research in prostate imaging, including \ntechnology development and clinical trials for projects determined by \nthe Secretary to have demonstrated promising preliminary results and \nproof of concept.\n    (d) Interdisciplinary Private-Public Partnerships.--In developing \nthe program under subsection (a), the Secretary, through the \nAdministrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, \nshall establish interdisciplinary private-public partnerships to \ndevelop and implement research strategies for expedited innovation in \nimaging and image-guided treatment and to conduct such research.\n    (e) Racial Disparities.--In developing the program under subsection \n(a), the Secretary shall recognize and address--\n            (1) the racial disparities in the incidences of prostate \n        cancer and mortality rates with respect to such disease; and\n            (2) any barriers in access to care and participation in \n        clinical trials that are specific to racial minorities.\n    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), there is \n        authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section, \n        $100,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n            (2) Specific allocations.--Of the amount authorized to be \n        appropriated under paragraph (1) for each of the fiscal years \n        described in such paragraph--\n                    (A) no less than 10 percent may be appropriated to \n                carry out the grant program under subsection (b); and\n                    (B) no more than 1 percent may be appropriated to \n                carry out subsection (d).\n\nSEC. 4. PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGN.\n\n    (a) National Campaign.--The Secretary shall carry out a national \ncampaign to increase the awareness and knowledge of Americans with \nrespect to the need for prostate cancer screening and for improved \ndetection technologies.\n    (b) Requirements.--The national campaign conducted under subsection \n(a) shall include--\n            (1) roles for the Health Resources Services Administration, \n        the Office on Minority Health of the Department of Health and \n        Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n        and the Office of Minority Health of the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention; and\n            (2) the development and distribution of written educational \n        materials, and the development and placing of public service \n        announcements, that are intended to encourage men to seek \n        prostate cancer screening and to create awareness of the need \n        for improved imaging technologies for prostate cancer screening \n        and diagnosis, including in vitro blood testing and imaging \n        technologies.\n    (c) Racial Disparities.--In developing the national campaign under \nsubsection (a), the Secretary shall recognize and address--\n            (1) the racial disparities in the incidences of prostate \n        cancer and mortality rates with respect to such disease; and\n            (2) any barriers in access to care and participation in \n        clinical trials that are specific to racial minorities.\n    (d) Grants.--The Secretary shall establish a program to award \ngrants to nonprofit private entities to enable such entities to test \nalternative outreach and education strategies to increase the awareness \nand knowledge of Americans with respect to the need for prostate cancer \nscreening and improved imaging technologies.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section, $10,000,000 for each of the \nfiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n\nSEC. 5.
