FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Occupational Safety and Health \n        Administration, some 2 million American workers are victims of \n        job-related violence each year.\n            (2) On August 17, 2004, Teri Zenner, a social worker and \n        case manager with Johnson County Mental Health Center, was \n        stabbed and killed during a routine, in-home visit with a \n        client.\n            (3) Based on OSHA's most recently published ``Guidelines \n        for Preventing Workplace Violence for Health Care & Social \n        Service Workers'', 48 percent of all non-fatal injuries from \n        occupational assaults and violent acts occurred in the fields \n        of health care and social services.\n            (4) A major study by the American Federation of State, \n        County, and Municipal Employees, found that 70 percent of \n        front-line child welfare workers had been victims of violence \n        or threats in the line of duty. A review of the 585 exit \n        interviews found that 90 percent of former child welfare \n        workers experienced verbal threats, 30 percent experienced \n        physical attacks, and 13 percent had been threatened with \n        weapons.\n            (6) Based on 2000 Bureau of Labor Statistics findings, \n        social service workers in the public sector, including social \n        workers and case workers, are approximately 7 times more likely \n        to be the victims of violent assaults while at work than are \n        workers in the private sector.\n            (7) States such as California, New Jersey, and Washington, \n        and the National Association of Social Workers, have all \n        developed various safety programs with safety guidelines for \n        social workers and case workers to follow while in the course \n        of their employment;\n            (8) Social workers and case workers elevate service to \n        others above self-interest, and draw on their knowledge, values \n        and skills to help people in need and to address social \n        problems. Job-related violence against social workers and case \n        workers affects these hard-working and dedicated individuals, \n        their families, their clients, and their communities throughout \n        the United States;\n            (9) There is a need to increase public awareness and \n        understanding of job-related violence in the field of social \n        services and to meet the needs of social workers and case \n        workers in preventing such violence. Although not every \n        incident of job-related violence can be prevented, many can, \n        and the severity of injuries sustained by social workers and \n        case workers can be reduced.\n\nSEC. 3.
