FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The tireless and passionate efforts of the suffragists, \n        their supporters, and other stakeholders contributed to the \n        movement to grant and protect the right of all women to vote.\n            (2) On August 26, 1920, after a long campaign by \n        suffragists across the country, the United States Constitution \n        was amended with the 19th Amendment, granting women the right \n        to vote.\n            (3) On June 24, 1924, all Native Americans were granted \n        citizenship, and by extension the right to vote.\n            (4) In 1948, the legal victories of Native American \n        veterans granted protections for the right of all Native men \n        and women to vote.\n            (5) On June 27, 1952, the Immigration and Nationality Act \n        of 1952 was enacted, granting citizenship to all individuals of \n        Asian descent, and by extension, the right to vote.\n            (6) Enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on August 6, \n        1965, granted Black women protections to overcome the legal \n        barriers that prevented many from exercising their right to \n        vote even though all Blacks had been granted citizenship in \n        1868 with ratification of the 14th Amendment.\n            (7) On August 6, 1975, the amendments to the \n        reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 removed \n        language barriers to mitigate discrimination against Hispanic, \n        Asian, and Native American voters.\n            (8) It was not until March 29, 1961, when the 23rd \n        Amendment passed that women in Washington, DC, were allowed to \n        vote in all elections.\n            (9) Women's history and the movement for women's rights \n        that the suffragists began extends beyond ratification of the \n        Nineteenth Amendment.\n            (10) August 26, 2020, marks the centennial of the day that \n        women were granted the right to vote in America.\n\nSEC. 3.
