FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Cape Fox Corporation (Cape Fox) is an Alaska Native \n        Village Corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native \n        Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) for the Native \n        Village of Saxman.\n            (2) As with other village corporations organized pursuant \n        to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in southeast Alaska, \n        Cape Fox was limited to selecting 23,040 acres under section 16 \n        of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.\n            (3) Except for Cape Fox, all other village corporations \n        organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n        in southeast Alaska were restricted from selecting land within \n        two miles of a home rule city.\n            (4) To protect the watersheds in the vicinity of Ketchikan, \n        Cape Fox was restricted from selecting land within six miles of \n        the boundary of the home rule City of Ketchikan under section \n        22(l) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. \n        1621(l)).\n            (5) The six mile restriction damaged Cape Fox by precluding \n        the corporation from selecting valuable timber land, industrial \n        sites, and other commercial property, not only in its core \n        township but in surrounding land far removed from Ketchikan and \n        its watershed.\n            (6) As a result of the six mile restriction, only the \n        remote mountainous northeast corner of Cape Fox's core \n        township, which is nonproductive and of no known economic \n        value, was available for selection by the corporation. \n        Selection of this parcel was, however, mandated by section \n        16(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. \n        1615(b)).\n            (7) Cape Fox's land selections were further limited by the \n        fact that the Annette Island Indian Reservation is within its \n        selection area, and those lands were unavailable for selection \n        under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Cape Fox is the \n        only village corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska \n        Native Claims Settlement Act affected by this restriction.\n            (8) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n        land under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act requires \n        adjustment of Sealaska Corporation's (Sealaska) selections and \n        conveyances to avoid creation of additional split estate \n        between National Forest System surface land and Sealaska \n        subsurface land.\n            (9) There is an additional need to resolve existing areas \n        of Sealaska/Tongass split estate, in which Sealaska holds title \n        or conveyance rights to several thousand acres of subsurface \n        land that encumber management of Tongass National Forest \n        surface land.\n            (10) The Tongass National Forest land identified in this \n        Act for selection by and conveyance to Cape Fox and Sealaska, \n        subject to valid existing rights, provides a means to resolve \n        some of the Cape Fox and Sealaska Alaska Native Claims \n        Settlement Act land entitlement issues without significantly \n        affecting Tongass National Forest resources, uses, or values.\n            (11) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n        land under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act through the \n        provisions of this Act, and the related adjustment of \n        Sealaska's selections and conveyances hereunder, are in \n        accordance with the purposes of the Alaska Native Claims \n        Settlement Act and otherwise in the public interest.\n\nSEC. 3. WAIVER OF CORE TOWNSHIP REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN LAND.\n\n    Notwithstanding section 16(b) of the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act (43 U.S. C. 1615(b)), Cape Fox shall not be required to \nselect or receive conveyance of the approximately 160 acres of Federal \nunconveyed land within section 1, T. 75 S., R. 91 E., C.R.M.\n\n SEC. 4. SELECTION AND CONVEYANCE OUTSIDE EXTERIOR SELECTION BOUNDARY.\n\n    (a) Selection of Surface Estate.--\n            (1) In general.--In addition to land made available for \n        selection under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, not \n        later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n        Cape Fox may select the approximately 99 acres of the surface \n        estate of Tongass National Forest land outside Cape Fox's \n        current exterior selection boundary described in paragraph (2).\n            (2) Land description.--The land referred to in paragraph \n        (a) is described as follows:\n                    T. 73 S., R. 90 E., C.R.M.\n                    Section 33: SW portion of SE 1/4: 38 acres.\n                    Section 33: NW portion of SE 1/4: 13 acres.\n                    Section 33: SE 1/4 of SE 1/4: 40 acres.\n                    Section 33: SE 1/4 of SW 1/4: 8 acres.\n    (b) Conveyance of Subsurface Estate.--Upon conveyance to Cape Fox \nof the surface estate to the land described in subsection (a)(2), the \nSecretary of the Interior shall convey to Sealaska the subsurface \nestate to that land.\n    (c) Timing.--The Secretary of the Interior shall complete the \nconveyances to Cape Fox and Sealaska under this section not later than \n180 days after the Secretary of the Interior receives written notice of \nthe Cape Fox selection under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 5.
