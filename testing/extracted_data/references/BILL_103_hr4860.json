IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COLLECTION OF UNITED STATES TAXES OWED BY \n              FOREIGN PERSONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) foreign-controlled corporations doing business in the \n        United States do not pay their fair share of taxes;\n            (2) up to 72 percent of foreign-controlled corporations \n        doing business in the United States pay no Federal income tax;\n            (3) the Internal Revenue Service has limited its own \n        ability to enforce Federal tax laws against foreign-controlled \n        corporations, to the detriment of domestic taxpayers;\n            (4) the Internal Revenue Service has been using antiquated \n        accounting concepts to deal with sophisticated multinational \n        corporations;\n            (5) billions of dollars of Federal revenues are lost \n        annually due to the inability of the Internal Revenue Service \n        to enforce the ``arm's length'' transaction rule--not even \n        counting the costs of bureaucracy and litigation;\n            (6) current procedures of the Internal Revenue Service are \n        insufficient for ensuring that a foreigner who is not a \n        resident of a foreign country does not take advantage of the \n        treaty benefits of that country; and\n            (7) current regulations and other positions adopted by the \n        Internal Revenue Service may permit foreign persons to avoid \n        United States taxes by utilizing derivative financial products \n        which replicate the economic features of United States taxable \n        investments.\n    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that \ndeficit reduction should be achieved, in part, by eliminating \nenforcement breakdowns that now enable foreign-controlled corporations \noperating in the United States, and foreign persons investing in the \nUnited States, to pay no taxes, including--\n            (1) a more streamlined and efficient method of enforcing \n        Federal tax laws involving multinational corporations, \n        especially those based abroad; in particular, the use of a \n        formula approach by the Treasury Department where the ``arm's \n        length'' transaction rule does not work; and\n            (2) the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's \n        delegate shall, no later than December 31, 1994, prescribe \n        regulations which--\n                    (A) establish certification, refund, or other \n                procedures which ensure that any treaty benefit \n                relating to withholding of tax under sections 1441 and \n                1442 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is available \n                only to persons entitled to the benefit, and\n                    (B) prevent the avoidance of withholding of tax \n                under such sections by use of derivative financial \n                instruments, including regulations providing for the \n                sourcing of income of foreign residents from notional \n                principal contracts as income from sources within the \n                United States in appropriate cases."
