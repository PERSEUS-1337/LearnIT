Upon receipt of a request to transfer the award to a tuition or fee charging qualifying institution, the individual shall be eligible to receive the Cal Grant A award previously held in reserve if, at the time of the request, he or she meets all of the requirements of this article. Upon receipt of the request, the commission shall reassess the financial need of the award recipient.
