FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Since the 1990s, the United States has achieved and \n        maintained high levels of childhood immunization, yet certain \n        problems persist within the national immunization system. Data \n        from the Centers for Disease Control indicate the following:\n                    (A) Immunization coverage rates among adults are \n                well below those achieved among children.\n                    (B) Significant racial and ethnic disparities exist \n                between coverage rates among adults.\n                    (C) Many at-risk adults are not getting the \n                vaccines they need to prevent diseases such as \n                influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia and hepatitis B.\n            (2) Vaccine-preventable diseases in adults cause a \n        staggering number of deaths and illnesses each year. Research \n        shows that the following applies each year in the United \n        States:\n                    (A) 200,000 individuals are hospitalized due to \n                influenza complications and approximately 36,000 will \n                die.\n                    (B) 33,000 people suffer from invasive pneumococcal \n                disease and 5,000 will die.\n                    (C) 80,000 individuals become newly infected with \n                hepatitis B, and of these 5,000 will die.\n                    (D) Pneumonia and influenza together are the sixth \n                leading cause of death among older adults.\n            (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        (``CDC'') estimates that the overall cost to the Nation from \n        these vaccine-preventable diseases of adults exceeds $10 \n        billion per year.\n            (4) Recommended adult immunizations are cost effective and \n        would produce significant savings for the health care system of \n        the United States. According to current research and CDC \n        statistics:\n                    (A) Influenza vaccine saves $14.71 per person \n                vaccinated between the ages of 18 and 63.\n                    (B) Influenza vaccine saves $182 in medical costs \n                for each person vaccinated aged 65 or over.\n                    (C) Pneumococcal vaccine saves $8.87 in medical \n                costs per person vaccinated aged 65 or over.\n                    (D) Hepatitis B vaccine saves $100 million in \n                medical costs for every 1 million high-risk adults \n                vaccinated.\n            (5) The shortage of influenza vaccine for the 2004-2005 \n        season revealed a number of weaknesses in the adult \n        immunization infrastructure in the United States: insufficient \n        vaccine to meet demand; uneven distribution of vaccine; and \n        impaired abilities to administer vaccine to those in greatest \n        need. Such problems undermine public health and confidence in \n        the public health system, create confusion and uncertainty, and \n        destabilize the vaccine market place.\n            (6) These deficiencies in adult immunization in the United \n        States are further exacerbated by decreasing Federal and State \n        resources for immunizations:\n                    (A) The Federal budget for immunizations has \n                decreased over the last five years, shifting more of \n                the immunization infrastructural costs to states \n                already facing budget shortfalls.\n                    (B) With most currently available State and Federal \n                immunization resources directed toward childhood \n                immunization, adult immunization policies and programs \n                are increasingly at risk.\n                    (C) The diminishing resource base compromises the \n                abilities of State health departments to collect data \n                about adult immunization, assess immunization rates and \n                conduct and implement strategic planning to protect \n                adults from vaccine-preventable diseases.\n            (7) There is, therefore, a vital need to enhance the \n        Nation's efforts to protect adults against vaccine-preventable \n        diseases. Establishing a strong and effective adult \n        immunization infrastructure in the Unites States makes good \n        sense:\n                    (A) From a public health perspective it will better \n                prepare the health care system for an anticipated \n                influenza pandemic.\n                    (B) From a homeland security preparedness stance it \n                will enable the public health community to respond more \n                quickly and effectively to biological threats.\n                    (C) From a biomedical standpoint it will encourage \n                American adults to capitalize on newly developed \n                vaccines for other diseases such as cervical cancer and \n                shingles.\n            (8) There are proven ways to bolster the adult immunization \n        system:\n                    (A) Rigorous studies have shown that removing \n                financial barriers increases vaccination rates among \n                adults.\n                    (B) Measuring how well providers deliver \n                immunizations increases vaccination rates.\n                    (C) Existing performance measurement systems are \n                excellent incentives to ensure that health care workers \n                are immunized against infectious diseases that could \n                potentially spread to vulnerable patients.\n                    (D) Health education campaigns are proven ways to \n                positively impact immunization behaviors.\n\nSEC. 3. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION; PROGRAM FOR \n              INCREASING IMMUNIZATION RATES FOR ADULTS.\n\n    (a) Activities of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.--\nSection 317(j) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247b(j)) is \namended by adding at the end the following paragraphs:\n    ``(3)(A) For the purpose of carrying out activities toward \nincreasing immunization rates for adults through the immunization \nprogram under this subsection, and for the purpose of carrying out \nsubsection (k)(2), there are authorized to be appropriated $75,000,000 \nfor fiscal year 2006, and such sums as may be necessary for each of the \nfiscal years 2007 through 2010. Such authorization is in addition to \namounts available under paragraphs (1) and (2) for such purposes.\n    ``(B) In expending amounts appropriated under subparagraph (A), the \nSecretary shall give priority to adults who are medically underserved \nand are at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases.\n    ``(C) The purposes for which amounts appropriated under \nsubparagraph (A) are available include (with respect to immunizations \nfor adults) payment of the costs of storing vaccines, outreach \nactivities to inform individuals of the availability of the \nimmunizations, and other program expenses necessary for the \nestablishment or operation of immunization programs carried out or \nsupported by States or other public entities pursuant to this \nsubsection.\n    ``(D)(i) Of the amounts appropriated under subparagraph (A), the \nSecretary may, for three consecutive fiscal years during the fiscal \nyears 2006 through 2010, reserve in the aggregate for such three years \nnot more than $25,000,000 to make grants to not more than four States \nfor the purpose of carrying out demonstration projects to provide \nimmunizations against influenza to individuals who are in the age group \n19 through 64, are uninsured with respect to such vaccine, and are at \nhigh risk with respect to influenza.\n    ``(ii) In making grants pursuant to clause (i), the Secretary shall \ngive preference to any State that--\n            ``(I) has a low rate of adult immunizations for influenza \n        and pneumococcus among populations that are at high risk with \n        respect to such diseases; or\n            ``(II) has a racial or ethnic minority group for which \n        there is a significant disparity in the rate of adult \n        immunizations for influenza and pneumococcus as compared to the \n        general population of the State.\n    ``(iii) A grant may be made pursuant to clause (i) only if the \nState involved agrees that, before the demonstration project under such \nclause begins providing immunizations, the State will, for purposes of \ndetermining the effects of the project, make an estimate of the rate of \nimmunizations with influenza vaccine in the population that will be \nserved by the project.\n    ``(iv) Upon the request of a State that will carry out a \ndemonstration project under clause (i), the Secretary shall provide \ntechnical assistance to the State with respect to making the estimate \ndescribed in clause (iii) and with respect to identifying intervention \nand comparison sites for the project.\n    ``(v) For purposes of this subparagraph:\n            ``(I) An individual shall be considered to be uninsured \n        with respect to influenza vaccine if the individual does not \n        have benefits with respect to the cost of such vaccine under a \n        health insurance policy or plan (including a group health plan, \n        a prepaid health plan, or an employee welfare benefit plan \n        under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974).\n            ``(II) With respect to influenza, an individual shall be \n        considered to be at high risk if the individual meets the high-\n        risk criteria identified by the Advisory Committee on \n        Immunization Practices (an advisory committee established by \n        the Secretary).\n    ``(4)(A) The Secretary shall annually submit to the Congress a \nreport that--\n                    ``(i) evaluates the extent to which the \n                immunization system in the United States has been \n                effective in providing for adequate immunization rates \n                for adults, taking into account the applicable year \n                2010 health objectives established by the Secretary \n                regarding the health status of the people of the United \n                States;
