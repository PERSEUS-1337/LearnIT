FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n            (1) National importance.--Community health centers serve as \n        the medical home and family physician to over 16,000,000 people \n        nationally. Patients of community health centers represent 1 in \n        7 low-income persons, 1 in 8 uninsured Americans, 1 in 9 \n        Medicaid beneficiaries, 1 in 10 minorities, and 1 in 10 rural \n        residents.\n            (2) Health care safety net.--Because Federally qualified \n        health centers (FQHCs) are generally located in medically \n        underserved areas, the patients of Federally qualified health \n        centers are disproportionately low income, uninsured or \n        publicly insured, and minorities, and they frequently have \n        poorer health and more complicated, costly medical needs than \n        patients nationally. As a chief component of the health care \n        safety net, Federally qualified health centers are required by \n        regulation to serve all patients, regardless of insurance \n        status or ability to pay.\n            (3) Medicare beneficiaries.--Medicare beneficiaries are \n        typically less healthy and, therefore, costlier to treat than \n        other patients of Federally qualified health centers. Medicare \n        beneficiaries tend to have more complex health care needs as--\n                    (A) more than half of Medicare patients have at \n                least 2 chronic conditions;\n                    (B) 45 percent take 5 or more medications; and\n                    (C) over half of Medicare beneficiaries have more \n                than 1 prescribing physician.\n            (4) Need to improve fqhc payment.--While the Centers for \n        Medicare & Medicaid Services have nearly 15 years' worth of \n        cost report data from Federally qualified health centers, which \n        would equip the agency to develop a new Medicare reimbursement \n        system, the agency has failed to update and improve the \n        Medicare FQHC payment system.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPANSION OF MEDICARE-COVERED PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES \n              AT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1861(aa)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395x(aa)(3)) is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(3) The term `Federally qualified health center services' means--\n            ``(A) services of the type described in subparagraphs (A) \n        through (C) of paragraph (1), and such other ambulatory \n        services furnished by a Federally qualified health center for \n        which payment may otherwise be made under this title if such \n        services were furnished by a health care provider or health \n        care professional other than a Federally qualified health \n        center; and\n            ``(B) preventive primary health services that a center is \n        required to provide under section 330 of the Public Health \n        Service Act,\nwhen furnished to an individual as a patient of a Federally qualified \nhealth center and such services when provided by a health care provider \nor health care professional employed by or under contract with a \nFederally qualified health center and for this purpose, any reference \nto a rural health clinic or a physician described in paragraph (2)(B) \nis deemed a reference to a Federally qualified health center or a \nphysician at the center, respectively. Services described in the \nprevious sentence shall be treated as billable visits for purposes of \npayment to the Federally qualified health center.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment To Permit Payment for Hospital-Based \nServices.--Section 1862(a)(14) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395y(a)(14)) is \namended by inserting ``Federally qualified health center services,'' \nafter ``qualified psychologist services,''.\n    (c) Effective Dates.--The amendments made by subsections (a) and \n(b) shall apply to services furnished on or after January 1, 2008.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF A MEDICARE PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM FOR \n              FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER SERVICES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Paragraph (3) section 1833(a) of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l(a)) is amended to read as follows:\n            ``(3)(A) in the case of services described in section \n        1832(a)(2)(D)(i) the costs which are reasonable and related to \n        the furnishing of such services or which are based on such \n        other tests of reasonableness as the Secretary may prescribe in \n        regulations including those authorized under section \n        1861(v)(1)(A), less the amount a provider may charge as \n        described in clause (ii) of section 1866(a)(2)(A) but in no \n        case may the payment for such services (other than for items \n        and services described in 1861(s)(10)(A)) exceed 80 percent of \n        such costs; and\n            ``(B) in the case of services described in section \n        1832(a)(2)(D)(ii) furnished by a Federally qualified health \n        center--\n                    ``(i) subject to clauses (iii) and (iv), for \n                services furnished on and after January 1, 2008, during \n                the center's fiscal year that ends in 2008, an amount \n                (calculated on a per visit basis) that is equal to 100 \n                percent of the average of the costs of the center of \n                furnishing such services during such center's fiscal \n                years ending during 2006 and 2007 which are reasonable \n                and related to the cost of furnishing such services, or \n                which are based on such other tests of reasonableness \n                as the Secretary prescribes in regulations including \n                those authorized under section 1861(v)(1)(A) (except \n                that in calculating such cost in a center's fiscal \n                years ending during 2006 and 2007 and applying the \n                average of such cost for a center's fiscal year ending \n                during fiscal year 2008, the Secretary shall not apply \n                a per visit payment limit or productivity screen), less \n                the amount a provider may charge as described in clause \n                (ii) of section 1866(a)(2)(A), but in no case may the \n                payment for such services (other than for items or \n                services described in section 1861(s)(10)(A)) exceed 80 \n                percent of such average of such costs;\n                    ``(ii) subject to clauses (iii) and (iv), for \n                services furnished during the center's fiscal year \n                ending during 2009 or a succeeding fiscal year, an \n                amount (calculated on a per visit basis and without the \n                application of a per visit limit or productivity \n                screen) that is equal to the amount determined under \n                this subparagraph for the center's preceding fiscal \n                year (without regard to any copayment)--\n                            ``(I) increased for a center's fiscal year \n                        ending during 2009 by the percentage increase \n                        in the MEI (as defined in section 1842(i)(3)) \n                        applicable to primary care services (as defined \n                        in section 1842(i)(4)) for 2009 and increased \n                        for a center's fiscal year ending during 2010 \n                        or any succeeding fiscal year by the percentage \n                        increase for such year of a market basket of \n                        Federally qualified health center costs as \n                        developed and promulgated through regulations \n                        by the Secretary;
