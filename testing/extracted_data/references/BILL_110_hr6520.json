PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to increase global stability and \nsecurity for the United States and the international community and \ndecrease trafficking and discrimination by reducing the number of \nindividuals who are de jure or de facto stateless and as a consequence \nare unable to avail themselves of their right to a nationality and its \nconcomitant rights and obligations and are excluded from full \nparticipation in civil society.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n        offers everyone the right to a nationality.\n            (2) The right to a nationality is a foundation of human \n        rights, and a deterrent to displacement and disaffection. The \n        state is the primary vehicle through which individuals are \n        guaranteed their inalienable rights and are made subject to the \n        rule of law. Regional stability and security are undermined \n        when individuals cannot avail themselves of their right to a \n        nationality and its concomitant rights and obligations and are \n        excluded from full participation in civil society.\n            (3) In the aftermath of World War II, millions of people \n        were displaced and arbitrarily deprived of their nationalities \n        and their protection of citizenship. In the 21st century, the \n        adverse effects of de jure or de facto statelessness still \n        impact at least an estimated 11,000,000 million people \n        worldwide and require a strong commitment by the international \n        community to address this serious issue.\n            (4) The lack of citizenship or the inability to document \n        one's ties to a state often results in severe hardships and \n        discrimination, particularly the inability to pursue lawful \n        employment and a sustainable livelihood, own property, or enjoy \n        legally protected family bonds and increases the likelihood \n        that such persons may fall victim to traffickers and organized \n        criminal groups who prey on the vulnerability of unprotected de \n        jure or de facto stateless persons. The Department of State's \n        Trafficking in Persons Report for 2008 noted that stateless \n        victims of trafficking face difficulties in repatriating and in \n        accessing critical medical, social, or legal services and \n        called on the international community to give greater attention \n        to birth registration and the provision of more effective and \n        accessible avenues for the acquisition of legal residency or \n        citizenship.\n            (5) Regional security is enhanced when States effectively \n        respect the right of nationality, as this right ensures the \n        availability of peaceful means of recourse to address \n        grievances and claims, including through national, regional, or \n        international court systems.\n            (6) Countries have the sovereign right to determine \n        procedures and conditions for acquisition and termination of \n        citizenship, and exercise of this right should be linked to the \n        responsibility of preventing de jure and de facto statelessness \n        and the respect for other universal principles of human rights, \n        in particular the universal antidiscrimination norm.\n            (7) The 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless \n        Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of \n        Statelessness were adopted to regulate the legal status and \n        treatment of individuals who are de jure or de facto stateless \n        and to prevent de jure and de facto statelessness.\n            (8) At least an estimated 11,000,000 individuals worldwide \n        currently are unable to avail themselves of any effective \n        nationality or cannot fully access their rights as citizens and \n        obtain protection from a country.\n            (9) De jure or de facto statelessness can result from \n        factors including political change, targeted persecution or \n        discrimination, transfers of territory, adoption of restrictive \n        laws relating to marriage, place or registration of birth, or \n        incongruous national citizenship laws.\n            (10) Individuals who are de jure or de facto stateless are \n        unable to avail themselves of the rights of free people \n        everywhere to an effective nationality, to the rights to legal \n        residence, to travel, to work in the formal economy or \n        professions, to attend school, to access basic health services, \n        to purchase or own property, to vote, or to hold elected \n        office, and to enjoy the protection and security of a country.\n            (11) Article 24 of the International Covenant on Civil and \n        Political Rights provides that every child shall be registered \n        at birth and that every child has the right to acquire a \n        nationality.\n            (12) UNICEF leads the efforts with governments, \n        particularly in the developing world, to promote universal, \n        accessible registration and documentation of all births but is \n        hard pressed to find the needed human and financial resources \n        necessary to encourage widespread implementation of needed \n        reforms.\n            (13) Article 9(2) of the Convention on the Elimination of \n        Discrimination Against Women grants women equal rights with men \n        with respect to transmitting the nationality of their children.\n            (14) The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \n        Refugees (UNHCR) has been given the mandate by the \n        international community to work to prevent de jure and de facto \n        statelessness and to identify, protect, and find remedies for \n        individuals now considered de jure or de facto stateless.\n            (15) The UNHCR lacks sufficient resources to undertake this \n        important work in a systematic and comprehensive manner to \n        identify, protect, and find timely solutions for the millions \n        of individuals who are de jure or de facto stateless.\n\nSEC. 3. THE UNITED NATIONS.\n\n    (a) Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States that the \nPresident and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the \nUnited Nations work with the international community to increase \npolitical and financial support for the work of the UNHCR to prevent \nand resolve problems related to de jure and de facto statelessness, and \nto promote the rights of the de jure or de facto stateless, by taking \nthese and other actions:\n            (1) Increasing the attention of the United Nations and the \n        UNHCR to de jure and de facto statelessness and increasing its \n        capacity to reduce statelessness around the world by \n        coordinating the mainstreaming of de jure and de facto \n        statelessness into all of the United Nations human rights work, \n        in cooperation with all relevant United Nations agencies.\n            (2) Urging United Nations country teams in countries with \n        significant de jure or de facto stateless populations to devote \n        increasing attention and resources to undertake coordinated \n        efforts by all United Nations offices, funds, and programs to \n        bring about the full registration and documentation of all \n        persons resident in the territory of each country, either as \n        citizens or as individuals in need of international protection.\n            (3) Urging the creation of an Inter-Agency Task Force on \n        Statelessness with representation from UNHCR, UNICEF and other \n        relevant United Nations agencies that will coordinate to \n        increase agency awareness and information exchange on de jure \n        and de facto statelessness to ensure a consistent and \n        comprehensive approach to the identification of stateless \n        groups and individuals and resolution of their status.\n            (4) Urging that nationality and de jure and de facto \n        statelessness issues are addressed in all country reviews \n        conducted by United Nations treaty bodies and relevant special \n        mechanisms engaged in country visits, and pursuing creation of \n        a standing mechanism within the United Nations to complement \n        the work of UNHCR in addressing issues of de jure and de facto \n        statelessness that give rise to urgent human rights or security \n        concerns.\n            (5) Urging the UNHCHR to include nationality and \n        statelessness in all country-specific and thematic monitoring, \n        reporting, training, and protection activities, and across \n        special procedures, and to designate at least one human rights \n        officer to monitor, report, and coordinate the office's \n        advocacy on nationality and de jure and de facto statelessness.\n            (6) Urging the United Nations to ensure that its work on \n        trafficking includes measures to restore secure citizenship to \n        trafficked women and girls, and to work with Member States to \n        guarantee that national legislation gives women full and equal \n        rights regarding citizenship.\n            (7) Urging the United Nations to increase its capacity to \n        respond to the needs of de jure or de facto stateless \n        individuals, particularly children, and to strengthen and \n        expand the United Nations protection and assistance activities, \n        particularly in field operations, to better respond to the wide \n        range of protection and assistance needs of de jure or de facto \n        stateless individuals.\n            (8) Urging the UNICEF to increase its efforts to encourage \n        all Member States of the United Nations to permit full and easy \n        access to birth registration for all children born in their \n        territories, particularly in Member States in which there are \n        displaced populations, and work with the UNHCR and Member \n        States to ensure the issuance of birth certificates to all \n        children born to refugees and displaced persons.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to regular United \nStates contributions to the UNHCR, there is authorized to be \nappropriated not less than $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 and each \nsubsequent fiscal year to be made available to improve the UNHCR's \nassistance to de jure or de facto stateless individuals. Such funds may \nbe used to--\n            (1) protect the rights, meet emergency humanitarian needs, \n        and provide assistance to de jure or de facto stateless groups \n        and individuals;\n            (2) provide additional resources to--\n                    (A) increase the number of protection officers;\n                    (B) increase the number of professional staff in \n                the statelessness unit; and\n                    (C) train protection officers and United Nations \n                country teams in the field to identify, reduce, \n                protect, and prevent de jure and de facto \n                statelessness;\n            (3) improve identification of de jure or de facto stateless \n        groups and individuals by carrying out a comprehensive annual \n        study of the scope of de jure and de facto statelessness \n        worldwide, including causes of de jure and de facto \n        statelessness and dissemination of best practices for remedying \n        de jure and de facto statelessness; and\n            (4) increase the United Nations educational and technical \n        assistance programs to prevent de jure and de facto \n        statelessness, including outreach to Member States and their \n        legislatures, with particular emphasis on those countries \n        determined to have protracted de jure or de facto statelessness \n        situations.\n    (c) Authorization of Appropriations to the UNICEF.--In addition to \nregular United States contributions to the UNICEF, there is authorized \nto be appropriated $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 and each subsequent \nfiscal year be made available to augment to the UNICEF's ability to aid \ncountries with significant de jure or de facto stateless populations to \nbring about the full registration of all children born to de jure or de \nfacto stateless parents.\n\nSEC. 4. THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    (a) Foreign Policy.--Given the importance of obtaining and \npreserving nationality and the protection of a government, and of \npreventing the exploitation or trafficking of de jure or de facto \nstateless groups or individuals, the President shall make the \nprevention and reduction of de jure or de facto statelessness an \nimportant goal of United States foreign policy and human rights \nefforts. Such efforts shall include--\n            (1) calling upon host countries to protect and assume \n        responsibility for de jure or de facto stateless groups or \n        individuals;\n            (2) working with countries of origin to facilitate the \n        resolution of problems faced by de jure or de facto stateless \n        groups or individuals;\n            (3) working with countries of origin and host countries to \n        facilitate the resolution of disputes and conflicts that cause \n        or result in the creation of de jure or de facto statelessness;\n            (4) encouraging host countries to afford de jure or de \n        facto stateless groups or individuals the full protection of \n        the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons \n        and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and \n        all relevant international conventions;\n            (5) directing the Secretary of State to provide assistance \n        to countries to prevent and resolve situations of de jure or de \n        facto statelessness and to prevent the trafficking or \n        exploitation of de jure or de facto stateless individuals;\n            (6) directing the Office of Trafficking in Persons of the \n        Department of State to continue to document and analyze the \n        effects of statelessness on trafficking in persons, both as a \n        cause of trafficking and as an obstacle to reaching and \n        assisting trafficked persons; and\n            (7) encouraging and facilitating the work of \n        nongovernmental organizations in the United States and abroad \n        that provide legal and humanitarian support to de jure or de \n        facto stateless groups or individuals, to increase the access \n        of de jure or de facto stateless groups or individuals to such \n        organizations, and to encourage other governments to provide \n        similar support and access.\n    (b) Domestic Policy.--\n            (1) In general.--Given the importance of preventing new \n        instances of de jure or de facto statelessness and the \n        trafficking of de jure or de facto stateless individuals, and \n        of protecting the human rights of de jure or de facto stateless \n        individuals, the President shall submit to the Committee on \n        Foreign Affairs and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House \n        of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and \n        the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate a report that \n        includes the following:\n                    (A) A detailed explanation of what changes, if any, \n                to United States law would have to occur should the \n                United States wish to comply with the terms of the 1954 \n                Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons \n                or the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of \n                Statelessness.\n                    (B) Information on de jure or de facto stateless \n                individuals in the United States, or under the \n                jurisdiction of the United States, and their \n                conditions.
