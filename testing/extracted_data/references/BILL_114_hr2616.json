URBAN FLOODING DEFINED.\n\n    (a) In General.--In this Act, the term ``urban flooding'' means the \ninundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more \ndensely populated areas, caused by rain falling on increased amounts of \nimpervious surface and overwhelming the capacity of drainage systems, \nsuch as storm sewers.\n    (b) Inclusions.--In this Act, the term ``urban flooding'' \nincludes--\n            (1) situations in which stormwater enters buildings through \n        windows, doors, or other openings;\n            (2) water backup through sewer pipes, showers, toilets, \n        sinks, and floor drains;\n            (3) seepage through walls and floors;\n            (4) the accumulation of water on property or public rights-\n        of-way; and\n            (5) the overflow from water bodies, such as rivers and \n        lakes.\n    (c) Exclusion.--In this Act, the term ``urban flooding'' does not \ninclude flooding in undeveloped or agricultural areas.\n    (d) Primary Focus of Study.--Although the definition of the term \n``urban flooding'' in this section acknowledges that flooding may be \ncaused in part by the overflow of rivers or other bodies of water, the \nprimary focus of the study under section 3 shall be on urban areas \noutside of special flood hazard areas, as that term is defined by the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nSEC. 3. URBAN FLOODING STUDY.\n\n    (a) Agreement With National Academy of Sciences.--The Administrator \nof the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall enter into an \nagreement with the National Academy of Sciences under which the \nNational Academy of Sciences will conduct a study on urban flooding in \naccordance with the requirements of this section.\n    (b) Contents.--\n            (1) General review and evaluation.--In conducting the \n        study, the National Academy of Sciences shall review and \n        evaluate the latest available research, laws, regulations, \n        policies, best practices, procedures, and institutional \n        knowledge regarding urban flooding.\n            (2) Specific issue areas.--The study shall include, at a \n        minimum, an examination of the following:\n                    (A) The prevalence and costs associated with urban \n                flooding events across the United States, with a focus \n                on the largest metropolitan areas and any clear trends \n                in frequency and severity over the past 2 decades.\n                    (B) The adequacy of existing federally provided \n                flood risk information and the most cost effective \n                methods and products to identify, map, or otherwise \n                characterize the risk of property damage from urban \n                flooding on a property-by-property basis, whether or \n                not a property is in or adjacent to a 1-percent (100-\n                year) flood plain, and the potential for training and \n                certifying local experts in flood risk characterization \n                as a service to property purchasers and owners and \n                their communities.\n                    (C) The causes of urban flooding and its apparent \n                increase over the past 20 years, including the impacts \n                of--\n                            (i) global climate change;\n                            (ii) increasing urbanization and the \n                        associated increase in impervious surfaces; and\n                            (iii) undersized, deteriorating, and \n                        otherwise ineffective stormwater \n                        infrastructure.\n                    (D) The most cost-effective strategies, practices, \n                technologies, policies, standards, or rules used to \n                reduce the impacts of urban flooding, with a focus on \n                decentralized, easy-to-install, and low-cost \n                approaches, such as nonstructural and natural \n                infrastructure on public and private property. The \n                examination under this subparagraph shall include an \n                assessment of opportunities for implementing innovative \n                strategies and practices on government-controlled land, \n                such as Federal, State, and local roads, parking lots, \n                alleys, sidewalks, buildings, recreational areas, and \n                open space.\n                    (E) The role of the Federal Government and State \n                governments, as conveners, funders, and advocates, in \n                spurring market innovations based on public-private-\n                nonprofit partnerships. Such innovations may include \n                smart home technologies for improved flood warning \n                systems connected to high-resolution weather forecast \n                data and Internet- and cellular-based communications \n                systems.\n                    (F) The most sustainable and effective methods for \n                funding flood risk and flood damage reduction at all \n                levels of government, including--\n                            (i) the potential for establishing a State \n                        revolving fund program for flood prevention \n                        projects similar to the revolving fund programs \n                        under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n                        and the Safe Drinking Water Act;\n                            (ii) stormwater fee programs using \n                        impervious surface as the basis for fee rates \n                        and providing credits for the installation of \n                        flood prevention or other stormwater management \n                        features;\n                            (iii) grant programs; and\n                            (iv) public-private partnerships.\n                    (G) Information and education strategies and \n                practices, including nontraditional approaches such as \n                the use of community colleges and social media, for \n                community leaders, government staff, and property \n                owners on--\n                            (i) flood risks;\n                            (ii) flood risk reduction strategies and \n                        practices; and\n                            (iii) the availability and effectiveness of \n                        different types of flood insurance policies.\n                    (H) The relevance of the National Flood Insurance \n                Program and Community Rating System to urban flooding \n                areas outside traditional flood plains, and strategies \n                for improving compliance, broadening coverage, and \n                increasing participation under the programs.\n                    (I) Strategies for protecting communities in the \n                lower elevations of a watershed or drainage area from \n                the flooding impacts of development in upstream \n                communities, including a review of--\n                            (i) potential standards for watershed-wide \n                        flood protection planning; and\n                            (ii) cost-effective and equitable legal \n                        options for a downstream community when \n                        upstream communities act in a way that \n                        increases flooding downstream.\n                    (J) Cost-effective strategies for reducing \n                infiltration/inflow into combined and separate sewer \n                systems.\n                    (K) Opportunities to increase coordination between \n                stormwater management programming under the Federal \n                Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) \n                and flood risk management and mitigation programming \n                under various laws, including the Robert T.
