FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Despite improved therapies, the prevalence rate of \n        asthma continues to rise, affecting an estimated 14.6 million \n        Americans; 4.4 million under the age of 18. Since 1982, the \n        prevalence of pediatric asthma has risen 76 percent. Rates are \n        increasing for all ethnic groups and especially for African \n        American and Hispanic children.\n            (2) Asthma is the third leading cause of preventable \n        hospitalizations. Improper diagnosis and poor management of \n        asthma resulted in 1.6 million people being treated for asthma \n        attacks in the emergency room in 1995.\n            (3) Asthma can be life-threatening if not properly managed. \n        Most asthma-related deaths are preventable, yet such deaths \n        continue to rise in the U.S. In 1996, 5,667 individuals died as \n        a result of an asthma attack, nearly double the number of \n        deaths in 1980.\n            (4) The costs of asthma to the U.S. was over $6 billion in \n        1990, and the rise in asthma prevalence will lead to higher \n        costs in the future.\n            (5) With early recognition of the signs and symptoms of \n        asthma, proper diagnosis and treatment, and patient education \n        and self-management, asthma is a controllable disease.\n            (6) Public health interventions have been proven effective \n        in the treatment and management of asthma. Population-based \n        research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \n        has effectively demonstrated the benefits of combining \n        aggressive medical treatment with patient education to improve \n        the management of asthma. The National Asthma Education and \n        Prevention Program (NAEPP) helps raise awareness that asthma is \n        a serious chronic disease, and helps promote more effective \n        management of asthma through patient and professional \n        education.\n            (7) The alarming rise in prevalence, asthma-related deaths, \n        and expenditures demonstrate that, despite extensive knowledge \n        on effective asthma management strategies, current federal \n        policy and funding regarding the education, treatment, and \n        management of asthma is inadequate.\n            (8) Additional federal direction, funding, and support is \n        necessary to increase awareness of asthma as a chronic illness, \n        its symptoms, and the environmental factors (indoor and \n        outdoor) that affect the disease, as well as to promote \n        education programs that teach patients how to better manage \n        asthma.\n\nSEC. 3.
