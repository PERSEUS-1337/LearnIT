FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Title 38, United States Code, authorizes the Secretary \n        of Veterans Affairs to furnish hospital and domiciliary care, \n        medical services, nursing home care, and related services to \n        eligible and enrolled veterans, but only to the extent that \n        appropriated resources and facilities are available for such \n        purposes.\n            (2) For 19 of the past 22 fiscal years, funds have not been \n        appropriated for the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \n        provision of health care as of the commencement of the new \n        fiscal year, causing the Department great challenges in \n        planning and managing care for enrolled veterans, to the \n        detriment of veterans.\n            (3) The cumulative effect of insufficient, late, and \n        unpredictable funding for the Department for health care \n        endangers the viability of the health care system of the \n        Department and impairs the specialized health care resources \n        the Department requires to maintain and improve the health of \n        sick and disabled veterans.\n            (4) Appropriations for the health care programs of the \n        Department have too often proven insufficient over the past \n        decade, requiring the Secretary to ration health care and \n        Congress to approve supplemental appropriations for those \n        programs.\n            (5) Providing sufficient, timely, and predictable funding \n        would ensure the Government meets its obligation to provide \n        health care to sick and disabled veterans and ensure that all \n        veterans enrolled for health care through the Department have \n        ready access to timely and high quality care.\n            (6) Providing sufficient, timely, and predictable funding \n        would allow the Department to properly plan for and meet the \n        needs of veterans.\n\nSEC. 3.
