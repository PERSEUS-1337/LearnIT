    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Private Sector Preparedness Act of \n2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Private sector organizations own 85 percent of the \n        Nation's infrastructure facilities and employ the vast majority \n        of the Nation's employees. The resources of these \n        organizations, including property and personnel, can be \n        coordinated in an emergency situation more efficiently than the \n        population in general.\n            (2) Private sector organizations are often unprepared for \n        emergencies, whether resulting from a natural disaster or a \n        terrorist incident. Although there have been exemplary efforts \n        by select private sector organizations, emergency preparedness \n        is not generally a priority for these organizations.\n            (3) The hearings of and testimony before the National \n        Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States \n        demonstrated that the lack of emergency preparedness and \n        evacuation planning, training, and exercises by private sector \n        organizations may have contributed to additional casualties at \n        the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.\n            (4) Although there may be an interest in promoting \n        emergency preparedness within private sector organizations, \n        there remains uncertainty and confusion as to the definition of \n        appropriate and adequate preparedness and what actions these \n        organizations should take.\n            (5) Identifying standards and best practices is necessary \n        to promote emergency preparedness by private sector \n        organizations, in addition to educational activities to \n        effectively communicate such standards and best practices.\n\nSEC. 3. PRIVATE SECTOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Preparedness Program.--Title V of the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 311 et seq.) is amended by adding at the \nend the following:\n\n``SEC. 510.
