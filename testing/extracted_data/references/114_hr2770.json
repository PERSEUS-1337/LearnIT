FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Administrator of the Transportation Security \n        Administration has stated that the maintenance of security-\n        related technology such as x-rays, explosive trace detection \n        systems, explosive detection systems, liquid scanners, and \n        enhanced walk-through metal detectors, is central to the \n        execution of Transportation Security Administration's mission \n        to protect United States transportation systems.\n            (2) Preventive and corrective maintenance is essential to \n        ensuring and extending the service lives of security-related \n        technology.\n            (3) In May 2015, the Inspector General of the Department of \n        Homeland Security, reporting on the results of a performance \n        audit conducted between December 2013 and November 2014, \n        concluded that because the Transportation Security \n        Administration did not properly manage the maintenance of its \n        security-related technology deployed to airports, it cannot be \n        assured that routine preventive maintenance is performed or \n        that equipment is repaired and ready for operational use.\n            (4) Specifically, the Inspector General found that the \n        Transportation Security Administration did not issue adequate \n        policies and procedures to document, track, and maintain \n        preventive maintenance actions at the airport level and \n        oversight of contractor-performed maintenance needed to be \n        strengthened.\n            (5) According to the Inspector General, if the equipment is \n        not fully operational, the Transportation Security \n        Administration may have to use other screening measures that \n        may be less effective at detecting dangerous items, thereby \n        potentially jeopardizing passenger safety and security.\n\nSEC. 3. MAINTENANCE OF SECURITY-RELATED TECHNOLOGY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title XVI of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 \nU.S.C. 561 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n        ``Subtitle C--Maintenance of Security-Related Technology\n\n``SEC. 1621. MAINTENANCE VALIDATION AND OVERSIGHT.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this subtitle, the Administrator shall develop and \nimplement a preventive maintenance validation process for security-\nrelated technology deployed to airports.\n    ``(b) Maintenance by Administration Personnel at Airports.--For \nmaintenance to be carried out by Administration personnel at airports, \nthe process referred to in subsection (a) shall include the following:\n            ``(1) Guidance to Administration personnel, equipment \n        maintenance technicians, and other personnel at airports \n        specifying how to conduct and document preventive maintenance \n        actions.\n            ``(2) Mechanisms for the Administrator to verify compliance \n        with the guidance issued pursuant to paragraph (1).\n    ``(c) Maintenance by Contractors at Airports.--For maintenance to \nbe carried out by a contractor at airports, the process referred to in \nsubsection (a) shall require the following:\n            ``(1) Provision of monthly preventive maintenance schedules \n        to appropriate Administration personnel at each airport that \n        includes information on each action to be completed by a \n        contractor.\n            ``(2) Notification to appropriate Administration personnel \n        at each airport when maintenance action is completed by a \n        contractor.\n            ``(3) A process for independent validation by a third party \n        of contractor maintenance.\n    ``(d) Penalties for Noncompliance.--The Administrator shall require \nmaintenance contracts for security-related technology deployed to \nairports to include penalties for noncompliance when it is determined \nthat either preventive or corrective maintenance has not been completed \naccording to contractual requirements and manufacturers' \nspecifications.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002 is amended by inserting after the item relating to \nsection 1616 the following:\n\n        ``Subtitle C--Maintenance of Security-Related Technology\n\n``Sec. 1621.

HAAS,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
