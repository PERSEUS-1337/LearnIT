FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In recent years, there has been a substantial number of \n        instances of price-fixing, bid-rigging, and other fraudulent \n        activity regarding foods purchased for--\n                    (A) the school lunch program established under the \n                National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.); and\n                    (B) the school breakfast program established under \n                section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. \n                1773).\n            (2) In 1986, President Reagan issued Executive Order 12549 \n        which was intended to curb fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal \n        programs, increase accountability, and ensure consistency among \n        agency regulations concerning debarment and suspension of \n        participants in Federal programs.\n            (3) During the past several years, the Antitrust Division \n        of the Department of Justice has filed over 95 criminal cases \n        against companies and individuals accused of bid-rigging \n        conspiracies, false statements, mail fraud, price-fixing, and \n        similar activities involving dairy products sold to schools or \n        to the Department of Defense.\n            (4) Over 30 grand juries in several States are \n        investigating similar activities.\n            (5) 45 corporations and 48 individuals have been convicted \n        by Federal courts of similar activities, and total fines and \n        civil damages of approximately $100,000,000 have been assessed \n        in Federal and State court actions for similar activities.\n            (6) Although several companies have violated the \n        regulations of food and nutrition programs of the Department of \n        Agriculture, such companies continue to participate in such \n        programs and monetarily benefit from such programs.\n            (7) A report of the Comptroller General of the United \n        States noted that, as of March 1992, the Secretary of \n        Agriculture had neither suspended nor debarred any of the 13 \n        dairy companies or 28 individuals convicted of milk contract \n        bid-rigging from participating in the school lunch and school \n        breakfast programs.\n            (8) Effective educational and monitoring programs can \n        greatly reduce the incidence of fraud, price-fixing, and bid-\n        rigging by companies that sell food products to schools.\n            (9) Reducing the incidence of fraud, price-fixing, and bid-\n        rigging in connection with the school lunch and school \n        breakfast programs could save school districts, parents, and \n        taxpayers millions of dollars per year.\n            (10) The Comptroller General of the United States has noted \n        that bid-rigging awareness training is an effective means of \n        deterring improper collusion and bid-rigging.\n            (11) The Comptroller General of the United States in a \n        General Accounting Office report addressed many of the concerns \n        described in this section with respect to bid-rigging in the \n        school lunch program.\n\nSEC. 3.
