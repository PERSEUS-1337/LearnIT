FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Federal, State, and local governments spend billions of \n        dollars annually on the Nation's transportation needs.\n            (2) Congestion on the Nation's roads costs over \n        $63,000,000,000 annually in lost work time, fuel consumption, \n        and costs of infrastructure and equipment repair.\n            (3) On average, on-road-vehicles contribute 34 percent of \n        nitrogen oxides emissions.\n            (4) It is estimated that staying at home to work requires 3 \n        times less energy consumption than commuting to work.\n            (5) In 2000, it was reported that if an identified 10 to 20 \n        percent of commuters switched to teleworking, 1,800,000 tons of \n        regulated pollutants would be eliminated, 3,500,000,000 gallons \n        of gas would be saved, 3,100,000,000 hours of personal time \n        would be freed up, and maintenance and infrastructure costs \n        would decrease by $500,000,000 annually because of reduced \n        congestion and reduced vehicle miles traveled.\n            (6) The average American daily commute is 49 minutes for a \n        24-mile round-trip (a total of 100 hours per year).\n            (7) The increase in work from 1969 to 1996, the increase in \n        hours mothers spend in paid work, combined with a shift toward \n        single-parent families resulted in families on average \n        experiencing a decrease of 22 hours a week (14 percent) in \n        parental time available outside of paid work they could spend \n        with their children.\n            (8) Today 60 percent of the workforce is involved in \n        information work (an increase of 43 percent since 1990) \n        allowing and encouraging decentralization of paid work to \n        occur.\n            (9) Estimates indicate that about 40,000,000 Americans are \n        currently teleworking.\n\nSEC. 3.
