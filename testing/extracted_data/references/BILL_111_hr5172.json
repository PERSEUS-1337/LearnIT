FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A school principal is expected to be an instructional \n        leader, meaning the principal must posses the knowledge and \n        instructional skills to guide teaching and learning in a \n        school.\n            (2) There is a clear intention within the amendments made \n        by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 to the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) that \n        principals become instructional leaders. Section 2113(c) of the \n        Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n        6613(c)) calls for principals to have--\n                    (A) ``the instructional leadership skills to help \n                teachers teach and students learn'';\n                    (B) and ``to help students meet challenging State \n                student academic achievement standards''.\n            (3) Despite this recognition of the importance of \n        instructional leadership, adequate attention and resources have \n        not been committed to training and supporting school \n        principals--\n                    (A) in meeting the standards of instructional \n                leadership in States where such standards exist; and\n                    (B) in developing such standards in States where \n                such standards do not exist.\n            (4) Licensure of school principals typically does not give \n        adequate emphasis to instructional leadership skills in the \n        certification process.\n            (5) The term ``highly qualified principal'' added by the No \n        Child Left Behind Act of 2001 to the Elementary and Secondary \n        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) should be \n        defined in such Act to include a strong emphasis on \n        instructional leadership.\n\nSEC. 3.
