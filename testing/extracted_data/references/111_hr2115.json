FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Risks to the health and well-being of the Nation's men \n        (and our families) are on the rise due to a lack of education, \n        awareness, and pursuit of preventative screening and care--\n                    (A) men are leading in 9 out of the top 10 causes \n                of death;\n                    (B) 1 in 2 men versus 1 in 3 women in their \n                lifetime will be diagnosed with cancer;\n                    (C) the life expectancy gap between men and women \n                has increased from one year in 1920 to 5.2 years in \n                2005; and\n                    (D) studies show that women are 100 percent more \n                likely than men to visit a doctor, have regular \n                physician check-ups, and obtain preventive screening \n                tests for serious diseases.\n            (2) While this health crisis is of particular concern to \n        men, it is also a concern for women regarding their fathers, \n        husbands, sons, and brothers.\n            (3) According to the Census Bureau, by the time men and \n        women reach age 65, the ratio of men to women reduces to 85 to \n        100. The growing disparity in this statistic suggests that \n        among other factors, the declining health of men increases the \n        risk of women entering retirement age as widows.\n            (4) According to the Administration on Aging, more than \n        half of elderly widows now living in poverty were not poor \n        before the death of their husbands.\n            (5) Men's health is a concern to Federal and State \n        governments which absorb the enormous costs of premature death \n        and disability, including the costs of caring for dependents \n        left behind.\n            (6) Educating men, their families, and health care \n        providers about the importance of early detection of male \n        health issues (i.e. cardiovascular, mental, prostate health, \n        cancer (lung, prostate, skin, colorectal, testicular, and \n        more), HIV/AIDS, osteoporosis, and other pertinent health \n        issues) can result in reducing rates of mortality for male-\n        specific diseases, as well as improve the health of the \n        Nation's men and its overall economic well-being.\n            (7) Of concern is the physical, mental, and emotional well-\n        being of our military men (and women) returning from war zones \n        and our veterans. We must pay attention to their needs and the \n        needs of their families.\n            (8) Recent scientific studies have shown that regular \n        medical exams, preventive screenings, regular exercise, and \n        healthy eating habits can help save lives.\n            (9) Appropriate use of tests such as prostate-specific \n        antigen (PSA) exams and blood pressure, blood sugar, lipid \n        panel, and colorectal screenings in conjunction with clinical \n        exams or self-testing, can result in the early detection of \n        many problems and in increased survival rates.\n            (10) Men's health is a concern for employers who pay the \n        costs of medical care and lose productive employees.\n            (11) Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed \n        cancer in the United States among men, accounting for 25 \n        percent of all cancer cases--\n                    (A) over 185,000 men will be newly diagnosed with \n                prostate cancer this year alone, and almost 29,000 will \n                die;\n                    (B) costs associated with prostate cancer detection \n                and treatments exceed $8 billion annually and represent \n                8 percent of cancer and 0.4 percent of all health-\n                related expenditures in the United States;\n                    (C) prostate cancer rates increase sharply with \n                age, and more than \\2/3\\ of such cases are diagnosed in \n                men age 65 and older;\n                    (D) \\2/3\\ of annual prostate cancer expenditures in \n                the United States are paid for by Medicare; and\n                    (E) the incidence of prostate cancer and the \n                resulting mortality rate in African-American men is \n                twice that of all other men.\n            (12) It is estimated that in 2008, approximately 115,000 \n        men were diagnosed with lung cancer, and almost 91,000 of the \n        Nation's men died from lung cancer.\n            (13) It is estimated that in 2008, approximately 54,000 men \n        were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and over 24,000 of the \n        Nation's men died from colorectal cancer.\n            (14) Men make up over half of the diabetes patients aged 20 \n        and over in the United States (10.9 million men total) and \n        nearly \\1/3\\ of them do not know it--\n                    (A) whereas approximately 21,000,000 Americans are \n                living with diabetes, men are 30 percent more likely to \n                die from the disease;\n                    (B) 54 million American people have pre-diabetes \n                and 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in \n                2005; and\n                    (C) people with diagnosed diabetes have medical \n                expenditures that are 2 to 3 times higher than patients \n                without diabetes and the estimated cost of diabetes in \n                2007 was $174,000,000, including $116,000,000 in excess \n                medical expenditures and $58,000,000 in reduced \n                national productivity.\n            (15) Over 8,000 men, ages 15 to 40, will be diagnosed this \n        year with testicular cancer, and 380 of these men will die of \n        this disease in 2008. A common reason for delay in treatment of \n        this disease is a delay in seeking medical attention after \n        discovering a testicular mass.\n            (16) Men over the past decade have shown poorer health \n        outcomes than women across all racial and ethnic groups as well \n        as socioeconomic status.\n            (17) Establishing an Office of Men's Health is needed to \n        investigate these findings and take further actions to promote \n        awareness of men's health needs.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE OF MEN'S HEALTH.\n\n    Title XVII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300u et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 1711.
