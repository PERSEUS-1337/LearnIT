FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1984, the United Nations General Assembly adopted \n        the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or \n        Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The United States ratified \n        the Convention in 1994, which defines torture as acts \n        deliberately perpetrated by or with the approval of government \n        officials, which are designed to inflict extreme physical or \n        psychological suffering.\n            (2) Torture has devastating, long-term consequences, not \n        only for survivors, but also for their families, friends, and \n        communities. Survivors' relationships with others suffer \n        greatly because of the distrust and sense of alienation from \n        humanity that the torture has engendered.\n            (3) Amnesty International reports that there are over 117 \n        countries in the world which engage in or condone torture. It \n        is estimated that over 500,000 victims of foreign governmental \n        torture live in the United States.\n            (4) Mechanical restraints, such as handcuffs, leg irons, \n        shackles, and thumbcuffs, are some of the most widely used \n        security devices; they are also widely abused as implements of \n        torture.\n            (5) Equipment designed for legitimate law enforcement \n        purposes can be misused to suppress freedom and commit human \n        rights violations, particularly in countries where police \n        authorities are used to monitor and harass human rights \n        activists, opposition political figures, and others and where \n        there are political or free expression ``crimes''.\n            (6) Many devices intended for crime control purposes, such \n        as electro-shock discharge devices, are especially susceptible \n        to abuse as implements of torture.\n\nSEC. 3.
