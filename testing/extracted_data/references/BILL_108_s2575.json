FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) tan oak, coast live oak, Shreve's oak, and black oak \n        trees are among the most beloved features of the topography of \n        California and the Pacific Northwest and efforts should be made \n        to protect those trees from disease;\n            (2) the die-off of those trees, as a result of the exotic \n        fungal pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, is approaching epidemic \n        proportions;\n            (3) native plants and forests must be protected from \n        Phytophthora ramorum;\n            (4) more information is needed on--\n                    (A) Phytophthora ramorum, including the existence \n                of Phytophthora ramorum throughout the United States; \n                and\n                    (B) sudden oak death syndrome, including--\n                            (i) the causes;\n                            (ii) the methods of transmittal; and\n                            (iii) the best methods of treatment;\n            (5) the host list for Phytophthora ramorum includes 60 \n        plant species in 32 genera, including--\n                    (A) some of the most popular and economically \n                important landscape and garden plants in the United \n                States; and\n                    (B) wild huckleberry plants, potentially \n                endangering the commercial blueberry and cranberry \n                industries;\n            (6) sudden oak death syndrome threatens to create major \n        economic and environmental problems in California, the Pacific \n        Northwest, and other regions, including--\n                    (A) the increased threat of fire and fallen trees;\n                    (B) the cost of tree removal and a reduction in \n                property values; and\n                    (C) loss of revenue due to--\n                            (i) restrictions on the movement of forest \n                        products and nursery stock; and\n                            (ii) the impact on the commercial nursery \n                        and small fruit industries;\n            (7) in 2002, the Secretary of Agriculture imposed a \n        quarantine on the exportation from 10 counties in northern \n        California and Curry County, Oregon, of oak trees and nursery \n        plants that serve as hosts for Phytophthora ramorum;\n            (8) on April 9, 2004, after the discovery of Phytophthora \n        ramorum in 2 nurseries in southern California--\n                    (A) restrictions were placed on the interstate \n                movement of species that could potentially serve as \n                hosts to Phytophthora ramorum; and\n                    (B) new restrictions were implemented on the \n                interstate movement of host plants and potential host \n                plants from all commercial nurseries in the State of \n                California that are outside the 10 quarantined \n                counties;\n            (9) on April 22, 2004, the restrictions referred to in \n        paragraph (8)(B) were expanded to include--\n                    (A) all plants in the same genus as host and \n                potential host plants; and\n                    (B) plants growing within 10 meters of a host or \n                potential host plant; and\n            (10) several States and Canada have placed restrictions on \n        the importation of nursery plants from California.\n\nSEC. 3.
