FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to data from the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs, several medical centers of the Department are managed \n        by acting or temporary directors.\n            (2) Some of these medical centers have not been managed by \n        a permanent director for a long period.\n            (3) Pursuant to section 317.903 of title 5, Code of Federal \n        Regulations, a member of the senior executive service who is \n        detailed to a temporary position in a department or agency of \n        the Federal Government may not serve in that position for \n        periods longer than 120-day increments, and no member of the \n        senior executive service may be detailed to an unclassified \n        position for a period longer than 240 days.\n            (4) The inability of the Department of Veterans Affairs to \n        recruit qualified, permanent candidates as directors of medical \n        centers, combined with the policies described in paragraph (3), \n        leads to frequent turnover of directors at the medical centers \n        which impedes the ability of system management to engage in \n        long-term planning and other functions necessary to improve \n        service delivery to veterans.\n            (5) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should develop a \n        comprehensive plan to recruit permanent directors at each \n        medical center that lacks a permanent director.\n\nSEC. 3.
