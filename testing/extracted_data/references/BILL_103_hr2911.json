It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) while there have been massive governmental efforts and \n        expenditure of funds to complete the resolution of the thrift \n        crisis and despite improvement in the condition of most \n        segments of the thrift industry, there is a risk that the \n        structure of the deposit insurance funds since FIRREA could \n        undermine even the healthiest segments of the thrift industry \n        by impeding their ability to compete and precipitating another \n        costly crisis in that industry. The structural issues involve--\n                    (a) the presence of two separate insurance funds, \n                the BIF and SAIF funds;\n                    (b) the projected, substantial disparity in deposit \n                insurance premiums to be paid by BIF and SAIF members \n                and the potential for a competitive imbalance;\n                    (c) the presence of a designated reserve ratio of \n                1.25 percent of insured deposits for BIF and SAIF \n                funds; and\n                    (d) the effect which existing debt obligations have \n                on the ability of the SAIF fund to accumulate reserves \n                and to become fiscally sound.\n            (2) to ensure the continued availability of housing credit \n        and to avoid another costly crisis in the thrift industry as a \n        result of some of these structural impediments involving the \n        FIRREA-mandated separate fund concept, an Advisory Commission \n        shall be formed to advise the President and the Congress on the \n        viability of merging or maintaining the separation of the \n        deposit insurance funds and the impact of such action on the \n        health of the BIF and SAIF funds, the confidence of depositors \n        in the federal deposit insurance system, and the regulation of \n        and competitive balance between banks and thrifts.\n\n                establishment of an advisory commission\n\n    Sec. 2. There is hereby established an Advisory Commission to be \nknown as the Advisory Commission on BIF and SAIF funds (thereafter \nreferred to as the ``Advisory Commission'').\n    (a) Membership of the Advisory Commission.--\n            (1) Number and appointment.--The Advisory Commission shall \n        be composed of 7 members appointed no later than ninety days \n        after the date of the enactment of this Act.

to its \n        responsibilities under this section the Advisory Commission \n        shall consider the following issues:\n                    (A) An analysis of whether a deposit insurance \n                premium disparity between banks and thrifts is likely \n                and the competitive impact thereof.\n                    (B) The practical justification for maintaining two \n                separate Federal deposit funds.\n                    (C) The impact on the soundness of the Federal \n                deposit insurance system by the continuation of a \n                separate insurance fund for banks and savings \n                associations.\n                    (D) Whether a merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and \n                Savings Association Insurance Fund can be accomplished \n                in a manner which is equitable and the legal and \n                structural impediments which need to be addressed in \n                such a merger.\n

of insured deposits, which must now be \n                held by each deposit insurance fund, is appropriate in \n                light of current and future needs and considerations.\n                    (G) The impact of any remaining regulatory \n                differences between banks and thrifts on the soundness \n                of a merged fund.\n                    (H) The impact of a
