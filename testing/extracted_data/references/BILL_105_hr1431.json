STATEMENTS OF POLICY.\n\n    The Congress declares the following to be the policy of the United \nStates:\n            (1) Policy with respect to nato enlargement.--(A) The \n        emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that will be \n        invited to begin accession negotiations with the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization (NATO) at the NATO summit in Madrid on July \n        8 and 9, 1997, should not be the last such countries invited to \n        join NATO.\n            (B) The United States should seek to ensure that the NATO \n        leaders assembled in Madrid agree on a process whereby all \n        other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that \n        wish to join NATO will be considered for membership in NATO as \n        soon as they meet the criteria for such membership set forth in \n        the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103-\n        447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note).\n            (2) Policy with respect to the nato-russia charter and \n        adaptation of the cfe treaty.--(A) NATO enlargement should be \n        carried out in such a manner as to underscore the Alliance's \n        defensive nature and demonstrate to Russia that NATO \n        enlargement will enhance the security of all countries in \n        Europe, including Russia. Accordingly, the United States and \n        its NATO Allies should make this intention clear in the \n        negotiation of the NATO-Russia Charter and adaptation of the \n        Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty of November \n        19, 1990.\n            (B) In seeking to demonstrate to Russia NATO's defensive \n        and security-enhancing intentions, it is essential that neither \n        fundamental United States security interests in Europe nor the \n        effectiveness and flexibility of NATO as a defensive alliance \n        be jeopardized. In particular, no commitments should be made \n        that would have the effect of--\n                    (i) extending rights or imposing responsibilities \n                on new NATO members different from those applicable to \n                current NATO members, including with respect to the \n                deployment of nuclear weapons and the stationing of \n                troops and equipment from other NATO members;\n                    (ii) limiting the ability of NATO to defend the \n                territory of new NATO members by, for example, \n                restricting the construction of defense infrastructure \n                or limiting the ability of NATO to deploy \n                reinforcements when necessary;\n                    (iii) providing any international organization, or \n                any country that is not a member of NATO, with \n                authority to review, delay, veto, or otherwise impede \n                deliberations and decisions of the North Atlantic \n                Council or the implementation of such decisions, \n                including with respect to the deployment of NATO forces \n                or the admission of additional members to NATO; or\n                    (iv) impeding the development of enhanced relations \n                between NATO and other European countries that do not \n                belong to the Alliance by, for example, recognizing \n                spheres of influence in Europe.\n            (C) In order to enhance security and stability in Europe, \n        the NATO-Russia Charter should include commitments from the \n        Russian Federation--\n                    (i) to demarcate all its borders with neighboring \n                states;\n                    (ii) to station its armed forces on the territory \n                of other states only with the consent of such states \n                and in strict accordance with international law; and\n                    (iii) to take steps to reduce nuclear and \n                conventional forces in Kaliningrad.\n            (D) As the ongoing negotiations on adaptation of the \n        Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty proceed, the \n        United States should engage in close and continuous \nconsultations not only with its NATO allies, but also with the emerging \ndemocracies of Central and Eastern Europe, Ukraine, and the newly \nindependent states of the Caucasus region.\n            (3) Policy with respect to ballistic missile defense \n        cooperation with russia.--(A) As the United States proceeds \n        with efforts to develop defenses against ballistic missile \n        attack, it should seek to foster a climate of cooperation with \n        Russia on matters related to missile defense. In particular, \n        the United States and its NATO allies should seek to cooperate \n        with Russia in such areas as early warning and technical \n        aspects of ballistic missile defense.\n            (B) Even as the Congress seeks to promote ballistic missile \n        defense cooperation with Russia, it must insist on its \n        constitutional prerogatives regarding consideration of arms \n        control agreements with Russia that bear on ballistic missile \n        defense.\n\nSEC. 3.
