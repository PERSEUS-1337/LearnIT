FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the National Science Board's 2008 Science \n        and Engineering Indicators, only 5 percent of American college \n        graduates major in engineering, compared with 13 percent of \n        European students and 20 percent of students in Asia.\n            (2) Although United States fourth graders score well \n        against international competition, United States students fall \n        near the bottom or dead last by 12th grade in mathematics and \n        science, respectively.\n            (3) Admissions requirements for undergraduate engineering \n        schools include a solid background in mathematics (algebra, \n        geometry, trigonometry, and calculus) and science (biology, \n        chemistry, and physics), in addition to courses in English, \n        social studies, and humanities.\n            (4) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, overall \n        engineering employment is expected to grow by 11 percent over \n        the 2008 through 2018 decade, and, as a group, engineers earn \n        some of the highest average starting salaries among individuals \n        holding bachelor's degrees.\n            (5) According to the Department of Labor, engineers should \n        be creative, inquisitive, analytical, and detail oriented. \n        Engineers should be able to work as part of a team and to \n        communicate well, both orally and in writing. Communication \n        abilities are becoming increasingly important as engineers \n        interact more frequently with specialists in a wide range of \n        fields outside engineering.\n            (6) Exposure to project- and problem-based learning, in a \n        competitive team environment, gives 9th through 12th graders \n        the skills the students need to be successful in engineering \n        programs of study and engineering careers.\n            (7) According to Brandeis University's Center for Youth and \n        Communities, participants in FIRST Robotics (a nonprofit \n        organization that inspires young people to be science and \n        technology leaders by engaging the young people in mentor-based \n        programs)--\n                    (A) are more likely to attend college full-time \n                than nonparticipants (88 percent versus 53 percent);\n                    (B) are nearly 2 times as likely to major in a \n                science or engineering field; and\n                    (C) are more than 3 times as likely to have majored \n                specifically in engineering.\n\nSEC. 2.
