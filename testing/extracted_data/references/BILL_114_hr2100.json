FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the United States Census Bureau's 2013 \n        international figures, 1 person in 12--or close to 900,000,000 \n        people--is a girl or young woman age 10 through 24.\n            (2) The Census Bureau's data also asserts that young people \n        are the fastest growing segment of the population in developing \n        countries.\n            (3) Even though most countries do have birth registration \n        laws, four out of ten babies born in 2012 were not registered \n        worldwide. Moreover, an estimated 36 percent of children under \n        the age of five worldwide (about 230 million children) do not \n        possess a birth certificate.\n            (4) A nationally recognized proof of birth system is \n        important to determining a child's citizenship, nationality, \n        place of birth, parentage, and age. Without such a system, a \n        passport, driver's license, or other identification card is \n        difficult to obtain. The lack of such documentation can prevent \n        girls and women from officially participating in and \n        benefitting from the formal economic, legal, and political \n        sectors in their countries.\n            (5) The lack of birth registration among girls worldwide is \n        particularly concerning as it can exacerbate the \n        disproportionate vulnerability of women to trafficking, child \n        marriage, and lack of access to health and education services.\n            (6) A lack of birth registration among women and girls can \n        also aggravate what, in many places, amounts to an already \n        reduced ability to seek employment, participate in civil \n        society, or purchase or inherit land and other assets.\n            (7) Girls undertake much of the domestic labor needed for \n        poor families to survive: carrying water, harvesting crops, \n        tending livestock, caring for younger children, and doing \n        chores.\n            (8) Accurate assessments of access to education, poverty \n        levels, and overall census activities are hampered by the lack \n        of official information on women and girls. Without this \n        rudimentary information, assessments of foreign assistance and \n        domestic social welfare programs are difficult to gauge\n            (9) To help ensure that women and girls are considered in \n        United States foreign assistance policies and programs, that \n        their needs are addressed in the design, implementation, and \n        evaluation of foreign assistance programs, and that women and \n        girls have the opportunity to succeed, it is important that \n        girls be counted and have access to birth certificates and \n        other official documentation.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to--\n            (1) encourage countries to support the rule of law and \n        ensure girls and boys of all ages are able to fully participate \n        in society, including by providing birth certifications and \n        other official documentation;\n            (2) enhance training and capacity-building in key \n        developing countries, local nongovernmental organizations, and \n        other civil society organizations, including faith-based \n        organizations and organizations representing children and \n        families in the design, implementation, and monitoring of \n        programs under this Act, to effectively address the needs of \n        birth registries in countries where girls are systematically \n        undercounted; and\n            (3) incorporate into the design, implementation, and \n        evaluation of policies and programs measures to evaluate the \n        impact that such policies and programs have on girls.\n\nSEC. 4.
