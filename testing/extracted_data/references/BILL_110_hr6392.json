SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Alerting Lives through Effective and \nReliable Technological Systems Act of 2008'' or the ``ALERTS Act of \n2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) numerous proven and tested technologies exist to enable \n        the Federal Government to enhance its public alert and warning \n        system;\n            (2) the expected benefits of these enhancements include--\n                    (A) greater security, reliability, and redundancy \n                of the system;\n                    (B) rapid alert dissemination;\n                    (C) an improved ability to notify remote locations;\n                    (D) the ability to geographically target and \n                deliver alerts and warnings to multiple devices; and\n                    (E) the ability to permit State homeland security \n                grants to be utilized for the purposes of modernizing \n                public alert and warning systems;\n            (3) there is a need to test the viability of delivering \n        messages through diverse communications modes to effectively \n        alert and warn the public;\n            (4) there is a need to modernize and improve the ability of \n        the Federal Government to provide residents of the United \n        States with timely and effective warnings;\n            (5) although significant Federal integration efforts are \n        underway, the aggregation, dissemination, and reporting system \n        necessary for effective public alert and warning will require \n        an integrated national network for reliable, secure, and \n        authentic dissemination of emergency alerts and warnings to and \n        from all Federal, State, local, and tribal entities that alert \n        the public when appropriate.\n\nSEC. 3.
