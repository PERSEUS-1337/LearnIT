FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Citizens have a right, protected by the Second \n        Amendment to the United States Constitution, to keep and bear \n        arms.\n            (2) Lawsuits have been commenced against manufacturers, \n        distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms that operate \n        as designed and intended, which seek money damages and other \n        relief for the harm caused by the misuse of firearms by third \n        parties, including criminals.\n            (3) The manufacture, importation, possession, sale, and use \n        of firearms and ammunition in the United States are heavily \n        regulated by Federal, State, and local laws. Such Federal laws \n        include the Gun Control Act of 1968, the National Firearms Act, \n        and the Arms Export Control Act.\n            (4) Businesses in the United States that are engaged in \n        interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, \n        manufacture, marketing, distribution, importation, or sale to \n        the public of firearms or ammunition that has been shipped or \n        transported in interstate or foreign commerce are not, and \n        should not, be liable for the harm caused by those who \n        criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition \n        products that function as designed and intended.\n            (5) The possibility of imposing liability on an entire \n        industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse \n        of the legal system, erodes public confidence in our Nation's \n        laws, threatens the diminution of a basic constitutional right \n        and civil liberty, invites the disassembly and destabilization \n        of other industries and economic sectors lawfully competing in \n        the free enterprise system of the United States, and \n        constitutes an unreasonable burden on interstate and foreign \n        commerce of the United States.\n            (6) The liability actions commenced or contemplated by the \n        Federal Government, States, municipalities, and private \n        interest groups are based on theories without foundation in \n        hundreds of years of the common law and jurisprudence of the \n        United States and do not represent a bona fide expansion of the \n        common law. The possible sustaining of these actions by a \n        maverick judicial officer or petit jury would expand civil \n        liability in a manner never contemplated by the Framers of the \n        Constitution, by the Congress, or by the legislatures of the \n        several states. Such an expansion of liability would constitute \n        a deprivation of the rights, privileges, and immunities \n        guaranteed to a citizen of the United States under the \n        Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To prohibit causes of action against manufacturers, \n        distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or ammunition \n        products for the harm caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse \n        of firearm products or ammunition products by others when the \n        product functioned as designed and intended.\n            (2) To preserve a citizen's access to a supply of firearms \n        and ammunition for all lawful purposes, including hunting, \n        self-defense, collecting, and competitive or recreational \n        shooting.\n            (3) To guarantee a citizen's rights, privileges, and \n        immunities, as applied to the States, under the Fourteenth \n        Amendment to the United States Constitution, pursuant to \n        section 5 of that Amendment.\n            (4) To prevent the use of such lawsuits to impose \n        unreasonable burdens on interstate and foreign commerce.\n            (5) To protect the right, under the First Amendment to the \n        Constitution, of manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and \n        importers of firearms or ammunition products, and trade \n        associations, to speak freely, to assemble peaceably, and to \n        petition the Government for a redress of their grievances.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON BRINGING OF QUALIFIED CIVIL LIABILITY ACTIONS IN \n              FEDERAL OR STATE COURT.\n\n    (a) In General.--A qualified civil liability action may not be \nbrought in any Federal or State court.\n    (b) Dismissal of Pending Actions.--A qualified civil liability \naction that is pending on the date of the enactment of this Act shall \nbe dismissed immediately by the court in which the action was brought \nor is currently pending.\n\nSEC. 4.
