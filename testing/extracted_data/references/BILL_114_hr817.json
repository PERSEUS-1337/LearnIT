FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in both \n        its proposed and final calendar year 2015 physician fee \n        schedule rules made adjustments to the geographic area \n        designations used to calculate payments for ambulance providers \n        and suppliers and misidentified the number of zip code \n        designations that would be impacted by the change.\n            (2) On July 11, 2014, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n        Services published a proposal (79 FR 40375) informing the \n        public that no zip codes in the State of California, only two \n        zip codes in the State of Louisiana, and only one zip code in \n        the State of Texas would be changed based on the Office of \n        Management and Budget's revised delineations and updated Rural-\n        Urban Commuting Area codes.\n            (3) After publication of the zip code proposal, the public \n        had 60 days to submit comments, per the requirements of the \n        Administration Procedures Act.\n            (4) On November 13, 2014, the Centers for Medicare & \n        Medicaid Services published a final regulation (79 FR 67748) \n        informing the public, for the first time, that 3.45 percent of \n        zip codes (or 94 zip codes) in the State of California, 13.67 \n        percent of zip codes (or 101 zip codes) in the State of \n        Louisiana, 5.96 percent of zip codes (or 155 zip codes) in the \n        State of Texas, and 7.1 percent of zip codes (or 35 zip codes) \n        in the State of Oregon would change based on the Office of \n        Management and Budget's revised delineations of the Rural-Urban \n        Commuting Area codes.\n            (5) This change from the data that was published in the \n        proposed rule to the data that was published in the final rule \n        did not afford the public proper notice and comment and \n        therefore is an apparent violation of the Administration \n        Procedures Act.\n            (6) Further, the corrected final list of zip code changes \n        was not posted until December 4, 2014, less than a month before \n        the new policy was implemented on January 1, 2015, giving \n        ambulance providers and suppliers insufficient time to prepare \n        for the change in reimbursement.\n            (7) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services also did \n        not provide an impact analysis or certification determining \n        whether there is a significant economic impact on small \n        entities, as required by law.\n            (8) These changes will result in nearly 9 percent cut in \n        reimbursement under the Medicare program for transports \n        originating in areas losing rural status.\n\nSEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF IMPLEMENTATION OF RURAL TO URBAN ZIP CODE \n              RECLASSIFICATIONS FOR MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR AMBULANCE \n              SERVICES.\n\n    (a) Suspension of Rural to Urban Zip Code Reclassifications.--Not \nlater than July 1, 2015, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nshall issue a notice suspending through December 31, 2015, the \nimplementation of the reclassification of rural to urban zip codes for \npayment for ambulance services under the fee schedule under section \n1834(l) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395m(l)), as contained \nin the final rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices in the Federal Register on November 13, 2014 (76 Fed.
