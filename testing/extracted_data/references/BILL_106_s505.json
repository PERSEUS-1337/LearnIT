FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Gifted and talented students give evidence of high \n        performance capability in specific academic fields, or in areas \n        such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership \n        capacity, and require services or activities not ordinarily \n        provided by a school in order to fully develop such \n        capabilities. Gifted and talented students are from all \n        cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic \n        groups. Some such students have disabilities and for some, \n        English is not their first language. Many students from such \n        diverse backgrounds have been historically underrepresented in \n        gifted education programs.\n            (2) Because gifted and talented students generally are more \n        advanced academically, are able to learn more quickly and study \n        in more depth and complexity than others their age, the \n        students have special educational needs that require \n        opportunities and experiences that are different from those \n        generally available in regular education programs.\n            (3) Parents and families are essential partners to schools \n        in developing appropriate educational services for gifted and \n        talented students. They need access to information, research \n        and support regarding the characteristics of gifted children \n        and their educational and social and emotional needs, as well \n        as information on available strategies and resources for \n        education in State and local communities.\n            (4) There currently is no Federal requirement to identify \n        or serve the Nation's approximately 3,000,000 gifted and \n        talented students.\n            (5) While some States and school districts allocate \n        resources to educate gifted and talented students, others do \n        not. Additionally, State laws and State and local funding, \n        identification, and accountability mechanisms vary widely, \n        resulting in a vast disparity of services for this special-\n        needs population.\n            (6) If the United States is to compete successfully in the \n        global economy, it is important that more students achieve to \n        higher levels, and that highly capable students receive an \n        education that prepares them to perform the most highly \n        innovative and creative work that is necessary in today's \n        workplace.\n            (7) The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in \n        the United States on the Third International Mathematics and \n        Science Study (TIMSS) was among the lowest in the world. In \n        each of 5 physics content areas in the study and in each of 3 \n        math content areas in the study, the performance of physics and \n        advanced mathematics students in the United States was among \nthe lowest of participating countries.\n            (8) Elementary school students that are gifted and talented \n        have already mastered 35 to 50 percent of the material covered \n        in a school year in several subject areas before the school \n        year begins.\n            (9) In 1990, fewer than 2 cents out of every $100 spent on \n        elementary and secondary education in the United States was \n        devoted to providing challenging programming for the Nation's \n        gifted and talented students.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide grants to \nStates to support programs, classes, and other services designed to \nmeet the needs of the Nation's gifted and talented students in \nelementary and secondary schools.\n\nSEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION AND ACTIVITIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary is authorized to provide grants to \nStates for use by public schools to develop or expand gifted and \ntalented education programs and to provide direct educational services \nand materials through 1 or more of the following activities:\n            (1) Professional development programs.--States may expend \n        funds to develop and implement programs to address State and \n        local needs for inservice training programs for general \n        educators, specialists in gifted and talented education, \n        administrators, school counselors, or other personnel at the \n        elementary and secondary levels.\n            (2) Technical assistance.--A State may make materials and \n        services available through State regional education service \n        centers, universities, colleges, or other entities.\n            (3) Programs and services.--\n                    (A) Direct services and materials.--States may \n                expend funds to provide direct educational services and \n                materials to gifted and talented students.
