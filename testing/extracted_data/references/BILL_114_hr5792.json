SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Modernizing Outdated and Vulnerable \nEquipment and Information Technology Act of 2016'' or the ``MOVE IT \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) National Institute of Standards and Technology Special \n        Publication 800-145 describes cloud computing as an evolving \n        paradigm for information technology that is a model for \n        enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a \n        shared pool of configurable computing resources (i.e., \n        networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that \n        can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management \n        effort or service provider interaction.\n            (2) Together, the efficiencies, cost savings, and greater \n        computing power enabled by cloud computing has the potential \n        to--\n                    (A) eliminate inappropriate duplication, reduce \n                costs, and address waste, fraud, and abuse in providing \n                Government services that are publicly available;\n                    (B) address the critical need for cybersecurity by \n                design; and\n                    (C) move the Federal Government into a broad \n                digital-services delivery model that could transform \n                the fashion in which the Federal Government provides \n                services to the people of the United States.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) accelerate the acquisition and deployment of cloud \n        computing services by addressing key impediments and roadblocks \n        in funding, development, and acquisition practices;\n            (2) support and expand an efficient Federal certification \n        standard for qualifying cloud services providers under the \n        Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program using a \n        ``qualify once, use many times'' efficiency model that strikes \n        an appropriate balance between--\n                    (A) encouraging the adoption of strong security \n                practices to protect against the harm of cyber \n                intrusions and hacks; and\n                    (B) avoiding the imposition of unduly burdensome \n                and restrictive requirements on cloud computing service \n                providers that would deter investment in innovative \n                cloud computing services;\n            (3) assist agencies in migrating to cloud computing \n        services by providing guidance and oversight of agency \n        enterprise-wide information technology portfolios suitable for \n        and identifiable as suitable for a cloud-based delivery model; \n        and\n            (4) provide for Federal agencies to procure cloud computing \n        services that adhere to sound security practices.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL RISK AND AUTHORIZATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Except as provided under subsection (b), a covered \nagency may not store or process Government information on a Federal \ninformation system with any cloud service provider, unless the provider \nhas an authorization to operate, or a provisional authorization to \noperate, covering the proposed scope of work, from the covered agency \nor the Joint Authorization Board. A covered agency operating under a \nprovisional authorization to operate shall issue an authorization to \noperate as soon as practicable and may not rely on the provisional \nauthorization to operate for the duration of the scope of work.\n    (b) Waiver of Requirements.--\n            (1) In general.--The Director of National Intelligence, or \n        a designee of the Director, may waive the applicability to any \n        national security system of any provision of this section if \n        the Director of National Intelligence, or the designee, \n        determines that such waiver is in the interest of national \n        security.\n            (2) Notification.--Not later than 30 days after exercising \n        a waiver under this subsection, the Director of National \n        Intelligence, or the designee of the Director, as the case may \n        be, shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security and \n        Governmental Affairs and the Select Committee on Intelligence \n        of the Senate and the Committee on Oversight and Government \n        Reform and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of \n        the House of Representatives a statement describing and \n        justifying the waiver.\n    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued as limiting the ability of the Office of Management and \nBudget to update or modify Federal guidelines relating to the security \nof cloud computing.\n\nSEC. 4.
