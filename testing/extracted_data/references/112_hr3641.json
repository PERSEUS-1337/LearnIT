FINDINGS.\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Pinnacles National Monument was established by Presidential \n    Proclamation 796 on January 16, 1908, for the purposes of \n    protecting its rock formations, and expanded by Presidential \n    Proclamation 1660 of May 7, 1923; Presidential Proclamation 1704 of \n    July 2, 1924; Presidential Proclamation 1948 of April 13, 1931; \n    Presidential Proclamation 2050 of July 11, 1933; Presidential \n    Proclamation 2528 of December 5, 1941; Public Law 94-567; and \n    Presidential Proclamation 7266 of January 11, 2000.\n        (2) While the extraordinary geology of Pinnacles National \n    Monument has attracted and enthralled visitors for well over a \n    century, the expanded Monument now serves a critical role in \n    protecting other important natural and cultural resources and \n    ecological processes. This expanded role merits recognition through \n    legislation.\n        (3) Pinnacles National Monument provides the best remaining \n    refuge for floral and fauna species representative of the central \n    California coast and Pacific coast range, including 32 species \n    holding special Federal or State status, not only because of its \n    multiple ecological niches but also because of its long-term \n    protected status with 14,500 acres of Congressionally designated \n    wilderness.\n        (4) Pinnacles National Monument encompasses a unique blend of \n    California heritage from prehistoric and historic Native Americans \n    to the arrival of the Spanish, followed by 18th and 19th century \n    settlers, including miners, cowboys, vaqueros, ranchers, farmers, \n    and homesteaders.\n        (5) Pinnacles National Monument is the only National Park \n    System site within the ancestral home range of the California \n    Condor. The reintroduction of the condor to its traditional range \n    in California is important to the survival of the species, and as a \n    result, the scientific community with centers at the Los Angeles \n    Zoo and San Diego Zoo in California and Buenos Aires Zoo in \n    Argentina looks to Pinnacles National Monument as a leader in \n    California Condor recovery, and as an international partner for \n    condor recovery in South America.\n        (6) The preservation, enhancement, economic and tourism \n    potential and management of the central California coast and \n    Pacific coast range's important natural and cultural resources \n    requires cooperation and partnerships among local property owners, \n    Federal, State, and local government entities and the private \n    sector.\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PINNACLES NATIONAL PARK.\n    (a) Establishment and Purpose.--There is hereby established \nPinnacles National Park in the State of California for the purposes \nof--\n        (1) preserving and interpreting for the benefit of future \n    generations the chaparral, grasslands, blue oak woodlands, and \n    majestic valley oak savanna ecosystems of the area, the area's \n    geomorphology, riparian watersheds, unique flora and fauna, and the \n    ancestral and cultural history of native Americans, settlers and \n    explorers; and\n        (2) interpreting the recovery program for the California Condor \n    and the international significance of the program.\n    (b) Boundaries.--The boundaries of Pinnacles National Park are as \ngenerally depicted on the map entitled ``Proposed: Pinnacles National \nPark Designation Change'', numbered 114/111,724, and dated December \n2011. The map shall be on file and available for public inspection in \nthe appropriate offices of the National Park Service.\n    (c) Abolishment of Current Pinnacles National Monument.--\n        (1) In general.--In light of the establishment of Pinnacles \n    National Park, Pinnacles National Monument is hereby abolished and \n    the lands and interests therein are incorporated within and made \n    part of Pinnacles National Park. Any funds available for purposes \n    of the monument shall be available for purposes of the park.\n        (2) References.--Any references in law (other than in this \n    Act), regulation, document, record, map or other paper of the \n    United States to Pinnacles National Monument shall be considered a \n    reference to Pinnacles National Park.\n    (d) Administration.--The Secretary of the Interior shall administer \nPinnacles National Park in accordance with this Act and laws generally \napplicable to units of the National Park System, including the National \nPark Service Organic Act (16 U.S.C. 1, 2-4).\nSEC. 4. REDESIGNATION OF PINNACLES WILDERNESS AS HAIN WILDERNESS.\n    Subsection (i) of the first section of Public Law 94-567 (90 Stat. \n2693; 16 U.S.C. 1132 note) is amended by striking ``Pinnacles \nWilderness'' and inserting ``Hain Wilderness''. Any reference in a law, \nmap, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States \nto the Pinnacles Wilderness shall be deemed to be a reference to the \nHain Wilderness.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
