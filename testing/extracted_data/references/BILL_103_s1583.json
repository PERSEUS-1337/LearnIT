CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Iran's Violations of Human Rights.--The Congress makes the \nfollowing findings with respect to Iran's violations of human rights:\n            (1) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n        Representative on Human Rights, Amnesty International, and the \n        United States Department of State, the Government of Iran has \n        conducted assassinations outside of Iran, such as that of \n        former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar for which the \n        Government of France issued arrest warrants for several Iranian \n        governmental officials.\n            (2) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n        Representative on Human Rights and by Amnesty International, \n        the Government of Iran has conducted revolutionary trials which \n        do not meet internationally recognized standards of fairness or \n        justice. These trials have included such violations as a lack \n        of procedural safeguards, trial times of 5 minutes or less, \n        limited access to defense counsel, forced confessions, and \n        summary executions.\n            (3) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n        Representative on Human Rights, the Government of Iran \n        systematically represses its Baha'i population. Persecutions of \n        this small religious community include assassinations, \n        arbitrary arrests, electoral prohibitions, and denial of \n        applications for documents such as passports.\n            (4) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n        Representative on Human Rights, the Government of Iran \n        suppresses opposition to its government. Political \n        organizations such as the Freedom Movement are banned from \n        parliamentary elections, have their telephones tapped and their \n        mail opened, and are systematically harassed and intimidated.\n            (5) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n        Representative on Human Rights and Amnesty International, the \n        Government of Iran has failed to recognize the importance of \n        international human rights. This includes suppression of \n        Iranian human rights movements such as the Freedom Movement, \n        lack of cooperation with international human rights \n        organizations such as the International Red Cross, and an \n        overall apathy toward human rights in general. This lack of \n        concern prompted the Special Representative to state in his \n        report that Iran had made ``no appreciable progress towards \n        improved compliance with human rights in accordance with the \n        current international instruments''.\n            (6) As cited by Amnesty International, the Government of \n        Iran continues to torture its political prisoners. Torture \n        methods include burns, arbitrary blows, severe beatings, and \n        positions inducing pain.\n    (b) Iran's Acts of International Terrorism.--The Congress makes the \nfollowing findings, based on the records of the Department of State, \nwith respect to Iran's acts of international terrorism:\n            (1) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n        Iran was the greatest supporter of state terrorism in 1992, \n        supporting over 20 terrorist acts, including the bombing of the \n        Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires that killed 29 people.\n            (2) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n        Iran is a sponsor of radical religious groups that have used \n        terrorism as a tool. These include such groups as Hezballah, \n        HAMAS, the Turkish Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the \n        Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC).\n            (3) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n        Iran has resorted to international terrorism as a means of \n        obtaining political gain. These actions have included not only \n        the assassination of former Prime Minister Bakhitiar, but the \n        death sentence imposed on Salman Rushdie, and the assassination \n        of the leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran.\n            (4) As cited by the Department of State and the Vice \n        President's Task Force on Combatting Terrorism, the Government \n        of Iran has long been a proponent of terrorist actions against \n        the United States, beginning with the takeover of the United \n        States Embassy in Tehran in 1979. Iranian support of extremist \n        groups have led to the following attacks upon the United States \n        as well:\n                    (A) The car bomb attack on the United States \n                Embassy in Beirut killing 49 in 1983 by the Hezballah.\n                    (B) The car bomb attack on the United States Marine \n                Barracks in Beirut killing 241 in 1983 by the \n                Hezballah.\n                    (C) The assassination of American University \n                President in 1984 by the Hezballah.\n                    (D) The kidnapping of all American hostages in \n                Lebanon from 1984-1986 by the Hezballah.\n\nSEC. 3.
