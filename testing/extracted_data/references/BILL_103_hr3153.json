REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH COST MORTGAGES.\n\n    ``(a) Disclosures.--In addition to any other disclosures required \nunder this title, for each high cost mortgage, the creditor shall \nprovide the following written disclosures in clear language and in \nconspicuous type size and format, segregated from other information as \na separate document:\n            ``(1) The following statement: `If you obtain this loan, \n        the lender will have a mortgage on your home. You could lose \n        your home, and any money you have put into it, if you do not \n        meet your obligations under the loan.'.\n            ``(2) The initial annual percentage rate.\n            ``(3) The consumer's gross monthly cash income, as verified \n        by the creditor, the total initial monthly payment, and the \n        amount of funds that will remain to meet other obligations of \n        the consumer.\n            ``(4) In the case of a variable rate loan, a statement that \n        the annual percentage rate and the interest rate could \n        increase, and the maximum interest rate and payment.\n            ``(5) In the case of a variable rate loan with an initial \n        annual percentage rate that is different than the one which \n        would be applied using the contract index after the initial \n        period, a statement of the period of time the initial rate will \n        be in effect, and the rate or rates that will go into effect \n        after the initial period is over, assuming that current \n        interest rates prevail.\n            ``(6) A statement that the consumer is not required to \n        complete the transaction merely because he or she has received \n        disclosures or signed a loan application.\n            ``(7) A statement as follows: `Under Federal law, this is a \n        high cost mortgage. You may be able to obtain a less expensive \n        loan.'.\n    ``(b) Time of Disclosures.--The disclosures required by this \nsection shall be given no later than 3 business days prior to \nconsummation of the transaction. A creditor may not change the terms of \nthe loan after providing the disclosures required by this section.\n    ``(c) No Prepayment Penalty.--\n            ``(1) In general.--A high cost mortgage may not contain \n        terms under which a consumer must pay a prepayment penalty for \n        paying all or part of the principal prior to the date on which \n        such principal is due. If the date of maturity of the high cost \n        mortgage is accelerated for any reason, the consumer is \n        entitled to a rebate that complies with paragraph (2). No high \n        cost mortgage shall provide for a default interest rate that is \n        higher than the interest rate provided by the note for a \n        performing loan.\n            ``(2) Rebate computation.--For purposes of this subsection, \n        any method of computing rebates of a finance charge less \n        favorable to the consumer than the actuarial method using \n        simple interest is a prepayment penalty.\n            ``(3) Certain other fees prohibited.--An agreement to \n        refinance a high cost mortgage by the same creditor or an \n        affiliate of the creditor may not require the consumer to pay \n        points, discount fees, or prepaid finance charges on the \n        portion of the loan refinanced. For the purpose of this \n        paragraph, the term `affiliate' has the same meaning as it does \n        in section 2(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.\n    ``(d) No Balloon Payments.--A high cost mortgage may not include \nterms under which the aggregate amount of the regular periodic payments \nwould not fully amortize the outstanding principal balance.\n    ``(e) No Negative Amortization.--A high cost mortgage may not \ninclude terms under which the outstanding principal balance will \nincrease over the course of the loan.\n    ``(f) No Prepaid Payments.--A high cost mortgage may not include \nterms under which more than 2 periodic payments required under the loan \nare consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds provided to \nthe consumer.\n    ``(g) Unfair, Deceptive, or Evasive Acts Prohibited.--Creditors of \ncontracts governed by this section shall not commit, in the making, \nservicing, or collecting of a high cost mortgage, any act or practice \nwhich is unfair or deceptive, including any of the following:\n            ``(1) Entering into a home equity loan if there is no \n        reasonable probability that the homeowner will be able to make \n        payments according to the terms of the loan.\n            ``(2) Taking advantage of the borrower's infirmities, lack \n        of education or sophistication, or language skills, necessary \n        to understand fully the terms of the transaction.\n            ``(3) Refinancing other loans owed by the homeowner which \n        had not been accelerated by reason of default of the homeowner \n        prior to the application for the home equity loan, unless the \n        new loan is at a lower interest rate or has lower monthly \n        payments.\n            ``(4) Financing a mortgage broker's commission, unless the \n        borrower entered into a separate written contract with the \n        broker prior to the date of application for the home equity \n        loan, which stated the dollar amount of the commission, and \n        which was provided to the borrower prior to the application.\n            ``(5) Taking action or interfering with any other consumer \n        protection laws or regulation designed to protect the \n        homeowner.\n            ``(6) Assisting in the falsification of information on the \n        application for a home equity loan.\n            ``(7) Disbursing to a home improvement contractor more than \n        80 percent of funds due under a home improvement contract which \n        exceeds $10,000, before the completion of the work due under \n        the home improvement contract, or making any disbursement for a \n        home improvement contract in a form other than an instrument \n        jointly payable to the borrower and the contractor.\n            ``(8)(A) Engaging in any other unfair, deceptive, or \n        unconscionable conduct which creates a likelihood of confusion \n        or misunderstanding.\n            ``(B) Any attempt to evade the provisions of this section \n        by any devise, subterfuge, or pretense whatsoever is deemed to \n        be unfair conduct under this paragraph.\n    ``(h) Right of Rescission.--For the purpose of section 125, any \ncontract with provisions prohibited by this section is deemed to not \ninclude material disclosures required under this title. Any provision \nin a high cost mortgage which violates section 125 shall not be \nenforceable.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
