FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) bounty hunters, also known as bail enforcement officers \n        or recovery agents, provide law enforcement officers and the \n        courts with valuable assistance in recovering fugitives from \n        justice;\n            (2) regardless of the differences in their duties, skills, \n        and responsibilities, the public has had difficulty in \n        discerning the difference between law enforcement officers and \n        bounty hunters;\n            (3) the availability of bail as an alternative to the \n        pretrial detention or unsecured release of criminal defendants \n        is important to the effective functioning of the criminal \n        justice system;\n            (4) the safe and timely return to custody of fugitives who \n        violate bail contracts is an important matter of public safety, \n        as is the return of any other fugitive from justice;\n            (5) bail bond agents are widely regulated by the States, \n        whereas bounty hunters are largely unregulated;\n            (6) the public safety requires the employment of qualified, \n        well-trained bounty hunters; and\n            (7) in the course of their duties, bounty hunters often \n        move in and affect interstate commerce.\n\nSEC. 3.
