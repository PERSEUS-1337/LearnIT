FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Migratory Bird Treaty Act was enacted in 1918 to \n        implement the 1916 Convention for the Protection of Migratory \n        Birds between the United States and Great Britain (for Canada). \n        The Act was later amended to reflect similar agreements with \n        Mexico, Japan, and the former Soviet Union.\n            (2) Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the \n        Secretary of the Interior is authorized to promulgate \n        regulations specifying when, how, and whether migratory birds \n        may be hunted.\n            (3) Contained within these regulations are prohibitions on \n        certain methods of hunting migratory game birds to better \n        manage and conserve this resource. These prohibitions, many of \n        which were recommended by sportsmen, have been in place for \n        over 60 years and have received broad acceptance among the \n        hunting community with one principal exception relating to the \n        application and interpretation of the prohibitions on the \n        hunting of migratory game birds by the aid of baiting, or on or \n        over any baited area.\n            (4) The prohibitions regarding the hunting of migratory \n        game birds by the aid of bait, or on or over bait, have been \n        fraught with interpretive difficulties on the part of law \n        enforcement, the hunting community, and courts of law. Hunters \n        who desire to comply with applicable regulations have been \n        subject to citation for violations of the regulations due to \n        the lack of clarity, inconsistent interpretations, and \n        enforcement. The baiting regulations have been the subject of \n        multiple congressional hearings and a law enforcement advisory \n        commission.\n            (5) Restrictions on the hunting of migratory game birds by \n        the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, must be \n        clarified in a manner that recognizes the national and \n        international importance of protecting the migratory bird \n        resource while ensuring consistency and appropriate enforcement \n        including the principles of ``fair chase''.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFYING HUNTING PROHIBITIONS.\n\n    Section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 704) is \namended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a)'' after ``Sec. 3.''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b)(1) No person shall--\n            ``(A) take any migratory game bird by the aid of baiting, \n        or on or over any baited area, where the person knows or \n        reasonably should have known that the area is a baited area; or\n            ``(B) place or direct the placement of bait on or adjacent \n        to an area for the purpose of causing, inducing, or allowing \n        any person to take or attempt to take any migratory game bird \n        by the aid of baiting or on or over the baited area.\n    ``(2) Nothing in this subsection prohibits any of the following:\n            ``(A) The taking of any migratory game bird, including \n        waterfowl, from a blind or other place of concealment \n        camouflaged with natural vegetation.\n            ``(B) The taking of any migratory game bird, including \n        waterfowl, on or over--\n                    ``(i) standing crops, flooded standing crops \n                (including aquatics), flooded harvested croplands, \n                grain crops properly shocked on the field where grown;
