FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Long-term care refers to a broad range and network of \n        health and social services that are used by persons who cannot \n        care for themselves independently because of a physical, \n        cognitive, or mental disability, or a combination thereof.\n            (2) Well over 9,400,000 adults receive long-term care in \n        the United States, and over 1,000,000 children living in the \n        community have long-term care limitations.\n            (3) The number of people who are in need of long-term care \n        is expected to grow due to the Nation's large aging population, \n        longer life spans among the chronically ill and persons living \n        with disabilities, and the higher incidence of acquired \n        disabilities from unmanaged conditions such as heart and \n        respiratory disease, obesity, stroke, and diabetes.\n            (4) Most people with long-term care needs prefer to live at \n        home and remain in their communities. These individuals receive \n        assistance primarily through informal caregivers, families, and \n        friends who provide care without compensation.\n            (5) Family caregivers can endure emotional and physical \n        stress, and often make significant financial and career \n        sacrifices to provide long-term care.\n            (6) Formal providers range from institutional settings and \n        other residential care facilities to a variety of agencies and \n        organizations that provide a wide array of home and community-\n        based services such as personal care, home-delivered meals \n        programs, transportation, and adult day care programs.\n            (7) Direct care workers provide the majority of paid long-\n        term care services to individuals with long-term care \n        limitations. Health care providers have expressed difficulty in \n        attracting and retaining direct care workers and the demand for \n        these workers is expected to increase.\n            (8) Planning for long-term care expenses is an essential \n        part of financial planning, however, most individuals and \n        families do not plan for such expenses.\n            (9) Identifying and arranging for long-term care services \n        can be a complex task for individuals and their families. \n        Uneven distribution of services in communities and across \n        States and United States territories often leads to \n        difficulties in accessing services.\n            (10) A significant portion of formal long-term care costs \n        are financed with personal funds and this method of payment \n        potentially poses economic burdens to individuals and their \n        families that can result in financial ruin, including medical \n        bankruptcy.\n            (11) The largest public payer for long-term care is \n        Medicaid, which allows States to enforce strict requirements \n        for eligibility, and discourages some Medicaid recipients from \n        acquiring a higher income for fear of losing Medicaid benefits.\n            (12) Decisions pertaining to long-term care are often \n        emotionally charged and culturally contentious, and present \n        emotional and financial challenges for patients, families, and \n        their providers.\n            (13) Although the financing and delivery of long-term care \n        plays a strong role in the way that such care is provided and \n        received, there has never been a comprehensive national plan \n        for the long-term care, particularly regarding home and \n        community-based services.\n            (14) The last time that Congress comprehensively reviewed \n        policy options for long-term care reform was nearly two decades \n        ago, under a U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health \n        Care referred to as the Pepper Commission.\n            (15) Limited data on the use and need for long-term care \n        exists thereby hindering the development of a targeted national \n        strategy to address the disparities in routine access to these \n        services.\n            (16) Personal choice, access, cost (including reimbursement \n        policy), effectiveness, and quality standards must be \n        adequately addressed when composing a national strategy for \n        long-term care.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT; POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE \n              NATIONAL STRATEGY.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in \nthis Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a commission \n(in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'') that is designed to \nconstruct a comprehensive national strategy (described in subsection \n(b)(2)) on how to increase the affordability, accessibility, and \neffectiveness of long-term care and community services in the United \nStates and United States Territories.\n    (b) Policy Recommendations and Comprehensive National Strategy.--\n            (1) Policy recommendations.--The Commission's policy \n        recommendations under this Act must address economic, \n        geographic, cultural, social, transportation, workforce, and \n        other factors that limit access to quality home, community, and \n        institutional services that can result in the need for more \n        costly and less effective care, compromise the financial, \n        mental, and physical well-being of caregivers, compromise the \n        independence, mental health, physical health and dignity of \n        individuals, or result in the foregoing of needed services.\n            (2) Comprehensive national strategy.--The comprehensive \n        national strategy described in this paragraph shall be \n        developed not later than 2 years after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act and shall provide recommendations on how \n        to--\n                    (A) facilitate and maintain necessary changes in \n                business practices, public policy, care processes, and \n                administrative systems to support a consumer-oriented \n                long-term care system that delivers efficient, cost-\n                effective, and consumer-centered care and services;\n                    (B) address issues of waste, fraud, and abuse by \n                providers, agencies, facilities, professional and \n                paraprofessional staff, and others involved in \n                institutional, home, and community health settings by \n                targeting chronically poor performing providers, \n                decertifying persistently substandard providers, and \n                monitoring institutional, home, and community entities \n                to ensure compliance with State and Federal quality \n                standards and criteria;\n                    (C) make priorities of preventive health and the \n                effective management of chronic diseases such as heart \n                and respiratory disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, stroke, \n                and obesity, in order to prevent them from becoming \n                permanently debilitating or disabling and help decrease \n                future dependence on long-term care;\n                    (D) establish and support existing and future \n                evidence-based research efforts among States, \n                government entities, organizations, and stakeholders \n                that are designed to address gaps in data and knowledge \n                about long-term care and the populations in need of \n                these services, and provide information on the \n                effectiveness and consequences of long-term care \n                programs and policies;\n                    (E) facilitate partnership and coordination among \n                State and Federal health care entities to improve \n                working conditions, training, management, requirements, \n                and competencies for long-term care workers \n                (particularly home health aides and other \n                paraprofessionals) to prevent turnover rates, staff \n                shortages, patient abuse, and improve job skills, job \n                satisfaction, and delivery of care;\n                    (F) identify and address flaws in reimbursement \n                policies for long-term care services through Medicare \n                under title XVIII of the Social Security Act and \n                Medicaid under title XIX of such Act, and decrease the \n                reliance on out-of-pocket-spending for long-term care;\n                    (G) improve access to affordable and safe housing \n                and transportation options for persons requiring long-\n                term care and community services;\n                    (H) increase access to home and community-based \n                services through Medicaid to meet consumer demands and \n                preferences and emphasize cost-effective non-\n                institutional care alternatives that provide \n                satisfaction and high quality care to all those \n                requiring long-term care services;\n                    (I) assist agencies and the private sector on \n                effectively disseminating information to consumers \n                about the various types of long-term care networks and \n                options available to consumers, educate consumers about \n                the potential benefits and risks of certain long-care \n                options, and inform consumers about State-specific \n                information regarding long-term care services;\n                    (J) increase the use and affordability of long-term \n                care insurance and other fiscally responsible measures \n                to finance long-term care services;\n                    (K) sufficiently fund and support programs, \n                facilities, and initiatives that have proven to \n                ameliorate the financial, physical, and mental stress \n                on informal caregivers, and improve their ability to \n                deliver services to individuals requiring long-term \n                care; and\n                    (L) sufficiently fund and support programs, \n                entities, and initiatives that have proven to help \n                individuals achieve and maintain their highest possible \n                level of independence, health, and function.\n        The comprehensive national strategy would include as available, \n        pursuant to request by the Committee to the Congressional \n        Budget Office, an analysis of the costs and savings that would \n        result from executing this comprehensive strategy on long-term \n        care to the extent possible.\n\nSEC. 4.
