FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Nation's beaches are a valuable public resource \n        used for recreation by millions of people annually;\n            (2) the beaches of coastal States are hosts to many out-of-\n        State and international visitors;\n            (3) tourism in the coastal zone generates billions of \n        dollars annually;\n            (4) increased population has contributed to the decline in \n        the environmental quality of coastal waters;\n            (5) pollution in coastal waters is not restricted by State \n        and other political boundaries;\n            (6) each coastal State has its own method of testing the \n        quality of its coastal recreation waters, providing varying \n        degrees of protection to the public; and\n            (7) the adoption of standards by coastal States for \n        monitoring the quality of coastal recreation waters, and the \n        posting of signs at beaches notifying the public during periods \n        when the standards are exceeded, would enhance public health \n        and safety.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require uniform \nprocedures for beach testing and monitoring to protect public safety \nand improve the environmental quality of coastal recreation waters.\n\nSEC. 3. WATER QUALITY CRITERIA AND STANDARDS.\n\n    (a) Issuance of Criteria.--Section 304(a) of the Federal Water \nPollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)) is amended by adding at the \nend the following:\n            ``(9) Coastal recreation waters.--(A) The Administrator, \n        after consultation with appropriate Federal and State agencies \n        and other interested persons, shall issue within 18 months \n        after the effective date of this paragraph (and review and \n        revise from time to time thereafter) water quality criteria for \n        pathogens in coastal recreation waters. Such criteria shall--\n                    ``(i) be based on the best available scientific \n                information;\n                    ``(ii) be sufficient to protect public health and \n                safety in case of any reasonably anticipated exposure \n                to pollutants as a result of swimming, bathing, or \n                other body contact activities; and\n                    ``(iii) include specific numeric criteria \n                calculated to reflect public health risks from short-\n                term increases in pathogens in coastal recreation \n                waters resulting from rainfall, malfunctions of \n                wastewater treatment works, and other causes.\n            ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `coastal \n        recreation waters' means Great Lakes and marine coastal waters \n        commonly used by the public for swimming, bathing, or other \n        similar primary contact purposes.''.\n    (b) Standards.--\n            (1) Adoption by states.--A State shall adopt water quality \n        standards for coastal recreation waters which, at a minimum, \n        are consistent with the criteria published by the Administrator \n        under section 304(a)(9) of the Federal Water Pollution Control \n        Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(9)), as amended by this Act, not later \n        than 3 years following the date of such publication. Such water \n        quality standards shall be developed in accordance with the \n        requirements of section 303(c) of the Federal Water Pollution \n        Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1313(c)). A State shall incorporate such \n        standards into all appropriate programs into which such State \n        would incorporate water quality standards adopted under section \n        303(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \n        1313(c)).\n            (2) Failure of states to adopt.--If a State has not \n        complied with paragraph (1) by the last day of the 3-year \n        period beginning on the date of publication of criteria under \n        section 304(a)(9) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n        (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(9)), as amended by this Act, the \n        Administrator shall promulgate water quality standards for \n        coastal recreation waters for the State under applicable \n        provisions of section 303 of the Federal Water Pollution \n        Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1313). The water quality standards for \n        coastal recreation waters shall be consistent with the criteria \n        published by the Administrator under section 304(a)(9) of the \n        Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(9)), as \n        amended by this Act. The State shall use the standards issued \n        by the Administrator in implementing all programs for which \n        water quality standards for coastal recreation waters are used.\n\nSEC. 4.
