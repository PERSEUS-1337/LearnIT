FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) from 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the \n        Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its \n        tributaries to determine sites at which power could be produced \n        at low cost;\n            (2) under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. \n        803(e)), when licenses are issued involving tribal land within \n        an Indian reservation, a reasonable annual charge shall be \n        fixed for the use of the land, subject to the approval of the \n        Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the land;\n            (3) in August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission, an \n        agency of the State of Washington, received a preliminary \n        permit from the Federal Power Commission for water power \n        development at the Grand Coulee site;\n            (4) had the Columbia Basin Commission or a private entity \n        developed the site, the Spokane Tribe would have been entitled \n        to a reasonable annual charge for the use of the land of the \n        Spokane Tribe;\n            (5) in the mid-1930s, the Federal Government, which is not \n        subject to licensing under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 792 \n        et seq.)--\n                    (A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project;

and\n                    (B) it would be appropriate for the Spokane and \n                Colville Tribes to receive a share of revenue from the \n                disposition of power produced at Grand Coulee Dam;\n            (7) in the Act of June 29, 1940 (16 U.S.C. 835d et seq.), \n        Congress--\n                    (A) granted to the United States--\n                            (i) in aid of the construction, operation, \n                        and maintenance of the Columbia Basin Project, \n                        all the right, title, and interest of the \n                        Spokane Tribe and Colville Tribes in and to the \n                        tribal and allotted land within the Spokane and \n                        Colville Reservations, as designated by the \n                        Secretary of the Interior from time to time;

and\n                    (B) provided that compensation for the land and \n                other interests was to be determined by the Secretary \n                in such amounts as the Secretary determined to be just \n                and equitable;\n            (8) pursuant to that Act, the Secretary paid--\n                    (A) to the Spokane Tribe, $4,700;

and\n            (17) by vote of the Spokane tribal membership, the Spokane \n        Tribe has resolved that the payments and delegation made \n        pursuant to this Act constitute fair and equitable compensation \n        for the past and continued use of Spokane tribal land for the \n        production of hydropower at Grand Coulee Dam.\n\nSEC. 3.
