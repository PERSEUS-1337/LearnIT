FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Working people are subject to social security taxes as \n        well as income taxes, and for over 90 percent of the population \n        the combined tax on earned income is higher than the income tax \n        rates of 15 percent and 28 percent that apply to unearned \n        income.\n            (2) There is no logical reason why social security taxes \n        should be imposed only on earnings and not on unearned income \n        (such as dividends, interest, rent income, and capital gains).\n\nSEC. 3.
