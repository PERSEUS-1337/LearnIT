FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A well-informed citizenry is essential for the well-\n        being of a democratic society.\n            (2) Access to Government information is essential for \n        citizens who seek to make the Federal Government accountable \n        for its actions.\n            (3) The public should have timely, complete, equitable, and \n        affordable access to Government information.\n            (4) Federal agencies should use modern information \n        technology for the benefit of citizens of the United States.\n            (5) Government information is a national resource that \n        should be treated as a public good.\n            (6) Government information is a valuable economic asset \n        that belongs to the public.\n            (7) Taxpayers pay for the creation, collection, and \n        organization of Government information and should not be \n        required to pay excessive fees to receive and use that \n        information.\n            (8) It is unnecessarily difficult for citizens to provide \n        Federal agencies with comments and suggestions on Federal \n        information policies. As a result, many Federal agencies do not \n        take into account the public interest in the information \n        resources they manage.\n            (9) Federal agencies have been slow in developing standards \n        for record and file formats, software query command structures, \n        and other important topics that will make Government \n        information easier to obtain and use.\n            (10) Many Federal agencies do not provide timely access to \n        Government information products and services at reasonable \n        costs.\n\nSEC. 3.
