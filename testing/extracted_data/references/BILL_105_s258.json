FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the National Cheese Exchange, located in Green Bay, \n        Wisconsin, is the only cash market for bulk cheese in the \n        United States, trades less than 1 percent of all bulk cheese \n        sold nationally, and currently functions as the only price \n        discovery mechanism for bulk cheese throughout the industry;\n            (2) the National Cheese Exchange opinion price directly \n        influences milk prices paid to farmers because of its use in \n        the Department of Agriculture's basic formula price under \n        Federal milk marketing orders;\n            (3) opinion prices at the National Cheese Exchange \n        influence the price for much of the bulk cheese bought and sold \n        in the United States and directly or indirectly influences the \n        price of milk paid to producers throughout the United States;\n            (4) the National Cheese Exchange is a thinly traded, \n        illiquid, and highly concentrated market that is increasingly \n        volatile;\n            (5) a report issued by the University of Wisconsin and \n        funded by the United States Department of Agriculture concluded \n        that the National Cheese Exchange is vulnerable to price \n        manipulation;\n            (6) the thin nature of the National Cheese Exchange and the \n        characteristics of that market that may facilitate price \n        manipulation have led to widespread producer concern about the \n        validity of prices at the National Cheese Exchange; and\n            (7) it is in the national interest to ensure that prices on \n        cash markets that directly and indirectly affect milk prices \n        are determined in the most competitive manner practicable and \n        to improve price discovery for milk and other dairy products.\n\nSEC. 3. BASIC FORMULA PRICE.\n\n    Section 143(a) of the Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. \n7253(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(5) National cheese exchange.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--In carrying out this subsection \n                and section 8c(5) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 \n                U.S.C. 608c(5)), reenacted with amendments by the \n                Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, the \n                Secretary shall not, directly or indirectly, use a \n                price established on the National Cheese Exchange to \n                determine the basic formula price for milk or any other \n                milk price regulated by the Secretary.\n                    ``(B) Regulations.--Not later than 60 days after \n                the date of enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary \n                shall review and amend the applicable regulations \n                promulgated by the Secretary to ensure that the \n                regulations comply with subparagraph (A).\n                    ``(C) Effect on further revision.--Subparagraph (B) \n                shall not preclude a further revision to, or \n                replacement of, the basic formula price under this \n                subsection or section 8c(5) of the Agricultural \n                Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 608c(5)), reenacted with \n                amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act \n                of 1937, except that the revision or replacement shall \n                be consistent with subparagraph (A).''.\n\nSEC. 4.
