Joint regulatory reform task \nforces shall implement this Act in coordination with the regulatory \nreform task forces of their members' respective agencies.\n    (d) Tasks.--Each Regulatory Reform Task Force shall evaluate \nexisting regulations and make recommendations to the head of the agency \nregarding repeal, replacement, or amendment, consistent with applicable \nlaw. The task force shall complete a review of each regulation issued \nby the agency not later than 5 years after the establishment of the \ntask force. For each regulation reviewed, the task force shall estimate \nthe cost savings that would be achieved if the agency followed the \nrecommendation from the task force.

In identifying regulatory actions for repeal, the head of each \nagency shall prioritize those regulatory actions that the Regulatory \nReform Task Force of the agency identified under section (4)(d)(2). For \neach regulatory action identified, the head of the agency must confirm \nthat the agency can continue to achieve regulatory objectives (such as \nhealth or environmental protection) if the identified regulatory \nactions were to be repealed.\n    (b) Total Incremental Cost for 2018.--For fiscal year 2018, the \ntotal incremental cost of all new significant regulatory actions at \neach agency and any repealed regulatory action, to be finalized in \nfiscal year 2018 shall be no greater than zero, or consistent with a \nwaiver provided by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n    (c) Offset of New Incremental Costs.--Any new incremental cost \nassociated with a new significant regulatory action shall be offset by \nthe elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior \nregulatory actions.

If the \nDirector does not set a net amount of incremental costs allowed for an \nagency, the net incremental cost allowed shall be zero. No significant \nregulatory actions exceeding the agency's total incremental cost \nallowance may be made in that fiscal year, unless required by law or \napproved in writing by the Director. If an agency does not exhaust all \nthe incremental cost allowance for a fiscal year, that remaining \nbalance may be included in the incremental allowance for the subsequent \nfiscal year, in addition to the allowance otherwise available for the \nsubsequent fiscal year. An agency's net incremental cost allowance \nmay--\n            (1) require an increase, decrease, or no change to the \n        total regulatory costs;\n            (2) include any existing regulatory action that imposes \n        costs and the repeal or revision of which will produce verified \n        savings; and\n            (3) include meaningful burden reduction through the repeal \n        or streamlining of mandatory reporting, recordkeeping, or \n        disclosure requirements.\n    (e) Guidance.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Director shall provide the heads of each \nagency with additional guidance on the implementation of the \nrequirements in this section, including a reasonable standard or \nmethodology for estimating the reduction in incremental cost achieved \nby repealing a regulatory action.\n\nSEC. 8.

The Director may revoke such a waiver at any time. The \nDirector shall maintain a publicly available list of each agency that \nis operating under a waiver issued under this section.
