SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING NEW \n              TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF INFLUENZA VACCINES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n            (1) 30 years ago, more than a dozen companies produced the \n        influenza vaccine in the United States. As of 2004, only 2 \n        companies make the vaccine for the United States.\n            (2) Currently, the influenza vaccine is grown in eggs \n        through a process that takes approximately 6 months and \n        consumes tens of thousands of eggs.\n            (3) Companies are developing new technologies for the \n        faster and safer production of the influenza vaccine. For \n        example, one manufacturer is testing a process that relies on \n        cell lines from silk moths, a technique that promises to shave \n        the production time by at least a month and reduce the costs \n        significantly.\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that it is \nprudent to allocate a greater percentage of the amounts appropriated to \nthe National Institutes of Health for research to the development of \nnew technologies for the production of influenza vaccines."
