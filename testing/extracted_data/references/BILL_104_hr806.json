FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, is an \n        installation that is vital to the national security interests \n        of the United States.\n            (2) The United States established the Range during World \n        War II, and, in doing so, temporarily displacing ranchers and \n        miners who owned land within the boundaries of the Range or \n        whose livelihood depended on such land.\n            (3) These ranchers and miners made a significant \n        contribution to the effort of the United States to win World \n        War II and to the post-war national defense program by vacating \n        land within the Range at the request of the United States \n        Government.\n            (4) In 1975, all land within the Range was permanently \n        taken by the United States Government.\n            (5) The United States Government has never fully \n        compensated ranchers and miners who owned land within the \n        boundaries of the Range or whose livelihood depended on such \n        land for the value of the land and claims taken by the \n        Government.\n            (6) The method utilized by the United States Government to \n        compensate such ranchers differs from the method utilized by \n        the Government to compensate ranchers during the taking of land \n        in the area in New Mexico that became the McGregor Range and \n        Extension Area of the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, Texas. \n        Ranchers owning property in that were fully compensated for \n        their ranches as operating units, including the carrying \n        capacity of public domain lands associated with such ranches.\n            (7) Though the Legacy Fellowship Program in Natural and \n        Cultural Resource Management established by section 328 of \n        Public Law 102-484, the Department of Defense is sponsoring a \n        5-year research project on the historical significance of \n        ranching in the area that is now the White Sands Missile Range.\n            (8) The United States Government has an obligation to pay \n        full compensation to ranchers and miners who owned land within \n        the boundaries of the Range or whose livelihood depended on \n        such land for the value of the land and claims that were taken \n        by the Government.\n\n SEC. 3.
