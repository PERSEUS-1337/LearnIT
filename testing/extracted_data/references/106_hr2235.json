FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase occurs in \n        2003, two hundred years after the United States, under the \n        leadership of President Thomas Jefferson and after due \n        consideration and approval by Congress, paid $15 million to \n        France to acquire the vast area in the western half of the \n        Mississippi River Basin;\n            (2) the Louisiana Purchase was the largest peaceful land \n        transaction in history and virtually doubled the size of the \n        United States;\n            (3) the Louisiana Purchase opened the heart of the North \n        American continent for exploration, settlement, and \n        achievement, as exemplified by the Lewis and Clark Expedition \n        of 1803 to 1806, which secured through heroic efforts the first \n        documentation of the inhabitants, riches, and grandeur of this \n        new territory of the United States;\n            (4) in the wake of the Louisiana Purchase and Lewis and \n        Clark Expedition, immigrants from around the world came to the \n        American frontier, which became emblematic of the search for \n        political, economic, and spiritual freedom; and\n            (5) commemoration of the Louisiana Purchase and the opening \n        of the West can enhance public understanding of the impact of \n        Westward expansion on American society and can provide lessons \n        for democratic governance in our own time.\n\nSEC. 3.
