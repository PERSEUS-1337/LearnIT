REGULATIONS APPROPRIATE TO BUSINESS MODELS.\n\n    (a) In General.--For any regulatory action occurring subsequent to \nenactment of this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw, the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies shall--\n            (1) take into consideration the risk profile and business \n        models of the various institutions or classes of institutions \n        subject to the regulatory action;\n            (2) determine the necessity, appropriateness, and impact of \n        applying such regulatory action to such institutions or classes \n        of institutions; and\n            (3) tailor such regulatory action applicable to such \n        institutions or class of institutions in a manner that limits \n        the regulatory compliance impact, cost, liability risk, and \n        other burdens as is appropriate for the risk profile and \n        business model involved.\n    (b) Other Considerations.--In satisfying the requirements of \nsubsection (a) and when implementing such regulatory action, the \nFederal financial institutions regulatory agencies shall also \nconsider--\n            (1) the impact that such regulatory action, both by itself \n        and in conjunction with the aggregate effect of other \n        regulations, has on the ability of the institution or class of \n        institutions to flexibly serve evolving and diverse customer \n        needs;\n            (2) the potential unintended impact of examination manuals \n        or other regulatory directives that work in conflict with the \n        tailoring of such regulatory action described in subsection \n        (a)(3);
