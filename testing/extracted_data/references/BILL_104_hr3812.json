FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Article 32 of the United Nations Convention on the \n        Rights of the Child recognizes ``the right of the child to be \n        protected from economic exploitation and from performing any \n        work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the \n        child's education or to be harmful to the child's health or \n        physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.''.\n            (2) Article 2 of the International Labor Organization \n        Convention 138, the Minimum Age Convention, states that the \n        minimum age for admission to employment or work ``shall not be \n        less than the age of completion of compulsory schooling and, in \n        any case, shall not be less than 15 years.''.\n            (3) International Labor Organization Convention 29, the \n        Forced Labor Convention, which has been in effect since 1930, \n        prohibits most forms of ``forced or compulsory labor'', \n        including all forced labor by people under the age of 18.\n            (4) Although it is among the most universally condemned of \n        all human rights abuses, child labor is widely practiced. The \n        International Labor Organization has estimated the total number \n        of child workers to be between 100,000,000 and 200,000,000. \n        More than 95 percent of those child workers live in developing \n        countries.\n            (5) The International Labor Organization has estimated that \n        13.2 percent of all 10-to-14 year olds around the world were \n        economically active in 1995. There are no reliable figures on \n        workers under 10 years of age, though their numbers are known \n        to be significant. Reliable child labor statistics are not \n        readily available, in part because many governments in the \n        developing world are reluctant to document those activities, \n        which are often illegal under domestic laws, which violate \n        international standards, and which may be perceived as a \n        failure of internal public policy.\n            (6) Notwithstanding international and domestic \n        prohibitions, many children in developing countries are forced \n        to work as debt-bonded and slave laborers in hazardous and \n        exploitative industries. According to the United Nations \n        Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery and the \n        International Labor Organization, there are tens of millions of \n        child slaves in the world today. Large numbers of those slaves \n        are involved in agricultural and domestic labor, the sex \n        industry, the carpet and textile industries, and quarrying and \n        brick making.\n            (7) In many countries, children lack either the legal \n        standing or the means to protect themselves from cruelty and \n        exploitation in the workplace.\n            (8) The employment of children often interferes with the \n        opportunities of such children for basic education. \n        Furthermore, where it coexists with high rates of adult \n        unemployment, the use of child labor likely denies gainful \n        employment to millions of adults.\n            (9) While child labor is a vast, complex, and multifaceted \n        phenomenon that is tied to issues of poverty, educational \n        opportunity, and culture, its most abusive and hazardous forms \n        are repugnant to basic human rights and must be eliminated.\n\nSEC. 3. IDENTIFICATION OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND INDUSTRIES THAT USE \n              CHILD LABOR IN PRODUCING GOODS.\n\n    (a) Identification of Countries and Industries.--The Secretary of \nLabor shall, not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act, and not later than the end of each 1-year period thereafter, \nidentify those foreign countries that do not prohibit child labor, or \nthat have laws prohibiting child labor but do not effectively enforce \nthem, and those industries in such countries in which child labor is \nused. The Secretary may revoke the identification of a country or an \nindustry before the end of the 1-year period during which the \nidentification would otherwise be effective, if revocation is warranted \nby new information or a change in the laws or practices of a country.\n    (b) Sanctions.--The sanctions set forth in sections 4 and 5 shall \napply with respect to those countries and industries identified under \nsubsection (a) for so long as the identification is effective under \nsuch subsection.\n    (c) Exemption.--The prohibition on imports under section 4(a), the \nprohibition under section 5(a)(1) on financing under the Export-Import \nBank Act of 1945, and the prohibition on multilateral assistance under \nsection 5(a)(2) shall not apply to a business entity if it is \nestablished to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Labor that no goods \nproduced by that entity are products of child labor.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON IMPORTS.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall prohibit the \nentry of any manufactured article that is a product of an industry \nidentified under section 3(a).\n    (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the entry of a \nmanufactured article--\n            (1) that is entered under any subheading in subchapter IV \n        or VI of chapter 98 (relating to personal exemptions) of the \n        Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States; or\n            (2) that was exported from the foreign country in which the \n        industry concerned is located and was en route to the United \n        States before the first day on which the identification of the \n        country and industry was effective.\n\nSEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON ASSISTANCE FOR FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT USE CHILD \n              LABOR IN PRODUCING GOODS.\n\n    (a) Prohibition on Assistance.--\n            (1) Bilateral assistance.--The President may not provide \n        United States assistance to a foreign country identified by the \n        Secretary of Labor under section 3(a).\n            (2) Multilateral assistance.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n        shall instruct the United States Executive Director of each \n        international financial institution to use the voice and vote \n        of the United States to oppose any loan or other utilization of \n        the funds of their respective institution to or for any \n        industry identified by the Secretary of Labor under section \n        3(a).\n    (b) Exception.--A foreign country or an industry identified by the \nSecretary of Labor under section 3(a) may receive United States \nassistance if the President determines and certifies to the Congress \nthat it is in the vital national interest of the United States to \nprovide such assistance to such country or industry, as the case may \nbe. The President shall include in any such certification--\n            (1) a full and complete description of the vital national \n        interest of the United States that is placed at risk if such \n        assistance is not provided to such country or industry; and\n            (2) a statement weighing the risk described in paragraph \n        (1) against the risk posed to the vital national interest of \n        the United States by the failure of such country to adopt or \n        enforce laws prohibiting child labor or by the use of child \n        labor by such industry, as the case may be.\n\nSEC. 6. PENALTIES.\n\n    (a) Unlawful Acts.--It is unlawful--\n            (1) to attempt to enter any manufactured article that is a \n        product of an industry if the entry is prohibited under section \n        4(a); or\n            (2) to violate any regulation prescribed under section 7.\n    (b) Civil Penalty.--Any person who commits any unlawful act set \nforth in subsection (a) is liable for a civil penalty of not to exceed \n$25,000.\n    (c) Criminal Penalty.--In addition to being liable for a civil \npenalty under subsection (b), any person who intentionally commits any \nunlawful act set forth in subsection (a) is, upon conviction, liable \nfor a fine of not less than $10,000 and not more than $35,000, or \nimprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.\n    (d) Construction.--The violations set forth in subsection (a) shall \nbe treated as violations of the customs laws for purposes of applying \nthe enforcement provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930, including--\n            (1) the search, seizure, and forfeiture provisions;\n            (2) section 592 (relating to penalties for entry by fraud, \n        gross negligence, or negligence); and\n            (3) section 619 (relating to compensation to informers).\n\nSEC. 7. REGULATIONS.\n\n    The President shall issue such regulations as are necessary to \ncarry out this Act.\n\nSEC. 8.
