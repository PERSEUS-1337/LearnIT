SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Prescription Drug \nPrice Monitoring Commission Act of 1998''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Although prescription drugs represent one of the most \n        frequently used medical care interventions in treating common \n        acute and chronic diseases, many Americans, especially elderly \n        and other vulnerable populations, are unable to afford \n        necessary medications because of excessive and persistent \n        prescription drug price inflation.\n            (2) Between 1981 and 1998, the rate of inflation for \n        prescription drugs has increased at over 2.5 times the general \n        rate of inflation.\n            (3) Because of the limited availability of private or \n        public prescription drug coverage for the elderly, prescription \n        drugs represent the highest out-of-pocket medical care cost for \n        75 percent of elderly patients, surpassed only by costs of \n        long-term care services.\n            (4) The Federal Government and the American taxpayer \n        provide substantial subsidies to the pharmaceutical industry in \n        the form of tax incentives, tax write-offs, and grants for \n        nonresearch activities.\n            (5) According to the most current edition of the Internal \n        Revenue Service Corporation Source Book of Statistics of \n        Income, the 1994-95 edition, the pharmaceutical industry \n        claimed $6,061,807,000 in deductions for advertising and \n        marketing of their products.\n            (6) The statistic described in paragraph (5) is not \n        indicative of the current amounts deducted by prescription drug \n        manufacturers, since the Food and Drug Administration Reform \n        Act of 1996, effective taxable year 1996, substantially \n        expanded the advertising activities the costs of which are \n        deductible by the pharmaceutical industry.\n            (7) According to the Internal Revenue Service Corporation \n        Source Book of Statistics of Income, the pharmaceutical \n        industry claimed $2,115,690,000 in tax credits to locate their \n        production facilities in United States possessions.\n            (8) There is a need to determine whether Federal subsidies \n        are used in the most efficient manner by the pharmaceutical \n        industry to develop drugs which represent true therapeutic \n        advances over those products already on the market.\n\nSEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``Prescription \nDrug Price Monitoring Commission'' (in this Act referred to as the \n``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 3. DUTIES OF COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Studies.--The Commission shall conduct the following studies:\n            (1) A study of the impact of a pharmaceutical price review \n        board on containing inflation on the cost of prescription \n        pharmaceutical products in the United States.\n            (2) A study on how Federal tax credits and subsidies, as \n        well as market exclusivity given to the pharmaceutical \n        industry, can be used to modify an individual manufacturer's \n        pricing behavior and research priorities.\n            (3) A study on drug prices in other industrialized nations.\n            (4)(A) A study on the feasibility of establishing in the \n        United States a pharmaceutical products price review board.\n            (B) In conducting the study under subparagraph (A), the \n        Commission shall--\n                    (i) assess the impact of such a board in other \n                industrialized nations, such as Canada, on containing \n                the costs of prescription drugs and the introductory \n                prices of new drugs;\n                    (ii) recommend how such a board might operate in \n                the United States, including the membership of the \n                Board;\n                    (iii) recommend guidelines that might be used by \n                the board in determining whether prices or price \n                increases for prescription drugs are excessive and \n                whether the introductory prices of new drugs are \n                excessive; and\n                    (iv) recommend incentives for drug manufacturers to \n                price their products fairly in the United States, \n                including a system of compulsory licensing of \n                pharmaceutical products or a reduction in the period of \n                market exclusivity as a penalty for excessive \n                inflation.\n    (b) Reports.--\n            (1) Annual reports.--The Commission shall submit to the \n        Congress an annual report (by not later than January 1 of each \n        year beginning with 1999) which shall include information and \n        recommendations regarding national and international drug \n        policy issues, such as--\n                    (A) trends and changes in prices for prescription \n                and nonprescription drugs in the inpatient and \n                outpatient setting in the United States;\n                    (B) trends and changes in prices for prescription \n                drugs in other industrialized nations, such as Canada, \n                Japan, Mexico, and countries of the European Union;\n                    (C) the scope of coverage, reimbursement, and \n                financing under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social \nSecurity Act and other programs that directly provide or receive \nFederal funds to provide coverage for or reimbursement of prescription \ndrugs, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of \nDefense, and Public Health Service clinics;\n                    (D) the availability and affordability of \n                prescription drugs for various population groups in the \n                United States, and the accessibility and affordability \n                of public and private insurance programs for \n                prescription drugs for such population groups;\n                    (E) changes in the level and nature of use of \n                prescription drugs by recipients of benefits under \n                titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, taking \n                into account the impact of such changes on aggregate \n                expenditures under these titles;\n                    (F) recommendations to make prescription drugs more \n                affordable and cost-effective for third-party insurers, \n                including State-based pharmaceutical assistance and \n                general assistance programs;\n                    (G) evaluation of technologies available for \n                efficient third-party prescription drug program \n                administration, such as electronic claims management \n                and payment technologies;\n                    (H) methods of providing reimbursement under \n                Federal health care programs to providers for drug \n                products;\n                    (I) evaluation of the use and efficiency of all \n                Federal tax credits and subsidies given to the \n                pharmaceutical industry for various purposes, including \n                the tax credit allowed under section 936 of the \n                Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
