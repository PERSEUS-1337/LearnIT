FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.--\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States has entered into treaties with Indian \n        tribes under which the United States made various commitments \n        to Indian tribes and Indian people;\n            (2) the United States functions, by treaty and statute, as \n        a trustee for Indian tribes and individual Indians;\n            (3) the United States has a fiduciary obligation to Indian \n        tribes and Indian people and, in accordance with that \n        obligation, must use the highest standard of care to protect \n        the assets of Indian tribes and individual Indians;\n            (4) the United States has failed Indian tribes and \n        individual Indians and abridged its treaty obligations related \n        to the handling of trust fund management and historical \n        accounting;\n            (5) mismanagement of Indian trust assets by the United \n        States is a longstanding problem that spans many \n        administrations;\n            (6) the complexity and longevity of that mismanagement \n        neither mitigates the injustice visited on the 300,000 Native \n        Americans whose accounts have been shortchanged nor absolves \n        the United States of its responsibility to correct the \n        situation in a timely manner;\n            (7) a civil action, Cobell v. Norton, Civ. No. 96-1285 \n        (RCL), was filed in 1996 in an attempt to obtain a court order \n        to compel the United States to account for the trust funds \n        managed by the United States on behalf of individual Indians;\n            (8) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the overall \n        individual Indian money fund--\n                    (A) contains approximately $3,000,000,000; and\n                    (B) distributes more than $500,000,000 each year to \n                individual Indian money account holders;\n            (9) those funds are generated from Indian trust land \n        royalties resulting from leases of that land to oil, \n        agricultural, timber, and mining interests;\n            (10) not only do the parties to the Cobell action disagree \n        on the amount of money owed to individual Indian money account \n        holders, there is disagreement between the United States and \n        the Cobell plaintiffs on the number of individual Indian \n        beneficiaries residing in the United States;\n            (11) the United States estimates that, as of the date of \n        enactment of this Act, there are approximately 300,000 \n        individual Indian trust beneficiaries residing in the United \n        States;\n            (12) the United States has never issued a public \n        approximation of the amount of money owed to individual Indian \n        money account holders;\n            (13) in 2001, the Secretary of the Interior established the \n        Office of Historical Trust Accounting to determine the means by \n        which a full accounting of individual Indian money accounts \n        could be accomplished;\n            (14) the Office of Historical Trust Accounting has \n        estimated that the process of conducting the accounting--\n                    (A) could last a decade or longer;\n                    (B) could cost at least $2,400,000,000; and\n                    (C) might not produce a usable result;\n            (15) the Cobell civil action was filed only on behalf of \n        individual Indians, and not Indian tribes; and\n            (16) the Secretary of the Interior has stated that \n        completion of a comprehensive accounting of funds owed to \n        individual Indian money account holders will not be completed \n        for at least 5 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to acknowledge that the United States owes a \n        considerable amount of funds to Indian tribes and individual \n        Indian money account holders;\n            (2) to recognize that the acute human needs of Indians \n        require that the debt be paid to Indians and Indian tribes as \n        promptly as possible;\n            (3) to respect the sovereignty of Indian tribes; and\n            (4) to provide for payments of amounts that Indians and \n        Indian tribes are owed by the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
