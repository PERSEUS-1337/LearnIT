    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Congenital Heart Futures Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congenital heart defects are the most common and most \n        deadly group of birth defects and affect nearly 1 percent of \n        all live births, approximately 36,000 births a year. A child is \n        born with a congenital heart defect every 15 minutes.\n            (2) Congenital heart disease is a rapidly growing national \n        health problem. Childhood survival has risen from below 20 \n        percent in 1950 to more than 90 percent today. Due to the \n        increase in childhood survival, the congenital heart disease \n        population increases by an estimated 5 percent every year.\n            (3) Approximately 800,000 children and 1,000,000 adults in \n        the United States are now living with congenital heart disease \n        and require highly specialized life-long cardiac care.\n            (4) There is no cure for congenital heart disease. Even \n        survivors of successful childhood treatment can face life-long \n        risks from congenital heart disease, including heart failure, \n        rhythmic disorders, stroke, renal dysfunction, and \n        neurocognitive dysfunction.\n            (5) Less than 10 percent of adults living with complex \n        congenital heart disease currently receive recommended cardiac \n        care. Many individuals with congenital heart disease are \n        unaware that they require life-long specialized health \n        surveillance. Delays in care can result in premature death and \n        disability.\n            (6) The estimated life expectancy for those with congenital \n        heart disease is significantly lower than for the general \n        population. The life expectancy for those born with moderately \n        complex heart defects is 55, while the estimated life \n        expectancy for those born with highly complex defects is \n        between 35 and 40.\n            (7) Despite the prevalence and seriousness of the disease, \n        Federal research, data collection, education, and awareness \n        activities are limited.\n            (8) The strategic plan of the National Heart, Lung, and \n        Blood Institute completed in 2007 notes that ``successes over \n        several decades have enabled people with congenital heart \n        diseases to live beyond childhood, but too often inadequate \n        data are available to guide their treatment as adults''.\n            (9) The strategic plan for the Division of Cardiovascular \n        Diseases at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, \n        completed in 2008, set goals for congenital heart disease \n        research, including understanding the development and genetic \n        basis of congenital heart disease, improving evidence-based \n        care and treatment of children with congenital and acquired \n        pediatric heart disease, and improving evidence-based care and \n        treatment of adults with congenital heart disease.\n\nSEC. 3. PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AWARENESS OF CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE.\n\n    Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n        ``PART S--PROGRAMS RELATING TO CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE\n\n``SEC. 399HH.
