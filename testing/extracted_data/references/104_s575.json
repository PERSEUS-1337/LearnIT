    "content": "SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act only, the term--\n            (1) ``coastline'' has the same meaning that it has in the \n        Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.);\n            (2) ``county'' means a unit of general government \n        constituting the local jurisdiction immediately below the level \n        of State government. This term includes, but is not limited to, \n        counties, parishes, villages and tribal governments which \n        function in lieu of and are not within a county, and in Alaska, \n        borough governments. If State law recognizes an entity of \n        general government that functions in lieu of and is not within \n        a county, the Secretary may recognize such other entities of \n        general government as counties;\n            (3) ``coastline State'' means any State of the United \n        States bordering on the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the \n        Arctic Ocean, the Bering Sea or the Gulf of Mexico;\n            (4) ``distance'' means minimum great circle distance, \n        measured in statute miles;\n            (5) ``leased tract'' means a tract, leased under section 8 \n        of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337) for \n        the purpose of drilling for, developing and producing oil or \n        natural gas resources, which is a unit consisting of either a \n        block, a portion of a block, a combination of blocks and/or \n        portions of blocks, as specified in the lease, and as depicted \n        on an Outer Continental Shelf Official Protraction Diagram;\n            (6) ``new revenues'' means monies received by the United \n        States as royalties (including payments for royalty taken in \n        kind and sold pursuant to section 27 of the Outer Continental \n        Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1353)), net profit share payments, \n        and related late-payment interest from natural gas and oil \n        leases issued pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands \n        Act, but only from leased tracts from which such revenues are \n        first received by the United States after the date of enactment \n        of this Act;\n            (7) ``Outer Continental Shelf'' means all submerged lands \n        lying seaward and outside of the area of ``lands beneath \n        navigable waters'' as defined in section 2(a) of the Submerged \n        Lands Act 43 U.S.C. 1301(a)), and of which the subsoil \nand seabed appertain to the United States and are subject to its \njurisdiction and control; and\n            (8) ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior or \n        the Secretary's designee.\n\nSEC. 2. IMPACT ASSISTANCE FORMULA AND PAYMENTS.\n\n    (a) There is established a fund in the Treasury of the United \nStates, which shall be known as the ``Outer Continental Shelf Impact \nAssistance Fund'' (hereinafter referred to in this Act as ``the \nFund''). Allocable new revenues determined under subsection (c) shall \nbe deposited in the Fund.\n    (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest excess monies in the \nFund, at the written request of the Secretary, in public debt \nsecurities with maturities suitable to the needs of the Fund, as \ndetermined by the Secretary, and bearing interest at rates determined \nby the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current \nmarket yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United \nStates of comparable maturity.\n    (c) Notwithstanding section 9 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands \nAct (43 U.S.C. 1338), amounts in the Fund, together with interest \nearned from investment thereof, shall be paid at the direction of the \nSecretary as follows:\n            (1) The Secretary shall determine the new revenues from any \n        leased tract or portion of a leased tract lying seaward of the \n        zone defined and governed by section 8(g) of the Outer \n        Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g)), or lying \n        within such zone but to which section 8(g) does not apply, the \n        geographic center of which lies within a distance of 200 miles \n        from any part of the coastline of any coastal State \n        (hereinafter referred to as an ``eligible coastal State'').\n            (2) The Secretary shall determine the allocable share of \n        new revenues determined under paragraph (1) by multiplying such \n        revenues by 27 percent.\n            (3) The Secretary shall determine the portion of the \n        allocable share of new revenues attributable to each eligible \n        coastal State (hereinafter referred to as the ``eligible \n        coastal State's attributable share'') based on a fraction which \n        is inversely proportional to the distance between the nearest \n        point on the coastline of the eligible coastal State and the \n        geographic center of the leased tract or portion of the leased \n        tract (to the nearest whole mile). Further, the ratio of an \n        eligible State's attributable share to any other eligible \n        State's attributable share shall be equal to the inverse of the \n        ratio of the distances between the geographic center of the \n        leased tract or portion of the leased tract and the coastlines \n        of the respective eligible coastal States. The sum of the \n        eligible coastal States' attributable shares shall be equal to \n        the allocable share of new revenues determined under paragraph \n        (2).\n            (4) The Secretary shall pay from the Fund 50 percent of \n        each eligible coastal State's attributable share, together with \n        the portion of interest earned from investment of the funds \n        which corresponds to that amount, to that State.\n            (5) Within 60 days of enactment of this Act, the Governor \n        of each eligible coastal State shall provide the Secretary with \n        a list of all counties, as defined herein, that are to be \n        considered for eligibility to receive impact assistance \n        payments. This list must include all counties with borders \n        along the State's coastline and may also include counties which \n        are at the closest point no more than 60 miles from the State's \n        coastline and which are certified by the Governor to have \n        significant impacts from Outer Continental Shelf-related \n        activities. For any such county that does not have a border \n        along the coastline, the Governor shall designate the coastline \n        of the nearest county that does have a border along the \n        coastline to serve as the former county's coastline for the \n        purposes of this section. The Governor of any eligible coastal \n        State may modify this list whenever significant changes in \n        Outer Continental Shelf activities require a change, but no \n        more frequently than once a year.\n            (6) The Secretary shall determine, for each county within \n        the eligible coastal State identified by the Governor according \n        to paragraph (5) for which any part of the county's coastline \n        lies within a distance of 200 miles of the geographic center of \n        the leased tract or portion of the leased tract (hereinafter \n        referred to as an ``eligible county'') 50 percent of the \n        eligible coastal State's attributable share which is \n        attributable to such county (hereinafter referred to as the \n        ``eligible county's attributable share'') based on a fraction \n        which is inversely proportional to the distance between the \n        nearest point on the coastline of the eligible county and the \n        geographic center of the leased tract or portion of the leased \n        tract (to the nearest whole mile). Further, the ratio of any \n        eligible county's attributable share to any other eligible \n        county's attributable share shall be equal to the inverse of \n        the ratio of the distances between the geographic center of the \n        leased tract or portion of the leased tract and the coastlines \n        of the respective eligible counties. The sum of the eligible \n        counties' attributable shares for all eligible counties within \n        each State shall be equal to 50 percent of the eligible coastal \n        State's attributable share determined under paragraph (3).\n            (7) The Secretary shall pay from the Fund the eligible \n        county's attributable share, together with the portion of \n        interest earned from investment of the Fund which corresponds \n        to that amount, to that county.\n            (8) Payments to eligible coastal States and eligible \n        counties under this section shall be made not later than \n        December 31 of each year from new revenues received and \n        interest earned thereon during the immediately preceding fiscal \n        year, but not earlier than one year following the date of \n        enactment of this Act.\n            (9) The remainder of new revenues and interest earned in \n        the Fund not paid to an eligible State or an eligible county \n        under this section shall be disposed of according to the law \notherwise applicable to receipts from leases on the Outer Continental \nShelf.\n\nSEC. 3. USES OF FUNDS.\n\n    Funds received pursuant to this Act shall be used by the eligible \ncoastal States and eligible counties for projects and activities \nrelated to all impacts of Outer Continental Shelf-related activities \nincluding but not limited to--\n            (1) air quality, water quality, fish and wildlife, \n        wetlands, or other coastal resources;\n            (2) other activities of such State or county, authorized by \n        the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et \n        seq.), the provisions of subtitle B of title IV of the Oil \n        Pollution Act of 1990 (104 Stat. 523), or the Federal Water \n        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); and\n            (3) administrative costs of complying with the provisions \n        of this subtitle.\n\nSEC. 4. OBLIGATIONS OF ELIGIBLE COUNTIES AND STATES.\n\n    (a) Project Submission.--Prior to the receipt of funds pursuant to \nthis Act for any fiscal year, an eligible county must submit to the \nGovernor of the State in which it is located a plan setting forth the \nprojects and activities for which the eligible county proposes to \nexpend such funds. Such plan shall state the amounts proposed to be \nexpended for each project or activity during the upcoming fiscal year.\n    (b) Project Approval.--Prior to the payment of funds pursuant to \nthis Act to any eligible county for any fiscal year, the Governor must \napprove the plan submitted by the eligible county pursuant to \nsubsection (a) and notify the Secretary of such approval. State \napproval of any such plan shall be consistent with all applicable State \nand federal law. In the event the Governor disapproves any such plan, \nthe funds that would otherwise be paid to the eligible county shall be \nplaced in escrow by the Secretary pending modification and approval of \nsuch plan, at which time such funds together with interest thereon \nshall be paid to the eligible county.\n    (c) Certification.--No later than 60 days after the end of the \nfiscal year, any eligible county receiving funds under this Act must \ncertify to the Governor--\n            (1) the amount of such funds expended by the county during \n        the previous fiscal year;\n            (2) the amounts expended on each project or activity; and\n            (3) the status of each project or activity.\n\nSEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT, REFUNDS.\n\n    (a) On June 15 of each fiscal year, the Governor of each State \nreceiving monies from the Fund shall account for all monies so received \nfor the previous fiscal year in a written report to Congress.\n    (b) In those instances where through judicial decision, \nadministrative review, arbitration or other means there are royalty \nrefunds owed to entities generating new revenues under this Act, \nrepayment of such refunds in the same proportion as monies were \nreceived under section 2 shall be the responsibility of the \ngovernmental entities receiving distributions under the Fund."
