    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 4535.2 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n4535.2.\n(a)\n(1)\nThe maximum preference and incentive a bidder may be awarded pursuant to this chapter and any other provision of law shall be 15 percent. However, in no case shall the maximum preference and incentive cost under this chapter exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for any bid, nor shall the combined cost of preferences and incentives granted pursuant to this chapter and any other provision of law exceed one hundred thousand dollars($100,000). In those cases where the 15-percent cumulated preference and incentive cost would exceed the one hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) maximum preference and incentive cost limit, the one hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) maximum preference and incentive cost limit shall apply.\n(2) Notwithstanding the one-hundred-thousand-dollar ($100,000) limitation specified in paragraph (1), if the bid includes preferences or incentives under this chapter and Section 14838, the combined cost of preferences and incentives granted pursuant to this chapter and any other law shall not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, small business bidders qualified in accordance with Section 14838 shall have precedence over nonsmall business bidders in that the application of any bidder preference for which nonsmall business bidders may be eligible, including the preference contained in this chapter, shall not result in the denial of the award to a small business bidder. This subdivision shall apply to those cases where the small business bidder is the lowest responsible bidder, as well as to those cases where the small business bidder is eligible for award as the result of application of the 5-percent small business bidder preference and incentive.\nSECTION 1.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 14838 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n14838.\nIn order to facilitate the participation of small business, including microbusiness, in the provision of goods, information technology, and services to the state, and in the construction (including alteration, demolition, repair, or improvement) of state facilities, the directors of the department and other state agencies that enter those contracts, each within their respective areas of responsibility, shall do all of the following:\n(a) Establish goals, consistent with those established by the Office of Small Business Certification and Resources, for the extent of participation of small businesses, including microbusinesses, in the provision of goods, information technology, and services to the state, and in the construction of state facilities.\n(b) Provide for small business preference, or nonsmall business preference for bidders that provide for small business and microbusiness subcontractor participation, in the award of contracts for goods, information technology, services, and construction, as follows:\n(1) In solicitations where an award is to be made to the lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications, the preference to small business and microbusiness shall be 5 percent of the lowest responsible nonsmall business bidder meeting specifications. The preference to nonsmall business bidders that provide for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation shall be, up to a maximum of 5 percent of the lowest responsible nonsmall business bidder meeting specifications, determined according to rules and regulations established by the Department of General Services.\n(2) In solicitations where an award is to be made to the highest scored bidder based on evaluation factors in addition to price, the preference to small business or microbusiness shall be 5 percent of the highest responsible bidder\u2019s total score. The preference to nonsmall business bidders that provide for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation shall be up to a maximum 5 percent of the highest responsible bidder\u2019s total score, determined according to rules and regulations established by the Department of General Services.\n(3) The preferences under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be awarded to a noncompliant bidder and shall not be used to achieve any applicable minimum requirements.\n(4) The preference under paragraph (1) shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for any contract award, and the combined cost of preferences granted pursuant to paragraph (1) and any other provision of law shall not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000). For contract awards in which the state has reserved the right to make multiple awards, this one hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) maximum preference cost shall be applied, to the extent possible, so as to maximize the dollar participation of small businesses, including microbusinesses, in the contract award.\n(c) Give special consideration to small businesses and microbusinesses by both:\n(1) Reducing the experience required.\n(2) Reducing the level of inventory normally required.\n(d) Give special assistance to small businesses and microbusinesses in the preparation and submission of the information requested in Section 14310.\n(e) Under the authorization granted in Section 10163 of the Public Contract Code, make awards, whenever feasible, to small business and microbusiness bidders for each project bid upon within their prequalification rating. This may be accomplished by dividing major projects into subprojects so as to allow a small business or microbusiness contractor to qualify to bid on these subprojects.\n(f) Small business and microbusiness bidders qualified in accordance with this chapter shall have precedence over nonsmall business bidders in that the application of a bidder preference for which nonsmall business bidders may be eligible under this section or any other provision of law shall not result in the denial of the award to a small business or microbusiness bidder. In the event of a precise tie between the low responsible bid of a bidder meeting specifications of a small business or microbusiness, and the low responsible bid of a bidder meeting the specifications of a disabled veteran-owned small business or microbusiness, the contract shall be awarded to the disabled veteran-owned small business or microbusiness. This provision applies if the small business or microbusiness bidder is the lowest responsible bidder, as well as if the small business or microbusiness bidder is eligible for award as the result of application of the small business and microbusiness bidder preference granted by subdivision (b).\nSEC. 3.\nSection 42893 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n42893.\n(a) The combined amount of preference granted pursuant to this\nsection\narticle\nshall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) each year.\n(b) Notwithstanding Section 42892, the recycled tire product preference shall not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) if a preference exceeding that amount would preclude an award to a small business that offers a similar product made of nonrecycled tire components and is qualified in accordance with Section 14838 of the Government Code. This provision applies regardless of whether the small business is the lowest responsible bidder or is eligible for the contract award on the basis of application of the 5 percent small business preference.\n(c) Notwithstanding the one-hundred-thousand-dollar limitation specified in subdivision (a) or the fifty-thousand-dollar ($50,000) limitation specified in subdivision (b), if the bid includes the preference authorized in Section 42891 and Section 14838 of the Government Code, the combined cost of preferences and incentives granted pursuant to this article and any other law shall not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000)."
