FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Surgeon General of the Public Health Service has \n        stated that dietary patterns with excessive intake of foods \n        high in fat (especially saturated fat), calories, cholesterol \n        and sodium, contribute to the high rates of chronic diseases \n        among Americans. Reversing such dietary patterns should \n        decrease the incidence of these chronic diseases.\n            (2) Currently, diet plays a major role in the development \n        of 4 of the top 7 diseases that are killers in the United \n        States: heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes.\n            (3) According to the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, America's poor diet and sedentary lifestyle \n        contribute to 300,000 to 580,000 deaths each year.\n            (4) To make significant strides toward improving the health \n        of Americans, greater attention must be made to nutrition \n        education. The President could provide leadership by giving a \n        higher profile to the importance of a healthy diet.\n            (5) Good nutrition is one of the most important factors in \n        determining long-term health.\n            (6) Improvements in the diet of Americans can reduce the \n        health care cost of treating dietary-related diseases and \n        produce a savings of up to $200,000,000,000.\n            (7) The Department of Health and Human Services and the \n        Preventive Services Task Force have recommended that health \n        care programs for individuals of all ages should include \n        dietary counselling.\n            (8) Efforts must be made to identify and to remove the \n        barriers to optimal health and nutritional status in high-risk \n        groups, including minority and low-income population groups \n        (using methods that take into consideration their diverse \n        cultural, ethnic and economic backgrounds); and special \n        attention should also be made to pregnant and lactating women, \n        to children, and to the elderly, who have special nutritional \n        needs.\n\nSEC. 3.
