REPORTS ON IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n    As part of the budget request for each fiscal year in which the \nSecretary will carry out activities under this Act, the Secretary shall \ntransmit to the relevant congressional committees--\n            (1) a schedule of the mission assignment and streamlining \n        actions to be carried out under this Act in the fiscal year for \n        which the request is made and an estimate of the total \n        expenditures required and cost savings to be achieved by each \n        such mission assignment and streamlining, and of the time \n        period in which these savings are to be achieved in each case; \n        and\n            (2) a description of the departmental laboratories, \n        including those under construction and those planned for \n        construction, to which functions are to be transferred as a \n        result of mission assignments and streamlining.\n\n                          TITLE II--GOVERNANCE\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is an inordinate internal focus at every level of \n        the Department of Energy and the departmental laboratories on \n        compliance issues and questions of management processes, which \n        takes a major toll on research performance;\n            (2) there has been a growing emphasis at the Department on \n        administrative and support organizations and their oversight \n        and compliance roles;\n            (3) the costs of dealing with review groups significantly \n        interferes with research operations at the department \n        laboratories;\n            (4) far too much influence has been ceded by the Department \n        to nonregulatory advisory boards, and such organizations \n        generate recommendations with no apparent cost/benefit \n        analysis, which results in significant unnecessary expenditures \n        and productivity losses; and\n            (5) enforcement of environmental, safety, and health rules, \n        regulations, orders, and standards is a function of government \n        agencies other than the Department of Energy.\n\nSEC. 202. ELIMINATION OF SELF-REGULATION.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Department of \nEnergy shall implement, but shall not be the agency of enforcement of, \nFederal, State, and local environmental, safety, and health rules, \nregulations, orders, and standards at departmental laboratories, unless \nthe Secretary certifies that a particular action is unique to the \nactivities of the Department and is necessary to maintain human health \nand safety.\n\nSEC. 203. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This title shall take effect on October 1, 1996."
