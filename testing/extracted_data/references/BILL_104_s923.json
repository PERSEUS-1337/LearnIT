FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) accidents occurring as a result of high speed motor \n        vehicle pursuits of fleeing motor vehicles by law enforcement \n        officers are becoming increasingly common across the United \n        States;\n            (2) the extent of the problem of those pursuits is evident \n        despite significant underreporting;\n            (3) because the problem of those pursuits is extensive, it \n        is essential for all law enforcement agencies to develop and \n        implement policies and training procedures for dealing with \n        high speed motor vehicle pursuits;\n            (4) a high speed motor vehicle pursuit in a community by a \n        law enforcement officer should be treated in the same manner as \n        the firing of a police firearm because a high speed motor \n        vehicle pursuit involves the use of a deadly force with the \n        potential for causing harm or death to pedestrians and \n        motorists;\n            (5) the Federal Government should provide an incentive for \n        States to enact laws to prevent high speed motor vehicle \n        pursuits;\n            (6) to demonstrate leadership in response to the national \n        problem of high speed motor vehicle pursuits, all Federal law \n        enforcement agencies should--\n                    (A) develop policies and procedures governing motor \n                vehicle pursuits; and\n                    (B) provide assistance to State and local law \n                enforcement agencies in instituting such policies and \n                procedures and in conducting training; and\n            (7) the policies referred to in paragraph (6) should \n        balance reasonably the need--\n                    (A) to apprehend promptly dangerous criminals; and\n                    (B) to address the threat to the safety of the \n                general public posed by high speed pursuits.\n\nSEC. 3.
