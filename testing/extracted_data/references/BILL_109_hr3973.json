FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In enacting the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003 \n        (Public Law 108-148; 16 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.), Congress clearly \n        recognized the priority of reducing wildfire risks to \n        communities through active hazardous fuels reduction treatment \n        of adjacent forested Federal lands.\n            (2) Because of funding limitations, the Secretary of \n        Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior have been unable \n        to fully implement the necessary hazardous fuels reductions \n        anticipated by the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003, and \n        many communities in the vicinity of forested Federal lands \n        remain at risk for wildland fire.\n            (3) The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the \n        Interior should increase efforts to prioritize and aggressively \n        pursue hazardous fuel reduction in communities at risk in the \n        wildland-urban interface.\n            (4) Many communities are still at risk from unnatural \n        accumulation of fuels, and, for such at-risk communities, it is \n        important to pro-actively consider scenarios for the \n        rehabilitation of Federal land near these communities, should \n        an uncharacteristic disturbance occur.\n            (5) While significant scientific research exists on the \n        short-term and long-term impacts of vegetative removal \n        following a fire, it is essential to test various approaches to \n        post-disturbance management to determine whether and how trees \n        of commercial value can be removed during the post-disturbance \n        period while ensuring the best and fastest recovery to a \n        resilient state that will ensure long-term protection for both \n        forest ecosystems and forest communities.\n            (6) Community collaboration has shown great promise in \n        resolving controversial issues prior to, and as part of, the \n        process required under the National Environmental Policy Act of \n        1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.), and the Healthy Forest \n        Restoration Act of 2003 recognized the promise of collaboration \n        by encouraging the development of community wildfire protection \n        plans.\n            (7) It is important to promote pro-active planning and \n        collaboration to accelerate the approval of restoration \n        projects following wildland fire or other uncharacteristic \n        disturbance events.\n\nSEC. 3.
