Congress finds the following:\n    (1) In 1855, the Duwamish Tribe signed the Treaty of Point Elliott, \nwhich guaranteed fishing rights and reservations to all tribes \nrepresented by the Native signatories.\n    (2) The Duwamish signatory was their Chief, Chief Si'ahl, for whom \nthe City of Seattle is named.\n    (3) In 1859, the Treaty of Point Elliott was ratified by Congress. \nHowever, the promises made by the United States in the treaty were \nnever fulfilled as to the Duwamish Tribe or its members.\n    (4) In 1925, the Duwamish Tribe officially adopted its constitution \nand bylaws.\n    (5) The Duwamish Tribe filed suit before the Indian Claims \nCommission for the value of its lands taken without compensation and a \n$62,000 judgment ultimately was awarded to the Duwamish. The settlement \nwas eventually distributed per capita at $64 per person to the Duwamish \npeople.\n    (6) In 1976, the Duwamish Tribe first submitted a petition for \nFederal recognition to the Secretary of the Interior. That petition \nsubsequently was returned to the tribe for revision due to changes in \nregulations governing the administrative federal acknowledgment \nprocess.\n    (7) In 1988, the Duwamish Tribe submitted its completed petition \nfor Federal recognition.\n    (8) In 1996, after years of delay, the Duwamish Tribe received a \nnegative preliminary determination. In response, the tribe addressed \nthe identified problems in its final submission of October 21, 1998.\n    (9) On January 19, 2001, the Duwamish Tribe received a favorable \ndetermination for federal recognition from the Assistant Secretary of \nthe Interior for Indian Affairs.\n    (10) On September 26, 2001, the new Assistant Secretary for Indian \nAffairs unilaterally reversed the January 19, 2001, decision and \nrejected the Duwamish petition for recognition.\n    (11) On January 4, 2002, the Interior Board of Indian Appeals \nreferred several questions raised by the circumstances of the \nadministrative reversal to the Secretary of the Interior along with \ndirections to decide whether to request further reconsideration by the \nAssistant Secretary for Indian Affairs in light of those questions.\n    (12) On May 8, 2002, the Secretary of the Interior refused to refer \nthe Duwamish petition back to the Assistant Secretary for Indian \nAffairs for further consideration.\n    (13) Nearly 150 years after the Duwamish Tribe signed the Point \nElliott Treaty, the Duwamish people still seek the recognition which \nwas established by the treaty.\n\nSEC. 2.
