FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The over reliance of the United States on imported \n        petroleum creates a major strategic vulnerability for the \n        Nation, with nearly half of the energy supply of the United \n        States dependent on foreign sources.\n            (2) From the economically damaging Arab oil embargoes of \n        1973-74 and 1979 to the current recession precipitated by \n        rising oil prices which began in 1999, the economic stability \n        of the United States has too often been shaken by economic \n        forces outside its borders.\n            (3) This Act would shift America's dependence away from \n        foreign petroleum as an energy source toward alternative, \n        renewable, domestic agricultural sources. Its aim is to convert \n        the current petroleum trade deficit to a trade balance by \n        replacing foreign sources of supply with steady increases of \n        biobased fuels through domestic production.\n            (4) Currently the United States annually consumes about \n        164,000,000,000 gallons of vehicle fuels and 5,600,00,000 \n        gallons of heating oil. In 2000, 52.9 percent of these fuels \n        were imported, yielding a $109,000,000,000 trade deficit with \n        the rest of the world. Since 1983, the United States \n        importation of petroleum and its derivatives has nearly \n        tripled, rising from 1,215,225,000 barrels in 1983 to \n        3,319,816,000 barrels in 2000.\n            (5) Further Strategic Petroleum Reserve policy should \n        encourage domestic production to the greatest extent possible. \n        Currently the Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds 545,000,000 \n        barrels (out of a potential 700,000,000 barrels), sufficient to \n        cushion the United States from wild price swings for a period \n        of 53 days. None of the fuel in this Reserve is biobased. In \n        fact, 92.2 percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been \n        purchased from foreign sources: 41.9 percent from Mexico, 24 \n        percent from the United Kingdom, and over 20 percent from OPEC \n        nations.\n            (6) Strategic Petroleum Reserve policy also should \n        encourage the development of alternatives to the Nation's \n        reliance on petroleum such as biomass fuels.\n            (7) As a first step in diversification, the Strategic \n        Petroleum Reserve should exchange 2,100,000 barrels from our \n        current reserves for 32,000,000 gallons of ethanol and \n        biodiesel, which would comprise less than 2 percent of the \n        United States market, but yield a doubling of ethanol products.\n            (8) The benefits of biofuels are as follows:\n                    (A) Energy security.--\n                            (i) Biofuels hold potential to address our \n                        dependence on foreign energy sources \n                        immediately. With agricultural surpluses, \n                        commodity prices have reached record lows; \n                        concurrently world petroleum prices have \n                        reached record highs and are expected to \n                        continue rising as global petroleum reserves \n                        are drawn down over the next 25 years. It also \n                        is clear that economic conditions are favorable \n                        to utilize domestic surpluses of biobased oils \n                        to enhance the Nation's energy security.\n                            (ii) In the short term, biofuels can supply \n                        at least one-fifth of current United States \n                        fuel demand using existing technologies and \n                        capabilities. Additional plant research, newer \n                        processing and distribution technologies, and \n                        placing additional acres under cultivation can \n                        yield even greater results.\n                            (iii) Biofuels can be used with existing \n                        petroleum infrastructure and conventional \n                        equipment.\n                    (B) Economic security.--\n                            (i) Continued dependence upon imported \n                        sources of oil means our Nation is \n                        strategically vulnerable to disruptions in our \n                        oil supply.\n                            (ii) Renewable biofuels domestically \n                        produced directly replace imported oil.\n                            (iii) Increased use of renewable biofuels \n                        would result in significant economic benefits \n                        to rural and urban areas and also reduce the \n                        trade deficit.\n                            (iv) According to the Department of \n                        Agriculture, a sustained annual market of \n                        100,000,000 gallons of biodiesel alone would \n                        result in $170,000,000 in increased income to \n                        farmers.\n                            (v) Farmer-owned biofuels production has \n                        already resulted in improved income for \n                        farmers, as evidenced by the experience with \n                        State-supported rural development efforts in \n                        Minnesota where prices to corn producers have \n                        been increased by $1.00 per bushel.\n                    (C) Environmental security.--\n                            (i) The use of grain-based ethanol reduces \n                        greenhouse gas emissions from 35 to 46 percent \n                        compared with conventional gasoline. Biomass \n                        ethanol provides an even greater reduction.\n                            (ii) The American Lung Association of \n                        Metropolitan Chicago credits ethanol-blended \n                        reformulated gasoline with reducing smog-\n                        forming emissions by 25 percent since 1990.\n                            (iii) Ethanol reduces tailpipe carbon \n                        monoxide emissions by as much as 30 percent.\n                            (iv) Ethanol reduces exhaust volatile \n                        organic compounds emissions by 12 percent.\n                            (v) Ethanol reduces toxic emissions by 30 \n                        percent.\n                            (vi) Ethanol reduces particulate emissions, \n                        especially fine-particulates that pose a health \n                        threat to children, senior citizens, and those \n                        with respiratory ailments.\n                            (vii) Biodiesel contains no sulfur of \n                        aromatics associated with air pollution.\n                            (viii) The use of biodiesel provides a 78.5 \n                        percent reduction in CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; emissions \n                        compared to petroleum diesel and when burned in \n                        a conventional engine provides a substantial \n                        reduction of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon \n                        monoxide, and particulate matter.\n\n          TITLE I--BIOFUELS FEEDSTOCKS ENERGY RESERVE PROGRAM\n\nSEC. 101. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    The Secretary of Agriculture (in this title referred to as the \n``Secretary'') may establish and administer a reserve of agricultural \ncommodities (known as the ``Biofuels Feedstocks Energy Reserve'') for \nthe purpose of--\n            (1) providing feedstocks to support and further the \n        production of energy from biofuels; and\n            (2) supporting the biofuels energy industry when production \n        is at risk of declining due to reduced feedstocks or \n        significant commodity price increases.\n\nSEC. 102.
