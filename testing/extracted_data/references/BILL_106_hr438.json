In supporting and encouraging such deployment and functioning, \nthe Commission shall consult and cooperate with State and local \nofficials responsible for emergency services and public safety, the \ntelecommunications industry (specifically including the cellular and \nother wireless telecommunications service providers), the motor vehicle \nmanufacturing industry, emergency medical service providers and \nemergency dispatch providers, special 911 districts, public safety, \nfire service and law enforcement officials, consumer groups, and \nhospital emergency and trauma care personnel (including emergency \nphysicians, trauma surgeons, and nurses).\n\nSEC. 4.

The \nenactment of such a State statute shall not affect the immunity or \nother protection from liability required by such subsection (a)(1) with \nrespect to acts or omissions occurring before the date of the enactment \nof such State statute.\n\nSEC. 5.
