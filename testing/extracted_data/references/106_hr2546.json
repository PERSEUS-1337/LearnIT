    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Preserve Access to Care in the Home \n(PATCH) Act of 1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Home health services are a vital component of the \n        benefits that are provided to beneficiaries under the medicare \n        program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.\n            (2) Home health services under the medicare program enable \n        homebound individuals who are at great risk for costly \n        institutionalized care to stay in their own homes and \n        communities.\n            (3) Implementation of the home health interim payment \n        system under the medicare program has inadvertently exacerbated \n        payment disparities for home health services between regions, \n        penalizing efficient, low-cost home health agencies in rural \n        areas and providing insufficient compensation for the care of \n        higher acuity, medically complex patients.\n            (4) The frequency and volume of prepayment medical reviews, \n        including requests for medical records, and other \n        administrative changes imposed upon home health agencies, \n        particularly those agencies that are located in rural areas, \n        has had a devastating effect on smaller care agencies.\n            (5) The combination of insufficient payments and new \n        administrative changes has precipitated the closure of nearly \n        2,000 home health agencies and branch offices and has forced \n        many surviving agencies to shrink their service areas or limit \n        the types of patients they may serve, resulting in restricted \n        access to home health services in many areas.\n            (6) The scheduled additional 15 percent across the board \n        reduction in home health payments under the medicare program \n        will severely compromise existing access to home health \n        services, particularly in low-cost rural areas.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To ensure access to care for patients with high medical \n        needs by establishing a process for home health agencies to \n        exclude high acuity, medically complex patients from the per-\n        beneficiary limits under the interim payment system for home \n        health services and instead receive cost-based reimbursement \n        for services provided such patients.\n            (2) To eliminate the 15 percent across the board reduction \n        in home health payments under the medicare program.\n            (3) To bring relief from certain administrative \n        requirements to home health agencies with--\n                    (A) strong, established compliance records; and\n                    (B) a history of claim denial rates of less than 5 \n                percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PPS FOR \n              HOME HEALTH SERVICES.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services should--\n            (1) ensure that the prospective payment system for home \n        health services under section 1895 of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1395fff) provides for appropriate payment of \n        services that are provided to beneficiaries;\n            (2) ensure that reimbursement rates under such system--\n                    (A) include incentives to provide services \n                efficiently to all beneficiaries; and\n                    (B) do not create unintentional incentives to \n                discriminate against beneficiaries with medically \n                complex conditions;\n            (3) ensure that the establishment of the case mix \n        adjustment for such services under subsection (b)(4) of such \n        section--\n                    (A) does not penalize agencies that serve \n                beneficiaries with medically complex conditions;\n                    (B) provides some predictive value and accounts for \n                a fair portion of the variation in costs associated \n                with providing services to beneficiaries; and\n                    (C) takes into account such variables as the health \n                status, age, and socioeconomic status of beneficiaries;\n            (4) establish a nationally uniform process to ensure that \n        fiscal intermediaries have the training and ability to provide \n        timely and accurate coverage and payment information to home \n        health agencies under the medicare program under title XVIII of \n        such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.);\n            (5) assess the costs to home health agencies of \n        implementing new regulations and interpretations associated \n        with the prospective payment system for home health services \n        and consider the impact of such costs on the ability of such \n        agencies to provide home health services to beneficiaries; and\n            (6) provide periodic updates to Congress and home health \n        agencies regarding the progress by the Secretary of \n        implementing the prospective payment system for home health \n        services."
