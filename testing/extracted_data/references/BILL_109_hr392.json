FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Improving financial literacy is a critical and complex \n        task for Americans of all ages.\n            (2) Low levels of savings and high levels of personal and \n        real estate debt are serious problems for many households \n        nearing retirement. Personal savings rates have fallen to a \n        dangerously low 2 percent.\n            (3) Approximately half of working Americans have any form \n        of pension coverage. Today, just 21 percent of workers have \n        defined benefit coverage and just 27 percent of workers are \n        enrolled in 401(k)s.\n            (4) Because women have longer life expectancies, the number \n        of poor older women is more than twice the number of poor older \n        men. Studies have also found that there is a substantial gender \n        gap in all sources of retirement income including Social \n        Security, pensions, savings and earnings from post-retirement \n        employment.\n            (5) The more limited timeframe that mid-life and older \n        individuals and families have to assess the realities of their \n        individual circumstances, to recover from counter-productive \n        choices and decision-making processes, and to benefit from more \n        informed financial practices, has immediate impact and near \n        term consequences for Americans nearing or of retirement age.\n            (6) Research indicates that there are now 4 basic sources \n        of retirement income security. Those sources are social \n        security benefits, pensions and savings, healthcare insurance \n        coverage, and, for an increasing number of older individuals, \n        necessary earnings from working during ``retirement'' years.\n            (7) The Congressional Budget Office has found that about a \n        quarter of baby-boomer households have so far failed to \n        accumulate significant savings and that they appear likely to \n        depend entirely on government benefits in retirement.\n            (8) Over the next 30 years, the number of older individuals \n        in the United States is expected to double, from 35,000,000 to \n        nearly 75,000,000, and long-term care costs are expected to \n        skyrocket.\n            (9) Over the next 25 years, the number of individuals over \n        65 years of age requiring long term care services is expected \n        to double to approximately 12 million.\n            (10) Fraud against older individuals, including \n        telemarketing schemes, predatory lending, identity theft and \n        Internet fraud has risen dramatically.\n\nSEC. 3.
