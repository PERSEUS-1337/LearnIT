FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) International terrorism is a serious and deadly problem \n        that threatens the vital interests of the United States.\n            (2) The Constitution confers upon Congress the power to \n        punish crimes against the law of nations and to carry out the \n        treaty obligations of the United States, and therefore Congress \n        may by law impose penalties relating to the provision of \n        material support to foreign organizations engaged in terrorist \n        activity, and allow for victims of international terrorism to \n        recover damages from those who have harmed them.\n            (3) International terrorism affects the interstate and \n        foreign commerce of the United States by harming international \n        trade and market stability, and limiting international travel \n        by United States citizens as well as foreign visitors to the \n        United States.\n            (4) Some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through \n        affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds \n        outside the United States for conduct directed and targeted at \n        the United States.\n            (5) Foreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity \n        are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution \n        to such an organization facilitates that conduct.\n            (6) The imposition of civil liability at every point along \n        the causal chain of terrorism is necessary to deter the flow of \n        terrorism's lifeblood, money. As recognized by Judge Richard \n        Posner in Boim v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and \n        Development, Nos. 05-1815, 05-1816, 05-1821, 05-1822, _ F.3d _ \n        (7th Cir. 2008) (en banc), ``Damages are a less effective \n        remedy against terrorists and their organizations than against \n        their financial angels . . . suits against financiers of \n        terrorism can cut the terrorists' lifeline.'' Moreover, the \n        statute of limitations for such claims must be extensive, for \n        as the Seventh Circuit notes, ``Seed money for terrorism can \n        sprout acts of violence long after the investment''.\n            (7) The reasoning like that of the United States Court of \n        Appeals for the Second Circuit in In Re: Terrorists Attacks on \n        September 11, 2001, 538 F.3d 71 (2d Cir. 2008) undermine \n        important counter-terrorism policies of the United States, by \n        affording undue protection from civil liability to persons, \n        entities and states that provide material support or resources \n        to foreign terrorist organizations, and by depriving victims of \n        international terrorism of meaningful access to court to seek \n        redress for their injuries.\n            (8) The United Nations Security Council declared in \n        Resolution 1373, adopted on September 28, 2001, that all states \n        have an affirmative obligation to ``refrain from providing any \n        form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons \n        involved in terrorist acts,'' and to ``ensure that any person \n        who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or \n        perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts \n        is brought to justice''.\n            (9) Consistent with these declarations, no state possesses \n        the discretion to engage knowingly in the financing or \n        sponsorship of terrorism, whether directly or indirectly.\n            (10) Persons, entities or states that knowingly or \n        recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly \n        or indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a \n        significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that threaten \n        the security of United States nationals or the national \n        security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, \n        necessarily direct their conduct at the United States, and \n        should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in the \n        United States to answer for such activities.\n            (11) The United States has a vital interest in providing \n        persons and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks \n        committed within the United States with full access to court to \n        pursue civil claims against persons, entities, or states that \n        have knowingly or recklessly provided material support or \n        resources, directly or indirectly, to the persons or \n        organizations responsible for their injuries.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil litigants \nwith the fullest possible basis, consistent with the Constitution, to \nseek relief against persons, entities and foreign states, wherever \nacting and wherever they may be found, which have provided material \nsupport or resources, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations \nthat engage in terrorist activities against the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
