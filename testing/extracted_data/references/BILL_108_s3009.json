FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Agricultural Research, Economics, and Education \nTask Force established under section 7404 of the Farm Security and \nRural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 3101 note) conducted an \nexhaustive review of agricultural research in the United States and \nevaluated the merits of establishing 1 or more national institutes \nfocused on disciplines important to the progress of food and \nagricultural science. Consistent with the findings and recommendations \nof the Agricultural Research, Economics, and Education Task Force, \nCongress finds the following:\n            (1) Agriculture in the United States faces critical \n        challenges, including an impending crisis in the food, \n        agricultural, and natural resource systems of the United \n        States. Exotic diseases and pests threaten crops and livestock, \n        obesity has reached epidemic proportions, agriculturally-\n        related environmental degradation is a serious problem for the \n        United States and other parts of the world, certain animal \n        diseases threaten human health, and United States producers of \n        some major crops are no longer the world's lowest cost \n        producers.\n            (2) In order to meet these critical challenges, it is \n        essential that the Nation ensure that the agricultural \n        innovation that has been so successful in the past continues in \n        the future. Agricultural innovation has resulted in hybrid and \n        higher yielding varieties of basic crops and enhanced the \n        world's food supply by increasing yields on existing acres. \n        Since 1960, the world's population has tripled with no net \n        increase in the amount of land under cultivation. Currently, \n        only 1.5 percent of the population of the United States \n        provides the food and fiber to supply the Nation's needs. \n        Agriculture and agriculture sciences play a major role in \n        maintaining the health and welfare of all people of the United \n        States and in husbanding our land and water, and that role must \n        be expanded.\n            (3) Fundamental scientific research that leads to \n        understandings of how cells and organisms work is critical to \n        continued innovation in agriculture in the United States. Such \n        future innovations are dependent on fundamental scientific \n        research, and will be enhanced by ideas and technologies from \n        other fields of science and research.\n            (4) Opportunities to advance fundamental knowledge of \n        benefit to agriculture in the United States have never been \n        greater. Many of these new opportunities are the result of \n        amazing progress in the life sciences over recent decades, \n        attributable in large part to the provision made by the Federal \n        Government through the National Institutes of Health and the \n        National Science Foundation. New technologies and new concepts \n        have speeded advances in the fields of genetics, cell and \n        molecular biology, and proteomics. Much of this scientific \n        knowledge is ready to be mined for agriculture and food \n        sciences, through a sustained, disciplined research effort at \n        an institute dedicated to this research.\n            (5) Publicly sponsored research is essential to continued \n        agricultural innovation to mitigate or harmonize the long-term \n        effects of agriculture on the environment, to enhance the long-\n        term sustainability of agriculture, and to improve the public \n        health and welfare.\n            (6) Competitive, peer-reviewed fundamental agricultural \n        research is best suited to promoting the fundamental research \n        from which breakthrough innovations that agriculture and \n        society require will come.\n            (7) It is in the national interest to dedicate additional \n        funds on a long-term, ongoing basis to an institute dedicated \n        to funding competitive peer-reviewed grant programs that \n        support and promote the highest caliber of fundamental \n        agricultural research.\n            (8) The Nation's capacity to be competitive internationally \n        in agriculture is threatened by inadequate investment in \n        research.\n            (9) To be successful over the long term, grant-receiving \n        institutions must be adequately reimbursed for their costs if \n        they are to pursue the necessary agricultural research.\n            (10) To meet these challenges, address these needs, and \n        provide for vitally needed agricultural innovation, it is in \n        the national interest to provide sufficient Federal funds over \n        the long term to fund a significant program of fundamental \n        agricultural research through an independent institute.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Division established under \nsection 4(a) shall be to ensure that the technological superiority of \nagriculture in the United States effectively serve the people of the \nUnited States in the coming decades, and to support and promote \nfundamental agricultural research of the highest caliber in order to \nachieve goals, including the following goals:\n            (1) Increase the international competitiveness of United \n        States agriculture.\n            (2) Develop foods that improve health and combat obesity.\n            (3) Create new and more useful food, fiber, health, \n        medicinal, energy, environmental, and industrial products from \n        plants and animals.\n            (4) Improve food safety and food security by protecting \n        plants and animals in the United States from insects, diseases, \n        and the threat of bioterrorism.\n            (5) Enhance agricultural sustainability and improve the \n        environment.\n            (6) Strengthen the economies of the Nation's rural \n        communities.\n            (7) Decrease United States dependence on foreign sources of \n        petroleum by developing bio-based fuels and materials from \n        plants.\n            (8) Strengthen national security by improving the \n        agricultural productivity of subsistence farmers in developing \n        countries to combat hunger and the political instability that \n        it produces.\n            (9) Assist in modernizing and revitalizing the Nation's \n        agricultural research facilities at institutions of higher \n        education, independent non-profit research institutions, and \n        consortia of such institutions, through capital investment.\n            (10) Achieve such other goals and meet such other needs as \n        determined appropriate by the Foundation, the Director, or the \n        Secretary.\n\nSEC. 4.
