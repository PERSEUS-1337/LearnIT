FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Open communication of information and ideas among \n        peoples of the world contributes to international peace and \n        stability, and that the promotion of such communication is \n        important to the national security of the United States.\n            (2) The United States needs to improve its communication of \n        information and ideas to people in foreign countries, \n        particularly in countries with significant Muslim populations.\n            (3) A significant expansion of United States international \n        broadcasting would provide a cost-effective means of improving \n        communication with countries with significant Muslim \n        populations by providing news, information, and analysis, as \n        well as cultural programming, through both radio and television \n        broadcasts.\n            (4) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist \n        Attacks Upon the United States stated that, ``Recognizing that \n        Arab and Muslim audiences rely on satellite television and \n        radio, the government has begun some promising initiatives in \n        television and radio broadcasting to the Arab world, Iran, and \n        Afghanistan. These efforts are beginning to reach large \n        audiences. The Broadcasting Board of Governors has asked for \n        much larger resources. It should get them.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
