    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Friends of the Children National \nDemonstration Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the single most important protective factor in a \n        child's life is a long-term relationship with a supportive, \n        caring adult;\n            (2) while the most disadvantaged children can be accurately \n        identified as early as age 5, very few long-term intervention \n        programs are initiated at this age;\n            (3) no Federal competitive grant or contract program exists \n        to fund innovative programs matching the most disadvantaged \n        children beginning at age 5 with ``professional mentors'' for \n        10 years or more;\n            (4) privately-funded programs matching ``professional \n        mentors'' with the most disadvantaged children beginning at an \n        early age for the child and lasting for 10 years or more, show \n        great promise in benefitting the most disadvantaged children \n        and youth; and\n            (5) violent juvenile crime is a national problem, and the \n        most disadvantaged children and youth need support specifically \n        targeted to help them from becoming involved in, or a victim \n        of, violent juvenile crime.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To establish a national demonstration project to \n        promote learning about successful early and sustained childhood \n        interventions, with programs carried out by Friends of the \n        Children local chapters, by employing and measuring an \n        effective approach for improving the lives and future prospects \n        of the most disadvantaged children and youth.\n            (2) To demonstrate an effective early intervention program \n        that serves the most disadvantaged children and youth through \n        private/public partnerships to prevent the need for costly \n        incarceration, rehabilitation, and treatment at a later date.\n            (3) To document best practices for conducting a successful \n        early intervention for the most disadvantaged children and \n        youth, based on the results of Friends of the Children local \n        chapters.\n            (4) To produce lessons and data from the operating \n        experiences of those Friends of the Children local chapters \n        that will provide information to improve policy in the public \n        and private sectors.\n\nSEC. 4.
