    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In the 1830s, members of the Cherokee Nation were \n        removed from their lands in the southeastern United States and \n        forced to migrate to Oklahoma along a route known as the Trail \n        of Tears. Among those persons forced to migrate were the Black \n        slaves of Cherokees, free Blacks married to Cherokees, and the \n        children of mixed-race families, known now as the ``Black \n        Cherokees''.\n            (2) In 1861, the Cherokee Nation executed a treaty with the \n        Confederate States of America, thereby severing its relations \n        with the United States Government. Members of the Cherokee \n        Nation held positions in the Congress and military of the \n        Confederate States of America and waged war against the United \n        States during the Civil War.\n            (3) Following the Civil War, the United States \n        reestablished relations with the Cherokee Nation through the \n        Treaty of 1866. The Treaty of 1866 declared that the Black \n        Cherokees, also known as ``Cherokee Freedmen'', were to be made \n        citizens of the Cherokee Nation and to have all the rights of \n        Cherokees.\n            (4) The Treaty of 1866 further guarantees the following:\n                    (A) Laws ``shall be uniform throughout said \n                nation'' and that if ``any law, either in its \n                provisions or in the manner of its enforcement, in the \n                opinion of the President of the United States, operate \n                unjustly in [the Freedmen] district, he is hereby \n                authorized and empowered to correct such evil.''.\n                    (B) The Cherokee Freedmen are given the right to \n                elect officials and to representation ``according to \n                numbers'' on the national council.\n            (5) Following the Treaty of 1866, the Cherokee National \n        Council amended its constitution to guarantee the Cherokee \n        Freedmen full rights as citizens of the Cherokee Nation.\n            (6) Also following the Treaty of 1866, the Courts upheld \n        the Cherokee Freedmen's treaty rights, including--\n                    (A) in 1895, the Court of Claims held that the \n                Cherokee Freedmen were entitled to share in the tribe's \n                land sale proceeds and the Cherokee Nation's \n                sovereignty could not be exercised in a manner that \n                breached the nation's treaty obligations to the United \n                States (Whitmire, Trustee for the Cherokee Freedmen v. \n                Cherokee Nation, 30 CT Cl. 138, 180 (CT Cl. 1895); and\n                    (B) in 1906, the Supreme Court noted that the \n                Cherokee Freedmen are citizens of the Cherokee Nation \n                entitled to the same property rights as other members \n                of the Cherokee Nation under the Treaty of 1866 (Red \n                Bird v. United States, 203 U.S. 76, 84).\n            (7) In a December 19, 2006, ruling in Vann v. Kempthorne, \n        the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \n        found that in 1906, the Dawes Commission registered members of \n        the Cherokee Nation under separate categories: the ``Freedmen \n        Roll'' for the Black Cherokees and the ``Blood Roll'' for other \n        Cherokees. Individuals possessing African blood were placed on \n        the Freedmen Roll, where no levels of Indian blood were \n        recorded. Those possessing no African blood were placed on the \n        Blood Roll, where levels of Indian blood were recorded. The \n        Dawes Commission declared that persons recorded on the Freedmen \n        Roll were on equal footing with those on the Blood Roll.\n            (8) In 1970, Congress passed the ``Principal Chiefs Act'' \n        requiring the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole, and Cherokee \n        Nations to obtain approval for their voting laws for selection \n        of the principal chief. The Department of the Interior drafted \n        a policy stating that it was not necessary that each of these \n        groups have identical or similar regulations, but that three \n        conditions are deemed fundamental to the democratic selection \n        of a principal tribal official. One of the three conditions \n        stipulated by the Department is that voter qualifications of \n        the Cherokees must be broad enough to include the enrolled \n        Cherokee Freedmen citizens.\n            (9) In May 2003, the Cherokee Nation held an election for \n        its officers and ratification of a new constitution. The vote \n        proposed to amend the 1999 constitution of the Cherokee Nation \n        by removing the requirement that the United States Department \n        of the Interior and Bureau of Indian Affairs approve amendments \n        to the Cherokee Nation Constitution. The Cherokee Freedmen were \n        not permitted to vote or run for office. The election violated \n        the Treaty of 1866, the 13th Amendment to the United States \n        Constitution, the Principal Chiefs Act of 1970, and the \n        Department of the Interior's guidance on the ratification of a \n        new constitution.\n            (10) In May 2003, the Cherokee Nation held an election for \n        its officers and the ratification of a new constitution. The \n        new constitution removed the requirement that the United States \n        Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n        approve amendments to the Cherokee Nation constitution. The \n        Cherokee Freedmen were not permitted to vote in this election. \n        The election violated the Treaty of 1866, the 13th Amendment to \n        the United States Constitution, and the Principal Chiefs Act of \n        1970.\n            (11) The Department of the Interior has not recognized the \n        May 2003 vote to amend the Cherokee Nation's constitution. The \n        Cherokee Nation has subsequently removed its request for \n        approval from the Department of the Interior.\n            (12) Currently, the Cherokee Nation operates under a \n        Principal Chief elected in violation to the 1970 Principal \n        Chiefs Act and Treaty of 1866, a National Council constituted \n        without Cherokee Freedmen representatives in violation of the \n        Treaty of 1866, and a Constitution not approved by the United \n        States pursuant to Article XV, Section 10 of the 1975 Cherokee \n        Nation Constitution.\n            (13) In May 2003, the Cherokee Nation renamed its highest \n        court, formerly named the Judicial Appeals Tribunal and newly \n        renamed the Supreme Court, after the Judicial Appeals Tribunal \n        ruled in a 2-1 decision that the Cherokee Freedmen were \n        entitled to citizenship pursuant to the 1975 Cherokee Nation \n        constitution. Pursuant to the new May 2003 constitution, which \n        still has not been approved by the Department of the Interior, \n        the illegally elected Principal Chief appointed two additional \n        judges to the Supreme Court. The panel of five Supreme Court \n        judges ruled in a 3-2 decision that the Cherokee Nation could \n        hold a vote on the tribal status of the Cherokee Freedmen.\n            (14) Operating under the unapproved Constitution, the \n        Cherokee Nation held an election in March 2007, to remove the \n        Cherokee Freedmen from the Cherokee Nation. In a vote of less \n        than 4 percent of the total Cherokee Nation population, the \n        voters elected to remove Cherokee Freedmen not on the Dawes \n        blood rolls from the Nation.\n            (15) In May 2007, the Cherokee Nation leadership determined \n        that it would allow registered Freedmen to vote in the June 23, \n        2007 election for tribal officers. Despite the Cherokee \n        Nation's decision to allow Freedmen to vote, Freedmen's rights \n        as members of the Cherokee Nation are severely restricted: \n        Freedmen are not allowed to run for office in the June 2007 \n        election in violation of the Treaty of 1866; the registration \n        of Freedmen entitled to Cherokee citizenship under the 1906 \n        Dawes Rolls has been halted; and the election is to be held \n        under provisions of an unapproved constitution and in violation \n        of the 1970 Principal Chiefs Act that requires the Cherokee \n        leadership to submit its voting requirements for the election \n        to the Secretary of the Interior for his approval. Further, the \n        actions of the Cherokee Nation in halting citizenship \n        application processing and voter registration of Freedmen have \n        disproportionately reduced the number of Freedmen voters that \n        can participate in the election.\n            (16) The manner in which the Cherokee Nation is conducting \n        the relationship between the United States and the tribal \n        entity is not in the best interest of the United States \n        Government, citizens of the Cherokee Nation, and violates \n        existing treaties and laws governing the relationship between \n        the United States Government and the Cherokee Nation.\n            (17) Current efforts of the Cherokee Nation to expel \n        members of the Cherokee Freedmen from the tribal rolls and \n        abolish Department of the Interior oversight are being pursued \n        in violation of the treaty rights extended to the Cherokee \n        Freedmen in a treaty agreement between the United States and \n        Cherokee Nation in the 1866 Treaty and in violation of Freedmen \n        citizenship under the federally approved Cherokee Nation \n        constitution of 1975.\n            (18) The Department of the Interior has failed to uphold \n        its fiduciary responsibility by recognizing the May 2003 \n        Cherokee Nation election for Principal Chief in which Freedmen \n        were not allowed to vote in violation of the Principal Chiefs \n        Act and the Treaty of 1866 and by failing to take any \n        administrative action against the Cherokee Nation leadership \n        for its decision to sanction a referendum in March 2007 in \n        which the Freedmen were expelled from the Cherokee Nation.\n\nSEC. 2.
