FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 1995, the Department of Health and Human Services \n        found that there is a significant underage drinking problem and \n        estimated that there are 11 million drinkers of alcoholic \n        beverages who are under the age of 21. Of that number, 2 \n        million are heavy drinkers of such beverages.\n            (2) In 1995, the proportion of students having 5 or more \n        drinks in a row during the 2 week period preceding the \n        Monitoring the Future Survey were 15 percent for 8th graders, \n        24 percent for 10th graders, and 30 percent for 12th graders.\n            (3) The median age at which children begin drinking \n        alcoholic beverages is just over 13 years. 67 percent of \n        students in the 8th grade have tried an alcoholic beverage.\n            (4) A 1995 survey found that 50 percent of the teenagers \n        who were asked said that alcohol is a more serious problem \n        among today's youth than illicit drugs.\n            (5) In 1993, nearly 10 percent (over 110,000) of the \n        clients admitted to State-funded alcohol treatment programs \n        were under the age of 21.\n            (6) Alcoholic beverage companies spent $2 billion to \n        advertise and promote their products in 1995. The budget of the \n        National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism for the same \n        year was $176 million.\n            (7) According to a study published in the American Journal \n        of Public Health, viewing beer ads on television may predispose \n        young people to drinking beer. Children who are more aware of \n        beer advertisements hold more favorable beliefs about drinking \n        beer and intend to drink beer more frequently as adults.\n            (8) Almost half of all adults think that alcohol industry \n        advertising greatly influences underage youth to drink \n        alcoholic beverages, another one-third think industry \n        advertising has some influence.\n\nSEC. 3.
