FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n        (1) the Secretary of the Interior has identified 53 dams on \n    Indian lands that present a threat to human life in the event of a \n    failure;\n        (2) because of inadequate attention in the past to problems \n    stemming from structural deficiencies and regular maintenance \n    requirements for dams operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \n    unsafe Bureau dams continue to pose an imminent threat to people \n    and property;\n        (3) many Bureau dams have maintenance deficiencies regardless \n    of their current safety condition classification and the \n    deficiencies must be corrected to avoid future threats to human \n    life and property;\n        (4) safe working dams on Indian lands are necessary to supply \n    irrigation water, to provide flood control, to provide water for \n    municipal, industrial, domestic, livestock, and recreation uses, \n    and for fish and wildlife habitats; and\n        (5) it is necessary to institute a regular dam maintenance and \n    repair program, utilizing the expertise in the Bureau, Indian \n    tribes, and other Federal agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n        (1) The term ``Bureau'' means the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n        (2) The term ``dam'' has the same meaning given such term by \n    the first section of Public Law 92-367 (33 U.S.C. 467).\n        (3) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior.\n        (4) The term ``Indian tribe'' means any Indian tribe, band, \n    nation, pueblo, or other organized group or community, including \n    any Alaska Native village or regional corporation as defined in or \n    established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, \n    which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and \n    services provided by the United States to Indian tribes because of \n    their status as Indians.\n\nSEC. 4. DAM SAFETY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a dam safety \nmaintenance and repair program within the Bureau to ensure maintenance \nand monitoring of the condition of each dam identified pursuant to \nsubsection (e) necessary to maintain the dam in a satisfactory \ncondition on a long-term basis.\n    (b) Transfer of Existing Functions and Personnel.--All functions \nperformed before the date of the enactment of this Act pursuant to the \nDam Safety Program established by the Secretary of the Interior by \norder dated February 28, 1980, and all Bureau of Indian Affairs \npersonnel assigned to such program as of the date of enactment of this \nAct are hereby transferred to the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair \nProgram. Any reference in any law, regulation, executive order, \nreorganization plan, or delegation of authority to the Dam Safety \nProgram is deemed to be a reference to the Dam Safety Maintenance and \nRepair Program.\n    (c) Rehabilitation.--Under the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair \nProgram, the Secretary shall perform such rehabilitation work as is \nnecessary to bring the dams identified pursuant to subsection (e) to a \nsatisfactory condition. In addition, each dam located on Indian lands \nshall be regularly maintained pursuant to the Dam Safety Maintenance \nand Repair Program established pursuant to subsection (a).\n    (d) Maintenance Action Plan.--The Secretary shall develop a \nmaintenance action plan, which shall include a prioritization of \nactions to be taken, for those dams with a risk hazard rating of high \nor significant as identified pursuant to subsection (e).\n    (e) Identification of Dams.--\n        (1) Development of list.--The Secretary shall develop a \n    comprehensive list of dams located on Indian lands that describes \n    the dam safety condition classification of each dam, as specified \n    in paragraph (2), the risk hazard classification of each dam, as \n    specified in paragraph (3), and the conditions resulting from \n    maintenance deficiencies.\n        (2) Dam safety condition classifications.--The dam safety \n    condition classification referred to in paragraph (1) is one of the \n    following classifications:\n            (A) Satisfactory.--No existing or potential dam safety \n        deficiencies are recognized. Safe performance is expected under \n        all anticipated conditions.\n            (B) Fair.--No existing dam safety deficiencies are \n        recognized for normal loading conditions. Infrequent hydrologic \n        or seismic events would probably result in a dam safety \n        deficiency.\n            (C) Conditionally poor.--A potential dam safety deficiency \n        is recognized for unusual loading conditions that may \n        realistically occur during the expected life of the structure.\n            (D) Poor.--A potential dam safety deficiency is clearly \n        recognized for normal loading conditions. Immediate actions to \n        resolve the deficiency are recommended; reservoir restrictions \n        may be necessary until resolution of the problem.\n            (E) Unsatisfactory.--A dam safety deficiency exists for \n        normal loading conditions. Immediate remedial action is \n        required for resolution of the problem.\n        (3) Risk hazard classification.--The risk hazard classification \n    referred to in paragraph (1) is one of the following \n    classifications:\n            (A) High.--Six or more lives would be at risk or extensive \n        property damage could occur if the dam failed.\n            (B) Significant.--Between one and six lives would be at \n        risk or significant property damage could occur if the dam \n        failed.\n            (C) Low.--No lives would be at risk and limited property \n        damage would occur if the dam failed.\n    (f) Limitation on Program Authorization.--Work authorized by this \nAct shall be for the purpose of dam safety maintenance and structural \nrepair. The Secretary may authorize, upon request of an Indian tribe, \nup to 20 percent of the cost of repairs to be used to provide \nadditional conservation storage capacity or developing benefits beyond \nthose provided by the original dams and reservoirs. This Act is not \nintended to preclude development of increased storage or benefits under \nany other authority or to preclude measures to protect fish and \nwildlife.\n    (g) Technical Assistance.--To carry out the purposes of this Act, \nthe Secretary may obtain technical assistance on a nonreimbursable \nbasis from other departments and agencies. Notwithstanding any such \ntechnical assistance, the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program \nestablished under subsection (a) shall be under the direction and \ncontrol of the Bureau.\n    (h) Contract Authority.--In addition to any other authority \nestablished by law, the Secretary is authorized to contract with Indian \ntribes (under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance \nAct (25 U.S.C. 450b(e))), as amended, to carry out the Dam Safety \nMaintenance and Repair Program established under this Act.\n    (i) Annual Report.--The Secretary shall submit an annual report on \nthe implementation of this Act. The report shall include--\n        (1) the list of dams and their status on the maintenance action \n    plan developed under this section; and\n        (2) the projected total cost and a schedule of the projected \n    annual cost of rehabilitation or repair for each dam under this \n    section.\nThe report shall be submitted at the time the budget is required to be \nsubmitted under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, to the \nSubcommittee on Native American Affairs of the Committee on Natural \nResources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Indian \nAffairs of the Senate.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \nnecessary to carry out this Act. Funds provided under this Act are to \nbe considered nonreimbursable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
