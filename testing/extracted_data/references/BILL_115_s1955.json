FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Liu Xiaobo was China's most prominent advocate for \n        democracy, human rights and freedom and a powerful voice for \n        peaceful political reform.\n            (2) Liu Xiaobo, along with other pro-democracy advocates, \n        sought to raise the Chinese people's awareness of their dignity \n        and rights by publicly calling upon the Chinese Government to \n        govern in accordance with its Constitution and the \n        international human rights agreements it has ratified.\n            (3) Liu Xiaobo, by his long and visionary leadership, has \n        become the symbol of two generations of Chinese reformers--he \n        unites the generation of student who protested at Tiananmen \n        Square in 1989 and, through his role in Charter 08, a new \n        generation of rights advocates, human rights lawyers, and \n        intellectuals.\n            (4) Liu Xiaobo, and so many other advocates for freedom, \n        have suffered official retribution and imprisonment for daring \n        to speak out against a range of human rights abuses across \n        China. In addition, their family members have faced harassment \n        and detention in response to their advocacy efforts, including \n        Liu Xia, who was detained without charges in her home since \n        2010.\n            (5) In December 2009, a Beijing court sentenced Liu Xiaobo \n        to an eleven-year sentence in a Chinese prison for ``inciting \n        subversion of state power'', in part for his role in Charter \n        08, a document calling for human rights and political reform in \n        China.\n            (6) In May 2011, the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary \n        Detention issued an opinion declaring that the Chinese \n        Government's imprisonment of Liu Xiaobo contravened the \n        Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n            (7) In 2010, many persons from around the world nominated \n        Liu Xiaobo for the Nobel Peace Prize, including the 14th Dalai \n        Lama, Bishop Desmond Tutu, and Vaclav Havel. In awarding the \n        2010 Nobel Peace Prize for his ``long and non-violent struggle \n        for fundamental human rights in China'', the Norwegian Nobel \n        Committee noted that ``through the severe punishment meted out \n        to him, Liu Xiaobo has become the foremost symbol of the wide-\n        ranging struggle for human rights in China''. He reportedly is \n        the first person since 1935 to win the prize while in prison.\n            (8) Liu Xiaobo died of late stage liver cancer on July 13, \n        2017. He was the first Nobel Peace Prize laureate to die in \n        state custody since Carl Von Ossietzky, who died after being \n        detained in a Nazi concentration camp.\n            (9) Liu Xiaobo, and all those part of the pro-democracy \n        movement in China, are the conscience of the international \n        community regarding human rights in China and serve as a \n        constant reminder that human rights, democratic transparency, \n        and liberty are critical issues of bilateral relations that, if \n        finally realized in China, will make monumental contributions \n        to world peace and stronger and more prosperous United States-\n        China relations.\n            (10) Awarding Liu Xiaobo the Congressional Gold Medal, and \n        collectively to all those who have stood for freedom and \n        democracy in China despite repression, would not only recognize \n        his contributions to peace, but to global understanding of \n        China and would further inspire millions of Chinese with the \n        ideals of freedom he so heroically articulated.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Presentation authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n        Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n        shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n        behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design \n        to Liu Xiaobo or his personal representatives and collectively \n        to all those who have peacefully advocated for democracy and \n        human rights in China in recognition of their achievements and \n        for their contributions to the cause of freedom, human rights, \n        and peace in China and globally.\n            (2) Design and striking.--For the purposes of the award \n        referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Treasury \n        (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall strike \n        the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n        inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n            (3) Smithsonian institution.--\n                    (A) In general.--Following the award of the gold \n                medal under paragraph (1), the gold medal shall be \n                given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it will be \n                available for display as appropriate and available for \n                research.\n                    (B) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of the \n                Congress that the Smithsonian Institution should make \n                the gold medal awarded pursuant to this Act available \n                for display elsewhere, particularly at appropriate \n                locations--\n                            (i) associated with the research of the \n                        Tiananmen Protests of 1989 and their subsequent \n                        violent suppression; and\n                            (ii) dedicated to preserving the history of \n                        the Chinese pro-democracy movement.\n    (b) Duplicate Medals.--The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates \nin bronze of the gold medals struck pursuant to subsection (a) under \nsuch regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient \nto cover the cost thereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of \nmachinery, and overhead expenses, and the cost of the gold medal.\n    (c) Status of Medals.--\n            (1) National medals.--Medals struck pursuant to this \n        section are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title \n        31, United States Code.\n            (2) Numismatic items.--For purposes of section 5134 of \n        title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this \n        section shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\nSEC. 4. HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE CHINESE OFFICIALS COMPLICIT IN LIU XIAOBO'S \n              IMPRISONMENT.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the United States Government \nshould--\n            (1) seek the release of political prisoners in China, \n        including seeking the unconditional release of Liu Xia and \n        ensure her freedom of movement;\n            (2) condemn all efforts to censor or intimidate the \n        families of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia and censor news and \n        information about Liu Xiaobo and his legacy;\n            (3) identify those officials or individuals involved in the \n        arrest and arbitrary detention of Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu \n        Xia;\n            (4) identify those officials or individuals complicit in \n        the torture and arbitrary detention of human rights lawyers and \n        rights advocates such as Xie Yang, Li Heping, Li Chunfu, Gao \n        Zhisheng, Chen Guangcheng, Jiang Tianyong, Tang Jingling, Wang \n        Quanzhang, and others peacefully advocating for human rights \n        and legal and political reforms in China and following in the \n        footsteps of Liu Xiaobo; and\n            (5) use the sanctions available under the Global Magnitsky \n        Human Rights Accountability Act (Public Law 114-328; 22 U.S.C. \n        2656 note) for those officials or individuals identified under \n        paragraph (4) because any official or individual complicit in \n        the torture or arbitrary detention of political prisoners \n        qualifies for the imposition of sanctions under that Act.\n\nSEC. 5. PRESERVING THE LEGACY OF LIU XIAOBO.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that funds should be authorized to \ncreate appropriate fellowship programs and awards in Liu Xiaobo's \nhonor, to preserve his ideas and legacy until the Chinese people are \nable to do so without censorship or fear, and to advance the universal \nideas of freedom, democracy and human rights in China and across the \nglobe."
