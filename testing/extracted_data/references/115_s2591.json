FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Arbitration Act (now enacted as chapter 1 \n        of title 9 of the United States Code) was intended to apply to \n        disputes between commercial entities of generally similar \n        sophistication and bargaining power.\n            (2) A series of decisions by the Supreme Court of the \n        United States have interpreted the Act so that it now extends \n        to consumer disputes and employment disputes, contrary to the \n        intent of Congress.\n            (3) Most consumers and employees have little or no \n        meaningful choice whether to submit their claims to \n        arbitration. Often, consumers and employees are not even aware \n        that they have given up their rights.\n            (4) Mandatory arbitration undermines the development of \n        public law because there is inadequate transparency and \n        inadequate judicial review of arbitrators' decisions.\n            (5) Arbitration can be an acceptable alternative when \n        consent to the arbitration is truly voluntary, and occurs after \n        the dispute arises.\n\nSEC. 3. ARBITRATION OF EMPLOYMENT, CONSUMER, ANTITRUST, AND CIVIL \n              RIGHTS DISPUTES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title 9 of the United States Code is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n\n``CHAPTER 4--ARBITRATION OF EMPLOYMENT, CONSUMER, ANTITRUST, AND CIVIL \n                            RIGHTS DISPUTES\n\n``Sec.\n``401.
