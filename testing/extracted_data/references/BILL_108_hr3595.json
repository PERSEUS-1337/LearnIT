FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In the majority of American families, parents, whether \n        married or single, must work to provide economic security for \n        their families and, not the least, for the infants newly \n        welcomed into the family. Fifty-five percent of women with \n        children less than 1 year of age are part of the workforce, \n        while 73 percent of women with children 1 year of age or older \n        are in the workforce.\n            (2) Research shows that the quality and nature of care-\n        taking in the first months and years of life are critical to a \n        newborn's subsequent brain development, social development, and \n        well-being. Healthy early development depends on nurturing and \n        dependable relationships.\n            (3) Research also shows that there is an extreme shortage \n        of quality, affordable child care for infants. Numerous studies \n        document lack of infant care and, in particular, affordable \n        care that meets basic health and safety standards, particularly \n        in rural areas. The current number of licensed infant slots can \n        only meet 18 percent of the potential need. The shortage is \n        even more acute in rural areas, especially those with a high \n        percentage of low-wage residents.\n            (4) For the well-being of American children, and for the \n        economic security of the families on which they depend, working \n        parents should be able to provide this care themselves without \n        undermining family economic stability.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT ACT OF \n              1990.\n\n    (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 658B of the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858) is \namended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(other than section 658H)'' after \n        ``subchapter'',\n            (2) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``There'', \n        and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Infant Care at Home.--There is authorized to be appropriated \nfor each of the fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007 such sums as may be \nnecessary to carry out section 658H.''.\n    (b) Application and Plan.--Section 658E(c) of the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858c(c)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (2)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (A)(i) by inserting ``(other \n                than section 658H)'' after ``subchapter'', and\n                    (B) in subparagraph (B) by inserting ``(other than \n                section 658H)'' after ``subchapter'', and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(I) Maintenance of effort.--Certify that the \n                State agrees that funds appropriated under section 658B \n                for any period will be used to supplement, and not to \n                supplant, non-Federal funds that in the absence of \n                funds appropriated under section 658B would be made \n                available to provide child care services and infant \n                care.'',\n            (2) in paragraph (3)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (B) by inserting ``(other than \n                section 658H)'' after ``subchapter'',\n                    (B) in subparagraph (D) by inserting ``(other than \n                section 658H)'' after ``subchapter'', and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(E) Assistance for infant care at home.--If a \n                State elects to receive funds appropriated under \n                section 658B(b) for a fiscal year, the State plan shall \n                provide that the State will use such funds to carry out \n                section 658H in accordance with the applicable \n                requirements of this subchapter.'', and\n            (3) in paragraph (5) by inserting ``and, if applicable, by \n        eligible parent caregivers who receive financial assistance \n        provided under section 658H'' before the period at the end.\n    (c) Activities to Improve the Quality of Child Care.--Section 658G \nof the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n9858e) is amended by inserting ``(other than section 658H)'' after \n``subchapter''.\n    (d) Financial Assistance for Infant Care Provided at Home by \nParents.--The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 \nU.S.C. 9858 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 658G the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 658H.
