    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The framers of the United States Constitution, \n        recognizing free exercise of religion as an inalienable right, \n        secured its protection in the First Amendment of the \n        Constitution; and Congress reaffirmed it in the Religious \n        Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which restores the compelling \n        interest by prohibiting the government from imposing a \n        substantial burden on the free exercise of religion unless it \n        demonstrates that application of the burden is the least \n        restrictive means of achieving a compelling governmental \n        interest.\n            (2) Many people (Quakers, Mennonite, church of the \n        Brethren) and others immigrated to this country expressly to \n        escape religious persecution for their pacifist beliefs, yet in \n        world War I hundreds of conscientious objectors were imprisoned \n        for their beliefs. Seventeen were sentenced to death, 142 were \n        sentenced to life terms, and 345 received sentences of 16.5 \n        years. None of the death sentences were carried out, but 16 \n        conscientious objectors died in prison as a result of \n        mistreatment.\n            (3) In World War II, Congress and the Administration \n        recognized ``alternative civilian service'' in lieu of military \n        service, in the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 to \n        accommodate a wide spectrum of religious beliefs and practices. \n        Subsequent case law also has expanded these exemptions. This \n        statutory policy has been characterized in case law as a ``long \n        standing tradition in this country'' and one with roots \n        ``deeply embedded in history.'' (Welsh v. United States, 1970) \n        During World War II thousands of conscientious objectors \n        provided essential staff for mental hospitals and volunteered \n        as human test subjects for arduous medical experiments, and \n        provided other service for the national health, safety and \n        interest.\n            (4) For more than 3 decades, these taxpayers sought legal \n        relief from either having their homes, livestock, automobiles, \n        and other property seized; bank accounts attached; wages \n        garnished; fines imposed; and threat of imprisonment for \n        failure to pay; or violating their consciences.\n            (5) Conscientious objection to participation in military \n        service based upon moral, ethical, or religious beliefs is \n        recognized in Federal law, with provision for alternative \n        service; but no such provision exists for taxpayers who are \n        conscientious objectors who must labor for many weeks each year \n        to pay taxes and to support military activities which violate \n        their deeply held beliefs.\n            (6) The Joint Committee on Taxation has certified that a \n        tax trust fund, providing for conscientious objector taxpayers \n        to pay their full taxes for non-military purposes, would \n        increase Federal revenues.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Designated Conscientious Objector.--For purposes of this Act, \nthe term ``designated conscientious objector'' means a taxpayer who is \nopposed to participation in war in any form based upon the taxpayer's \ndeeply held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs or training (within \nthe meaning of the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. App. 450 \net seq.)), and who has certified these beliefs in writing to the \nSecretary of the Treasury in such form and manner as the Secretary \nprovides.\n    (b) Military Purpose.--For purposes of this Act, the term \n``military purpose'' means any activity or program which any agency of \nthe Government conducts, administers, or sponsors and which effects an \naugmentation of military forces or of defensive and offensive \nintelligence activities, or enhances the capability of any person or \nnation to wage war, including the appropriation of funds by the United \nStates for--\n            (1) the Department of Defense;\n            (2) the Central Intelligence Agency;\n            (3) the National Security Council;\n            (4) the Selective Service System;\n            (5) activities of the Department of Energy that have a \n        military purpose;\n            (6) activities of the National Aeronautics and Space \n        Administration that have a military purpose;\n            (7) foreign military aid; and\n            (8) the training, supplying, or maintaining of military \n        personnel, or the manufacture, construction, maintenance, or \n        development of military weapons, installations, or strategies.\n\nSEC. 4. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM PEACE TAX FUND.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish \nan account in the Treasury of the United States to be known as the \n``Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund'', for the deposit of income, gift, \nand estate taxes paid by or on behalf of taxpayers who are designated \nconscientious objectors. The method of deposit shall be prescribed by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury in a manner that minimizes the cost to \nthe Treasury and does not impose an undue burden on such taxpayers.\n    (b) Use of Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund.--Funds in the \nReligious Freedom Peace Tax Fund shall be allocated annually to any \nappropriation not for a military purpose.\n    (c) Report.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall report to the \nCommittees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the \nSenate each year on the total amount transferred into the Religious \nFreedom Peace Tax Fund during the preceding fiscal year and the \npurposes for which such amount was allocated in such preceding fiscal \nyear. Such report shall be printed in the Congressional Record upon \nreceipt by the Committees.\n    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that any \nincrease in revenue to the Treasury resulting from the creation of the \nReligious Freedom Peace Tax Fund shall be allocated in a manner \nconsistent with the purposes of the Fund."
