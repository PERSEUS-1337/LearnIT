SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed as repealing or modifying \nany Federal law, regulation, order or land use plan, in effect prior to \nthe effective date of this Act, that prohibits or restricts the \napplication of the general mining laws, including such laws that \nprovide for special management criteria for operations under the \ngeneral mining laws as in effect prior to the effective date of this \nAct, to the extent such laws provide environmental protection greater \nthan required under this Act.\n\nSEC. 6.
