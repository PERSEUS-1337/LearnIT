FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) water resources in the United States are among the most \n        plentiful in the world;\n            (2) for many years, the effective development and use of \n        water resources in the United States has been the focus of a \n        wide array of Federal policies and programs;\n            (3) in recent years, unprecedented growth, multiple \n        competing water uses, and growing public interest in \n        environmental protection have combined to create an atmosphere \n        of conflicting policy interests;\n            (4) large-scale water conflicts continue to emerge between \n        communities, States, and stakeholder interests in the \n        southeastern region of the United States; and\n            (5) Federal support is needed to assess the utility and \n        effectiveness of current Federal policies and programs as they \n        relate to resolving State and local water supply needs.\n\nSEC. 3.
