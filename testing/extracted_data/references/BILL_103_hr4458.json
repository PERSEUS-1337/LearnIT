FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States trade deficit with Japan of more than \n        $59,000,000,000 in 1993 and the worldwide Japanese current \n        account surplus of more than $131,000,000,000 are but two \n        measures of the unfair and chronically imbalanced state of \n        Japan's international economic relations;\n            (2) even more indicative of the closed nature of the \n        Japanese market to foreign products are statistics detailing \n        the marginal penetration of sales and investment in Japan by \n        foreign companies, particularly when compared to the \n        significant Japanese penetration of the United States market;\n            (3) although Japan is the second largest market for \n        manufactured goods in the industrialized world, in 1992, \n        according to the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and \n        Industry, only 1.2 percent of all sales and .9 percent of \n        assets in the Japanese economy were attributable to foreign \n        companies, with United States corporate affiliates accounting \n        for roughly .7 percent of total product sales and approximately \n        $89 per capita in inward direct investment;\n            (4) in contrast, in 1992 foreign corporate affiliates \n        accounted for almost 17 percent of all sales and 20 percent of \n        all assets in the United States economy, with an estimated 4.8 \n        percent of total product sales and $594 per capita in \n        accumulated inward direct investment in the United States \n        coming from Japanese corporate affiliates, so that Japanese \n        corporate affiliates have a net sales and investment \n        penetration level in the United States that exceeds, by almost \n        7-fold on a per capita basis, that of United States corporate \n        affiliates in Japan;\n            (5) the majority of the blame for this highly unbalanced \n        situation rests with the Government of Japan, which has striven \n        through an intricate mixture of tariffs, controls, and domestic \n        regulations on the flow of goods and capital to, from, and \n        within Japan to keep foreign and Japanese entrepreneurs \n        desiring to do business in Japan from succeeding;\n            (6) today the market regulatory and interventionary \n        policies of the Japanese Government that intentionally or \n        unintentionally serve to keep foreign companies from doing \n        business in Japan must be removed to maintain the strength of \n        the United States-Japan relationship and to improve the growth \n        of the world economy;\n            (7) United States trade and trade promotion policies toward \n        Japan must also change to reflect post-Cold War priorities of \n        export expansion and technological competitiveness, the central \n        objective of which is to help United States companies become as \n        vital a part of the Japanese industrial system as Japanese \n        companies have become in the United States;\n            (8) one proven effective way in which the United States \n        Government can assist United States industry in overcoming \n        barriers to access in Japan, improve awareness of scientific \n        and technological developments in Japan, and facilitate greater \n        coordination between United States industry and the United \n        States Government in the making of trade and technology policy \n        is to promote the establishment of United States industrial and \n        service sector association representative offices in Japan;\n            (9) despite the very large potential for sales in Japan of \n        goods manufactured in the United States, because of the great \n        cost of establishing representative operations in Japan, only 3 \n        nonagricultural United States industry associations have \n        created full-time offices in Japan (the auto parts, \n        electronics, and semiconductor industries) and all have relied \n        on the partial support of funding under the Market Development \n        Cooperator Program established under the Export Enhancement Act \n        of 1988; and\n            (10) the expedient expansion of the Market Development \n        Cooperator Program will have a significant impact on \n        facilitating greater United States exports to Japan and on \n        enhancing the awareness by United States industry of \n        competitive developments and opportunities in the Japanese \n        market.\n\n             TITLE I--MARKET DEVELOPMENT COOPERATOR PROGRAM\n\nSEC. 101. EXPANSION OF THE MARKET DEVELOPMENT COOPERATOR PROGRAM IN \n              JAPAN.\n\n    (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to funds \notherwise available for such purpose, there are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Department of Commerce for fiscal year 1995, \n$3,000,000--\n            (1) to increase the number of United States manufacturing \n        and service sector industry associations in Japan participating \n        in the Market Development Cooperator Program established under \n        section 2303 of the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. \n        4723); and\n            (2) to expand the trade promotion, technological \n        monitoring, and industry analysis activities undertaken before \n        the enactment of this Act by United States nonprofit \n        manufacturing and service trade associations in Japan.\n    (b) Reports on the Program.--Section 2303 of the Export Enhancement \nAct of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 4723) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(e) Reports to Congress.--The Secretary of Commerce shall report \nannually to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on \nAppropriations of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations \nof the Senate on the progress the Department of Commerce has made in \nimplementing the Market Development Cooperator Program and in \nallocating funding to cooperator recipients in Japan.''.\n\n  TITLE II--UNITED STATES EXPORT DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY CENTER IN \n                                 JAPAN\n\nSEC. 201.
