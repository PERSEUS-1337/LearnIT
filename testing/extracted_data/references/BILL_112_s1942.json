FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to projections from the 2010 decennial \n        census, the number of individuals in the United States who are \n        65 years of age or older will increase from 40,000,000 in 2010 \n        to 72,000,000 in 2030. Yet, a 2004 report by the Surface \n        Transportation Policy Project found that more than 1 in 5 (or \n        21 percent) of individuals who are 65 years of age or older do \n        not drive.\n            (2) According to a 2011 report by the National Association \n        of Area Agencies on Aging, inadequate transportation options \n        for older adults has emerged as the second greatest challenge \n        identified by communities during the 5-year period ending in \n        2011.\n            (3) According to a 2004 report by the Surface \n        Transportation Policy Project, more than \\1/2\\ of seniors who \n        are 65 years of age and older (numbering 3,600,000 individuals) \n        who no longer drive due to a decline in health, stay at home on \n        any given day partially because they lack transportation \n        options. Alternatives to driving are particularly sparse in \n        some regions and in rural and small town communities.\n            (4) According to a 2004 report by the Surface \n        Transportation Policy Project, compared with older drivers, \n        older non-drivers in the United States make 15 percent fewer \n        trips to the doctor, 59 percent fewer shopping trips, and 65 \n        percent fewer trips for social, family, and religious \n        activities.\n            (5) In 2009, the program under section 5310 of title 49, \n        United States Code, provided more than 43,000,000 rides to \n        older adults and people with disabilities.\n            (6) Access to mobility management services help transit and \n        human services systems meet the needs of older adults and \n        people with disabilities. This person-centered strategy helps \n        individuals and families review available transportation \n        options and support their decisions regarding the \n        transportation options that are best suited to their \n        circumstances, preferences and mobility needs.\n\nSEC. 3.
