FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A growing body of evidence demonstrates that increases \n        in patient-level financial barriers (including deductibles, \n        copayments, and coinsurance) for high-value medical services \n        (such as prescription medications, clinician visits, diagnostic \n        tests, and procedures) systematically reduces the use of such \n        services. Savings attributable to cost-related, decreased \n        utilization of specific services may lead to an increase in \n        total medical expenditures due to increased use of other \n        related clinical services, such as hospitalizations and \n        emergency room visits.\n            (2) Empirical research studies demonstrate that reductions \n        in beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses for high-value \n        prescription medications and clinical services can mitigate the \n        adverse health and financial consequences attributable to cost-\n        related decreased utilization of high-value services.\n            (3) Financial barriers to prescription medications and \n        clinical services that are deemed to be high-value should be \n        reduced or eliminated to increase their use.\n            (4) Value-Based Insurance Design is a methodology that \n        adjusts patient out-of-pocket costs for prescription \n        medications and clinical services according to the clinical \n        value, not exclusively the cost. Value-Based Insurance Design \n        is based on the concept of clinical nuance that recognizes--\n                    (A) prescription medications and clinical services \n                differ in the clinical benefit provided; and\n                    (B) the clinical benefit derived from a specific \n                prescription medication or clinical service depends on \n                the clinical situation, the provider, and where the \n                care is delivered.\n            (5) The current ``one-size-fits-all'' copayment or \n        coinsurance design for prescription medications and clinical \n        services provided under the Medicare program does not recognize \n        the well-established value differences in health outcomes \n        produced by various medical interventions.\n            (6) The establishment by Medicare of copayment and \n        coinsurance requirements using Value-Based Insurance Design \n        methodologies will improve patient-centered health outcomes, \n        enhance personal responsibility, and afford a more efficient \n        use of taxpayer dollars.\n\nSEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this \nsection referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a \ndemonstration program to test Value-Based Insurance Design \nmethodologies in Medicare Advantage plans under part C of title XVIII \nof the Social Security Act for beneficiaries with chronic clinical \nconditions.\n    (b) Demonstration Program Design.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall select not less than 2 \n        Medicare Advantage plans to participate in the demonstration \n        program under this section.\n            (2) Requirements.--A Medicare Advantage plan selected to \n        participate in the demonstration program under paragraph (1) \n        shall meet the following requirements:\n                    (A) The plan offers a coordinated Medicare Part D \n                drug benefit.\n                    (B) The plan and the Medicare Advantage \n                organization offering the plan meet such other criteria \n                as the Secretary determines appropriate.\n    (c) Expansion of Demonstration Program.--The Secretary shall expand \nthe demonstration program by issuing regulations to implement, on a \npermanent basis, the components of the demonstration program that are \nbeneficial to Medicare beneficiaries and the Medicare program, unless \nthe report under subsection (e) or (f)(3) contains an evaluation that \nthe demonstration program under this section--\n            (1) increases Medicare program expenditures for \n        beneficiaries participating in the demonstration program; or\n            (2) decreases the quality of health care services provided \n        to Medicare beneficiaries participating in the demonstration \n        program.\n    (d) Value-Based Insurance Design Methodology.--\n            (1) Value-based insurance design.--For purposes of this \n        section, ``Value-Based Insurance Design'' is a methodology for \n        identifying specific prescription medications and clinical \n        services for which copayments or coinsurance should be reduced \n        or eliminated due to the high-value and effectiveness of such \n        medications and services for specific clinical conditions.\n            (2) Reduction of copayments and coinsurance.--Under the \n        demonstration program, a Medicare Advantage organization, using \n        Value-Based Insurance Design methodologies, shall identify each \n        prescription medication and clinical service for which the \n        amount of the copayment or coinsurance payable should be \n        reduced or eliminated.\n            (3) Reduction of copayments and coinsurance to encourage \n        use of specific clinical services.--Under the demonstration \n        program, the Medicare Advantage organization, using Value-Based \n        Insurance Design, may lower cost-sharing under the plan for the \n        purpose of encouraging enrollees to use prescription \n        medications and clinical services (such as preventive care, \n        primary care, specialty visits, diagnostic tests, procedures, \n        and durable medical equipment) that such organization has \n        identified as high-value for the management of specified \n        clinical conditions in paragraph (5). Any such variation on \n        copayment or coinsurance by a Medicare Advantage organization \n        must occur on an annual basis and be evidence-based.\n            (4) Reduction of copayments and coinsurance to encourage \n        use of specific high-performing providers.--Under the \n        demonstration program, the Medicare Advantage organization, \n        using Value-Based Insurance Design, may lower cost-sharing \n        under the plan for the purpose of encouraging enrollees to use \n        providers that such organization has identified as high-\n        performing based on quality metrics. Any such variation on \n        copayment or coinsurance by a Medicare Advantage organization \n        must occur on an annual basis.\n            (5) Specific clinical conditions.--In identifying clinical \n        conditions for purposes of paragraph (3), the Medicare \n        Advantage organization shall, at a minimum, consider the \n        services utilized across the spectrum of care in the management \n        of the following clinical conditions:\n                    (A) Asthma.\n                    (B) Atrial fibrillation.\n                    (C) Deep venous thrombosis.\n                    (D) Cancer.\n                    (E) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n                    (F) Chronic renal failure/End stage renal disease.\n                    (G) Congestive heart failure.\n                    (H) Ischemic heart disease/Myocardial infarction.\n                    (I) Depression.\n                    (J) Diabetes mellitus.\n                    (K) Hyperlipidemia.\n                    (L) Hypertension.\n                    (M) Osteoporosis.\n                    (N) Stroke.\n                    (O) Tobacco abuse disorder.\n            (6) Prohibition of increases of copayments and \n        coinsurance.--A Medicare Advantage plan selected to participate \n        in the demonstration program under paragraph (1) may not raise \n        cost-sharing on any item or service to discourage its use.\n    (e) Report on Implementation.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to \n        Congress a report on the implementation by the Secretary of the \n        demonstration program under this section.\n            (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n        include the following:\n                    (A) A statement setting forth each medication and \n                clinical service identified pursuant to subsection \n                (d)(3).\n                    (B) For each such medication or clinical service \n                identified pursuant to subsection (d)(3), a statement \n                of the amount of the copayment or coinsurance required \n                to be paid for such service and the amount of the \n                reduction from previous cost-sharing levels.\n                    (C) For each such high-performing provider \n                identified pursuant to subsection (d)(4), a statement \n                of the amount of the copayment or coinsurance required \n                to be paid for such clinician visit and the amount of \n                the reduction from previous cost-sharing levels.\n    (f) Review and Assessment of Utilization of Value-Based Insurance \nDesign Methodologies.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall enter into a contract \n        or agreement with an independent, nonbiased entity having \n        expertise in Value-Based Insurance Design to review and assess \n        the implementation of the demonstration program under this \n        section.
