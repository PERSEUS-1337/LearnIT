SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Rights and \nEmployee Investigation Clarification Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Fair Credit Reporting Act, as interpreted by the \n        Federal Trade Commission, impedes investigations of workplace \n        misconduct.\n            (2) The Fair Credit Reporting Act undermines the ability of \n        employers to use experienced outside organizations or \n        individuals to investigate allegations of drug use or sales, \n        violence, sexual harassment, other types of harassment, \n        employment discrimination, job safety and health violations, as \n        well as criminal activity, including theft, fraud, \n        embezzlement, sabotage or arson, patient or elder abuse, child \n        abuse, and other types of misconduct related to employment.\n            (3) Employers have been advised by agencies and the courts \n        to utilize such experienced outside organizations and \n        individuals in many cases to assure compliance with civil \n        rights laws and other laws, as well as written workplace \n        policies.\n            (4) Employees and consumers are put at risk because the \n        Fair Credit Reporting Act frustrates or impedes employers in \n        their efforts to maintain a safe and productive workforce.\n            (5) The Fair Credit Reporting Act should not chill the use \n        of experienced outside organizations or individuals to assist \n        employers in their investigations of workplace misconduct or \n        misbehavior by potentially subjecting those employers to \n        additional liabilities or damages.\n\nSEC. 2.
