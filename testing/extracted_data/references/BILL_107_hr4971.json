FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the American Eagle silver bullion coin leads the global \n        market, and is the largest and most popular silver coin program \n        in the United States;\n            (2) established in 1986, the American Eagle silver bullion \n        program is the most successful silver bullion program in the \n        world;\n            (3) from fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2001, the \n        American Eagle silver bullion program generated--\n                    (A) revenues of $264,100,000; and\n                    (B) sufficient profits to significantly reduce the \n                national debt;\n            (4) with the depletion of silver reserves in the Defense \n        Logistic Agency's Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpile, \n        it is necessary for the Department of the Treasury to acquire \n        silver from other sources in order to preserve the American \n        Eagle silver bullion program;\n            (5) with the ability to obtain silver from other sources, \n        the United States Mint can continue the highly successful \n        American Eagle silver bullion program, exercising sound \n        business judgment and market acquisition practices in its \n        approach to the silver market, resulting in continuing \n        profitability of the program;\n            (6) in 2001, silver was commercially produced in 12 States, \n        including, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, \n        Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah, and \n        Washington;\n            (7) Nevada is the largest silver producing State in the \n        Nation, producing--\n                    (A) 17,500,000 ounces of silver in 2001; and\n                    (B) 34 percent of United States silver production \n                in 2000;\n            (8) the mining industry in Idaho is vital to the economy of \n        the State, and the Silver Valley in northern Idaho leads the \n        world in recorded silver production, with over 1,100,000,000 \n        ounces of silver produced between 1884 and 2001;\n            (9) the largest, active silver producing mine in the Nation \n        is the McCoy/Cove Mine in Nevada, which produced more than \n        107,000,000 ounces of silver between 1989 and 2001;\n            (10) the mining industry in Idaho--\n                    (A) employs more than 3,000 people;\n                    (B) contributes more than $900,000,000 to the Idaho \n                economy; and\n                    (C) produces $70,000,000 worth of silver per year;\n            (11) the silver mines of the Comstock lode, the premier \n        silver producing deposit in Nevada, brought people and wealth \n        to the region, paving the way for statehood in 1864, and giving \n        Nevada its nickname as ``the Silver State'';\n            (12) mines in the Silver Valley--\n                    (A) represent an important part of the mining \n                history of Idaho and the United States; and\n                    (B) have served in the past as key components of \n                the United States war effort; and\n            (13) silver has been mined in Nevada throughout its \n        history, with every significant metal mining camp in Nevada \n        producing some silver.\n\nSEC. 3. PURCHASE OF SILVER BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\n\n    (a) Purchase of Silver.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 5116(b)(2) of title 31, United \n        States Code, is amended by inserting after the second sentence \n        the following: ``At such time as the silver stockpile is \n        depleted, the Secretary shall obtain silver as described in \n        paragraph (1) to mint coins authorized under section 5112(e). \n        If it is not economically feasible to obtain such silver, the \n        Secretary may obtain silver for coins authorized under section \n        5112(e) from other available sources. The Secretary shall not \n        pay more than the average world price for silver under any \n        circumstances. As used in this paragraph, the term `average \n        world price' means the price determined by a widely recognized \n        commodity exchange at the time the silver is obtained by the \n        Secretary.''.\n            (2) Rulemaking authority.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n        shall issue regulations to implement the amendments made by \n        paragraph (1).\n    (b) Study Required.--\n            (1) Study.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall conduct a \n        study of the impact on the United States silver market of the \n        coins minted and issued under section 5112(e) of title 31, \n        United States Code, commonly referred to as the ``American \n        Eagle silver bullion program''.\n            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n        submit a report of the study conducted under paragraph (1) to \n        the chairman and ranking minority member of--\n                    (A) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n                Affairs of the Senate; and\n                    (B) the Committee on Financial Services of the \n                House of Representatives.\n    (c) Annual Report.--\n            (1) In general.--The Director of the United States Mint \n        shall prepare and submit to Congress an annual report on the \n        purchases of silver made pursuant to this Act and the \n        amendments made by this Act.\n            (2) Concurrent submission.--The report required by \n        paragraph (1) may be incorporated into the annual report of the \n        Director of the United States Mint on the operations of the \n        mint and assay offices, referred to in section 1329 of title \n        44, United States Code."
