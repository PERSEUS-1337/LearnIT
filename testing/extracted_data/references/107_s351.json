    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury Reduction Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) mercury is a persistent and toxic pollutant that \n        bioaccumulates in the environment;\n            (2) according to recent studies, mercury deposition is a \n        significant public health threat in many States throughout the \n        United States;\n            (3) 40 States have issued fish advisories that warn certain \n        individuals to restrict or avoid consuming mercury-contaminated \n        fish from affected bodies of water;\n            (4) according to a report by the National Academy of \n        Sciences, over 60,000 children are born each year in the United \n        States at risk for adverse neurodevelopmental effects due to \n        exposure to methyl mercury in utero;\n            (5) studies have documented that exposure to elevated \n        levels of mercury in the environment results in serious harm to \n        species of wildlife that consume fish;\n            (6) according to the Mercury Study Report, prepared by the \n        Environmental Protection Agency and submitted to Congress in \n        1997, mercury fever thermometers contribute approximately 17 \n        tons of mercury to solid waste each year;\n            (7) the Governors of the New England States have endorsed a \n        regional goal of ``the virtual elimination of the discharge of \n        anthropogenic mercury into the environment'';\n            (8) mercury fever thermometers are easily broken, creating \n        a potential risk of dangerous exposure to mercury vapor in \n        indoor air and risking mercury contamination of the \n        environment; and\n            (9) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the \n        quantity of mercury in 1 mercury fever thermometer, \n        approximately 1 gram, is enough to contaminate all fish in a \n        lake with a surface area of 20 acres.\n\nSEC. 3.
