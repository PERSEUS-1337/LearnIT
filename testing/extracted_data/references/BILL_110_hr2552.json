FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Approximately 5,000,000 Americans are infected with the \n        hepatitis C virus (referred to in this section as ``HCV''), and \n        more than 3,000,000 Americans are chronically infected, leading \n        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (referred to in \n        this section as the ``CDC'') to recognize HCV as the Nation's \n        most common chronic blood-borne virus infection.\n            (2) According to the CDC, nearly 2 percent of the \n        population of the United States have been infected with HCV.\n            (3) The CDC conservatively estimates that approximately \n        30,000 Americans are newly infected with HCV each year, and \n        that number has been growing since 2001.\n            (4) HCV infection, in the United States, is the most common \n        cause of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and liver \n        cancer, the most common indication for liver transplant, and \n        the leading cause of death in people with HIV/AIDS. In \n        addition, there may be links between HCV and certain other \n        diseases, given that a high number of people infected with HCV \n        also suffer from type 2 diabetes, lymphoma, thyroid and certain \n        blood disorders, and autoimmune disease. Moreover, \n        methamphetamine abuse--which is a matter of increasing concern \n        to Congress and public health officials across the country--is \n        recognized by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to be \n        inextricably linked to HCV.\n            (5) The majority of individuals infected with HCV are \n        unaware of their infection. Individuals infected with HCV serve \n        as a source of transmission to others and, since few \n        individuals are aware they are infected, they are unlikely to \n        take precautions to prevent the spread or exacerbation of their \n        infection.\n            (6) There is no vaccine available to prevent HCV infection.\n            (7) Treatments are available that can eradicate the disease \n        in approximately 50 percent of those who are treated, and \n        behavioral changes can slow the progression of the disease.\n            (8) Conservative estimates place the costs of direct \n        medical expenses for HCV at more than $1,000,000,000 in the \n        United States annually, and such costs will undoubtedly \n        increase in the absence of expanded prevention and treatment \n        efforts.\n            (9) To combat the HCV epidemic in the United States, the \n        CDC developed Recommendations for Prevention and Control of \n        Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and HCV-Related Chronic \n        Disease in 1998 and the National Hepatitis C Prevention \n        Strategy in 2001, and the National Institutes of Health \n        convened Consensus Development Conferences on the Management of \n        Hepatitis C in 1997 and 2002. These recommendations and \n        guidelines provide a framework for HCV prevention, control, \n        research, and medical management referral programs.\n            (10) The Department of Veterans Affairs (referred to in \n        this paragraph as the ``VA''), which cares for more people \n        infected with HCV than any other health care system, is the \n        Nation's leader in HCV screening, testing, and treatment. Since \n        1998, it has been the VA's policy to screen for HCV risk \n        factors all veterans receiving VA health care, and the VA \n        currently recommends testing for all those who are found to be \n        ``at risk'' for the virus and for all others who wish to be \n        tested. In fiscal year 2004, over 98 percent of VA patients had \n        been screened for HCV risk factors, and over 90 percent of \n        those ``at risk'' were tested. For all veterans who test \n        positive for HCV and enroll in VA medical care, the VA offers \n        medications that can help HCV or its complications. The VA also \n        has programs for HCV patient and provider education, clinical \n        care, data-based quality improvement, and research, and it has \n        4 Hepatitis C Resource Centers to develop and disseminate \n        innovative practices and tools to improve patient care. This \n        comprehensive program should be commended and could potentially \n        serve as a model for future HCV programs.\n            (11) Federal support is necessary to increase knowledge and \n        awareness of HCV and to assist State and local prevention and \n        control efforts.\n\nSEC. 3.
