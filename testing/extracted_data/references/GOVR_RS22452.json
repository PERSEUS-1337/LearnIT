A \"follow-on mission,\" Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS), was started on January 1, 2015, to \"continue training, advising, and assisting Afghan security forces.\" Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) began on March 19, 2003, and was primarily conducted in Iraq. On August 31, 2010, President Obama announced that OIF had ended. A transitional force of U.S. troops remained in Iraq under Operation New Dawn (OND), which ended on December 15, 2011. Several thousand U.S. civilian personnel, contract personnel, and a limited number of U.S. military personnel remain in Iraq carrying out U.S. government business and cooperative programs under the auspices of agreements with the Iraqi government. On October 15, 2014, U.S. Central Command designated new military operations in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR). (For more information on war and conflict dates, see CRS Report RS21405, U.S. Periods of War and Dates of Recent Conflicts , by [author name scrubbed].) Daily updates of total U.S. military and civilian casualties in OIF, OEF, OND, OIR, and OFS can be found at the Department of Defense's (DOD's) website, at http://www.defense.gov/news/casualty.pdf . Table 1 gives the overall casualties in OIF, OND, and OEF. The U.S. Army Office of the Surgeon General (OSG), using the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS), provided data on the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases. According to Dr. Michael Carino of the OSG, a case of PTSD is defined as an individual with two or more outpatient visits or one or more hospitalizations during which PTSD was diagnosed. The threshold of two or more outpatient visits is used in the DMSS to increase the likelihood that the individual has, or had, clinically diagnosable PTSD. A single visit on record commonly reflects a servicemember who was evaluated for possible PTSD, but did not actually meet the criteria for clinical diagnosis. In this data set, an incident of PTSD among deployed servicemembers is defined as occurring when a deployed servicemember was diagnosed with PTSD at least 30 days after being deployed.  Many statistics on traumatic brain injury (TBI) are available to the public, at the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, at http://dvbic.dcoe.mil/dod-worldwide-numbers-tbi . Unlike PTSD numbers, which are segmented by those deployed and those not previously deployed, TBI numbers represent medical diagnoses of TBI that occurred anywhere U.S. forces are located, including the continental United States.   Table 4 shows the number of individuals with battle-injury major limb amputations for OEF, OFS, OIF, OND, and OIR. A major limb amputation includes the loss of one or more limbs, the loss of one or more partial limbs, or the loss of one or more full or partial hand or foot. The total number of individuals with major limb amputations as of June 1, 2015, is 1,645.   Figure 3 charts the number of major limb amputations due to a battle injury in OIF, OND, OIR, OEF, and OFS from 2001 through June 1, 2015, for all services.  DOD provides data on the demographics of servicemembers who have died or been wounded in action in OIF, OND, and OEF through the Defense Casualty Analysis System at https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/dcas/pages/casualties.xhtml . To find this information, select a conflict and select between \"deaths\" or \"wounded in action,\" and then select from the demographic categories, including gender, age, race, and ethnicity. Similar data have not yet been publically released for OEF and OIR."
