FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Health care costs in the United States are rising. From \n        2004 through 2005, the medical costs for a four-person \n        household increased by 9.1 percent to $12,214. A significant \n        portion of these increased costs are attributable to health \n        care-associated infections. When a patient contracts such an \n        infection, that cost is passed on to the insurance companies, \n        State and Federal governments, or individuals.\n            (2) Health care-associated infections contribute to over \n        $50,000,000,000 in annual medical costs. An acquired infection \n        adds $150,000 to a medical bill per patient.\n            (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n        that there are an estimated 2,000,000 cases of health care-\n        associated infections and an estimated 90,000 deaths related to \n        such infections annually.\n            (4) Only six States require hospitals to report their \n        health care-associated infection rates. Only one State makes \n        that information available to the public for each hospital.\n            (5) Health care-associated infections include surgical site \n        infections, ventilator associated pneumonia, central line \n        related (IV) blood infections, urinary tract infections, \n        methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, \n        and other types of infections. These infections are transmitted \n        to patients when there is inadequate adherence to clean \n        sanitation and patient safety procedures that would otherwise \n        prevent infectious disease. A study in the American Journal of \n        Medical Quality of almost 12,000 hospitalizations reports that \n        hospital procedures, not the sickness of the patient at the \n        time of admission, tended to be the primary cause of these \n        infections.\n            (6) Hospitals and other health care providers have been \n        able to drastically reduce infection rates by strict adherence \n        to clean sanitation techniques, including:\n                    (A) Handwashing before and after contact with any \n                patient.\n                    (B) Sterilizing all equipment used with patients.\n                    (C) Clean up before and after patient procedures.\n                    (D) Proper use of antibiotics before and after \n                surgery.\n                    (E) Pre-testing patients on admission to evaluate \n                the presence of an infection (such as MRSA).\n                    (F) Use of infection control boards at hospitals to \n                monitor and manage procedures.\n            (7) The National Surgical Infection Prevention Project \n        found in a study of over 34,000 patients treated nationwide \n        that more than 44 percent of patients did not receive \n        antibiotic doses within the recommended time frame. In \n        addition, the American Journal of Infection Control reports \n        that 70 percent of health care workers do not adhere to \n        handwashing and sterilization procedures.\n            (8) Hospitals have successfully reduced infections by \n        improving patient safety. For example, Allegheny General \n        Hospital in Pennsylvania reduced the rate of central line-\n        acquired infections to almost zero within 90 days by educating \n        and training health care staff on infection control resulting \n        in savings in three years of over $2,000,000. A major teaching \n        hospital in St. Louis reported a reduction in central line \n        acquired infection rates through introduction of an educational \n        program for all staff resulting in cost savings of over \n        $1,500,000. Mercy Health Center in Oklahoma has performed 400 \n        surgeries without any infections by utilizing antibiotics and \n        clean procedures.\n            (9) Uniform and accurate public reporting of health care-\n        associated infections by hospitals and ambulatory surgical \n        centers will allow health care providers to target their \n        efforts to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated \n        infections, enhance consumer choice of health care providers, \n        reduce health care costs, and save lives.\n\nSEC. 3.
