IMMIGRANTS TO NEW AMERICANS MODEL PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Immigrants to \nNew Americans Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1997, there were an estimated 25,800,000 foreign-\n        born individuals residing in the United States. That number is \n        the largest number of such foreign-born individuals ever in \n        United States history and represents a 6,000,000, or 30 \n        percent, increase over the 1990 census figure of 19,800,000 of \n        such foreign-born individuals. The Bureau of the Census \n        estimates that the recently arrived immigrant population \n        (including the refugee population) currently residing in the \n        Nation will account for 75 percent of the population growth in \n        the United States over the next 50 years.\n            (2) For millions of immigrants settling into the Nation's \n        hamlets, towns, and cities, the dream of ``life, liberty, and \n        the pursuit of happiness'' has become a reality. The wave of \n        immigrants, from various nationalities, who have chosen the \n        United States as their home, has positively influenced the \n        Nation's image and relationship with other nations. The diverse \n        cultural heritage of the Nation's immigrants has helped define \n        the Nation's culture, customs, economy, and communities. By \n        better understanding the people who have immigrated to the \n        Nation, individuals in the United States better understand what \n        it means to be an American.\n            (3) There is a critical shortage of teachers with the \n        skills needed to educate immigrant students and their families \n        in nonconcentrated, nontraditional, immigrant communities as \n        well as communities with large immigrant populations. The large \n        influx of immigrant families over the last decade presents a \n        national dilemma: The number of such families with school-age \n        children, requiring assistance to successfully participate in \n        elementary schools, secondary schools, and communities in the \n        United States, is increasing without a corresponding increase \n        in the number of teachers with skills to accommodate their \n        needs.\n            (4) Immigrants arriving in communities across the Nation \n        generally settle into high-poverty areas, where funding for \n        programs to provide immigrant students and their families with \n        the services the students and families need to successfully \n        participate in elementary schools, secondary schools, and \n        communities in the United States is inadequate.\n            (5) The influx of immigrant families settling into many \n        United States communities is often the result of concerted \n        efforts by local employers who value immigrant labor. Those \n        employers realize that helping immigrants to become productive, \n        prosperous members of a community is beneficial for the local \n        businesses involved, the immigrants, and the community. \n        Further, local businesses benefit from the presence of the \n        immigrant families because the families present businesses with \n        a committed and effective workforce and help to open up new \n        market opportunities. However, many of the communities into \n        which the immigrants have settled need assistance in order to \n        give immigrant students and their families the services the \n        students and families need to successfully participate in \n        elementary schools, secondary schools, and communities, in the \n        United States.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish a grant \nprogram, within the Department of Education, that provides funding to \npartnerships of local educational agencies and community-based \norganizations for the development of model programs to provide to \nimmigrant students and their families the services the students and \nfamilies need to successfully participate in elementary schools, \nsecondary schools, and communities, in the United States.\n    (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Community-based organization; elementary school; local \n        educational agency; secondary school.--The terms ``community-\nbased organization'', ``elementary school'', ``local educational \nagency'', and ``secondary school'' have the meanings given the terms in \nsection 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \nU.S.C. 8801).\n            (2) Immigrant.--The term ``immigrant'' has the meaning \n        given the term in section 101 of the Immigration and \n        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101).\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Education.\n    (e) Program Authorized.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary is authorized to award not \n        more than 10 grants in a fiscal year to eligible partnerships \n        for the design and implementation of model programs to--\n                    (A) assist immigrant students to achieve in \n                elementary schools and secondary schools in the United \n                States by offering such educational services as English \n                as a second language classes, literacy programs, \n                programs for introduction to the education system, and \n                civics education; and\n                    (B) assist parents of immigrant students by \n                offering such services as parent education and literacy \n                development services and by coordinating activities \n                with other entities to provide comprehensive community \n                social services such as health care, job training, \n                child care, and transportation services.\n            (2) Duration.--Each grant awarded under this section shall \n        be awarded for a period of not more than 5 years. A partnership \n        may use funds made available through the grant for not more \n        than 1 year for planning and program design.\n    (f) Applications for Grants.--\n            (1) In general.--Each eligible partnership desiring a grant \n        under this section shall submit an application to the Secretary \n        at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may require.\n            (2) Eligible partnerships.--To be eligible to receive a \n        grant under this section, a partnership--\n                    (A) shall include--\n                            (i) at least 1 local educational agency;
