SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the Librarian of Congress (referred to in this section \n        as the ``Librarian'') should ensure that noninfringing uses of \n        copyrighted works, as well as activities unrelated to the \n        copyrighted works, are not unduly burdened by the application \n        of section 1201 of title 17, United States Code;\n            (2) the Librarian should apply section 1201 of title 17, \n        United States Code, in a manner that strikes a balance between \n        the ability of persons to make noninfringing use of copyrighted \n        works and the legitimate protection of intellectual property \n        rights;\n            (3) the Librarian, in considering whether to grant \n        exemptions to the prohibition on the circumvention of \n        technological protection measures, should recognize that such \n        measures prevent persons from undertaking activities unrelated \n        to the use of copyrighted works; and\n            (4) the Librarian--\n                    (A) should not impose undue burdens on proponents \n                of exemptions; and\n                    (B) should ensure that the rulemaking process for \n                considering exemptions is responsive to changes in the \n                technological landscape.\n\nSEC. 3. CIRCUMVENTION OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) Violations Regarding Circumvention of Technological Measures.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 1201(a)(1) of title 17, United \n        States Code, is amended--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking the second \n                sentence;\n                    (B) in subparagraph (C)--\n                            (i) in the matter preceding clause (i)--\n                                    (I) by striking ``During the 2-year \n                                period described in subparagraph (A), \n                                and during each succeeding 3-year \n                                period,'' and inserting ``Every 3 \n                                years,'';
