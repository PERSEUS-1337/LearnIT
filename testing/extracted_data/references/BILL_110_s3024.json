FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There has been established in the District of Columbia \n        a private, nonprofit corporation known as the Eurasia \n        Foundation (hereafter in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Foundation''), which is not an agency or establishment of the \n        United States Government.\n            (2) In recognition of the valuable contributions of the \n        Foundation to long-range United States foreign policy \n        interests, the United States Government has, through the United \n        States Agency for International Development and the Department \n        of State, provided financial support for the Foundation.\n            (3) It is in the interest of the United States, and the \n        further strengthening of cooperation with the countries of \n        Eurasia, to establish a more permanent mechanism for United \n        States Government financial support for the ongoing activities \n        of the Foundation, while preserving the independent character \n        of the Foundation.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Foundation are to--\n            (1) promote civil society, private enterprise, and sound \n        public administration and policy only in the countries of \n        Eurasia and in lending encouragement and assistance to citizens \n        of such countries in their own efforts to develop more open, \n        just, and democratic societies;\n            (2) strengthen indigenous institutions only in the \n        countries of Eurasia in order to foster national development, \n        constructive social change, equitable economic growth, and \n        cooperative international relationships that are fully \n        consistent with and supportive of long-term United States \n        interests with respect to the countries of Eurasia; and\n            (3) conduct programs in response to initiatives in the \n        countries of Eurasia that would be difficult or impossible for \n        an official United States entity, and, as a result of its \n        position in the countries of Eurasia, to respond quickly and \n        flexibly to meet new opportunities.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS TO THE FOUNDATION.\n\n    (a) Grants Required.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of State shall award an \n        annual grant to the Foundation to enable the Foundation to \n        carry out the purposes described in section 2(b).\n            (2) Additional requirements.--Each grant awarded under \n        paragraph (1) shall--\n                    (A) consist of funds specifically appropriated for \n                grants to the Foundation; and\n                    (B) be contingent upon a grant agreement between \n                the Secretary and the Foundation that requires the \n                Foundation to--\n                            (i) only use grant funds for activities \n                        that the Board of Directors of the Foundation \n                        determines are consistent with the purposes \n                        described in section 2(b); and\n                            (ii) otherwise comply with the requirements \n                        of this Act.\n    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed \nto--\n            (1) make the Foundation an agency or establishment of the \n        United States Government; or\n            (2) make the members of the Board of Directors of the \n        Foundation, or the officers or employees of the Foundation, \n        officers or employees of the United States.\n    (c) Oversight.--The Foundation and its grantees shall be subject to \nthe appropriate oversight procedures of Congress.\n    (d) Other Funding.--The Foundation may accept funding from non-\nUnited States Government sources to complement United States Government \nfunding.\n    (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) a Foundation, funded for fiscal year 2009 at the levels \n        authorized under section 7, and at appropriate levels in \n        subsequent fiscal years, can contribute significantly to the \n        political, economic, and social development of democracy and \n        human rights in the countries of Eurasia;\n            (2) notwithstanding the Foundation's distinguished record \n        of performance, organizations that seek competitive grants \n        typically perform in a more transparent and effective manner; \n        and\n            (3) to the maximum extent possible, the Foundation should \n        seek competitive grants to supplement appropriations from the \n        United States Government, and at least 20 percent of the \n        funding received in each fiscal year by the Foundation should \n        be from non-United States Government sources to ensure \n        continued strong performance of the Foundation.\n\nSEC. 4.
