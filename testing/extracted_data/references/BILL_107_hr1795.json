FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 1993, the Palestine Liberation Organization \n        (hereinafter in this title referred to as the ``PLO'') made the \n        following commitments in an exchange of letters with the Prime \n        Minister of Israel:\n                    (A) Recognition of the right of the State of Israel \n                to exist in peace and security.\n                    (B) Acceptance of United Nations Security Council \n                Resolutions 242 and 338.\n                    (C) Resolution of all outstanding issues in the \n                conflict between the two sides through negotiations and \n                exclusively peaceful means.\n                    (D) Renunciation of the use of terrorism and all \n                other acts of violence and responsibility over all PLO \n                elements and personnel in order to assure their \n                compliance, prevent violations, and discipline \n                violators.\n            (2) The Palestinian Authority, the governing body of \n        autonomous Palestinian territories, was created as a result of \n        agreements between the PLO and the State of Israel that are a \n        direct outgrowth of the commitments made in 1993.\n            (3) The PLO made the following commitments in the \n        Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government \n        Arrangements of 1993, the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement \n        on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 1995, and the Wye River \n        Memorandum of 1998:\n                    (A) To resolve disputes arising out of any \n                agreements pertaining to the interim period by \n                negotiations, arbitration, or other mutually agreed \n                upon mechanisms of conciliation.\n                    (B) To take all measures necessary in order to \n                prevent acts of terrorism, crime and hostilities \n                directed against the State of Israel.\n                    (C) To abstain from incitement, including hostile \n                propaganda, against the State of Israel, and to take \n                legal measures to prevent such incitement by \n                organizations, groups, or individuals under their \n                control.\n                    (D) To arrest and prosecute individuals suspected \n                of perpetrating acts of violence and terror and to \n                punish all persons involved in acts of violence and \n                terror.\n                    (E) To provide for the protection of Jewish holy \n                sites in areas under the administration of the \n                Palestinian Authority, as well as persons visiting \n                them, and to ensure the peaceful use of such sites, to \n                prevent any instances of disorder and to respond to any \n                incident.\n                    (F) To prevent the establishment or operation in \n                the West Bank or Gaza Strip of any armed force other \n                than the Palestinian Police and Israeli military \n                forces.\n                    (G) To establish, and vigorously and continually \n                implement, a systematic program for the collection and \n                appropriate handling of all illegal firearms, \n                ammunition or weapons.\n                    (H) To maintain continuous intensive and \n                comprehensive bilateral security cooperation with \n                Israel.\n            (4) The President of the United States witnessed and signed \n        the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government \n        Arrangements of 1993, the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement \n        on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 1995, and the Wye River \n        Memorandum of 1998, placing at issue the credibility and \n        reputation of the United States with regard to the \n        implementation of the agreements.\n            (5) The United States has a longstanding, and enduring, \n        vital national security interest in the peaceful resolution of \n        the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and to that end has provided \n        the parties with its good offices and considerable financial \n        assistance.\n            (6) The State of Israel has made incontrovertible and \n        extensive efforts to resolve its conflict with the PLO by \n        negotiating in good faith and offering concessions of a \n        magnitude to demonstrate conclusively its clear commitment to \n        reaching a just and enduring settlement of the Israeli-\n        Palestinian conflict.\n            (7) The PLO's commitment to its freely accepted \n        obligations, specified in paragraphs (1) and (3), has come into \n        question as a result of the violence and mayhem occurring since \n        September 28, 2000, creating significant doubt as to the PLO's \n        commitment to the fundamental principle of resolving its \n        conflict with the State of Israel exclusively through direct \n        bilateral negotiations.\n\nSEC. 3.
