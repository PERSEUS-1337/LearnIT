FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the National Telecommunications and Information \n        Administration of the Department of Commerce recently submitted \n        to the Congress a report entitled ``U.S. National Spectrum \n        Requirements'' as required by section 113 of the National \n        Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization \n        Act (47 U.S.C. 923);\n            (2) based on the best available information the report \n        concludes that an additional 179 megahertz of spectrum will be \n        needed within the next ten years to meet the expected demand \n        for land mobile and mobile satellite radio services such as \n        cellular telephone service, paging services, personal \n        communication services, and low earth orbiting satellite \n        communications systems;\n            (3) a further 85 megahertz of additional spectrum, for a \n        total of 264 megahertz, is needed if the United States is to \n        fully implement the Intelligent Transportation System currently \n        under development by the Department of Transportation;\n            (4) as required by Part B of the National \n        Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization \n        Act (47 U.S.C. 921 et seq.) the Federal Government will \n        transfer 235 megahertz of spectrum from exclusive government \n        use to non-governmental or mixed governmental and non-\n        governmental use between 1994 and 2004;\n            (5) the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report submitted to \n        Congress by the National Telecommunications and Information \n        Administration states that, of the 235 megahertz of spectrum \n        identified for reallocation from governmental to non-\n        governmental or mixed use--\n                    (A) 50 megahertz has already been reallocated for \n                exclusive non-governmental use,\n                    (B) 45 megahertz will be reallocated in 1995 for \n                both exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental \n                and non-governmental use,\n                    (C) 25 megahertz will be reallocated in 1997 for \n                exclusive non-governmental use,\n                    (D) 70 megahertz will be reallocated in 1999 for \n                both exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental \n                and non-governmental use, and\n                    (E) the final 45 megahertz will be reallocated for \n                mixed governmental and non-governmental use by 2004;\n            (6) the 165 megahertz of spectrum that are not yet \n        reallocated, combined with 80 megahertz that the Federal \n        Communications Commission is currently holding in reserve for \n        emerging technologies, are less than the best estimates of \n        projected spectrum needs in the United States;\n            (7) the authority of the Federal Communications Commission \n        to assign radio spectrum frequencies using an auction process \n        expires on September 30, 1998;\n            (8) a significant portion of the reallocated spectrum will \n        not yet be assigned to non-governmental users before that \n        authority expires;\n            (9) the transfer of Federal governmental users from certain \n        valuable radio frequencies to other reserved frequencies could \n        be expedited if Federal governmental users are permitted to \n        accept reimbursement for relocation costs from non-governmental \n        users; and\n            (10) extension of the authority to use auctions and non-\n        governmental reimbursement of Federal governmental users \n        relocation costs would allow the market to determine the most \n        efficient use of the available spectrum.\n\nSEC. 3. EXTENSION AND EXPANSION OF AUCTION AUTHORITY.\n\n    Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)) \nis amended--\n            (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting in lieu thereof \n        the following:\n            ``(1) General authority.--If mutually exclusive \n        applications or requests are accepted for any initial license \n        or construction permit which will involve a use of the \n        electromagnetic spectrum, then the Commission shall grant such \n        license or permit to a qualified applicant through a system of \n        competitive bidding that meets the requirements of this \n        subsection. The competitive bidding authority granted by this \n        subsection shall not apply to licenses or construction permits \n        issued by the Commission for public safety radio services or \n        for licenses or construction permits for new terrestrial \n        digital television services assigned by the Commission to \n        existing terrestrial broadcast licensees to replace their \n        current television licenses.'';\n            (2) by striking paragraph (2) and renumbering paragraphs \n        (3) through (13) as (2) through (12), respectively; and\n            (3) by striking ``1998'' in paragraph (10), as renumbered, \n        and inserting in lieu thereof ``2002''.\nSEC. 4. REIMBURSEMENT OF FEDERAL RELOCATION COSTS.\n\n    Section 113 of the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration Act (47 U.S.C. 923) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new subsections:\n    ``(f) Relocation of Federal Government Stations.--\n            ``(1) In general.--In order to expedite the efficient use \n        of the electromagnetic spectrum and notwithstanding section \n        3302(b) of title 31, United States Code, any Federal entity \n        which operates a Federal Government station may accept \n        reimbursement from any person for the costs incurred by such \n        Federal entity for any modification, replacement, or reissuance \n        of equipment, facilities, operating manuals, regulations, or \n        other expenses incurred by that entity in relocating the \n        operations of its Federal Government station or stations from \n        one or more radio spectrum frequencies to any other frequency \n        or frequencies. Any such reimbursement shall be deposited in \n        the account of such Federal entity in the Treasury of the \n        United States. Funds deposited according to this section shall \n        be available, without appropriation or fiscal year limitation, \n        only for the operations of the Federal entity for which such \n        funds were deposited under this section.\n            ``(2) Process for relocation.--Any person seeking to \n        relocate a Federal Government station that has been assigned a \n        frequency within a band allocated for mixed Federal and non-\n        Federal use may submit a petition for such relocation to NTIA. \n        The NTIA shall limit the Federal Government station's operating \n        license to secondary status when the following requirements are \n        met--\n                    ``(A) the person seeking relocation of the Federal \n                Government station has guaranteed reimbursement through \n                money or in-kind payment of all relocation costs \n                incurred by the Federal entity, including all \n                engineering, equipment, site acquisition and \n                construction, and regulatory fee costs;\n                    ``(B) the person seeking relocation completes all \n                activities necessary for implementing the relocation, \n                including construction of replacement facilities (if \n                necessary and appropriate) and identifying and \n                obtaining on the Federal entity's behalf new \n                frequencies for use by the relocated Federal Government \n                station (where such station is not relocating to \n                spectrum reserved exclusively for Federal use); and\n                    ``(C) any necessary replacement facilities, \n                equipment modifications, or other changes have been \n                implemented and tested to ensure that the Federal \n                Government station is able to successfully accomplish \n                its purposes.\n            ``(3) Right to reclaim.--If within one year after the \n        relocation the Federal Government station demonstrates to the \n        Commission that the new facilities or spectrum are not \n        comparable to the facilities or spectrum from which the Federal \n        Government station was relocated, the person seeking such \n        relocation must take reasonable steps to remedy any defects or \n        reimburse the Federal entity for the costs of returning the \n        Federal Government station to the spectrum from which such \n        station was relocated.\n    ``(g) Federal Action To Expedite Spectrum Transfer.--Any Federal \nGovernment station which operates on electromagnetic spectrum that has \nbeen identified for reallocation for mixed Federal and non-Federal use \nin the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report shall, to the maximum extent \npracticable through the use of the authority granted under subsection \n(f) and any other applicable provision of law, take action to relocate \nits spectrum use to other frequencies that are reserved for Federal use \nor to consolidate its spectrum use with other Federal Government \nstations in a manner that maximizes the spectrum available for non-\nFederal use. Notwithstanding the timetable contained in the Spectrum \nReallocation Final Report, the President shall seek to implement the \nreallocation of the 1710 to 1755 megahertz frequency band by January 1, \n2000. Subsection (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to the extent \nthat a non-Federal user seeks to relocate or relocates a Federal power \nagency under subsection (f).\n    ``(h) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n            ``(1) Federal entity.--The term `Federal entity' means any \n        Department, agency, or other element of the Federal Government \n        that utilizes radio frequency spectrum in the conduct of its \n        authorized activities, including a Federal power agency.\n            ``(2) Spectrum reallocation final report.--The term \n        `Spectrum Reallocation Final Report' means the report submitted \n        by the Secretary to the President and Congress in compliance \n        with the requirements of subsection (a).''.\n\nSEC. 5. REALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM.\n\n    The Secretary of Commerce shall, within 9 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, prepare and submit to the President and the \nCongress a report and timetable recommending the reallocation of the \nthree frequency bands (225-400 megahertz, 3625-3650 megahertz, and \n5850-5925 megahertz) that were discussed but not recommended for \nreallocation in the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report. The Secretary \nshall consult with the Federal Communications Commission and other \nFederal agencies in the preparation of the report, and shall provide \nnotice and an opportunity for public comment before submitting the \nreport and timetable required by this section."
