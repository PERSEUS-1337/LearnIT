    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Poverty Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than one billion people worldwide live on less \n        than $1 per day, and another 1.6 billion people struggle to \n        survive on less than $2 per day, according to the World Bank.\n            (2) At the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, the \n        United States joined more than 180 other countries in \n        committing to work toward the United Nations Millennium \n        Development Goals to improve life for the world's poorest \n        people by 2015.\n            (3) The United Nations Millennium Development Goals include \n        the goal of reducing by one-half the proportion of people \n        worldwide, between 1990 and 2015, that live on less than $1 per \n        day, cutting in half the proportion of people suffering from \n        hunger and unable to access safe drinking water and sanitation, \n        reducing child mortality by two-thirds, ensuring basic \n        education for all children, and reversing the spread of HIV/\n        AIDS and malaria, while sustaining the environment upon which \n        human life depends.\n            (4) On March 22, 2002, President George W. Bush stated: \n        ``We fight against poverty because hope is an answer to terror. \n        We fight against poverty because opportunity is a fundamental \n        right to human dignity. We fight against poverty because faith \n        requires it and conscience demands it. We fight against poverty \n        with a growing conviction that major progress is within our \n        reach.''.\n            (5) The 2002 National Security Strategy of the United \n        States notes: ``[A] world where some live in comfort and \n        plenty, while half of the human race lives on less than $2 per \n        day, is neither just nor stable. Including all of the world's \n        poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity is a \n        moral imperative and one of the top priorities of United States \n        international policy.''.\n            (6) The 2006 National Security Strategy of the United \n        States notes: ``America's national interests and moral values \n        drive us in the same direction: to assist the world's poor \n        citizens and least developed nations and help integrate them \n        into the global economy.''.\n            (7) The bipartisan Final Report of the National Commission \n        on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States recommends: ``A \n        comprehensive United States strategy to counter terrorism \n        should include economic policies that encourage development, \n        more open societies, and opportunities for people to improve \n        the lives of their families and enhance prospects for their \n        children.''.\n            (8) At the summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) nations in \n        July 2005, leaders from all eight countries committed to \n        increase aid to Africa from the current $25 billion annually to \n        $50 billion by 2010, and to cancel 100 percent of the debt \n        obligations owed to the World Bank, African Development Bank, \n        and International Monetary Fund by 18 of the world's poorest \n        nations.\n            (9) At the United Nations World Summit in September 2005, \n        the United States joined more than 180 other governments in \n        reiterating their commitment to achieve the United Nations \n        Millennium Development Goals by 2015.\n            (10) The United States has recognized the need for \n        increased financial and technical assistance to countries \n        burdened by extreme poverty, as well as the need for \n        strengthened economic and trade opportunities for those \n        countries, through significant initiatives in recent years, \n        including the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n        Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, the Millennium Challenge \n        Act of 2003, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, \n        and trade preference programs for developing countries, such as \n        the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n            (11) In January 2006, United States Secretary of State \n        Condoleezza Rice initiated a restructuring of the United States \n        foreign assistance program, including the creation of a \n        Director of Foreign Assistance, who maintains authority over \n        Department of State and United States Agency for International \n        Development (USAID) foreign assistance funding and programs.\n            (12) In January 2007, the Department of State's Office of \n        the Director of Foreign Assistance added poverty reduction as \n        an explicit, central component of the overall goal of United \n        States foreign assistance. The official goal of United States \n        foreign assistance is: ``To help build and sustain democratic, \n        well-governed states that respond to the needs of their people, \n        reduce widespread poverty and conduct themselves responsibly in \n        the international system.''.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to promote the reduction of \nglobal poverty, the elimination of extreme global poverty, and the \nachievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of \nreducing by one-half the proportion of people worldwide, between 1990 \nand 2015, who live on less than $1 per day.\n\nSEC. 4.
