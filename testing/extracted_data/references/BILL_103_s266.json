FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in order to prepare our Nation's children for the \n        challenges of the future, as well as keeping our Nation \n        competitive in a global economy, every elementary and secondary \n        school in the United States should be equipped with the best \n        and most up-to-date library resources, certified library media \n        specialists, access to advanced technology, and instruction on \n        the use of library and information resources;\n            (2) our Nation's elementary and secondary school libraries \n        are primarily dependent on a core of deteriorating and out-of-\n        date library materials purchased with original funding from the \n        Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n            (3) school library media center expenditures, when adjusted \n        for inflation, have declined 16 percent in public schools since \n        1979; and\n            (4) small and rural school libraries are further \n        disadvantaged because of small budgets based on low student \n        enrollments, and limited access to resources, services, and \n        personnel.\n    (b) Statement of Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) establish within the Department of Education Office of \n        Educational Research and Improvement a Division of Elementary \n        and Secondary School Library Media Services to provide \n        information and leadership to school library media programs and \n        personnel nationwide;\n            (2) provide continued funding for elementary and secondary \n        school library media program improvement, equity, innovation, \n        and technological advancement;\n            (3) establish a partnership program for elementary and \n        secondary school teachers and school library media specialists \n        to jointly design resource and curriculum-based instructional \n        activities that provide opportunities for students to access a \n        broad diversity of resources and information, and other \n        languages and cultures, including materials that will encourage \n        understanding; and\n            (4) establish a partnership program for encouraging uses of \n        technology and the sharing of information and access to \n        resources by elementary and secondary school students, school \n        library media specialists, and teachers.\n\nSEC. 3.
