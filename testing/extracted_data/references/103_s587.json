FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) because Senator Mike Mansfield served his country with \n        distinction and has had a lasting impact on America's \n        relationship with Japan during his tenure in the Senate and \n        later as the United States Ambassador to Japan, it is a fitting \n        tribute to establish in his name the following Fellowship for \n        promising officials of the Federal Government;\n            (2) Japan is America's second largest trading partner, the \n        second biggest investor in the United States, and America's \n        most serious economic competitor;\n            (3) despite the challenge and importance of Japan to the \n        United States, few Americans speak Japanese or understand how \n        the country and its government work; and\n            (4) key agencies of the United States Government involved \n        in United States-Japan relations often lack sufficient \n        personnel versed in the functioning of the Japanese \n        policymaking apparatus.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to enable the United States Government to respond more \n        effectively to the Japanese challenge; and\n            (2) to provide officials from any branch of the United \n        States Government with intensive Japanese language training and \n        placement as a Fellow in the Government of Japan.\n\nSEC. 4.
