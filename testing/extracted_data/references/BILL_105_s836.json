FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States civil justice system is inefficient, \n        unpredictable, unfair, costly, and impedes competitiveness in \n        the marketplace for goods, services, business, and employees;\n            (2) the defects in the civil justice system have a direct \n        and undesirable effect on interstate commerce by decreasing the \n        availability of goods and services in commerce;\n            (3) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and \n        fairness to the legal system;\n            (4) the spiralling costs of litigation and the magnitude \n        and unpredictability of punitive damage awards and noneconomic \n        damage awards have continued unabated for at least the past 30 \n        years;\n            (5) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized \n        that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the \n        award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate \n        interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence of \n        unlawful conduct;\n            (6) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly \n        excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some circumstances \n        for a party to be held responsible under the doctrine of joint \n        and several liability for damages that party did not cause;\n            (7) as a result of joint and several liability, entities \n        including small businesses are often brought into litigation \n        despite the fact that their conduct may have little or nothing \n        to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to the \n        lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust costs due \n        to the possibility or result of unfair and disproportionate \n        damage awards;\n            (8) the costs imposed by the civil justice system on small \n        businesses are particularly acute, since small businesses often \n        lack the resources to bear those costs and to challenge \n        unwarranted lawsuits;\n            (9) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n        costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing \n        insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their \n        activities;\n            (10) liability reform for small businesses will promote the \n        free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate \n        commerce, and decrease litigiousness; and\n            (11) legislation to address these concerns is an \n        appropriate exercise of Congress' powers under Article I, \n        section 8, clauses 3, 9, and 18 of the Constitution, and the \n        fourteenth amendment to the Constitution.\n\nSEC. 3.
