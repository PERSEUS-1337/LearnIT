    "content": "SECTION 1. NATIONAL ELECTRIC SYSTEM PUBLIC BENEFITS.\n\n    Title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is \namended by adding after section 604 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 605. NATIONAL ELECTRIC SYSTEM PUBLIC BENEFITS FUND.\n\n    ``(a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide for a \nNational Electric System Public Benefits Fund, administered by the \nNational Electric System Public Benefits Board, to provide matching \nfunds to States for the support of eligible public purpose programs.\n    ``(b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n            ``(1) The term `Board' means the National Electric System \n        Public Benefits Board established under this section.\n            ``(2) The term `eligible public purpose program' means a \n        program that supports--\n                    ``(A) conservation and energy efficiency and \n                renewable energy,\n                    ``(B) universal and affordable service, or\n                    ``(C) research and development that supports such \n                purposes,\n         and that is designated by the Board as eligible to receive \n        funding under this section.\n            ``(3) The term `matching funds' means an equal distribution \n        of State funds and funds made available as provided in this \n        section.\n            ``(4) The `Secretary' means the Secretary of Energy.\n            ``(5) The terms `State commission' and `transmitting \n        utility' have the meanings provided for such terms by the \n        Federal Power Act.\n            ``(6) The term `renewable energy' means electricity \n        generated from nontoxic organic waste, biomass, dedicated \n        energy crops, landfill gas, geothermal, solar, tidal or wind \n        resources, except that such term does not include electricity \n        generated from the incineration of municipal solid waste.\n            ``(7) The term `energy efficiency' means programs and \n        measures designed to cost-effectively improve the efficiency of \n        end-use electricity consumption, considering all costs of \n        electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and \n        consumption on a life-cycle basis. For purposes of this \n        section, eligible energy efficiency programs and measures shall \n        include efforts to transform markets in end-use equipment, to \n        develop and implement codes and standards, to provide technical \n        support and information to consumers, and to provide financing \n        and financial support for the acquisition of efficient end use \n        equipment.\n            ``(9) A program that supports `universal and affordable \n        service' is any program that promotes high quality and reliable \n        electric service at just, reasonable, and affordable rates for \n        low income consumers and those in rural, insular, or high cost \n        areas.\n    ``(c) National Electric System Public Benefits Board.--(1) A \nNational Electric System Public Benefits Board shall be established to \ncarry out the functions and responsibilities specified in this section.\n    ``(2) The Board shall be composed of 3 persons who are officers or \nemployees of the United States, and 4 State commissioners nominated by \nthe national organization of the State commissions and appointed by the \nSecretary. The Secretary shall appoint one member of the Board to serve \nas Chairman.\n    ``(3) Within 180 days after the enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary shall promulgate a final rule containing the rules and \nprocedures of the Board, including the rules and procedures for \nselecting a non-Federal fiscal agent under subsection (e). The \nSecretary shall have oversight responsibilities over the Board.\n    ``(d) Contributions.--Each owner or operator of an electric power \ngeneration facility shall, as a condition of transmitting power to any \ntransmitting utility, contribute funds (based on the kilowatt hours \ntransmitted) in such amounts as shall be determined by the Board to be \nnecessary to generate revenues in each calendar year equal to \\1/2\\ of \nthe aggregate cost of carrying out the eligible public purpose programs \nthat meet the criteria established by the Board under subsection (e) \nfor receipt of funding for that calendar year. Such contributions shall \nnot exceed 2 mills per kilowatt hour. Each transmitting utility \nreceiving electricity from a generator shall collect such contributions \nand transfer the contributions to the fiscal agent designated under \nsubsection (e) at the end of each month in which contributions are \nmade.\n    ``(e) Public Benefits Program.--(1) Within 90 days after the \npromulgation of the Secretary's rules under subsection (c)(3), the \nBoard shall institute a proceeding to establish regulations governing \ncreation and administration of a Public Benefits Program. Such \nregulations shall include criteria for the eligibility of the State \npublic service programs for support under the Program. The Board shall \nenter into arrangements with a non-Federal fiscal agent who shall be \nauthorized to receive the contributions made under subsection (d) and \nto disburse such contributions as provided in subsection (f). The Board \nshall prepare a recommended decision for prompt review and approval by \nthe Secretary.\n    ``(2) Any State may establish one or more public purpose programs \nand apply for matching funding for such program or programs under the \nPublic Benefits Program. A participating State may use matching funds \nreceived under this section only to support one or more eligible public \npurpose programs. The Board shall regularly audit the expenditures of \nmatching funds received by a participating State under this section.\n    ``(3) At no time is a State required, pursuant to this section, to \nparticipate in the Public Benefits program, nor may a State be required \nby the Board to fund a particular eligible public purpose program.\n    ``(f) National Electric System Public Benefits.--(1) The fiscal \nagent shall distribute contributions received by the fiscal agent under \nsubsection (d) to States (or entities designated by the States) under \nthis subsection in accordance with the criteria established by the \nBoard under subsection (e) to carry out eligible public purpose \nprograms established by the States. A State seeking matching funds to \ncarry out eligible public purpose programs shall apply for such funds \nno later than 3 months prior to the start of the calendar year. In its \napplication, the State must certify that the moneys will be used for \none or more eligible public purpose programs and must specify the \namount of State support which is projected for the coming calendar year \nfor the programs concerned.\n    ``(2) Upon receipt of all State requests for matching funds \nsubmitted pursuant to paragraph (1) within the 3-month time period \nspecified in paragraph (1), the Board shall calculate the funds \nnecessary to match the level of projected States funds for eligible \npublic purpose programs for the coming calendar year.\n    ``(3) Following the calculation of the amount of matching funds \nrequired under paragraph (2) for all States for any calendar year, the \nBoard shall communicate that amount to the fiscal agent. To the extent \nthe matching funds requested by all States for a calendar year exceed \nthe maximum projected revenues from the contributions under this \nsection, the matching funds distributed to each State shall be reduced \npro rata so that the percentage of State funds matched by funds \nprovided under this section is the same for all States.\n    ``(4) The fiscal agent shall distribute matching funds to the \nStates (or to an entity or entities designated by the State to receive \npayments) in monthly payments to be used for eligible public purpose \nprograms designated under subsection (f). All funds received shall be \nused only for the eligible public purpose programs designated by the \nState.\n    ``(g) Existing Programs.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nprogram established under this section shall not replace or supersede \nany other existing programs that support or encourage conservation and \nenergy efficiency, renewable energy, universal and affordable service, \nor research and development.''."
