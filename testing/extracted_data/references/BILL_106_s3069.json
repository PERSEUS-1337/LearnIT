FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Television is seen and heard in nearly every United \n        States home and is a uniquely pervasive presence in the daily \n        lives of Americans. The average American home has 2.5 \n        televisions, and a television is turned on in the average \n        American home 7 hours every day.\n            (2) Television plays a particularly significant role in the \n        lives of children. Figures provided by Nielsen Research show \n        that children between the ages of 2 years and 11 years spend an \n        average of 21 hours in front of a television each week.\n            (3) Television has an enormous capability to influence \n        perceptions, especially those of children, of the values and \n        behaviors that are common and acceptable in society.\n            (4) The influence of television is so great that its images \n        and messages often can be harmful to the development of \n        children. Social science research amply documents a strong \n        correlation between the exposure of children to televised \n        violence and a number of behavioral and psychological problems.\n            (5) Hundreds of studies have proven conclusively that \n        children who are consistently exposed to violence on television \n        have a higher tendency to exhibit violent and aggressive \n        behavior, both as children and later in life.\n            (6) Such studies also show that repeated exposure to \n        violent programming causes children to become desensitized to \n        and more accepting of real-life violence and to grow more \n        fearful and less trusting of their surroundings.\n            (7) A growing body of social science research indicates \n        that sexual content on television can also have a significant \n        influence on the attitudes and behaviors of young viewers. This \n        research suggests that heavy exposure to programming with \n        strong sexual content contributes to the early commencement of \n        sexual activity among teenagers.\n            (8) Members of the National Association of Broadcasters \n        (NAB) adhered for many years to a comprehensive code of conduct \n        that was based on an understanding of the influence exerted by \n        television and on a widely held sense of responsibility for \n        using that influence carefully.\n            (9) This code of conduct, the Television Code of the \n        National Association of Broadcasters, articulated this sense of \n        responsibility as follows:\n                    (A) ``In selecting program subjects and themes, \n                great care must be exercised to be sure that the \n                treatment and presentation are made in good faith and \n                not for the purpose of sensationalism or to shock or \n                exploit the audience or appeal to prurient interests or \n                morbid curiosity.''.\n                    (B) ``Broadcasters have a special responsibility \n                toward children. Programs designed primarily for \n                children should take into account the range of \n                interests and needs of children, from instructional and \n                cultural material to a wide variety of entertainment \n                material. In their totality, programs should contribute \n                to the sound, balanced development of children to help \n                them achieve a sense of the world at large and informed \n                adjustments to their society.''.\n                    (C) ``Violence, physical, or psychological, may \n                only be projected in responsibly handled contexts, not \n                used exploitatively. Programs involving violence \n                present the consequences of it to its victims and \n                perpetrators. Presentation of the details of violence \n                should avoid the excessive, the gratuitous and the \n                instructional.''.\n                    (D) ``The presentation of marriage, family, and \n                similarly important human relationships, and material \n                with sexual connotations, shall not be treated \nexploitatively or irresponsibly, but with sensitivity.''.\n                    (E) ``Above and beyond the requirements of the law, \n                broadcasters must consider the family atmosphere in \n                which many of their programs are viewed. There shall be \n                no graphic portrayal of sexual acts by sight or sound. \n                The portrayal of implied sexual acts must be essential \n                to the plot and presented in a responsible and tasteful \n                manner.''.\n            (10) The National Association of Broadcasters abandoned the \n        code of conduct in 1983 after three provisions of the code \n        restricting the sale of advertising were challenged by the \n        Department of Justice on antitrust grounds and a Federal \n        district court issued a summary judgment against the National \n        Association of Broadcasters regarding one of the provisions on \n        those grounds. However, none of the programming standards of \n        the code were challenged.\n            (11) While the code of conduct was in effect, its \n        programming standards were never found to have violated any \n        antitrust law.\n            (12) Since the National Association of Broadcasters \n        abandoned the code of conduct, programming standards on \n        broadcast and cable television have deteriorated dramatically.\n            (13) In the absence of effective programming standards, \n        public concern about the impact of television on children, and \n        on society as a whole, has risen substantially. Polls routinely \n        show that more than 80 percent of Americans are worried by the \n        increasingly graphic nature of sex, violence, and vulgarity on \n        television and by the amount of programming that openly \n        sanctions or glorifies criminal, antisocial, and degrading \n        behavior.\n            (14) At the urging of Congress, the television industry has \n        taken some steps to respond to public concerns about \n        programming standards and content. The broadcast television \n        industry agreed in 1992 to adopt a set of voluntary guidelines \n        designed to ``proscribe gratuitous or excessive portrayals of \n        violence''. Shortly thereafter, both the broadcast and cable \n        television industries agreed to conduct independent studies of \n        the violent content in their programming and make those reports \n        public.\n            (15) In 1996, the television industry as a whole made a \n        commitment to develop a comprehensive rating system to label \n        programming that may be harmful or inappropriate for children. \n        That system was implemented at the beginning of 1999.\n            (16) Despite these efforts to respond to public concern \n        about the impact of television on children, millions of \n        Americans, especially parents with young children, remain angry \n        and frustrated at the sinking standards of television \n        programming, the reluctance of the industry to police itself, \n        and the harmful influence of television on the well-being of \n        the children and the values of the United States.\n            (17) The Department of Justice issued a ruling in 1993 \n        indicating that additional efforts by the television industry \n        to develop and implement voluntary programming guidelines would \n        not violate the antitrust laws. The ruling states that ``such \n        activities may be likened to traditional standard setting \n        efforts that do not necessarily restrain competition and may \n        have significant procompetitive benefits...Such guidelines \n        could serve to disseminate valuable information on program \n        content to both advertisers and television viewers. Accurate \n        information can enhance the demand for, and increase the output \n        of, an industry's products or services.''.\n            (18) The Children's Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-\n        437) states that television broadcasters in the United States \n        have a clear obligation to meet the educational and \n        informational needs of children.\n            (19) Several independent analyses have demonstrated that \n        the television broadcasters in the United States have not \n        fulfilled their obligations under the Children's Television Act \n        of 1990 and have not noticeably expanded the amount of \n        educational and informational programming directed at young \n        viewers since the enactment of that Act.\n            (20) The popularity of video and personal computer (PC) \n        games is growing steadily among children. Although most popular \n        video and personal computer games are educational or harmless \n        in nature, many of the most popular are extremely violent. One \n        recent study by Strategic Record Research found that 64 percent \n        of teenagers played video or personal computer games on a \n        regular basis. Other surveys of children as young as elementary \n        school age found that almost half of them list violent computer \n        games among their favorites.\n            (21) Violent video games often present violence in a \n        glamorized light. Game players are often cast in the role of \n        shooter, with points scored for each ``kill''. Similarly, \n        advertising for such games often touts violent content as a \n        selling point--the more graphic and extreme, the better.\n            (22) As the popularity and graphic nature of such video \n        games grows, so do their potential to negatively influence \n        impressionable children.\n            (23) Music is another extremely pervasive and popular form \n        of entertainment. American children and teenagers listen to \n        music more than any other demographic group. The Journal of \n        American Medicine reported that between the 7th and 12th grades \n        the average teenager listens to 10,500 hours of rock or rap \n        music, just slightly less than the entire number of hours spent \n        in the classroom from kindergarten through high school.\n            (24) Teens are among the heaviest purchasers of music, and \n        are most likely to favor music genres that depict, and often \n        appear to glamorize violence.\n            (25) Music has a powerful ability to influence perceptions, \n        attitudes, and emotional state. The use of music as therapy \n        indicates its potential to increase emotional, psychological. \n        and physical health. That influence can be used for ill as \n        well.\n\n SEC. 3. PURPOSES; CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to permit the \nentertainment industry--\n            (1) to work collaboratively to respond to growing public \n        concern about television programming, movies, video games, \n        Internet content, and music lyrics, and the harmful influence \n        of such programming, movies, games, content, and lyrics on \n        children;\n            (2) to develop a set of voluntary programming guidelines \n        similar to those contained in the Television Code of the \n        National Association of Broadcasters; and\n            (3) to implement the guidelines in a manner that alleviates \n        the negative impact of television programming, movies, video \n        games, Internet content, and music lyrics on the development of \n        children in the United States and stimulates the development \n        and broadcast of educational and informational programming for \n        such children.\n    (b) Construction.--This Act may not be construed as--\n            (1) providing the Federal Government with any authority to \n        restrict television programming, movies, video games, Internet \n        content, or music lyrics that is in addition to the authority \n        to restrict such programming, movies, games, content, or lyrics \n        under law as of the date of the enactment of this Act; or\n            (2) approving any action of the Federal Government to \n        restrict such programming, movies, games, content, or lyrics \n        that is in addition to any actions undertaken for that purpose \n        by the Federal Government under law as of such date.\n\n SEC. 4.
