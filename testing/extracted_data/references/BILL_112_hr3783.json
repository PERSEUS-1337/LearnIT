FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The United States has vital political, economic, and \n    security interests in the Western Hemisphere.\n        (2) Iran is pursuing cooperation with Latin American countries \n    by signing economic and security agreements in order to create a \n    network of diplomatic and economic relationships to lessen the blow \n    of international sanctions and oppose Western attempts to constrict \n    its ambitions.\n        (3) According to the Department of State, Hezbollah, with Iran \n    as its state sponsor, is considered the ``most technically capable \n    terrorist group in the world'' with ``thousands of supporters, \n    several thousand members, and a few hundred terrorist operatives,'' \n    and officials from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \n    (IRGC) Qods Force have been working in concert with Hezbollah for \n    many years.\n        (4) The IRGC's Qods Force has a long history of supporting \n    Hezbollah's military, paramilitary, and terrorist activities, \n    providing it with guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence, and \n    logistical support, and in 2007, the Department of the Treasury \n    placed sanctions on the IRGC and its Qods Force for their support \n    of terrorism and proliferation activities.\n        (5) The IRGC's Qods Force stations operatives in foreign \n    embassies, charities, and religious and cultural institutions to \n    foster relationships, often building on existing socioeconomic ties \n    with the well established Shia Diaspora, and recent years have \n    witnessed an increased presence in Latin America.\n        (6) According to the Department of Defense, the IRGC and its \n    Qods Force played a significant role in some of the deadliest \n    terrorist attacks of the past two decades, including the 1994 \n    attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, by \n    generally directing or supporting the groups that actually executed \n    the attacks.\n        (7) Reports of Iranian intelligence agents being implicated in \n    Hezbollah-linked activities since the early 1990s suggest direct \n    Iranian government support of Hezbollah activities in the Tri-\n    Border Area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, and in the past \n    decade, Iran has dramatically increased its diplomatic missions to \n    Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil. Iran \n    has built 17 cultural centers in Latin America, and it currently \n    maintains 11 embassies, up from 6 in 2005.\n        (8) Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies with a presence in \n    Latin America have raised revenues through illicit activities, \n    including drug and arms trafficking, counterfeiting, money \n    laundering, forging travel documents, pirating software and music, \n    and providing haven and assistance to other terrorists transiting \n    the region.\n        (9) Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela expressed \n    their intention to assist Iran in evading sanctions by signing a \n    statement supporting Iran's nuclear activities and announcing at a \n    2010 joint press conference in Tehran their determination to \n    ``continue and expand their economic ties to Iran'' with confidence \n    that ``Iran can give a crushing response to the threats and \n    sanctions imposed by the West and imperialism''.\n        (10) The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration concluded in 2008 \n    that almost one-half of the foreign terrorist organizations in the \n    world are linked to narcotics trade and trafficking, including \n    Hezbollah and Hamas.\n        (11) In October 2011, the United States charged two men, \n    Manssor Arbabsiar, a United States citizen holding both Iranian and \n    United States passports, and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member \n    of Iran's IRGC Qods Force, with conspiracy to murder a foreign \n    official using explosives in an act of terrorism. Arbabsiar \n    traveled to Mexico with the express intent to hire ``someone in the \n    narcotics business'' to carry out the assassination of the Saudi \n    Arabian Ambassador in the United States. While in the end, he only \n    engaged a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency informant posing as an \n    associate of a drug trafficking cartel, Arbabsiar believed that he \n    was working with a member of a Mexican drug trafficking \n    organization and sought to send money to this individual in \n    installments and not in a single transfer.\n        (12) In February 2011, actions by the Department of the \n    Treasury effectively shut down the Lebanese Canadian Bank. \n    Subsequent actions by the United States Government in connection \n    with the investigation into Lebanese Canadian Bank resulted in the \n    indictment in December 2011 of Ayman Joumaa, an individual of \n    Lebanese nationality, with citizenship in Lebanon and Colombia, and \n    with ties to Hezbollah, for trafficking cocaine to the Los Zetas \n    drug trafficking organization in Mexico City for sale in the United \n    States and for laundering the proceeds.\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n     It shall be the policy of the United States to use a comprehensive \ngovernment-wide strategy to counter Iran's growing hostile presence and \nactivity in the Western Hemisphere by working together with United \nStates allies and partners in the region to mutually deter threats to \nUnited States interests by the Government of Iran, the Iranian Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the IRGC's Qods Force, and Hezbollah.\nSEC. 4.
