In order to provide opportunities for adults to live in their own homes, the following procedures shall be adopted:\n(a) The department and regional centers shall ensure that supported living arrangements adhere to the following principles:\n(1) Consumers shall be supported in living arrangements\nwhich\nthat\nare typical of those in which persons without disabilities reside.\n(2) The services or supports that a consumer receives shall change as his or her needs change without the consumer having to move elsewhere.\n(3) The consumer\u2019s preference shall guide decisions concerning where and with whom he or she lives.\n(4) Consumers shall have control over the environment within their own home.\n(5) The purpose of furnishing services and supports to a consumer shall be to assist that individual to exercise choice in his or her life while building critical and durable relationships with other individuals.\n(6) The services or supports shall be flexible and tailored to a consumer\u2019s needs and preferences.\n(7) Services and supports are most effective when furnished where a person lives and within the context of his or her day-to-day activities.\n(8) Consumers shall not be excluded from supported living arrangements based solely on the nature and severity of their disabilities.\n(b) Regional centers may contract with agencies or individuals to assist consumers in securing their own homes and to provide consumers with the supports needed to live in their own homes.\n(c) The range of supported living services and supports available include, but are not limited to, assessment of consumer needs; assistance in finding,\nmodifying\nmodifying,\nand maintaining a home; facilitating circles of support to encourage the development of unpaid and natural supports in the community; advocacy and self-advocacy facilitation; development of employment goals; social, behavioral, and daily living skills training and support; development and provision of 24-hour emergency response systems; securing and maintaining adaptive equipment and supplies; recruiting, training, and hiring individuals to provide personal care and other assistance, including in-home supportive services workers, paid neighbors, and paid roommates; providing respite and emergency relief for personal care attendants; and facilitating community participation.

These tasks shall only be shared to the extent they are permitted under the Labor Code and related regulations, including, but not limited to, Industrial Welfare Commission Minimum Wage Order No. 15. The planning team, as defined in subdivision (j) of Section 4512, at the time of development, review, or modification of a consumer\u2019s individual program plan (IPP), for housemates currently in a supported living arrangement or planning to move together into a supported living arrangement, or for consumers who live with a housemate not receiving supported living services who is responsible for the task, shall consider, with input from the service provider, whether any tasks, such as meal preparation and cleanup, menu planning, laundry, shopping, general household tasks, or errands can appropriately be shared.

The questionnaire shall be used during the individual program plan meetings, in addition to the provider\u2019s assessment, to assist in determining whether the services provided or recommended are necessary and sufficient and that the most cost-effective methods of supported living services are utilized. With input from stakeholders, including regional centers, the department shall develop and post the questionnaire on its Internet Web site, and, by June 30, 2012, shall provide it to the regional centers.\n(2) Supported living service providers shall conduct comprehensive assessments for the purpose of getting to know the consumer they will be supporting and developing a support plan congruent with the choices and needs of the individual and consistent with the principles of supported living set forth in this section and in Subchapter 19 (commencing with Section 58600) of Chapter 3 of Division 2 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. The independent assessment required by this paragraph is not intended to take the place of or repeat the service provider\u2019s comprehensive assessment.\n(3) Upon a determination of a reduction in services pursuant to this section, the regional center shall inform the consumer of the reason for the determination, and shall provide a written notice of fair hearing rights pursuant to Section 4701.\n(4) Nothing in this section precludes the completion of an independent assessment.\n(q) Direct care workers providing supported living services shall satisfactorily complete 15 hours of training in behavioral intervention within three months from the date the direct care worker was hired."
