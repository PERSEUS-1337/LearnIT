    "content": "This report provides an overview of the FY2019 budget request and appropriations for the International Trade Administration (ITA), the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). These three trade-related agencies are funded through the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations. This report also provides a review of these trade agencies' programs. When comparing the Administration's FY2019 request with FY2018 funding, one may want to consider that the Administration formulated its FY2019 budget request before full-year appropriations for FY2018 were enacted. In this report, FY2018 funding levels reflect the amounts appropriated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ), enacted on March 23, 2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, provided $482.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $93.7 million for USTIC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR for FY2018. The FY2018 appropriation for the three CJS trade-related agencies totaled $648.3 million.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, provided $484.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA, $95.0 million in funding for USITC, and a total of $68.0 million for USTR. The FY2019 appropriations for three CJS trade-related agencies totaled $647.0 million, a 0.2% decrease from FY2018 appropriations. See the Appendix for enacted budget authority for the trade-related agencies for FY2009-FY2019. The President submitted his FY2019 budget request to Congress on February 12, 2018. In it, the Administration requested a total of $590.8 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies (see Table 1 ). This request represented an 8.9% decrease in funding from the FY2018 appropriated amount. The request included reduced funding for all three trade agencies: $440.1 million in direct funding for ITA (an 8.7% decrease from the FY2018 appropriation), $87.6 million for USITC (a 6.5% decrease), and $63.0 million for USTR (a 13.2% decrease).  Despite the proposed overall decrease in funding for CJS trade-related agencies, the Administration proposed increasing some trade enforcement activities within ITA and USTR. For ITA, the Administration proposed increasing trade enforcement activities while reducing funding for certain export promotion activities. For USTR, the Administration requested funds to increase staffing; however, the request did not include a request for funding to be drawn from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. (For a description of the \" Trade Enforcement Trust Fund ,\" see section below.) The President's budget did not provide a rationale for requesting a decrease in funding for USITC. A more detailed overview of these agencies' FY2019 budget requests is provided below. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported their CJS appropriation bills in the spring of 2018. Both committees largely declined the budget cuts requested by the Administration for these three trade agencies. (See Table 1 .) The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5952 on May 17, 2018. The House committee bill included a total of $647.6 million for the three trade-related agencies, which was $56.8 million more (9.6%) than the Administration's request and $0.7 million less (-0.1%) than the FY2018-enacted amount. The House committee recommended $480.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $95.0 million for USTIC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR.  The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3072 on June 14, 2018. The Senate bill included a total of $655.6 million for the three agencies, which was $64.8 million (11.0%) more than the Administration's request and $7.3 million (1.1%) more than the FY2018-enacted appropriation. The Senate committee recommended $488.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $95.0 million for USITC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR.  Through February 15, 2019, the CJS trade-related agencies operated under continuing resolutions (CR)\u2014with the exception of a three-week lapse in funding when agencies halted most operations. Congress passed final FY2019 appropriations in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), which was signed into law on February 15, 2019. The act included a total of $647.0 million in funding for the three trade-related agencies\u2014a 0.2% decrease from FY2018 appropriations. For FY2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, included $484.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA (a 0.4% increase from the FY2018 appropriation), $95.0 million in funding for USITC (a 1.4% increase), and a total of $68.0 million for USTR (a 0.2% decrease). Within the Department of Commerce, ITA's mission is to improve U.S. prosperity by strengthening the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promoting trade and investment, and ensuring compliance with trade laws and agreements. ITA provides export promotion services; works to enforce and ensure compliance with trade laws and agreements; administers trade remedies such as antidumping and countervailing duties; and provides analytical support for ongoing trade negotiations.  ITA went through a major organizational change in October 2013 in which it consolidated four organizational units into three more functionally aligned units: (1) Global Markets; (2) Industry and Analysis; and (3) Enforcement and Compliance. ITA also has a fourth organizational unit, the Executive and Administrative Directorate, which is responsible for providing policy leadership, information technology support, and administration services for all of ITA. ( Table A-1 shows budget amounts for ITA by unit between FY2009 and FY2019.) For FY2019, the Administration requested $440.1 million for ITA in direct funding, with an additional $11.0 million to be collected in user fees, for a total of $451.1 million in authorized spending. The request for direct funding represents a $41.9 million decrease (-8.7%) from the FY2018-enacted amount ($482.0 million).  According to ITA's budget justification, the Administration proposed increasing ITA's enforcement and compliance efforts in FY2019, while deemphasizing other initiatives, such as export promotion. The Administration specifically proposed closing some domestic and international offices of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS). The House committee-reported H.R. 5952 proposed $480.0 million for ITA in direct funding, with an additional $11.0 million to be collected from user fees, for a total of $491.0 million in authorized spending. The amount in direct funding proposed by the House Committee on Appropriations was $39.9 million (9.1%) more than the Administration's request and $2.0 million less (-0.4%) than the FY2018-enacted amount. The Senate committee-reported S. 3072 included $488.0 million in direct funding for ITA, with an additional $11.0 million in user fees, for a total of $499.0 million in authorized spending. The amount in direct funding proposed by the Senate Committee on Appropriations was $47.9 million (10.9%) more than the Administration's request and $6.0 million (1.2%) more than the FY2018-enacted amount. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) provided $484.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA, with an additional $11.0 million to be collected in user fees, for a total of $495.0 in authorized spending. The act provided $2 million more (0.4%) in direct appropriations for ITA than the FY2018-enacted amount and $43.9 million more (10.0%) than the Administration's request.  ITA's Global Markets (GM) unit is a combination of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS) unit, a program that provides export promotion services to U.S. businesses, and SelectUSA, a program that works to attract foreign investment into the United States. Through US&FCS, GM promotes U.S. exports by helping U.S. exporters research foreign markets and identify opportunities abroad. GM's country and regional experts\u2015in domestic and overseas offices\u2014help to advise U.S. companies on market access, local standards, and regulations. The unit also helps to make connections through business-to-business trade shows, fairs, and missions. GM is designed to advance U.S. commercial interests by engaging with foreign governments and U.S. businesses, identifying and resolving market barriers, and leading efforts that advocate for U.S. firms with foreign governments. Through its SelectUSA program, the GM unit also promotes the United States as a destination for foreign investment. (For more on SelectUSA, see section below, \" SelectUSA Program .\") For FY2019, the Administration proposed reducing funding for the Global Markets unit. The Administration requested $276.5 million for Global Markets in direct funding, a 13.4% decrease from the FY2018-enacted appropriation. In its FY2019 budget submission, ITA proposed \"rescaling export promotion\" activities in the GM unit by reducing staff and its domestic and overseas offices, with a total reduction of 133 positions. The budget submission did not indicate how many or which domestic and overseas offices it was proposing to close.  The House and Senate Appropriation Committees did not adopt the proposed cuts. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $319.0 million for the Global Markets unit for FY2019. This was $42.5 million (15.4%) more than the Administration's request. According to the committee report, \"the recommendation does not adopt the proposal to reduce U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service staff or close overseas offices or U.S. Export Assistance Centers.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee report did not provide an exact funding amount, but recommended that ITA \"fund US&FCS, and its core mission of export promotion, at the highest possible level in fiscal year 2019, and at no less than the amount provided in fiscal year 2018.\" Like the House committee, the Senate committee did not adopt the Administration's proposal to close offices. The Senate committee report specifically noted, \"No offices shall be closed in fiscal year 2019 unless the Committee approves a reprogramming request to close such office or offices. Additionally, the Committee will not approve requests to close any domestic offices, called U.S. Export Assistance Centers, if such Center is the only one located in a given State.\" According to the conference report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), the final agreement for FY2019 appropriations included \"no less than $320 million\" in funding for Global Markets and required ITA to report quarterly to the Committees on staffing levels within the US&FCS. ITA's Industry and Analysis unit brings together ITA's industry, trade, and economic experts to advance the competitiveness of U.S. industries through the development and execution of international trade and investment policies, export promotion strategies, and investment promotion. It develops economic and international policy analysis to improve market access for U.S. businesses, and designs and implements trade and investment promotion programs. The unit serves as the primary liaison between U.S. industries and the federal government on trade and investment promotion. It administers programs that support small and medium-sized enterprises, such as the Market Development Cooperator Program. For FY2019, the Administration requested $52.3 million for Industry and Analysis. The request is $3.4 million less than the FY2018 funding level. The Administration proposed refocusing some of the unit's priorities away from export promotion and toward trade enforcement. Specifically, the Administration proposed reducing activities related to trade missions, the International Buyer Program, and certified trade fairs, and eliminating Market Development Cooperator Program grants. The House committee proposed $52.0 million for Industry and Analysis. This represented $0.3 million less (-0.5%) than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill did not include a specific recommendation for Industry and Analysis. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), did not provide an exact funding guidance for Industry and Analysis. The mission of ITA's Enforcement and Compliance unit is to enforce U.S. trade laws and ensure compliance with negotiated international trade agreements. It is responsible for enforcing U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws; overseeing a variety of programs and policies regarding the enforcement and administration of U.S. trade remedy laws; assisting U.S. industry and businesses with unfair trade matters; and administering the Foreign Trade Zone program and other U.S. import programs.  For FY2019, the Administration requested $90.6 million for the Enforcement and Compliance unit, an increase of $3.1 million (3.6%) from the FY2018-enacted amount. For the requested increase in funding, ITA cited the unit's increasing number of AD/CVD investigations, its new focus on self-initiating AD/CVD cases, and the increased workload due to the tariffs and investigations initiated through Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.  The House Appropriations Committee proposed $85.5 million for Enforcement and Compliance. The House committee proposal represented $2.1 million less (-2.3%) than the Administration's request, and $1.0 million (1.1%) more than the FY2018-enacted amount . The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $91.5 million for Enforcement and Compliance. The Senate recommendation represented $0.9 million more than the Administration's request and $4.0 million more than the 2018-enacted amount. The Senate committee report noted that the committee was supportive of the Administration's request to self-initiate AD/CVD cases. For FY2019 appropriations, the conference report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), included $88.5 million for Enforcement and Compliance. This amount was $1.0 million more (1.1%) than the FY2018 funding, and $2.1 million less (-2.1%) than the Administration's request.  USITC is an independent, quasi-judicial agency responsible for conducting trade-related investigations and providing independent technical advice related to U.S. international trade policy to Congress, the President, and the USTR. The commission (1) investigates and determines whether imports injure a domestic industry or violate U.S. intellectual property rights; (2) provides independent tariff, trade, and competitiveness-related analysis to the President and Congress; and (3) maintains the U.S. tariff schedule. USITC also serves as a federal resource for trade data and other trade policy information. It makes most of its information and analyses available to the public to promote understanding of competitiveness, international trade issues, and the role that international trade plays in the U.S. economy.  In addition to the President's budget request for the commission, USITC also has bypass authority to submit its budget directly to Congress without revision by the President, pursuant to Section 175 of the Trade Act of 1975.  For FY2019, the President requested $87.6 million for USITC, which represented a $6.1 million decrease (-6.5%) from the FY2018-enacted amount ($93.7 million). While the President requested a decrease in funding for USITC, the commission's independent budget submission\u2014sent directly to Congress without revision by the President\u2014requested $97.5 million for FY2019, an increase of $3.8 million (4.0%) from the FY2018-enacted amount. USITC cited the increasing number of import injury cases in the previous five years and projected that the caseload would increase further in FY2019. Both the House and Senate committee-reported bills recommended $95.0 million for USITC. This amount was $7.4 million (8.4%) more than the President's request and $1.3 million (1.4%) more than the FY2018-enacted amount. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), provided $95.0 million for USITC, which was $7.4 million (8.4%) more than the President's request and $1.3 million (1.4%) more than the FY2018-enacted amount. USTR, located in the Executive Office of the President, is responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade and direct investment policies. USTR is the President's chief negotiator for international trade agreements, including commodity and direct investment negotiations. It negotiates directly with foreign governments to create trade agreements, resolve disputes, and participate in global trade policy organizations such as the World Trade Organization. It also meets with business groups, policymakers, and public interest groups on trade policy issues. In 2018, USTR led the negotiations for the modernization of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the investigations into Chinese intellectual property practices. In addition to direct appropriations for USTR, supplementary funding for the agency is available through the congressionally established Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. For more detail on the trust fund, see section \" Trade Enforcement Trust Fund ,\" below. For FY2019, the Administration requested $63.0 million for USTR's salaries and expenses, and no additional funding from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. The request represents a $9.6 million decrease (-13.2%) from the FY2018-enacted amounts ($72.6 million). In the Administration's budget request, USTR outlined the Trump Administration's \"aggressive trade agenda,\" and its goals of \"(1) defending U.S. national sovereignty over trade policy; (2) strictly enforcing U.S. trade laws; (3) using all possible sources of leverage to encourage other countries to open their markets to U.S. exports of goods and services, and protecting U.S. intellectual property rights; and (4) negotiating better trade deals with countries in key markets around the world.\" Both the House and Senate committee-reported bills recommended a total of $72.6 million for USTR for FY2019. These proposals included $57.6 million for USTR's salaries and expenses and $15.0 million from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund for enforcement activities authorized in Section 611 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-125 ). The total proposals were $9.6 million (15.2%) more than the Administration's request, and were equal to the FY2018-enacted amount. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), provided a total of $63.0 million for USTR, which included $53.0 million in salaries and expenses for USTR and an additional $15.0 million to be derived from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. The total funding was $4.6 million less (-6.3%) than the FY2018 appropriated amount. Over the past decade, Congress has provided funding for specific trade-related programs, including (1) China trade enforcement and compliance activities; (2) trade promotion and attracting foreign direct investment to the United States through ITA's SelectUSA program; and (3) trade enforcement activities through the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund and the Interagency Center on Trade Implementation, Monitoring, and Enforcement (ICTIME, formerly the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC)). Since 2004, Congress has dedicated some of ITA's funding to AD/CVD enforcement and compliance activities with respect to China and other nonmarket economies. ITA's Office of China Compliance was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-199 ). Its primary role has been to enforce U.S. AD/CVD laws and to develop and implement other policies and programs aimed at countering unfair foreign trade practices in China. ITA's China Countervailing Duty Group was established in FY2009 to accommodate the workload that resulted from the application of countervailing duty law to imports from nonmarket economy countries. The Office of China Compliance is within the Enforcement and Compliance unit at ITA. ITA's FY2019 budget justification did not provide a breakdown of funding for its China AD/CVD activities. Both the House and Senate committee-reported bills included $16.4 million from ITA's funding for China AD/CVD enforcement and compliance activities for FY2019.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), provided $16.4 million from ITA's funding for China AD/CVD enforcement and compliance activities for FY2019. This amount was equal to the FY2018-enacted amount. SelectUSA was created in 2011 and is now part of ITA's Global Markets unit. It coordinates investment-related resources across more than 20 federal agencies to (1) promote the United States as an investment market and (2) address investor climate concerns that may impede investment in the United States. The program serves as an information resource for international investors and advocates for U.S. cities, states, and regions as investment destinations. ITA's budget justification did not provide a breakdown for requested funding for SelectUSA. The House committee-reported bill did not propose a specific funding amount for SelectUSA.  The Senate committee report recommended $10.0 million in funding for SelectUSA, an amount equal to the FY2018-enacted amount. The Senate Committee on Appropriation proposed making funding contingent on (1) SelectUSA updating its protocol to ensure that its programs did not encourage foreign investments by state-owned entities into the United States and (2) SelectUSA reporting its updated protocol to the committee within 30 days of enactment of the bill. According to the conference report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), the final agreement adopted the Senate committee report language regarding SelectUSA.  ITA's Survey of International Air Travelers (SIAT) gathers statistics about air passenger travelers in the United States. These statistics are used across federal agencies, for a variety of purposes, such as to estimate the contribution of international travel to the economy, develop public policy on the travel industry, and forecast staffing needs at consulates and ports of entry.  The Administration requested $5.0 million for FY2019 for SIAT to expand the survey and data collection. The Administration proposed that \"$5 million in fee revenues collected from the surcharge on international travelers utilizing the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) be redirected to fully fund the SIAT.\" The House committee-reported bill did not include a specific recommendation for SIAT. According to the Senate committee report, the Senate Committee on Appropriations did not adopt the Administration's proposal to seek alternative funding sources for SIAT and \"direct[ed] ITA to continue funding SIAT out of its base budget. Within funds provided, ITA [was] encouraged to increase the sample size for SIAT.\" The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), and the accompanying conference report did not provide specific language regarding SIAT. In order to provide additional funding for USTR's trade enforcement activities, Congress established the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund (TETF) in 2016. In Section 611 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-125 ), Congress set up the trust fund and outlined authorized uses of the funds. According to Section 611(d), USTR can use funds from the TETF to monitor and enforce trade agreements and WTO commitments and to support trade capacity-building assistance to help partner countries meet their free-trade agreement obligations and commitments. USTR can also transfer funds to select federal agencies for trade enforcement activities authorized in Section 611(d) of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. For FY2019, the Administration requested no funding to be derived from the TETF; the FY2018-enacted amount was $15.0 million.  Both the House and Senate committee bills proposed $15.0 million from the TETF for enforcement activities authorized in Section 611 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. These proposals were equal to the FY2018-enacted amount.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), provided $15.0 million to be derived from the TETF for USTR, for enforcement activities authorized in Section 611 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. This amount is equal to the FY2018-enacted amount. ITEC was established by executive order in 2012 to take a \"whole-of-government\" approach to monitoring and enforcing U.S. trade rights by using expertise from across the federal government. In 2016, the ITEC was succeeded by ICTIME, which Congress established through the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-125 ). The executive-established ITEC received its funding through ITA; funding for ICTIME is now appropriated through USTR. ICTIME's purpose is to advance U.S. trade policy through strengthened and coordinated enforcement of U.S. trade rights. ICTIME investigates potential disputes under the auspices of the World Trade Organization; inspects potential disputes pursuant to bilateral and regional trade agreements to which the United States is a party; and carries out the functions of USTR with respect to the monitoring and enforcement of trade agreements to which the United States is a party. USTR and ITA work closely within the ICTIME to identify issues and develop information in areas of economic importance to U.S. industries.  The USTR's budget justification did not provide a breakdown for requested funding for ICTIME. The House and Senate committee-reported bills did not include a specific funding amount for ICTIME. The Senate committee report did note that the Senate committee supports ICTIME within the funds provided for USTR. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) and the accompanying conference report also did not provide specific language regarding ICTIME."
