FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked 4 civilian \n        aircraft, crashing 2 of them into the towers of the World Trade \n        Center in New York City, causing the destruction of the towers.\n            (2) These were by far the deadliest terrorist attacks ever \n        launched against the United States, claiming the lives of more \n        than 3,000 innocent people, 2,797 of whom died in New York \n        City.\n            (3) The debris from the destruction of the World Trade \n        Center towers was taken to a landfill on Staten Island, New \n        York, for cleanup and investigation and to continue the \n        recovery of victim remains and effects that could not be \n        performed at the site of the towers' collapse in Manhattan.\n            (4) Over the 10-month period following September 11, 2001, \n        more than 1,000 people worked at the landfill around the clock \n        every day, tirelessly and carefully sifting through all \n        1,620,000 tons of debris from the World Trade Center site \n        searching for remains, personal effects, and evidence from what \n        is now considered to be history's largest crime scene.\n            (5) Approximately 20 percent of all the victim remains \n        recovered following the towers' collapse, as well as more than \n        54,000 personal items, from wedding rings and photographs to \n        driver licenses and keys were retrieved at the Staten Island \n        site.\n            (6) The remains of 306 of the 1,423 World Trade Center \n        victims whose remains have been identified and returned to \n        their families were recovered at the Staten Island site.\n            (7) Victims' families were brought some sort of peace by \n        being given back something personal of lost loved ones, whether \n        through a positive identification of a victim's remains or the \n        return of something so simple and yet so meaningful as a \n        wedding ring, a watch, or a wallet.\n            (8) On July 15, 2002, after 10 months, the cleanup and \n        recovery operations at the landfill on Staten Island, New York, \n        came to a somber conclusion.\n            (9) The site commemorates those lost. The determination of \n        appropriate recognition there will be a slowly unfolding \n        process in order to address the interests and concerns of all \n        interested parties. Appropriate national assistance and \n        recognition must give ample opportunity for those involved to \n        voice these broad concerns.\n            (10) It is appropriate that the site be designated a unit \n        of the National Park System.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To establish a national memorial to honor the final \n        resting place of some of those lost at the World Trade Center \n        on September 11, 2001.\n            (2) To establish the memorial advisory commission to assist \n        with consideration and formulation of plans for a permanent \n        memorial to those lost at the World Trade Center, including its \n        nature, design, and construction.\n            (3) To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \n        coordinate and facilitate the activities of the Memorial \n        Advisory Commission and administer a victim's memorial at the \n        site of the Fresh Kills Landfill operation on Staten Island, \n        New York.\n\nSEC. 3.
