The Secretary shall have in place within 2 \nyears of enactment of this Act a plan for assuring that the inventory \nis sold and replaced in a manner that assures the integrity of the \nproduct at all times. The Secretary shall have the authority to \nexchange an aging supply of reserve gasoline through private sales or \nby utilizing the fuel for military or government use.
