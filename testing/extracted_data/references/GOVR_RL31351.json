    "content": "Although efforts at gaining legislative approval of the Brownlow committee's recommendations lay in ruin in the spring of 1938, the President had not deserted the cause. By July, Roosevelt was meeting with Brownlow and the other committee members. The panel would not be officially reassembled, but he wanted each man's help with a reorganization authority proposal. The resulting measure empowered the President to propose reorganization plans, subject to a veto by a majority vote of disapproval in both houses of Congress, and to also appoint six administrative assistants. After three days of discussion and debate, the House adopted the bill on March 8, 1939. Twelve days later, the Senate began considering the proposal. Following two days of sparring over amendments, the Senate adopted the bill. A quick conference cleared the measure for Roosevelt's signature on April 3. Earlier, the President had asked the Brownlow committee members to assist with the preparation of his initial reorganization plans. Following consultations with Budget Bureau Director Harold D. Smith, the Brownlow group presented two reorganization proposals to Roosevelt on April 23. Plan 1, submitted to Congress on April 25, transferred certain agencies to the Executive Office of the President, but offered no explanation of that entity. In Plan 2, a presidential emergency council was abolished and most of its functions were transferred to the Executive Office. While both plans were acceptable to legislators, their effective dates were troublesome in terms of accommodating fiscal calendar necessities. By joint resolution, Congress provided that both plans would be effective on July 1, 1939. Following this action, the President, on September 8, issued E.O. 8248, formally organizing the Executive Office and, thereby, defining it in terms of its components. Brownlow, who drafted the initial reorganization plan, viewed the Executive Office as the institutional realization of administrative management and \"the effective coordination of the tremendously wide-spread federal machinery.\" He called the initial version \"a little thing\" compared to its later size. It grew under Roosevelt and \"it continued to expand and was further regularized by statute, by appropriation acts, and by more reorganization plans\" during the succeeding years. The Executive Office organized by E.O. 8248 consisted of the White House Office, the Bureau of the Budget, the National Resources Planning Board, the Office of Government Reports, and the Liaison Office for Personnel Management. It also provided that, \"in the event of a national emergency,\" there could be established \"such office for emergency management as the President shall determine.\" The Office for Emergency Management was created by an administrative order on May 25, 1940, and its functions were further specified in an administrative order of January 7, 1941. It subsequently served as a parent unit for a number of subordinate emergency management bodies. The creation of the Executive Office of the President contributed to an increase in the number of presidential advisers for several reasons. First, it provided an enclave for various agencies that immediately assisted the President. Primary among these was the White House Office, which was no longer merely the President's small office staff, but an agency with hierarchically organized staff positions whose personnel rapidly expanded during the next few decades. Second, it counted agencies, such as the Liaison Office for Personnel Management and the Office for Emergency Management, that were headed by an administrative assistant\u2014and adviser\u2014to the President on the White House Office payroll. It also included agencies, such as the Bureau of the Budget (and its Office of Management and Budget successor), that were headed by leaders for whom advising the President was a primary responsibility. Third, senior White House Office staff would come to supervise and direct the staff of other Executive Office entities: the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs would direct the National Security Council staff and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy would direct the Domestic Council staff. Fourth, in January 1973, President Richard M. Nixon vested his Secretary of the Treasury and his director of the Office of Management and Budget with dual White House Office positions, respectively, of Assistant to the President for Economic Affairs and Assistant to the President for Executive Management. He also vested his Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development with dual White House Office positions, respectively, of Counselor to the President for Natural Resources, Counselor to the President for Human Resources, and Counselor to the President for Community Development. Having such dual White House Office titles was viewed as giving added emphasis, if not authority, to the role of these officials as presidential advisers. In the aftermath of World War II, Congress statutorily chartered most of the agencies within the Executive Office of the President. Furthermore, Congress routinely appropriated funds for the operating expenses of these entities. In 1944, Congress had adopted an amendment to an appropriation bill that was designed to restrain the creation of Executive Office agencies by executive order\u2014a frequent occurrence during 1941-1944. The amendment stated: After January 1, 1945, no part of any appropriation or fund made available by this or any other Act shall be allotted or made available to, or used to pay the expenses of, any agency or instrumentality including those established by Executive order after such agency or instrumentality has been in existence for more than one year, if the Congress has not appropriated any money specifically for such agency or instrumentality or specifically authorized the expenditure of funds by it. In 1982, when Title 31 of the United States Code was recodified, the amendment was repealed and replaced with new language at Section 1347. The opening sentence of the new section, which remains as operative law, states: \"An agency in existence for more than one year may not use amounts otherwise available for obligation to pay its expenses without a specific appropriation or specific authorization by law.\" With their growing number and influence, senior staff members of the White House Office and certain other Executive Office agencies began to become of interest to congressional committees when accountability for policymaking and administrative or managerial actions prompted requests for their testimony. Some, like War Production Board chairman Donald M. Nelson, who was popularly known as the \"arms czar,\" appeared before and cooperated with the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (\"Truman Committee\") during World War II to report on and discuss war material production and related coordination matters. Others, like Office of War Mobilization director James F. Byrnes, who was sometimes referred to as the \"assistant president,\" apparently avoided appearing before congressional committees during the World War II era, but were in communication with various individual Members of Congress in leadership positions and served as liaisons between the President and Congress on a number of war matters. Beginning with the closing years of World War II, examples are provided below of instances when a presidential adviser\u2014a civilian executive branch official, other than a member of the traditional Cabinet, who, as part of that official's responsibilities and activities, consulted with the President\u2014testified before a congressional committee or subcommittee. Because these consultations with the President by such an official may be considered by the President to be privileged and constitutionally protectable, examples are also provided of instances when invited congressional committee or subcommittee testimony by a presidential adviser was refused. None of the examples involves testimony or refusal to testify by a former presidential adviser. All examples are based upon the public record.

Congress has a constitutionally rooted right of access to the information it needs to perform its Article I legislative and oversight functions. Generally, a congressional committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter, which is conducting an authorized investigation for legislative or oversight purposes, has a right to information held by the executive branch in the absence of either a valid claim of constitutional privilege by the executive or a statutory provision whereby Congress has limited its constitutional right to information. Given the tradition of comity between the executive and legislative branches, Congress often elects not to request the appearance of presidential aides. When Congress has requested the appearance of such aides, Presidents and their aides have at times resisted, asserting the separation of powers doctrine and/or executive privilege. These two grounds for declining to comply with congressional requests for the appearance of presidential aides overlap, and it is sometimes difficult to determine which argument is being raised. The executive branch has articulated a long-standing position that \"the President's immediate advisers are absolutely immune from congressional testimonial process.\" This principle of absolute immunity would prevent Congress from compelling a presidential adviser to appear before a committee for purposes of providing testimony. The executive branch position, as articulated in various opinions of the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, is grounded in the separation of powers and legal principles underlying executive privilege. Specifically, the DOJ argues that because the President must be immune from compelled congressional testimony, his close presidential advisers, who \"function as the President's alter ego,\" must also be immune from compelled testimony. To hold otherwise, the DOJ argues, would interfere with the President's \"discharge of his constitutional functions\" in two significant ways. First, permitting Congress to compel testimony from close presidential advisers would \"threaten the President's independence and autonomy from Congress\" in that committees could \"harass ... advisers in an effort to influence their conduct\" and \"promote a perception that the President is subordinate to Congress.\" Second, compelled testimony by presidential advisers would \"threaten executive branch confidentiality, which is necessary (among other things) to ensure that the President can obtain the type of sound and candid advice that is essential to the effective discharge of his constitutional duties.\" Although conceding that advisers could appear before Congress and invoke executive privilege with respect to specific questions, the DOJ finds that procedure insufficient to protect executive branch autonomy. \"In the heat of the moment, without the opportunity for careful reflection,\" the executive branch argues, \"the adviser might have difficulty confining his remarks to those that do not reveal [] sensitive information.\"  With respect to the many instances in which close presidential advisers have testified before Congress, the DOJ asserts that those officials have done so voluntarily \"as an accommodation to a congressional committee's legitimate interest in investigating certain activities of the Executive Branch.\" The DOJ argues that voluntary testimony, as opposed to compelled testimony, does not trigger the same concerns under the separation of powers, nor do examples of voluntary testimony \"undermine the Executive Branch's long-established position on absolute immunity.\"  No decision of the Supreme Court resolves the question of whether there are any circumstances in which close presidential advisers can refuse a subpoena to appear before a congressional committee for purposes of providing testimony. However, in Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers , the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected the long-standing executive branch position and held that close presidential advisers are not immune from compulsory congressional testimony.  The Miers case arose out of an investigation by the House Committee on the Judiciary into the termination and replacement of a number of U.S. Attorneys during the George W. Bush Administration. In the course of the investigation, the committee issued a subpoena to former White House Counsel Harriet Miers, seeking her testimony on the matter. Following a legal conclusion from the DOJ that \"Ms. Miers is immune from compulsion to testify before the Committee on this matter,\" Miers informed the Committee that she would not appear. The Committee subsequently filed a civil lawsuit asking a federal court to order Miers to comply with the subpoena.  The Miers opinion represents a clear repudiation of the executive view of absolute immunity for close presidential advisers. The district court strongly disagreed with the executive's arguments, noting that: The Executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context. That simple yet critical fact bears repeating: the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law. In fact, there is Supreme Court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity. The Court therefore rejects the Executive's claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides. Instead, the court held that Miers \"must appear before the Committee to provide testimony, and invoke executive privilege where appropriate.\" In reaching its conclusion, the district court also rejected the argument that close advisers should be considered the \"alter ego\" of the President. The court noted that this line of argument had been foreclosed by the Supreme Court in the case of Harlow v. Fitzgerald \u2014a civil suit for damages in which the Court expressly refused to accord presidential advisers with absolute immunity. Indeed, the district court in Miers went further and, in fact, questioned whether the president himself was absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony. Miers did, however, leave open the question of whether presidential advisers engaged in \"special functions\" relating to \"national security or foreign policy\" may be accorded some form of immunity from compelled testimony. The district court likewise rejected that argument that the absence of absolute immunity would create a \"chilling effect\" on the candid and frank advice advisers would provide to the President. The court reasoned that the ability of an adviser to appear, and invoke executive privilege in response to specific questioning, \"should serve as an effective check against public disclosure of truly privileged communications, thereby mitigating any adverse impact on the quality of advice that the President receives.\" The reasoning adopted by the Miers court may have significant influence in that it so clearly repudiated the executive's claim of absolute immunity for presidential advisers, while reaffirming Congress's essential role in conducting oversight and enforcing its own subpoenas. However, as a district court decision, the Miers opinion has limited precedential value. For its part, the executive branch maintains that Miers was wrongly decided. Consistent with that conclusion, DOJ continues to adhere to its position that close presidential advisers have absolute immunity from compelled testimony by Congress.  A congressional committee may request (informally or by a letter from the committee chair, perhaps cosigned by the ranking Member) or demand (pursuant to subpoena ) the testimony of a presidential adviser. However, Congress may encounter legal and political problems in attempting to enforce a subpoena to a presidential adviser. Conflicts concerning congressional requests or demands for executive branch testimony or documents often involve extensive negotiations, and may be resolved by some form of compromise as to, inter alia, the scope of the testimony or information to be provided to Congress. If the executive branch fails to comply with a committee subpoena, and if negotiations do not resolve the matter, the committee may employ Congress's inherent contempt authority (involving a trial at the bar of the Senate or House) or statutory criminal contempt authority in an effort to obtain the needed information. Both of these procedures are somewhat cumbersome, and their use may not result in the production of the information that is sought. When faced with a refusal by the executive branch to comply with a demand for information, Congress has several alternatives to inherent and statutory contempt, although these alternatives are not without their own limitations. One approach is to seek declaratory or other relief in the courts. Previous attempts to seek judicial resolution of interbranch conflicts over information access issues have encountered procedural obstacles and have demonstrated the reluctance of the courts to resolve sensitive separation of powers issues. Other approaches may include, inter alia, appropriations riders, impeachment, and a delay in the confirmation of presidential appointees. In addition to the options generally available in the event of a refusal by the executive to provide information sought by Congress, when a presidential adviser who is not serving in a department or agency established by law declines to testify before a committee, Congress might wish to enact legislation establishing the entity and making the head of the entity subject to Senate confirmation. (1) Legal and policy factors may explain why presidential advisers do not regularly testify before committees. (2) Generally, a congressional committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter, which is conducting an authorized investigation for legislative or oversight purposes, has a right to information held by the executive branch in the absence of either a valid claim of constitutional privilege by the executive or a statutory provision whereby Congress has limited its constitutional right to information. (3) A committee may request or demand the testimony of a presidential adviser, however, legal mechanisms available for enforcing congressional subpoenas to the executive branch may fail to provide the committee with the desired information. (4) Negotiations may result in the production of at least some of the information sought."
