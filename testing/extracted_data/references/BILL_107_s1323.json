FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) small business concerns represent approximately 96 \n        percent of all exporters of goods;\n            (2) there has been dynamic growth in the number of small \n        business concerns exporting goods, and the dollar value of \n        their exports;\n            (3) despite such growth, small business concerns encounter \n        problems in obtaining financing for exports;\n            (4) growth in United States exports will depend primarily \n        on technology innovation, making the protection of intellectual \n        property in the global market of special national interest;\n            (5) the costs of filing for initial patent protection in \n        foreign markets can be prohibitive for small business concerns \n        involved in the Small Business Innovation Research Program \n        (referred to in this section as ``SBIR'') and the Small \n        Business Technology Transfer Program (referred to in this \n        section as ``STTR''), representing an insurmountable barrier to \n        obtaining the protection needed to pursue the international \n        markets;\n            (6) to overcome such barriers and to maximize the Federal \n        investment in the SBIR and STTR programs, the Small Business \n        Administration should be authorized to provide grants to be \n        used to underwrite the costs of initial foreign patent \n        applications by SBIR and STTR awardees; and\n            (7) a program established to provide such grants should, \n        over time, become self funding.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF GRANT PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n    Section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(w) Foreign Patent Protection Grant Pilot Program.--\n            ``(1) Grants authorized.--The Administrator shall make \n        grants from the Fund established under paragraph (6) for the \n        purpose of assisting SBIR and STTR awardees in seeking foreign \n        patent protection in accordance with this subsection.\n            ``(2) Number of grants.--The Administrator shall make \n        grants under this subsection to not more than--\n                    ``(A) a total of 100 SBIR and STTR awardees in \n                fiscal year 2003;\n                    ``(B) a total of 200 SBIR and STTR awardees in \n                fiscal year 2004;\n                    ``(C) a total of 300 SBIR and STTR awardees in \n                fiscal year 2005;
