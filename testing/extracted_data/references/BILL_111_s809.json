FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In today's global economy, employees must possess the \n        education and training necessary to adapt to change and learn \n        new skills.\n            (2) Community colleges provide high quality education to \n        students and support to businesses and employers.\n            (3) Community colleges collaborate with local and regional \n        businesses, industry, workforce investment boards, and economic \n        development organizations to tailor their educational programs \n        to deliver employers a workforce with the skills employers \n        need. Workers receiving customized training have increased job \n        performance productivity and the workforce is stronger and more \n        competitive as a result.\n            (4) Community-based job training grants were created as \n        part of the fiscal year 2005 budget of the President.\n            (5) The purpose of community-based job training grants is \n        to assist community colleges in training workers to develop the \n        skills required by employers in high-growth industries and \n        occupations where demand for qualified workers outstrips the \n        supply.\n            (6) Given the high level of unemployment as a result of the \n        economic downturn, the supply of labor now greatly outpaces \n        demand in many industries.\n            (7) According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, \n        the current economic recession began in December of 2007.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a tuition \nassistance program for qualifying workers who become unemployed as a \nresult of the recent economic recession to enable those workers to \nobtain education and training to contribute to the economic recovery.\n\nSEC. 3.
