FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Infertility is a medical disease recognized by the \n        World Health Organization, the American Society for \n        Reproductive Medicine, and the American Medical Association \n        that affects men and women equally.\n            (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, 1 in 8 couples have difficulty getting pregnant or \n        sustaining a pregnancy.\n            (3) Infertility affects a broad spectrum of prospective \n        parents. No matter what race, religion, sexuality, or economic \n        status one is, infertility does not discriminate.\n            (4) Approximately one-third of infertility is attributed to \n        the female partner, one-third is attributed to the male \n        partner, and one-third is caused by a combination of problems \n        in both partners or is unexplained.\n            (5) Infertility disproportionately affects individuals with \n        particular health complications. For cancer patients and others \n        who must undergo treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation \n        therapy, hormone therapy, or surgery that are likely to harm \n        the reproductive system and organs, fertility preservation \n        becomes necessary.\n            (6) Leading causes of infertility include chronic \n        conditions and diseases of the endocrine or metabolic systems, \n        such as primary ovarian insufficiency, polycystic ovarian \n        syndrome, endometriosis, thyroid disorders, menstrual cycle \n        defects, autoimmune disorders, hormonal imbalances, testicular \n        disorders, and urological health issues. Other causes include \n        structural problems or blockages within the reproductive \n        system, exposure to infectious diseases, occupational or \n        environmental hazards, or genetic influences.\n            (7) Recent improvements in therapy and cryopreservation \n        make pregnancy possible for more people than in past years.\n            (8) Like all other diseases, infertility and its treatments \n        should be covered by health insurance.\n            (9) A 2017 national survey of employer-sponsored health \n        plans found that 44 percent of employers with at least 500 \n        employees did not cover infertility services, and 25 percent of \n        companies with 20,000 or more employees did not cover \n        infertility services.\n            (10) States that do not require insurance coverage of \n        assisted reproductive technology have higher rates of multiple \n        births.\n            (11) The ability to have a family should not be denied to \n        anyone on account of a lack of insurance coverage for medically \n        necessary treatment.\n\nSEC. 3.
