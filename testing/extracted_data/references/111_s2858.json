FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Mitochondrial disease results when there is a defect \n        that reduces the ability of the mitochondria in a cell to \n        produce energy. As mitochondria fail to produce enough energy, \n        the cells will cease to function properly and will eventually \n        die. Organ systems will begin to fail, and the life of the \n        individual is compromised or ended.\n            (2) There are more than 40 mitochondrial diseases.\n            (3) Mitochondrial diseases are a relatively newly diagnosed \n        group of diseases, first recognized in the late 1960s. \n        Diagnosis of these diseases is extremely difficult.\n            (4) Mitochondrial diseases can present themselves at any \n        age, with associated mortality rates that vary depending upon \n        the particular disease. The most severe diseases result in \n        progressive loss of neurological and liver function, and death \n        within several years.\n            (5) According to the National Institute of Environmental \n        Health Sciences, half of those affected by mitochondrial \n        disease are children, who show symptoms before age five and \n        approximately 80 percent of whom will not survive beyond the \n        age of 20.\n            (6) Mitochondrial dysfunction is also associated with \n        numerous other disorders, including many neurological diseases \n        (such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, and autism), and other \n        diseases associated with aging, diabetes, and cancer.\n            (7) Mitochondrial diseases are most commonly the result of \n        genetic mutation, either in the nuclear DNA or in the \n        mitochondrial DNA. Some mitochondrial diseases have been \n        attributable to environmental factors that interfere with \n        mitochondrial function.\n            (8) Researchers estimate that one in 4,000 children will \n        develop a mitochondrial disease related to an inherited \n        mutation by the age of 10 years, and that 1,000-2,000 children \n        are born each year in the United States who will develop \n        mitochondrial disease in their lifetimes. However, studies of \n        umbilical cord blood samples show that one in 200 children are \n        born with both normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA, and the \n        number of children with these mutations who actually develop a \n        disease is unknown.\n            (9) There are no cures for any of the specifically \n        identified mitochondrial diseases, nor is there a specific \n        treatment for any of these diseases.\n            (10) Improving our basic understanding of mitochondrial \n        function and dysfunction has potential application to numerous \n        areas of biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health \n        has taken an increased interest in mitochondrial disease and \n        dysfunction and has sponsored a number of activities in recent \n        years aimed at advancing mitochondrial medicine, including \n        incorporating research into functional variation in \n        mitochondria in the Transformative Research Grants Initiative.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to promote an enhanced \nresearch effort aimed at improved understanding of mitochondrial \ndisease and dysfunction and the development of treatments and cures for \nmitochondrial disease.\n\nSEC. 3.
