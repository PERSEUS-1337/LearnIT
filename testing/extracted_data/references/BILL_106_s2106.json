FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Biotechnology in the agricultural sector holds the \n        prospect for substantial benefits to mankind in a number of \n        critical areas.\n            (2) Enhanced crop yields resulting from the use of \n        agricultural biotechnology will help in feeding a growing world \n        population, especially in developing countries.\n            (3) Healthier bio-engineered foods will assist in combating \n        diseases specific to the developing world that arise from \n        vitamin and other nutritional deficiencies.\n            (4) Pest and disease resistant crops developed through \n        biotechnology will preserve and improve the environment by \n        reducing the need for herbicides and pesticides.\n            (5) Greater agricultural yields will preserve the \n        environment by minimizing the need for additional farmland to \n        feed and clothe the world's growing population.\n            (6) Ensuring that these benefits, the underlying scientific \n        information, and the regulatory framework for managing this \n        technology are shared globally is imperative and should be an \n        integral part of United States foreign assistance programs.\n\nSEC. 3. INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Of the funds appropriated to carry out sections \n103 through 106, and chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act \nof 1961 for fiscal years 2001-2002, $6,000,000 is authorized to be \nappropriated to the Agency for International Development for programs \nand projects designed to educate government officials in developing \ncountries regarding the use of biotechnology in the agricultural sector \nand the regulatory procedures used by the United States with respect to \nagricultural products using biotechnology. The programs and activities \nshall encourage acceptance by those countries of products approved \nunder the United States regulatory system or, in the case of countries \nwho choose to establish a national regulatory system based on science, \nto encourage adoption of domestic approval processes based on objective \nscientific principles. The programs and activities shall include the \nfollowing:\n            (1) Technical exchange program for foreign officials.--The \n        Agency for International Development shall carry out a \n        technical exchange program that brings to the United States \n        appropriate foreign officials for the purpose of educating them \n        about the scientific process underlying biotechnology and the \n        regulatory approval system employed in the United States for \n        biotechnology products, and to seek answers to any questions \n        they or their citizens may have regarding the safety of \n        biotechnology, particularly in agricultural products.\n            (2) Technical exchange program for united states \n        biotechnology experts.--The Agency for International \n        Development shall carry out a technical exchange program that \n        sends United States experts in the field of biotechnology in \n        the agriculture sector to foreign capitals to provide \n        information on the scientific process underlying biotechnology, \n        the regulatory approval system employed in the United States to \n        approve agricultural products produced with biotechnology, and \n        to respond to any questions the officials in foreign countries \n        or their citizens may have regarding the safety of \n        biotechnology, particularly in the agriculture sector.\n\nSEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERTISE IN BIOTECHNOLOGY IN THE AGENCY FOR \n              INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    In order to carry out the programs and activities in section ____, \nthe Agency for International Development shall establish a group of \nexperts within the agency to carry out these programs. To maximize its \neffectiveness, this group should draw on the expertise, as appropriate, \nof regulatory officials in the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nFood and Drug Administration, and the United States Department of \nAgriculture, as well as appropriate officials from the Department of \nState.\n\nSEC. 5. COORDINATED FEDERAL STRATEGY.\n\n    (a) Coordination.--The President shall establish an interagency \nprocess for all relevant executive branch agencies, including the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture, the Office of the United \nStates Trade Representative, the Department of State, the Agency for \nInternational Development, the Department of Commerce, the Food and \nDrug Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency, to \ncoordinate efforts and to generate support for the acceptance of \nagricultural biotechnology. United States policies must stress the \nprominence of science as the foundation for regulatory decision-making \nand work aggressively in international fora such as the World Trade \nOrganization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, the World Health Organization, including its CODEX \nAlimentarius, and the United Nations, to advocate for science-based \ndecision making.\n    (b) Standards for Food Aid.--The Agency for International \nDevelopment and the United States Department of Agriculture should work \nto ensure that all food and grain products that meet United States \nhealth and safety requirements are acceptable to foreign countries \nunder relevant food aid programs.\n\nSEC. 6. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the Sense of the Congress that the Secretary of State should \nwork with United States embassies abroad to develop bilateral support \nfrom foreign governments for the approval of science-based trading \nregimes in multilateral forums and organizations."
