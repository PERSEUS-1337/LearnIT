FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price \n        discrimination practices that compel many older Americans to \n        pay substantially more for prescription drugs than the drug \n        manufacturers' most favored customers, such as health insurers, \n        health maintenance organizations, and the Federal Government.\n            (2) On average, older Americans who buy their own \n        prescription drugs pay twice as much for prescription drugs as \n        the drug manufacturers' most favored customers. In some cases, \n        older Americans pay over 15 times more for prescription drugs \n        than the most favored customers.\n            (3) The discriminatory pricing by major drug manufacturers \n        sustains their annual profits of $20,000,000,000, but causes \n        financial hardship and impairs the health and well-being of \n        millions of older Americans. More than one in eight older \n        Americans are forced to choose between buying their food and \n        buying their medicines.\n            (4) Most federally funded health care programs, including \n        Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration, the Public Health \n        Service, and the Indian Health Service, obtain prescription \n        drugs for their beneficiaries at low prices. Medicare \n        beneficiaries are denied this benefit and cannot obtain their \n        prescription drugs at the favorable prices available to other \n        federally funded health care programs.\n            (5) It has been estimated that implementation of the policy \n        set forth in this Act will reduce prescription prices for \n        Medicare beneficiaries by more than 40 percent.\n            (6) In addition to substantially lowering health care costs \n        for older Americans, implementation of the policy set forth in \n        this Act will significantly improve the health and well-being \n        of older Americans and lower the costs to the Federal taxpayer \n        of the Medicare program.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect Medicare \nbeneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug manufacturers and to \nmake prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at \nsubstantially reduced prices, by allowing pharmacies to purchase drugs \nfor Medicare beneficiaries at the substantially reduced price available \nunder the Federal Supply Schedule.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE BENEFICIARY DRUG BENEFIT CARD.\n\n    The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall furnish to each \nMedicare beneficiary a drug benefit card that enables the beneficiary \nto purchase covered prescription drugs from participating pharmacies at \nreduced prices pursuant to section 4.\n\nSEC. 4. PARTICIPATING PHARMACIES.\n\n    (a) Agreements to Participate.--Any qualified pharmacy may enter \ninto an agreement with the Secretary that enables the pharmacy to sell \ncovered outpatient drugs to holders of Medicare drug benefit cards at a \nreduced price, by authorizing the pharmacy to operate as a \nparticipating pharmacy under this Act.\n    (b) Right of Participating Pharmacies To Obtain Drugs.--An \nagreement under this section shall entitle the participating pharmacy \nto purchase any covered outpatient drug that is listed on the Federal \nSupply Schedule of the General Services Administration at the \nparticipating pharmacy discount price for that drug determined under \nsubsection (d).\n    (c) Quantity of Drugs Purchased.--An agreement under this section \nshall permit the participating pharmacy to purchase under this Act as \nmuch of a covered outpatient drug as is sold by the pharmacy to holders \nof Medicare drug benefit cards.\n    (d) Participating Pharmacy Discount Price.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall determine a \n        participating pharmacy discount price for each covered \n        outpatient drug.\n            (2) Determination.--The participating pharmacy discount \n        price for a covered outpatient drug shall be determined by \n        adding--\n                    (A) the price at which the drug is available to \n                Federal agencies from the Federal Supply Schedule under \n                section 8126 of title 38, United States Code; plus\n                    (B) an amount that reflects the administrative \n                costs incurred by the Secretary in administering this \n                Act.\n\nSEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall administer this Act in a \nmanner that uses existing methods of obtaining and distributing drugs \nto the maximum extent possible, consistent with efficiency and cost \neffectiveness.\n    (b) Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue such regulations as may \nbe necessary to implement this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. REPORTS TO CONGRESS REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF ACT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall \nreport to the Congress regarding the effectiveness of this Act in--\n            (1) protecting Medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory \n        pricing by drug manufacturers; and\n            (2) making prescription drugs available to Medicare \n        beneficiaries at substantially reduced prices.\n    (b) Consultation.--In preparing such reports, the Secretary shall \nconsult with public health experts, affected industries, organizations \nrepresenting consumers and older Americans, and other interested \npersons.\n    (c) Recommendations.--The Secretary shall include in such reports \nany recommendations they consider appropriate for changes in this Act \nto further reduce the cost of covered outpatient drugs to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n\nSEC. 7.
