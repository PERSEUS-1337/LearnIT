FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The marketing relationships of swine producers with \n        meat packers have undergone significant changes in recent \n        years, and these changes have had an adverse effect on the \n        prices swine producers receive for swine.\n            (2) The concentration of the meat packing industry as it \n        relates to swine slaughter and processing, and the increase in \n        the number of live swine imported into the United States for \n        slaughter and processing, have had an adverse effect on the \n        availability of slaughter capacity in the United States and \n        have adversely affected the price of swine in the United \n        States.\n            (3) A swine market price crisis occurred in the United \n        States during the period beginning on October 1, 1998, through \n        December 31, 1998, which can be summarized as resting on three \n        salient facts:\n                    (A) A 10 percent increase in swine available for \n                slaughter during the period.\n                    (B) An eight percent decrease over the prior year \n                in packer slaughter capacity.\n                    (C) A 37 percent increase in Canadian swine imports \n                into the United States during the period.\n            (4) The fourth quarter of 1998 (adjusted for inflation) \n        registered the lowest live swine prices in the United States \n        spot market for the 20th century, averaging 37 percent lower \n        than 1932.\n            (5) Swine producers had approximately $2,600,000,000 in \n        equity capital investment reduction in 1998 in the value of \n        their production ownership.\n            (6) According to Ron Plain, University of Missouri \n        Extension Economist, swine producers' share of the consumer \n        pork dollar was approximately $0.22 in 1998, and 1998 was the \n        first year since records have been maintained that swine \n        producers received less than 30 percent of the consumer dollar \n        spent for pork and pork products.\n            (7) Despite relatively little change in retail prices for \n        pork and pork products, consumption of pork and pork products \n        increased seven percent in 1998, and such products were the \n        only meat protein that reflected a net per capita consumption \n        increase in 1998 over 1997.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to partially compensate \nswine producers who, due to circumstances beyond their control, \nincurred substantial losses in the marketing of their swine during the \nfourth quarter of 1998 as a result of--\n            (1) adverse economic factors in the swine market; and\n            (2) the failure of the Federal Government to pursue foreign \n        trade opportunities and to obtain cooperative limitations on \n        imports that substantially and adversely affected an industry \n        already under stressed market pricing conditions.\n\nSEC. 3.
