A \n        recent study found that children in high-quality child care \n        programs had better thinking and attention skills, better \n        mathematics and pre-reading skills, and fewer behavioral \n        problems.\n            ``(4) In a study following children to age 21 who received \n        high-quality early children education, such children were more \n        likely to have enrolled in college, been employed, and delayed \n        parenthood.\n\n``SEC. 10996B.
