Any such petitioner shall not be \n        entitled to have such issue determined under section 360(a) of \n        this Act or otherwise;\n            ``(6) whenever a petitioner seeks review of an order under \n        this section, any review sought with respect to a motion to \n        reopen or reconsider such an order shall be consolidated with \n        the review of the order;\n            ``(7) if the validity of a removal order has not been \n        judicially determined, its validity may be challenged in a \n        criminal proceeding against the alien for violation of \n        subsection (a) or (b) of section 243 of this Act only by \n        separate motion for judicial review before trial. Such motion \n        shall be determined by the court without a jury and before the \n        trial of the general issue. Whenever a claim to United States \n        nationality is made in such motion, and in the opinion of the \n        court, a genuine issue of material fact as to the alien's \n        nationality is presented, the court shall accord him a hearing \n        de novo on the nationality claim and determine that issue as if \n        proceedings had been initiated under the provisions of section \n        2201 of title 28, United States Code. Any such alien shall not \n        be entitled to have such issue determined under section 360(a) \n        of this Act or otherwise. If no such hearing de novo as to \n        nationality is conducted, the determination shall be made \n        solely upon the administrative record upon which the removal \n        order is based and the Attorney General's findings of fact, if \n        supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on \n        the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive.

Nothing contained in this section shall be \n        construed to preclude the Attorney General from detaining or \n        continuing to detain an alien or from taking the alien into \n        custody pursuant to section 241 of this Act at any time after \n        the issuance of a removal order;\n            ``(9) it shall not be necessary to print the record or any \n        part thereof, or the briefs, and the court shall review the \n        proceedings on a typewritten record and on typewritten briefs; \n        and\n            ``(10) any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of \n        removal may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas corpus \n        proceedings.\n    ``(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any alien \nagainst whom a final order of removal has been made heretofore or \nhereafter under the provisions of section 235 of this Act or comparable \nprovisions of any prior Act may obtain judicial review of such order by \nhabeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise.\n    ``(c) An order of removal shall not be reviewed by any court if the \nalien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to the \nalien as of right under the immigration laws and regulations or if the \nalien has departed from the United States after the issuance of the \norder. Every petition for review or for habeas corpus shall state \nwhether the validity of the order has been upheld in any prior judicial \nproceeding, and, if so, the nature and date thereof, and the court in \nwhich such proceeding took place. No petition for review or for habeas \ncorpus shall be entertained if the validity of the order has been \npreviously determined in any civil or criminal proceeding, unless the \npetition presents grounds which the court finds could not have been \npresented in such prior proceeding, or the court finds that the remedy \nprovided by such prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test \nthe validity of the order.\n    ``(d)(1) A petition for review or for habeas corpus on behalf of an \nalien against whom a final order of removal has been issued pursuant to \nsection 238(b) may challenge only--\n            ``(A) whether the alien is in fact the alien described in \n        the order;\n            ``(B) whether the alien is in fact an alien described in \n        section 238(b)(2);\n            ``(C) whether the alien has been convicted of an aggravated \n        felony and such conviction has become final; and\n            ``(D) whether the alien was afforded the procedures \n        required by section 238(b)(4).\n    ``(2) No court shall have jurisdiction to review any issue other \nthan an issue described in paragraph (1).''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \ntake effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply to \ndeterminations pending on or after such date with respect to which--\n            (1) a final administrative decision has been not been \n        rendered as of such date; or\n            (2) such a decision has been rendered but the period for \n        seeking judicial review of the decision has not expired."
