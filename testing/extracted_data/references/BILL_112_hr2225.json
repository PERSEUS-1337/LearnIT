FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Family offices are not of national concern in that \n        their advice, counsel, publications, writings, analyses, and \n        reports are not furnished or distributed to clients on a retail \n        basis, but are instead furnished or distributed only to persons \n        who are members of a particular family.\n            (2) Family offices do not hold themselves out to the public \n        as investment advisers.\n            (3) Family offices do not engage in the business of \n        advising others, but instead provide a wide range of services \n        to members of the family they serve, only one of which involves \n        investment advice, for which they may receive compensation from \n        the members of the family.\n            (4) Since the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 was enacted, \n        the Securities and Exchange Commission has regularly issued \n        orders to individual family offices exempting them from all of \n        the provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\n            (5) Section 409 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n        Consumer Protection Act expressly exempts family offices from \n        all of the provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\n            (6) It was the intent of Congress that section 409 of the \n        Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act be \n        interpreted broadly to encompass all family offices as they are \n        currently organized and operated, as well as to encompass \n        changes in the organization and operation of family offices in \n        the future.\n\nSEC. 2. FAMILY OFFICE DEFINITION.\n\n    Section 202(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. \n80b-2(a)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (11)(G), in the matter added by section \n        409(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n        Protection Act, by striking ``, as defined by rule, regulation, \n        or order of the Commission, in accordance with the purposes of \n        this title'';\n            (2) by redesignating the second paragraph (29), as added by \n        section 770 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n        Protection Act, as paragraph (31);
