Frequently contrasted with \u201cconversational\u201d or \u201csocial\u201d language, academic language includes a variety of formal-language skills such as vocabulary, grammar, punctuation, syntax, discipline-specific terminology, or rhetorical conventions, that allow pupils to acquire knowledge and academic skills while also successfully navigating school policies, assignments, expectations, and cultural norms.\n350.1.\n(a)On or before September 1, 2016, the Superintendent, in consultation with the department and local educational agencies, shall develop a formal process to identify pupils who may meet the definition in subdivision (a) of Section 350.\n(b)The process may, at a minimum, provide special consideration to pupils who meet any of the following criteria:\n(1)Scores in the lowest achievement levels on the Smarter Balanced Assessment System summative and interim assessments.\n(2)Receives less than a passing grade on one or more consecutive progress and report cards in English language arts.\n(3)Is identified by teachers or faculty members as a candidate who may meet one or more of the criteria in paragraphs (1) or (2).\n350.2.\n(a)On or before January 1, 2017, the department, in consultation with local educational agencies, shall develop a study on best practices for providing instruction to pupils of limited academic English proficiency, and shall provide this study to members of the Legislature, the Office of the Legislative Analyst, and the Governor.
