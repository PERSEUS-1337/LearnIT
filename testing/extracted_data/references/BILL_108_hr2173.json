FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Eighty percent of what children learn is acquired \n        through the visual processing of information.\n            (2) Visual impairment is one of the 10 most common causes \n        of disability in America. In children, visual impairment is \n        associated with developmental delays and the need for special \n        education, vocational, and social services.
