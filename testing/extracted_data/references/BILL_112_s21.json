FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Malicious state, terrorist, and criminal actors \n        exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications \n        networks and gaps in cyber security pose one of the most \n        serious and rapidly growing threats to both the national \n        security and economy of the United States.\n            (2) With information technology now the backbone of the \n        United States economy, a critical element of United States \n        national security infrastructure and defense systems, the \n        primary foundation of global communications, and a key enabler \n        of most critical infrastructure, nearly every single American \n        citizen is touched by cyberspace and is threatened by cyber \n        attacks.\n            (3) Malicious actors in cyberspace have already caused \n        significant damage to the United States Government, the United \n        States economy, and United States citizens: United States \n        Government computer networks are probed millions of times each \n        day; approximately 9,000,000 Americans have their identities \n        stolen each year; cyber crime costs American businesses with \n        500 or more employees an average of $3,800,000 per year; and \n        intellectual property worth over $1,000,000,000,000 has already \n        been stolen from American businesses.\n            (4) In its 2009 Cyberspace Policy Review, the White House \n        concluded, ``Ensuring that cyberspace is sufficiently resilient \n        and trustworthy to support United States goals of economic \n        growth, civil liberties and privacy protections, national \n        security, and the continued advancement of democratic \n        institutions requires making cybersecurity a national \n        priority.''\n            (5) An effective solution to the tremendous challenges of \n        cyber security demands cooperation and integration of effort \n        across jurisdictions of multiple Federal, State, local, and \n        tribal government agencies, between the government and the \n        private sector, and with international allies, as well as \n        increased public awareness and preparedness among the American \n        people.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that Congress should enact, and the \nPresident should sign, bipartisan legislation to secure the United \nStates against cyber attack, to enhance American competitiveness and \ncreate jobs in the information technology industry, and to protect the \nidentities and sensitive information of American citizens and \nbusinesses by--\n            (1) enhancing the security and resiliency of United States \n        Government communications and information networks against \n        cyber attack by nation-states, terrorists, and cyber criminals;\n            (2) incentivizing the private sector to quantify, assess, \n        and mitigate cyber risks to their communications and \n        information networks;\n            (3) promoting investments in the American information \n        technology sector that create and maintain good, well-paying \n        jobs in the United States and help to enhance American economic \n        competitiveness;\n            (4) improving the capability of the United States \n        Government to assess cyber risks and prevent, detect, and \n        robustly respond to cyber attacks against the government and \n        the military;\n            (5) improving the capability of the United States \n        Government and the private sector to assess cyber risk and \n        prevent, detect, and robustly respond to cyber attacks against \n        United States critical infrastructure;\n            (6) preventing and mitigating identity theft and guarding \n        against abuses or breaches of personally identifiable \n        information;\n            (7) enhancing United States diplomatic capacity and \n        international cooperation to respond to emerging cyber threats, \n        including promoting security and freedom of access for \n        communications and information networks around the world and \n        battling global cyber crime through focused diplomacy;\n            (8) protecting and increasing the resiliency of United \n        States' critical infrastructure and assets, including the \n        electric grid, military assets, the financial sector, and \n        telecommunications networks against cyber attacks and other \n        threats and vulnerabilities;\n            (9) expanding tools and resources for investigating and \n        prosecuting cyber crimes in a manner that respects privacy \n        rights and civil liberties and promotes American innovation; \n        and\n            (10) maintaining robust protections of the privacy of \n        American citizens and their on-line activities and \n        communications."
