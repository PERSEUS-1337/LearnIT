FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Embassies--\n                    (A) are an important reflection of American values, \n                openness, ingenuity, and innovation;\n                    (B) should reflect the best of United States \n                design, architecture, sustainability, and technology; \n                and\n                    (C) should maintain security as a top priority.\n            (2) Since 2001, the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations \n        (referred to in this section as ``OBO'') has--\n                    (A) completed 71 new diplomatic and consular \n                facilities; and\n                    (B) moved more than 20,000 individuals into safer, \n                more secure and functional facilities.\n            (3) OBO, which has 34 other building projects in design or \n        construction in 2010, has demonstrated its ability to construct \n        diplomatic and consular facilities in a timely and expeditious \n        manner.\n            (4) Since the August 1998 embassy bombings in East Africa, \n        United States diplomatic and consular facilities have faced \n        increasing attacks.\n            (5) OBO constructs safe and functional facilities for \n        American diplomats to allow them to advance foreign policy and \n        to strive to create better, safer, and more secure communities \n        for all citizens of the world.\n            (6) In his seminal memo, entitled ``Guiding Principles for \n        Federal Architecture'', the Honorable Daniel Patrick Moynihan \n        laid out the following core principles:\n                    (A) ``It should be our object to meet the test of \n                Pericles' evocation to the Athenians, which the \n                President commended to the Massachusetts legislature in \n                his address of January 9, 1961: `We do not imitate--for \n                we are a model to others.'''.\n                    (B) ``The policy shall be to provide requisite and \n                adequate facilities in an architectural style and form \n                which is distinguished and which will reflect the \n                dignity, enterprise, vigor and stability of the \n                American National Government.''.\n                    (C) ``The development of an official style must be \n                avoided. . . . The advice of distinguished architects, \n                as a rule, ought to be sought prior to the award of \n                important design contracts.''.\n                    (D) ``The choice and development of the building \n                site should be considered the first step of the design \n                process.''.\n            (7) The principles set forth in paragraph (2) provide the \n        foundation for the General Services Administration's Design \n        Excellence Program, which--\n                    (A) establishes nationwide policies and procedures \n                for selecting distinguished architects and artists for \n                General Services Administration's commissions; and\n                    (B) implements rigorous review processes to produce \n                facilities and civic artworks of outstanding quality \n                and value.\n            (8) Section 401 of the Energy Independence and Security Act \n        of 2007 (Public Law 110-140) defines a high-performance \n        building as ``a building that integrates and optimizes on a \n        life cycle basis all major high performance attributes, \n        including energy conservation, environment, safety, security, \n        durability, accessibility, cost-benefit, productivity, \n        sustainability, functionality, and operational \n        considerations''.\n            (9) The 2009 American Institute of Architects ``Design for \n        Diplomacy: New Embassies for the 21st Century'' reports \n        ``significant interest in developing an approach that would \n        enable architects and engineers to design embassies that \n        reflected the unique needs of a site at a foreign post''.\n            (10) The Center for Strategic and International Studies \n        published a report in 2007, authored by the Embassy of the \n        Future Commission and entitled ``The Embassy of the Future'', \n        which makes the following statements:\n                    (A) ``The new embassy facilities have in some \n                places created the perception among some of a fearful \n                United States, retreating behind high walls and \n                isolating itself from the people it is trying to \n                reach.''.\n                    (B) ``The commission believes that it is important \n                to meet security needs in ways that reflect the new \n                diplomatic job.''.\n                    (C) ``[S]etbacks, barriers, and other security \n                features can be designed in ways that integrate \n                security with the overall building design and \n                surroundings.''.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to adopt design excellence as \na mandate to advance a new generation of secure, high-performance, \nsustainable diplomatic and consular facilities in support of United \nStates foreign policy.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF A DESIGN EXCELLENCE PROGRAM AT THE DEPARTMENT \n              OF STATE.\n\n    The Secretary of State should--\n            (1) develop and establish a design excellence program, \n        which shall be--\n                    (A) modeled after the program used by the General \n                Services Administration; and\n                    (B) tailored to the specific requirements of the \n                Bureau of Overseas Building Operations;\n            (2) ensure that security remains a top priority for all \n        diplomatic and consular facilities;\n            (3) integrate sustainability and sustainable design and \n        construction best practices for all facilities constructed \n        under the direction of the Bureau of Overseas Building \n        Operations;\n            (4) encourage innovation in building design;\n            (5) create a framework for testing new technologies as they \n        come on the market that can create potential value for new \n        facilities;\n            (6) create a design excellence policies and procedures \n        manual, which shall--\n                    (A) explain the mandate of the design excellence \n                program; and\n                    (B) describe how the Department of State will \n                implement and operate the program;\n            (7) establish a high-level board to track the progress of \n        the design excellence program, which--\n                    (A) shall be composed of an equivalent number of--\n                            (i) outside professionals who have specific \n                        architectural, design, and industry expertise; \n                        and\n                            (ii) senior United States Government \n                        officials; and\n                    (B) shall meet not less frequently than \n                semiannually--\n                            (i) to review and analyze the progress and \n                        results of the program; and\n                            (ii) to provide guidance to the Department \n                        of State on questions that may arise;\n            (8) train staff to support design excellence through \n        education and training on program implementation to ensure \n        consistency and quality on all projects;\n            (9) perform post-occupancy evaluations to identify the \n        problems and successes of each facility;\n            (10) consider utilizing research studies from outside the \n        Department of State to bring new ideas and provide cost-\n        effective solutions;\n            (11) include fine arts advisors as part of the design \n        excellence program and peer review panels for all embassy \n        projects; and\n            (12) undertake a concurrent review of the Standard Embassy \n        Design Program (referred to in this section as the ``SED \n        Program'') to determine--\n                    (A) the best way to integrate the newly established \n                design excellence program with the SED Program; and\n                    (B) modifications that need to be made to the SED \n                Program.\n\nSEC. 5. ARCHITECTURAL ADVISORY BOARD.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall reestablish the Architectural \nAdvisory Board (referred to in this section as the ``Board'') in order \nto--\n            (1) advise the Department of State on design standards;\n            (2) recommend the most appropriate style of architecture \n        for prospective projects;\n            (3) review the quality and fitness of designs;\n            (4) advise on an appropriate balance and integration \n        between security priorities and American values of openness and \n        design;\n            (5) advise how the Department can construct new diplomatic \n        and consular facilities that are built to the most up-to-date \n        energy efficiency requirements, standards, checklists, or \n        rating systems, to the extent possible;\n            (6) advise how the Department can place diplomatic and \n        consular facilities in urban and city center locations, to the \n        extent possible--\n                    (A) to permit greater accessibility to national \n                government institutions; and\n                    (B) to facilitate ease of access for local \n                residents; and\n            (7) advise how the Department can construct new diplomatic \n        and consular facilities with future, projected growth needs in \n        mind, including growth needs for other Federal agencies.\n    (b) Composition.--The Board shall be composed of 5 members \nappointed by the Secretary from outside the United States Government, \nwho are noted for their knowledge of, and experience with, architecture \nand design.\n    (c) Deadline for Appointments.--All members of the Board shall be \nappointed not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act.\n    (d) Meetings.--The Board shall meet not less frequently than \nsemiannually at the call of the Chairperson.\n    (e) Compensation.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n        members of the Board--\n                    (A) shall be paid compensation out of funds made \n                available for the purposes of this title at the daily \n                equivalent of the highest rate payable under section \n                5332 of title 5, United States Code, for each day \n                (including travel time) during which the member is \n                engaged in the actual performance of duties as a member \n                of the Board; and\n                    (B) while away from the member's home or regular \n                place of business on necessary travel in the actual \n                performance of duties as a member of the Board, shall \n                be paid per diem, travel, and transportation expenses \n                in the same manner as is provided under subchapter I of \n                chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code.\n            (2) Limitation.--A member of the Board may not be paid \n        compensation under paragraph (1)(B) for more than 90 days in \n        any calendar year.\n    (f) Exemption.--The Board shall be exempt from the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act (5 U.S.C.

MODIFIED SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC AND \n              CONSULAR FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress on Co-Location and Security Requirements.--It \nis the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) while assessing the necessity, security, and efficiency \n        of co-locating all United States Government personnel at a \n        single embassy site within a single foreign country, the \n        Secretary should consider placing United States Government \n        personnel at locations conducive to maximizing their use;\n            (2) while cost efficiency and security considerations may \n        justify the consolidation of multiple Federal departments and \n        agencies at a single location, such a determination should not \n        be made without taking into account other crucial policy \n        considerations;\n            (3) the Secretary should consider alternative location \n        arrangements that do not affect the strength and \n        appropriateness of security arrangements for United States \n        Government personnel;\n            (4) it is crucial that security standards remain uniformly \n        high in all locations hosting United States Government \n        personnel;\n            (5) the perimeter distance requirement under section \n        606(a)(3) of the Secure Embassy Construction and \n        Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (22 U.S.C. 4865(a)(3)) imposes a \n        uniform security standard for all diplomatic and consular \n        facilities regardless of country context or specific security \n        needs;\n            (6) a more nuanced approach may tailor specific security \n        requirements, such as perimeter distance requirements, to \n        particular security considerations in a given country; and\n            (7) while every country with diplomatic representation must \n        have a modern, secure, safe, and functional facility, it is \n        important to integrate security with the long-term impact on \n        the foreign policy objectives of the Department of State.\n    (b) Diplomatic and Consular Facilities Task Force.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of State should establish \n        the Diplomatic and Consular Facilities Task Force (referred to \n        in this section as the ``Task Force'')--\n                    (A) to review existing regulations, standards, and \n                procedures to implement paragraphs (2) and (3) of \n                section 606(a) of the Secure Embassy Construction and \n                Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (22 U.S.C. 4865(a)); and\n                    (B) to make appropriate recommendations to modify \n                or revoke the regulations, standards, and procedures \n                under such Act.\n            (2) Composition.--The Task Force shall be composed of 7 \n        members, of whom--\n                    (A) 4 shall be senior career professionals of the \n                Department of State with different personnel \n                backgrounds; and\n                    (B) 3 shall be professionals outside the United \n                States Government who are noted for their knowledge and \n                experience in construction and security issues.\n            (3) Deadline for appointments.--All members of the Task \n        Force shall be appointed not later than 60 days after the date \n        of the enactment of this Act.\n            (4) Exemption.--The Task Force shall be exempt from the \n        Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).\n            (5) Termination.--The Task Force shall terminate on the \n        date on which the report is submitted to Congress under \n        subsection (c)(2).\n    (c) Reports.--\n            (1) Secretary of state.--Not later than 1 year after the \n        date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n        submit a report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n        Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n        Representatives that describes--\n                    (A) the recommendations made by the Task Force \n                under subsection (b)(1)(B); and\n                    (B) the impact of such recommendations on the \n                operations of, and security standards for, United \n                States diplomatic and consular facilities.\n            (2) Comptroller general.--Not later than 120 days after the \n        submission of the report under paragraph (1), the Comptroller \n        General of the United States shall submit a report to the \n        appropriate congressional committees that contains--\n                    (A) a review of, and comments on, the \n                recommendations made by the Task Force under subsection \n                (b)(1)(B); and\n                    (B) the Comptroller General's recommendations for \n                improving the security standards at all United States \n                diplomatic and consular facilities."
