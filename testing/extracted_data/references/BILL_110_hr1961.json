FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration, in 2007 the average annual temperature in the \n        United States and around the global is approximately 1.0 degree \n        Fahrenheit warmer than at the start of the 20th century, and \n        the rate of warming has accelerated during the past 30 years, \n        increasing globally since the mid-1970s. The fourth assessment \n        report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has \n        predicted that the Earth will warm 0.72 degrees Fahrenheit \n        during the next 2 decades with current emission trends.\n            (2) The annual national security strategy report submitted \n        pursuant to section 108 of the National Security Act of 1947 \n        (50 U.S.C. 404a) for 2006 states that the United States faces \n        new security challenges, including ``environmental destruction, \n        whether caused by human behavior or cataclysmic mega-disasters \n        such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or tsunamis. Problems \n        of this scope may overwhelm the capacity of local authorities \n        to respond, and may even overtax national militaries, requiring \n        a larger international response. These challenges are not \n        traditional national security concerns, such as the conflict of \n        arms or ideologies. But if left unaddressed they can threaten \n        national security.''.\n            (3) According to the fourth assessment report of the \n        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, average temperature \n        increases of between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius over preindustrial \n        levels are projected to cause the sea level to rise by between \n        2 and 4 meters by 2100 due to melting of the Greenland and \n        Antarctic ice sheets.\n            (4) In 2007, more than 200,000,000 people live in coastal \n        floodplains around the world and 2,000,000 square kilometers of \n        land and an estimated $1,000,000,000,000 worth of assets are \n        less than a 1-meter elevation above sea level.\n            (5) An estimated 1,700,000,000 people in the world live in \n        areas where water is scarce and in 25 years that population is \n        projected to increase to 5,400,000,000. Climate change will \n        impact the hydrological cycle and change the location, time of \n        year, and intensity of water availability.\n            (6) The report of the World Health Organization entitled \n        ``The World Health Report 2002: Reducing Risks and Promoting \n        Healthy Life'' states that ``Effects of climate change on human \n        health can be expected to be mediated through complex \n        interactions of physical, ecological, and social factors. These \n        effects will undoubtedly have a greater impact on societies or \n        individuals with scarce resources, where technologies are \n        lacking, and where infrastructure and institutions (such as the \n        health sector) are least able to adapt.''.\n            (7) Environmental changes relating to global climate change \n        represent a potentially significant threat multiplier for \n        instability around the world as changing precipitation patterns \n        may exacerbate competition and conflict over agricultural, \n        vegetative, and water resources and displace people, thus \n        increasing hunger and poverty and causing increased pressure on \n        fragile countries.\n            (8) The strategic, social, political, and economic \n        consequences of global climate change are likely to have a \n        greater adverse effect on less developed countries with fewer \n        resources and infrastructures that are less able to adjust to \n        new economic and social pressures, and where the margin for \n        governance and survival is thin.\n            (9) The consequences of global climate change represent a \n        clear and present danger to the security and economy of the \n        United States.\n            (10) A failure to recognize, plan for, and mitigate the \n        strategic, social, political, and economic effects of a \n        changing climate will have an adverse impact on the national \n        security interests of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
