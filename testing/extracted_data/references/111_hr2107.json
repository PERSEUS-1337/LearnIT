Professional education.\nSec. 7. Targeted education grants.\nSec. 8. Authorization of appropriations.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Every 10 minutes, another child or adult is expected to \n        die from leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma. Leukemia, lymphoma, and \n        myeloma caused the deaths of an estimated 52,910 people in the \n        United States in 2007 and accounted for nearly 9.4 percent of \n        the deaths from cancer in 2008. In addition, leukemia causes \n        more deaths than any other cancer among children and young \n        adults under the age of 20.\n            (2) As many as 16,000 leukemia patients diagnosed each year \n        require a bone marrow transplant but have no matched relative \n        or cannot find a match in the national bone marrow registry. \n        There is a 1 in 4 chance that an newborn baby's cord blood \n        cells would be a perfect match to a sibling that suffers from 1 \n        of 70 blood diseases.\n            (3) Umbilical cord blood stem cells (in this Act referred \n        to as ``cord blood cells'') have effectively been used in the \n        treatment of these conditions. To date, cord blood cells have \n        been used in more than 14,000 transplants worldwide during the \n        last 20 years.\n            (4) Cord blood cells, like marrow and blood, is a rich \n        source of stem cells for allogeneic transplantation, especially \n        for children. Cord blood cells used in transplant result in a \n        lower rate of graft versus host disease than bone marrow and \n        are easier to match based on HLA typing. In addition, cord \n        blood cells have also been used to treat effectively \n        nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders such as \n        aplastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, severe combined \n        immunodeficiencies, and leukodystrophies.\n            (5) Researchers have found that in addition to blood cell \n        precursors, cord blood cells contains many different types of \n        stem cells--the building blocks of bones, the heart, liver, and \n        nervous system. Further, cord blood cells have proven to be \n        pluripotent, which means they have the ability to differentiate \n        into every cell type in the human body. Cord blood cells have \n        also been shown decrease inflammation and stimulate tissue \n        repair.\n            (6) Clinical research and experimental clinical use is \n        underway to study the use of autologous cord blood cells to \n        treat type 1 diabetes, brain injury, and cerebral palsy. In \n        addition, preclinical research using cord blood cells is \n        showing promise in treating hearing loss, renal failure, spinal \n        cord injury, and congenital heart valve defects.\n            (7) Of the more than 4,000,000 births in the United States \n        each year, more than 90 percent of the cord blood cells are \n        discarded as medical waste. Currently, less than one quarter of \n        the States requires that expectant parents receive information \n        regarding their options to bank their baby's cord blood in \n        public or private blood banks.\n            (8) In 2005, the Institute of Medicine submitted a report \n        to Congress entitled ``Establishing National Hematopoietic Stem \n        Cell Bank Program'', and recommended that ``donors must be \n        provided with clear information about their options'', for cord \n        blood cells and that ``the information provided to a donor must \n        include a balanced perspective on the different options for \n        banking'' cord blood cells. The Institute also recommended that \n        ``informed consent for the collection storage and use of cord \n        blood should be obtained before labor and delivery, and after \n        the adequate disclosure of information.''.\n\nSEC. 3. PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN.\n\n    Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Secretary'') shall develop and make publicly available, including \nby posting on the public website of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, a publication relating to umbilical cord blood that includes \nthe following information:\n            (1) An explanation of the potential value and uses of \n        umbilical cord blood, including cord blood cells and stem \n        cells, for individuals who are, as well as individuals who are \n        not, biologically related to a mother or her newborn child.\n            (2) An explanation of the differences between using one's \n        own cord blood cells (autologous) and using related or \n        unrelated cord blood stem cells (allogeneic use) in the \n        treatment of disease.\n            (3) An explanation of the differences between public and \n        private umbilical cord blood banking.\n            (4) The options available to a mother relating to stem \n        cells that are contained in the umbilical cord blood after the \n        delivery of her newborn, including--\n                    (A) donating the stem cells to a public umbilical \n                cord blood bank (where facilities are available);\n                    (B) storing the stem cells in a private family \n                umbilical cord blood bank for use by immediate and \n                extended family members;\n                    (C) storing the stem cells for immediate or \n                extended family members through a family or sibling \n                donor banking program that provides free collection, \n                processing, and storage where there is an existing \n                medical need; and\n                    (D) discarding the stem cells.\n            (5) The medical processes involved in the collection of \n        cord blood.\n            (6) Medical or family history criteria that can impact a \n        family's consideration of umbilical cord blood banking, \n        including the likelihood of using a baby's cord blood to serve \n        as a match for a family member who has a medical condition.\n            (7) Options for ownership and future use of donated \n        umbilical cord blood.\n            (8) The average cost of public and private umbilical cord \n        blood banking.\n            (9) The availability of public and private cord blood \n        banks, including--\n                    (A) a list of public cord blood banks within the \n                United States and the hospitals served by such banks;\n                    (B) a list of private cord blood banks that are \n                accredited, as determined by the Secretary; and\n                    (C) the availability of free family banking and \n                sibling donor programs where there is an existing \n                medical need by a family member.\n            (10) An explanation of which racial and ethnic groups are \n        in particular need of publicly donated cord blood samples based \n        upon medical data developed by the Health Resources and \n        Services Administration.\n\nSEC. 4.
