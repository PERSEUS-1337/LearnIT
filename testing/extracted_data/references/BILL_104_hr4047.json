modifications described in paragraph (2) within the period \n        specified in such paragraph, the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services shall make the modifications described in such \n        paragraph and such revised regulation incorporating the \n        modifications shall be considered to be the appropriate \n        Regulation for the purposes of such section.\n            (4)

  section, but\n                            (ii) having a legislature which is not \n                        scheduled to meet in 1998 in a legislative \n                        session in which such
