DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n    The Congress declares that the following is the policy of the \nUnited States:\n            (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n        based on trust, mutual respect, open communications, bilateral \n        and consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. \n        Labor-management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of \n        both parties to best serve the interests of the public, \n        operating as a team to carry out the public safety mission in a \n        quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it is \n        the union that provides the institutional stability as elected \n        leaders and appointees come and go.\n            (2) The health and safety of the Nation and the best \n        interest of public safety employers and employees can be best \n        protected by the settlement of issues through the processes of \n        collective bargaining.\n            (3) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n        mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n        employers and the representatives of their employees to reach \n        and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and \n        working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n        negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement \n        reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as may \n        be provided for in any applicable agreement for the settlement \n        of disputes.\n            (4) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n        safety employers and employees has implications for the \n        security of employees and can affect interstate and intrastate \n        commerce. Additionally, the lack of such labor-management \n        cooperation detrimentally impacts the upgrading of police and \n        fire services of local communities, the health and well-being \n        of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire and \n        police departments. These factors could have significant \n        commercial repercussions. Moreover, providing minimal standards \n        for collective bargaining negotiations in the public safety \n        industry will prevent industrial strife between labor and \n        management that interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\nSEC. 3.
