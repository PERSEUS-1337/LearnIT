(Non-designated products may be assigned to the \n        contractor for salvage.) A roadside sale is a completely \n        separate transaction from the awarding of the stewardship \n        contract itself.\n            (8) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Agriculture.\n            (9) Statement of work contract.--The term ``statement of \n        work contract'' is used to describe contracts in which the \n        contracting entity gives a general overview of the project, and \n        the bidding contractor provides the specifics on how he/she \n        envisions the project and the end result he/she would obtain \n        using his/her particular approach to land stewardship.\n            (10) Stewardship contract.--The term ``stewardship \n        contract'' means a contract for carrying out resource \n        activities for the improvement and restoration of forest \n        ecosystems of units of the National Forest System and to \n        encourage or enhance the economic sustainability and the \n        viability of rural and regional communities. A stewardship \n        contract could use a design specification format (definition 2, \n        above), a performance specification format (definition 4, \n        above), a statement of work format (definition 9, above), or \n        some combination thereof.\n\nSEC. 3. USE OF STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTS.\n\n    (a) Use Authorized.--The Secretary shall establish and implement in \nthe Forest Service a demonstration program through which forest- and/or \ndistrict-level resource managers use stewardship contracts to carry out \nresource activities in a comprehensive manner to restore and preserve \nthe ecological integrity and productivity of forest ecosystems within \nthe National Forest System and to encourage or enhance the economic \nsustainability and the viability of nearby rural communities. The \nresource activities undertaken should be consistent with the precepts \nof ecosystem management and with the forest's management plan for \nachieving the desired future conditions of the area being treated.\n    (b) Use Limited.--Within the limits of available financial \nresources, each forest within the National Forest System may use \nstewardship contracts to carry out ecosystem management projects, if \nthose contracts:\n            (1) Provide for payment to the contractor based on the \n        number of acres satisfactorily treated in accordance with an \n        approved plan to create a desired future condition on the land.\n            (2) Are used for projects where the harvest of timber is \n        secondary to creating specific resource conditions (e.g., \n        wildlife habitat enhancement, watershed improvement, insect and \n        disease control).\n            (3) Are not used for projects involving the construction of \n        new permanent roads or entries into roadless areas.\n            (4) Will result in the removal of no more than 300,000 \n        board feet of merchantable timber per project.\n            (5) Provide for the roadside sale of all contract-\n        designated merchantable timber which is extracted.\n            (6) Are awarded competitively to qualified contractors with \n        no more than 25 employees.\n            (7) Include stewardship skill and experience qualification \n        requirements which have been established by the local Forest \n        Stewardship Council and approved by the Forest Service.\n            (8) Are monitored not only by the Forest Service, but also \n        by the local Forest Stewardship Council.\n            (9) Provide for periodic progress payments to contractors \n        based on successful completion of contract activities on a per \n        acre basis. The acceptability of the contractor's work shall be \n        determined by the Forest Service, taking into account the \n        recommendation of the local Forest Stewardship Council.\n    (c) Demonstration Research Objectives.--The Secretary shall insure \nthat in the carrying out of the provisions of this Act enough \nflexibility is provided to resource managers to enable them to test \nvarious approaches to solving questions left unresolved in previous \ndemonstrations of stewardship and end results contracts authorized in \nfiscal year 1991 and 1992 through the Department of the Interior and \nRelated Appropriation Acts. These questions include, but are not \nlimited to:\n            (1) The need for the bonding of stewardship contractors \n        and/or possible alternatives which could reduce the financial \n        burden on small businesses.\n            (2) Preferred methods of marketing timber or other products \n        of the forest removed as a result of stewardship contract \n        activities.\n            (3) The standards to be used in evaluating the quality and \n        acceptability of the work performed by a stewardship \n        contractor.\n            (4) The desirability of multi-year contracts for \n        stewardship projects.\n            (5) The relative merits of using design specifications, \n        performance specifications, or statements of work in offering, \n        awarding, and evaluating stewardship contracts.\n            (6) The costs, benefits, problems, and opportunities \n        resulting from increased community involvement in the design \n        and monitoring of stewardship contracts.\n            (7) The benefits and problems resulting from restricting \n        stewardship contracts to very small (no more than 25 employees) \n        contractors.\n            (8) The extent to which local economic sustainability and \n        rural community viability are affected by the use of \n        stewardship contracts.\n            (9) The difference between estimated and actual revenues \n        derived from roadside sales of timber.\n            (10) The level of utilization of timber and other products \n        of the forest derived from stewardship contract projects as \n        compared with conventional timber sales.\n            (11) The extent to which stewardship contracting \n        contributes to the achievement of forest ecosystem management \n        plans.\n            (12) The extent to which the revenues from stewardship \n        contracts cover the cost of such contracts or are offset by the \n        costs which could reasonably be expected to result if the \n        contracts are not carried out (e.g., fire suppression costs in \n        areas with heavy fuel loads).\n            (13) The administrative costs or savings involved in the \n        use of stewardship contracts.\n            (14) The benefits and/or disadvantages of using local \n        Forest Stewardship Councils as part of the stewardship \n        contracting process.\n            (15) The benefits and/or disadvantages of various methods \n        of selecting members, organizing, administering, and conducting \n        the business of local Forest Stewardship Councils.\n    (d) Development and Use of Contracts.--Each resource manager of a \nunit of the National Forest System may enter into stewardship contracts \nwith qualified non-Federal entities (as established in regulations \nrelating to procurement by the Federal Government or as determined by \nthe Secretary.) The local Forest Stewardship Council, in cooperation \nwith the Forest Service resource manager, shall select the type of \nstewardship contract that is most suitable to local conditions. \nContracts should clearly describe the desired future condition for each \nresource managed under the contract and the evaluation criteria to be \nused to determine acceptable performance. The length of a stewardship \ncontract shall be consistent with the requirements of section 14 of the \nNational Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a).\n    (e) Selection of Areas for Contracts.--In selecting areas within \nunits of the National Forest System to be subject to stewardship \ncontracts, the Secretary, resource managers, and local Forest \nStewardship Councils shall base the selection on the need to improve \nforest health, maintain and improve soil and water quality, and improve \nfisheries and wildlife habitat. Priorities for activities within \nindividual units will be established by local resource managers, in \nconsultation with the appropriate local Forest Stewardship Council.\n    (f) Establishment of Local Forest Stewardship Councils.--Local \nForest Stewardship Councils shall be established for each unit of the \nNational Forest System which offers stewardship contracts. The role of \na Forest Stewardship Council will be to, in cooperation with the \nresource managers, prioritize and select stewardship projects, set \noperational goals in the context of current national forest management \npolicies and local forest plans, evaluate contractor performance and \naccomplishments, recommend progress payments for work successfully \ncompleted by contractors, and make recommendations for the improvement \nof the stewardship contract process. Each participating National Forest \nSystem unit shall establish, after soliciting the comments of local \ncitizens, the size of the local council, the method of selection or \nelection of council members, the terms of service of members, and the \ncouncil administrative budget, if any. At least 51 percent of members \nof any Forest Stewardship Council shall be drawn from the private \nsector, in a manner which insures representation of a broad range of \npublic interests. The functioning of the Forest Stewardship Councils \nmust assure a continuing and open process and must in no way interfere \nwith the broad public involvement in Federal resource management \ndecision making required under the National Environmental Policy Act of \n1976.\n    (g) Application of Contracts.--Subject to subsection (h), the \nrevenue received from the sale of timber or any other products of the \nforest resulting to the Federal Government as a result of work carried \nout under a stewardship contract shall be deposited into a Stewardship \nAccount as established in section 4(a).\n    (h) Effect on Other Revenue Requirements.--Twenty-five percent of \nthe revenues received from roadside sale of products extracted through \nstewardship contract activities shall remain available for payments to \nStates, as required under the Act of May 23, 1908, and section 13 of \nthe Act of March 1, 1991 (16 U.S.C. 500). The Secretary shall first \ncollect revenues to make such payments before exercising the authority \nprovided in subsection g.\n\nSEC. 4. STEWARDSHIP CONTRACT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES.\n\n    (a) Receipts.--Monetary receipts received as payment for contract-\ndesignated timber and other products of the forest extracted through \nstewardship contract activities shall be deposited in a designated fund \nto be known as the ``Stewardship Account''. Amounts in the Account \nshall be used to make payments to States under the Act of May 23, 1908, \nand section 13 of the Act of March 1, 1911 (16 U.S.C. 500), and to fund \nresource activities. Amounts in the Account are hereby appropriated and \nshall be available to the Secretary until expended, except that those \namounts found by the Secretary to be in excess of the needs of the \nSecretary shall be transferred to miscellaneous receipts in the \nTreasury of the United States. Any additional revenues made available \nthrough direct appropriations to the Forest Service for stewardship \ncontracting and ecosystem management purposes also shall be deposited \nin the Account.\n    (b) Expenditures.--Not less than 80 percent of amounts in the \nAccount available for resource activities shall be used for the direct \ncosts of such resource activities. The revenues received from sales of \ncontract-designated products resulting from stewardship contracts shall \nbe returned to the national forest from which they were generated, to \nbe used to fund additional stewardship contracts. To the extent that \nadditional revenues are received in the Account from direct \nappropriations by the Congress of funds for stewardship contract \nactivities, such funds shall be made available to those forest units \nusing stewardship contracts through a process to be developed by the \nSecretary.\n    (c) Reporting.--As part of the annual report of the Secretary to \nCongress, the Secretary shall include an accounting of revenues, \nexpenditures, and accomplishments related to the stewardship contracts.\n\nSEC. 5. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS.\n\n    All stewardship contracts shall comply with existing applicable \nlaws, and nothing in this Act may be construed as modifying the \nprovisions of any other law except as explicitly provided in this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act shall be effective upon passage.\n\nSEC. 7. TERMINATION DATE.\n\n    Unless extended by a subsequent act of the Congress, this Act shall \nterminate five years from its effective date."
