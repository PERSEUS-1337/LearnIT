FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a devastating neurologic \n        disease leading to blindness and paralysis.\n            (2) There are an estimated 11,000 patients with NMO in the \n        United States.\n            (3) Women are affected 7 to 9 times more than men, and a \n        large proportion of NMO patients are African-American.\n            (4) The average age at diagnosis is 41 years, but the range \n        is broad and includes children as young as 2 years of age and \n        adults as old as 89 years of age.\n            (5) NMO incurs substantial costs for affected patients and \n        their families.\n            (6) The cause of NMO is unknown, but it is hypothesized to \n        be autoimmune in nature.\n            (7) More than 90 percent of NMO patients will suffer \n        recurrent disease and accumulate neurologic disability.\n            (8) Because of their relatively low overall incidence, \n        orphan diseases like NMO frequently do not receive sufficient \n        attention and research funding.\n            (9) No single institution has a sufficient number of \n        patients to independently conduct research that will adequately \n        address the cause of NMO.\n            (10) There has been no comprehensive study analyzing all \n        relevant clinical, biological, and epidemiological aspects of \n        NMO to identify potential risk factors and biomarkers for NMO.\n            (11) We can apply our understanding of NMO to the study of \n        other autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and \n        systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that there is a need--\n            (1) to establish and coordinate a multicenter research \n        effort based on collaboration between regional consortia and \n        governmental and nongovernmental entities in order to--\n                    (A) comprehensively study the causes of NMO; and\n                    (B) identify potential biomarkers of disease \n                activity; and\n            (2) to encourage a collaborative effort among academic \n        medical centers with epidemiological study groups to gather \n        comprehensive and detailed information for each patient \n        enrolled in those groups, in order to investigate \n        environmental, nutritional, and genetic factors with respect \n        to, and the pathological and epidemiological characteristics \n        of, NMO.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA CONSORTIUM.\n\n    Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284 \net seq.) is amended by adding after section 409J the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 409K.
