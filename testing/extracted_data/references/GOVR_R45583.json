    "content": "Congress is composed of 541 individuals from the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico. Since 1789, 12,343 individuals have served as either Representatives (11,037 individuals) or as Senators (1,983 individuals). Of these individuals, 677 have served in both chambers. An additional 178 individuals have served in the House in the roles of territorial Delegates or Resident Commissioners. The following is a profile of the 116 th Congress (2019-2020). In the 116 th Congress, the current party alignments as of March 7, 2019, are as follows: House of Representatives: 239 Democrats (including 4 Delegates), 199 Republicans (including 1 Delegate and the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico), and 3 vacant seats. Senate: 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and 2 Independents, who both caucus with the Democrats. The average age at the beginning of the 116 th Congress was 57.6 years for Representatives and 62.9 years for Senators.  Table 1 shows the average ages at the beginning of the 116 th and three previous Congresses. The U.S. Constitution requires Representatives to be at least 25 years old when they take office. The youngest Representative in the 116 th Congress, and the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), born October 13, 1989, who was 29 at the beginning of the 116 th Congress.

The oldest Senator in the 116 th Congress is Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), born June 22, 1933, who was 85.  According to data on occupations in the CQ New Members Guide , in the 116 th Congress law ties with public service/politics as the most commonly declared profession of Senators, followed by business; for Representatives, public service/politics is first, closely followed by business, then law.  Table 2 uses data from the CQ Member Profiles to present the occupational categories most frequently listed as prior careers of Members of the 116 th Congress.

Egar and Amber Hope Wilhelm. Ninety-seven percent of the Members of the 116 th Congress report an affiliation with a specific religion. Statistics gathered by the Pew Research Center on Religion and Public Life, which studies the religious affiliation of Representatives and Senators, and CQ at the beginning of the 116 th Congress showed the following: 54.9% of Members (233 in the House, 60 in the Senate) are Protestant, with Baptist as the most represented denomination, followed by Methodist; 30.5% of Members (141 in the House, 22 in the Senate) are Catholic; 6.4% of Members (26 in the House, 8 in the Senate) are Jewish; 1.9% of Members (6 in the House, 4 in the Senate) are Mormon (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints); 2 Members (1 in the House, 1 in the Senate) are Buddhist, 3 Representatives are Muslim, and 3 Representatives are Hindu; and other religious affiliations represented include Greek Orthodox, Pentecostal Christian, Unitarian Universalist, and Adventist. A record 131 women Members (24.2% of the total membership) serve in the 116 th Congress, 22 more than at the beginning of the 115 th Congress. One hundred six women, including 3 Delegates as well as the Resident Commissioner, serve in the House and 25 in the Senate. Of the 106 women in the House, 91 are Democrats, including 2 of the Delegates, and 15 are Republicans, including 1 Delegate as well as the Resident Commissioner. Of the 25 women in the Senate, 17 are Democrats and 8 are Republicans.  By comparison, approximately 35 years ago in the 99 th Congress (1985-1986), 23 women served in the House, and 2 in the Senate. Approximately 45 years ago, in the 94 th Congress (1975-1976), there were 19 women in the House, and none in the Senate. There are a record 58 African American Members (10.7% of the total membership) in the 116 th Congress, 6 more than at the beginning of the 115 th Congress. Fifty-five serve in the House, including two Delegates, and three serve in the Senate. This number includes one Representative, as well as one Senator, who are of African American and Asian ancestry, and two Representatives who are of African American and Hispanic ancestry. In this report, each of these four Members is counted as belonging to two ethnic groups. Fifty-four of the African American House Members, including two Delegates, are Democrats, and one is a Republican. Two of the Senators are Democrats and one is Republican. Twenty-four African American women, including two Delegates, serve in the House, and one serves in the Senate.  By comparison, approximately 35 years ago in the 99 th Congress (1985-1986), 21 African American Members served in the House, and none in the Senate. About 60 years ago, in the 87 th Congress (1961-1962), there were 4 African American Members of Congress, all serving in the House. There are 50 Hispanic or Latino Members in the 116 th Congress, 9.2% of the total membership and a record number. Forty-five serve in the House, including two delegates and the Resident Commissioner, and 5 in the Senate. These numbers include two House Members who are also of Asian descent, and two House Members also of African ancestry; these Members are counted in both ethnic categories in this report. Of the Members of the House, 37 are Democrats (including 2 Delegates) and 8 are Republicans (including the Resident Commissioner). Fourteen are women, including the Resident Commissioner. Of the five Hispanic Senators (three Republicans, two Democrats), one is a woman. By comparison, approximately 35 years ago in the 99 th Congress (1985-1986), 14 Hispanic or Latino Members served in Congress. All 14 were male Members of the House.  A record 20 Members of the 116 th Congress (3.8% of the total membership) are of Asian, South Asian, or Pacific Islander ancestry. Seventeen of them (16 Democrats, 1 Republican) serve in the House, and 3 (all Democrats) serve in the Senate. These numbers include one House Member and one Senator who are also of African American ancestry, and another House Member of Hispanic ancestry; these Members are counted in both ethnic categories in this report. Of those serving in the House, three are Delegates. Ten of the Asian, Pacific Islander, or South Asian American Members are female: seven in the House, and all three in the Senate. By comparison, approximately 35 years ago in the 99 th Congress (1985-1986), there were five Asian/Pacific Islander Americans in the House, and two in the Senate.  There are four American Indian (Native American) Members of the 116 th Congress; two of each party, all in the House. This is two more than in the 115 th Congress, and a record number. Twenty-four Representatives and five Senators (5.3% of the 116 th Congress) were born outside the United States. Their places of birth include Canada, Cuba, Ecuador, Germany, Japan, Peru, and India. Some of these Members were born to American citizens working or serving abroad. The U.S. Constitution requires that Representatives be citizens for seven years and Senators be citizens for nine years before they take office. At the beginning of the 116 th Congress, there were 96 individuals (17.8% of the total membership) who had served or were serving in the military, 6 fewer than at the beginning of the 115 th Congress (102 Members). According to lists compiled by CQ , the House as of January 2019 had 78 veterans (including 4 female Members, as well as 1 Delegate); the Senate had 18 veterans, including 3 women. These Members served in the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and combat or peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo, as well as during times of peace. Eight House Members and one Senator are still serving in the reserves, and seven House Members are still serving in the National Guard. Four of the seven female veterans are combat veterans. The number of veterans in the 116 th Congress reflects the trend of steady decline in recent decades in the number of Members who have served in the military. For example, 64% of the Members of the 97 th Congress (1981-1982) were veterans, and in the 92 nd Congress (1971-1972), 73% of the Members were veterans.
