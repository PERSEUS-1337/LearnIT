    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) All citizens should be able to make their voices heard in the political process and hold their elected officials accountable.\n(b) Elections for local or state elective office should be fair, open, and competitive.\n(c) The increasing costs of political campaigns can force candidates to rely on large contributions from wealthy donors and special interests, which can give those wealthy donors and special interests disproportionate influence over governmental decisions.\n(d) Such disproportionate influence can undermine the public\u2019s trust that public officials are performing their duties in an impartial manner and that government is serving the needs and responding to the wishes of all citizens equally, without regard to their wealth.\n(e) Special interests contribute more to incumbents than challengers because they seek access to elected officials, and such contributions account for a large portion of the financial incumbency advantage, as confirmed by recent studies such as those published in the Journal of Politics in 2014 and Political Research Quarterly in 2016.\n(f) Citizen-funded election programs, in which qualified candidates can receive public funds for the purpose of communicating with voters rather than relying exclusively on private donors, have been enacted in six charter cities in California, as well as numerous other local and state jurisdictions.\n(g) Citizen-funded election programs encourage competition by reducing the financial advantages of incumbency and making it possible for citizens from all walks of life, not only those with connections to wealthy donors or special interests, to run for office, as confirmed by recent studies such as those published in State Politics and Policy Quarterly in 2008, and by the Campaign Finance Institute in 2015 and the National Institute of Money in State Politics in 2016.\n(h) By reducing reliance on wealthy donors and special interests, citizen-funded election programs inhibit improper practices, protect against corruption or the appearance of corruption, and protect the political integrity of our governmental institutions.\n(i) In Johnson v. Bradley (1992) 4 Cal.4th 389, the California Supreme Court commented that \u201cit seems obvious that public money reduces rather than increases the fund raising pressures on public office seekers and thereby reduces the undue influence of special interest groups.\u201d\n(j) In Buckley v. Valeo (1976) 424 U.S. 1, the United States Supreme Court recognized that \u201cpublic financing as a means of eliminating the improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest.\u201d\n(k) In Arizona Free Enterprise v. Bennett (2011) 564 U.S. 721, the United States Supreme Court acknowledged that public financing of elections \u201ccan further \u2018significant governmental interest[s]\u2019 such as the state interest in preventing corruption,\u201d quoting Buckley v. Valeo.\n(l) In Buckley v. Valeo, the United States Supreme Court further noted that citizen-funded elections programs \u201cfacilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a self-governing people.\u201d\n(m) The absolute prohibition on public campaign financing allows special interests to gain disproportionate influence and unfairly favors incumbents. An exception should be created to permit citizen-funded election programs so that elections may be conducted more fairly.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 85300 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n85300.\n(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), a public officer shall not expend, and a candidate shall not accept, any public moneys for the purpose of seeking elective office.\n(b) A public officer or candidate may expend or accept public moneys for the purpose of seeking elective office if the state or a local governmental entity establishes a dedicated fund for this purpose by statute, ordinance, resolution, or charter, and both of the following are true:\n(1) Public moneys held in the fund are available to all qualified, voluntarily participating candidates for the same office without regard to incumbency or political party preference.\n(2) The state or local governmental entity has established criteria for determining a candidate\u2019s qualification by statute, ordinance, resolution, or charter.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 89519.5 is added to the Government Code, to read:\n89519.5.\n(a) An officeholder who is convicted of a felony enumerated in Section 20 of the Elections Code, and whose conviction has become final, shall use funds held by the officeholder\u2019s candidate controlled committee only for the following purposes:\n(1) The payment of outstanding campaign debts or elected officer\u2019s expenses.\n(2) The repayment of contributions.\n(b) Six months after the conviction becomes final, the officeholder shall forfeit any remaining funds subject to subdivision (a), and these funds shall be deposited in the General Fund.\n(c) This section does not apply to funds held by a ballot measure committee or in a legal defense fund formed pursuant to Section 85304.\nSEC. 4.\nThe provisions of this bill are severable. If any provision of this bill or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.\nSEC. 5.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution.\nSEC. 6.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that this bill furthers the purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 81012 of the Government Code."
