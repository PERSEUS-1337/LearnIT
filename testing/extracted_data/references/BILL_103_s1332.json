FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Public Law 99-590 authorized the study of 2 segments of \n        the West Branch of the Farmington River, including an 11-mile \n        headwater segment in Massachusetts and the uppermost 14-mile \n        segment in Connecticut, for potential inclusion in the wild and \n        scenic rivers system, and created the Farmington River Study \n        Committee, consisting of representatives from the 2 States, the \n        towns bordering the 2 segments, and other river interests, to \n        advise the Secretary of the Interior in conducting the study \n        and concerning management alternatives should the river be \n        included in the wild and scenic rivers system;\n            (2) the study determined that both segments of the river \n        are eligible for inclusion in the wild and scenic rivers system \n        based upon their free-flowing condition and outstanding \n        fisheries, recreation, wildlife, and historic values;\n            (3) the towns that directly abut the Connecticut segment \n        (Hartland, Barkhamsted, New Hartford, and Canton), as well as \n        the town of Colebrook, which abuts the major tributary of the \n        segment, have demonstrated their desire for national wild and \n        scenic river designation through town meeting actions endorsing \n        designation;\n            (4) the 4 abutting towns have demonstrated their commitment \n        to protect the river through the adoption of river protection \n        overlay districts, which establish a uniform setback for new \n        structures, new septic systems, sand and gravel extraction, and \n        vegetation removal along the entire length of the Connecticut \n        segment;\n            (5) during the study, the Farmington River Study Committee \n        and the National Park Service prepared a comprehensive \n        management plan for the Connecticut segment, the Upper \n        Farmington River Management Plan, dated April 29, 1993, which \n        establishes objectives, standards, and action programs that \n        will ensure long-term protection of the outstanding values of \n        the river and compatible management of the land and water \n        resources of the river; and\n            (6) the Farmington River Study Committee voted unanimously \n        on April 29, 1993, to adopt the Upper Farmington River \n        Management Plan and to recommend that Congress include the \n        Connecticut segment in the wild and scenic rivers system in \n        accordance with the spirit and provisions of the Upper \n        Farmington River Management Plan, and to recommend that, in the \n        absence of town votes supporting designation, no action be \n        taken regarding wild and scenic river designation of the \n        Massachusetts segment.\n\nSEC. 3. WILD, SCENIC, AND RECREATIONAL RIVER DESIGNATION.\n\n    Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1274(a)) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(  ) Farmington River, Connecticut.--\n            ``(A) Designation and management.--The 14-mile segment of \n        the West Branch and mainstem extending from immediately below \n        the Goodwin Dam and Hydroelectric Project in Hartland, \n        Connecticut, to the downstream end of the New Hartford-Canton, \n        Connecticut, town line (referred to in this paragraph as the \n        `segment'), to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior \n        in cooperation with the Farmington River Coordinating Committee \n        established under paragraph (B) as a recreational river. The \n        segment shall be managed in accordance with the Upper \n        Farmington River Management Plan, dated April 29, 1993, adopted \n        on April 29, 1993 by the Farmington River Study Committee \n        (referred to in this paragraph as the `Plan'). The Plan shall \n        be deemed to satisfy the requirement for a comprehensive \n        management plan pursuant to section 3(d) of this Act.\n            ``(B) Management committee.--Not later than 90 days after \n        the date of enactment of this paragraph, there shall be \n        established a Farmington River Coordinating Committee to assist \n        in the long-term protection of the segment and the \n        implementation of this paragraph and the Plan. The membership, \n        functions, responsibilities, and administrative procedures of \n        the Committee shall be as set forth in the Plan. The Committee \n        shall not be a Federal advisory committee, and shall not be \n        subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act \n        (5 U.S.C. App.).\n            ``(C) Federal role.--(i) The Director of the National Park \n        Service (referred to in this paragraph as the `Director') shall \n        represent the Secretary in the implementation of the Plan and \n        the provisions of this Act with respect to the segment \n        designated by this paragraph, including the review of proposed \n        federally assisted water resources projects that could have a \n        direct and adverse effect on the values for which the segment \n        was established, as authorized under section 7(a) of this Act.\n            ``(ii) Pursuant to sections 10(e) and 11(b)(1) of this Act, \n        the Director may enter into cooperative agreements with the \n        State of Connecticut, the towns of Colebrook, Hartland, \n        Barkhamsted, New Hartford, and Canton, Connecticut, and the \n        Committee. Such cooperative agreements shall be consistent with \n        the Plan and may include provisions for financial or other \n        assistance from the United States to facilitate the long-term \n        protection, conservation, and enhancement of the segment.\n            ``(iii) The Director may provide technical assistance, \n        staff support, and funding to assist in the implementation of \n        the Plan.\n            ``(iv) Notwithstanding section 10(c) of this Act, no \n        portion of the segment designated by this paragraph shall \n        become a part of the National Park System nor shall it be \n        subject to regulations that govern the National Park System.\n            ``(D) Water resources projects.--(i) In determining whether \n        a proposed water resources project would have a direct and \n        adverse effect on the values for which the segment designated \n        by this paragraph was included in the national wild and scenic \n        rivers system, the Secretary shall specifically consider the \n        extent to which the project is consistent with the Plan.\n            ``(ii) Congress finds that the existing operation of the \n        Colebrook Dam and Goodwin Dam hydroelectric facilities, \n        together with associated transmission lines and other existing \n        project works, pursuant to licenses or exemptions granted under \n        the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.) and in effect on \n        the date of enactment of this paragraph, is not incompatible \n        with the designation of the segment referred to in subparagraph \n        (A) as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers \n        system, and will not have a direct and adverse effect on, nor \n        unreasonably diminish, the values for which the segment was \n        established. Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the \n        contrary, the designation of the river shall not affect the \n        ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to license \n        or relicense (including exempting from licensing) the continued \n        operation of the Colebrook Dam and Goodwin Dam hydroelectric \n        projects, together with associated transmission lines and other \n        project works if such operation is consistent with the Plan.\n            ``(iii) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the \n        contrary, inclusion of the segment designated by this paragraph \n        in the wild and scenic rivers system shall not impair the \n        continued operation of the Colebrook Dam and Reservoir by the \n        United States Army Corps of Engineers for the purpose of flood \n        control.\n            ``(iv) The Plan, including the detailed analysis of \n        instream flow needs incorporated in the Plan and such \n        additional analysis as may be incorporated in the future, shall \n        serve as the primary source of information regarding the flows \n        needed to maintain instream resources and the potential \n        compatibility between resource protection and possible water \n        supply withdrawals.\n            ``(E) Land management.--(i) The zoning ordinances adopted \n        by the towns of Hartland, Barkhamsted, New Hartford, and \n        Canton, Connecticut, including the `river protection overlay \n        districts' in effect on the date of enactment of this \n        paragraph, satisfy the standards and requirements of section \n        6(c) of this Act. For the purpose of section 6(c), such towns \n        shall be deemed `villages' and the provisions of that section, \n        which prohibit Federal acquisition of lands by condemnation, \n        shall apply.\n            ``(ii) Nothing in this Act shall authorize management by \n        the Federal Government of lands that are not owned by the \n        Federal Government.
