FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Department of State's Patterns of Global Terrorism \n        report for 2003 stated that ``Iran remained the most active \n        state sponsor of terrorism in 2003''.\n            (2) That report further stated that--\n                    (A) Iran continues to provide funding, safehaven, \n                training, and weapons to known terrorist groups, \n                including Hizballah, HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic \n                Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of \n                Palestine; and\n                    (B) the Government of Iran's poor human rights \n                record continues to worsen.\n            (3) In 1979, in response to the Islamic Revolution in Iran \n        and the holding of United States citizens as hostages in Iran, \n        the United States imposed economic sanctions against Iran that \n        prohibit virtually all trade and investment activities with \n        Iran by citizens of the United States or United States \n        companies.\n            (4) The United States does not prohibit foreign \n        subsidiaries of United States companies from investing in Iran \n        if the foreign subsidiary is independent of the United States \n        parent company.\n            (5) A number of subsidiaries of United States companies \n        appear to be taking advantage of this condition and are \n        investing in the energy sector in Iran through such \n        subsidiaries.\n            (6) According to the Energy Information Administration of \n        the Department of Energy, Iran is the second largest oil \n        producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \n        Countries (OPEC) and holds 10 percent of the world's proven oil \n        reserves.\n            (7) According to the Energy Information Administration, the \n        economy of Iran relies heavily on revenues generated by the \n        export of oil and such revenues account for approximately 80 \n        percent of Iran's total annual export earnings, nearly one-half \n        of the annual budget of the Government of Iran, and as much as \n        one-fifth of the gross domestic product of Iran.\n            (8) According to the Energy Information Administration, \n        Iran is actively seeking significant new foreign investment in \n        the energy sector and experts believe that with sufficient \n        investment Iran could increase its crude oil production \n        capacity significantly.\n            (9) The Department of Justice is conducting a criminal \n        investigation into whether United States companies have \n        violated any law by trading or investing with Iran through a \n        subsidiary company that may not be completely independent of \n        the parent company.\n            (10) The Securities and Exchange Commission has determined \n        that significant corporate operations in countries subject to \n        economic sanctions, such as Iran, can represent a material risk \n        to investors in the United States and that such investments \n        should be properly disclosed.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to enforce fully existing economic sanctions imposed by \n        United States law against Iran, including sanctions imposed \n        under the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. 1701 \n        note) on persons that make certain investments that contribute \n        to Iran's ability to develop and exploit its petroleum and \n        natural gas resources;\n            (2) to make available to the public information regarding a \n        United States person or a person that is controlled in fact by \n        a United States person who maintains any direct or indirect \n        investment in the energy sector in Iran; and\n            (3) to seek international cooperation in fully enforcing \n        economic sanctions against Iran and in prohibiting any direct \n        or indirect investment in Iran until Iran ceases to support \n        international terrorism.\n\nSEC. 4.
