FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Weather, climate change, and climate variability affect \n        public safety, environmental services and security, human \n        health, agriculture, energy use, water resources, and other \n        factors vital to national security and human welfare.\n            (2) Climate forecasts create opportunities for society to \n        prepare, potentially reducing the costs of climate-related \n        events, as well as serving national needs related to enhancing \n        economic growth, managing risk, protecting life and property, \n        and promoting environmental stewardship.\n            (3) Information on predicted climate and climate impacts is \n        not being fully disseminated or used well, despite the \n        increasing predictability of climate.\n            (4) The United States lacks adequate research, \n        infrastructure, and coordinated outreach and communication \n        mechanisms to meet national climate monitoring, prediction, and \n        decision support needs for adapting to and mitigating the \n        impacts of climate change and climate variability.\n            (5) Increasing societal resilience to climate impacts \n        requires understanding climate trends and variations as well as \n        possible, understanding the impacts of climate on human and \n        nonhuman systems, providing decision-relevant tools based on \n        that information, and increasing society's capacity to act on \n        that information.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to establish a National Climate \nService that will assist the Nation and the world in understanding, \nanticipating, and responding to climate, climate change, and climate \nvariability and their impacts and implications. The Service shall \ninform the public through the sustained production and delivery of \nauthoritative, timely, useful information about impacts on local, \nState, regional, tribal, national, and global scales. The Service shall \nbe user-centric, by ensuring that the information is accessible, \nconsistent with users' ability to respond, and based on user needs and \nlimitations. The Service shall provide such usable information through \na sustained network of observations, modeling, and research activities.\n\nSEC. 4.
