FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Major disasters, including disasters caused by \n        terrorist acts, often result in a decline in economic activity \n        in areas affected by the disaster and a reduction in tax \n        collections by State and local governments serving those areas.\n            (2) A report of the General Accounting Office entitled \n        ``Review of the Estimates for the Impact of the September 11, \n        2001, Terrorist Attacks on New York Tax Revenues'', dated July \n        26, 2002, found the following estimates by the New York City \n        and State budget offices to be reasonably approximate--\n                    (A) for fiscal year 2002, tax revenue losses for \n                New York City will be $1,600,000,000 and tax revenue \n                losses for the State of New York will be \n                $1,600,000,000; and\n                    (B) for fiscal year 2003, tax revenue losses for \n                New York City will be $1,400,000,000 and tax revenue \n                losses for the State of New York will be \n                $4,200,000,000.\n            (3) Under the community disaster loan program (in this \n        section referred to as the ``CDL program''), as authorized by \n        the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n        Act, the President may make loans to a local government \n        suffering a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a \n        result of a major disaster, if the local government \n        demonstrates a need for financial assistance in order to \n        preform its governmental function.\n            (4) The President may cancel the repayment of all or any \n        part of a loan made to a local government under the CDL program \n        if revenues following the disaster are insufficient to meet the \n        operating budget of that local government as a result of \n        disaster-related revenue losses and additional unreimbursed \n        disaster-related municipal operating expenses. In the case of a \n        major disaster resulting from a terrorist attack, repayment of \n        interest or principal on a loan made under the CDL program \n        should not be required.\n            (5) Assistance provided under the CDL program in the past \n        has been instrumental in aiding the full recovery of local \n        governments following a major disaster.\n            (6) The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 established a \n        $5,000,000 limitation on loans made to a local government under \n        the CDL program in connection with a major disaster. Before the \n        date of enactment of that Act, there was not any limitation on \n        the amount of such loans.\n            (7) The $5,000,0000 limitation is inequitable when applied \n        to a local government serving a largely populated area, such as \n        New York City, and is inconsistent with the objective of the \n        CDL program to provide meaningful assistance to a local \n        government recovering from a major disaster.\n            (8) Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n        President George W. Bush has been frequently quoted as \n        directing the Federal Government to do ``whatever it takes'' to \n        help New York City recover and rebuild. In this spirit of \n        resolve, assistance for should be provided to New York City and \n        the State of New York for the loss of tax and other revenues as \n        a direct result of these attacks.\n\nSEC. 3. COMMUNITY DISASTER LOANS.\n\n    (a) Eligibility of States.--Section 417 of the Robert T. Stafford \nDisaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5184) is \namended by striking ``local government'' each place it appears and \ninserting ``State or local government''.\n    (b) Amount.--Section 417(b) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 5184(b)) is \namended--\n            (1) by striking ``based on need, shall'' and inserting \n        ``based on need and shall''; and\n            (2) by striking ``, and shall not exceed $5,000,000''.\n    (c) Major Disasters Caused by Terrorist Attacks.--Section 417 of \nsuch Act (42 U.S.C. 5184) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(e) Major Disasters Caused by Terrorist Attacks.--The President \nshall not require the payment of any interest or principal on a loan \nmade under this section to a State or local government which may suffer \na substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major \ndisaster caused by a terrorist attack.''.\n    (d) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section shall apply \nwith respect to any major disaster occurring on or after October 30, \n2000.\n\nSEC. 4. COMMUNITY DISASTER LOANS FOR LOSSES RELATED TO TERRORIST \n              ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.\n\n    The President is authorized to make loans to New York City and the \nState of New York under section 417 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \nRelief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5184), as amended by \nthis Act, for losses of tax and other revenues as a result of the major \ndisaster caused by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2002. Subject \nto the availability of appropriations, the total amount of such loans \nshall be $8,800,000,000 or such greater amount as is determined by the \nPresident to be necessary to cover such losses. In accordance with \nsection 417(e) of such Act, as added by section 3(c) of this Act, the \nPresident shall not require the payment of any interest or principal on \nsuch loans."
