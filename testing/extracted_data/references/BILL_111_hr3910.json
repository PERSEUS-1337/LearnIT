AUTHORITY TO APPROVE AND IMPLEMENT A SINGLE FISHERY COOPERATIVE \n              FOR THE LONGLINE CATCHER PROCESSOR SUBSECTOR IN THE BSAI.\n\n    (a) In General.--Upon the request of eligible members of the \nlongline catcher processor subsector holding at least 80 percent of the \nlicenses issued for that subsector, the Secretary is authorized to \napprove a single fishery cooperative for the longline catcher processor \nsubsector in the BSAI.\n    (b) Limitation.--A single fishery cooperative approved under this \nsection shall include a limitation prohibiting any eligible member from \nharvesting a total of more than 20 percent of the Pacific cod available \nto be harvested in the longline catcher processor subsector, the \nviolation of which is subject to the penalties, sanctions, and \nforfeitures under section 308 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. \n1858), except that such limitation shall not apply to harvest amounts \nfrom quota assigned explicitly to a CDQ group as part of a CDQ \nallocation to an entity established by section 305(i) of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1855(i)).\n    (c) Contract Submission and Review.--The longline catcher processor \nsubsector shall submit to the Secretary--\n            (1) not later than November 1 of each year, a contract to \n        implement a single fishery cooperative approved under this \n        section for the following calendar year; and\n            (2) not later than 60 days prior to the commencement of \n        fishing under the single fishery cooperative, any interim \n        modifications to the contract submitted under paragraph (1).\n    (d) Department of Justice Review.--Not later than November 1 before \nthe first year of fishing under a single fishery cooperative approved \nunder this section, the longline catcher processor sector shall submit \nto the Secretary a copy of a letter from a party to the contract under \nsubsection (c)(1) requesting a business review letter from the Attorney \nGeneral and any response to such request.\n    (e) Implementation.--The Secretary shall implement a single fishery \ncooperative approved under this section not later than 2 years after \nreceiving a request under subsection (a).\n    (f) Status Quo Fishery.--If the longline catcher processor \nsubsector does not submit a contract to the Secretary under subsection \n(c) then the longline catcher processor subsector in the BSAI shall \noperate as a limited access fishery for the following year subject to \nthe license limitation program in effect for the longline catcher \nprocessor subsector on the date of enactment of this Act or any \nsubsequent modifications to the license limitation program recommended \nby the Council and approved by the Secretary.\n\nSEC. 3. HARVEST AND PROHIBITED SPECIES ALLOCATIONS TO A SINGLE FISHERY \n              COOPERATIVE FOR THE LONGLINE CATCHER PROCESSOR SUBSECTOR \n              IN THE BSAI.\n\n    A single fishery cooperative approved under section 2 may, on an \nannual basis, collectively--\n            (1) harvest the total amount of BSAI Pacific cod total \n        allowable catch, less any amount allocated to the longline \n        catcher processor subsector non-cooperative limited access \n        fishery;\n            (2) utilize the total amount of BSAI Pacific cod prohibited \n        species catch allocation, less any amount allocated to a \n        longline catcher processor subsector non-cooperative limited \n        access fishery; and\n            (3) harvest any reallocation of Pacific cod to the longline \n        catcher processor subsector during a fishing year by the \n        Secretary.\n\nSEC. 4.

AUTHORITY OF THE NORTH PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL.\n\n    (a) In General.--Nothing in this Act shall supersede the authority \nof the Council to recommend for approval by the Secretary such \nconservation and management measures, in accordance with the Magnuson-\nStevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) as it considers necessary to \nensure that this Act does not diminish the effectiveness of fishery \nmanagement in the BSAI or the Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod fishery.\n    (b) Limitations.--\n            (1) Notwithstanding the authority provided to the Council \n        under this section, the Council is prohibited from altering or \n        otherwise modifying--\n                    (A) the methodology established under section 3 for \n                allocating the BSAI Pacific cod total allowable catch \n                and BSAI Pacific cod prohibited species catch \n                allocation to a single fishery cooperative approved \n                under this Act; or\n                    (B) the methodology established under section 4 of \n                this Act for allocating the BSAI Pacific cod total \n                allowable catch and BSAI Pacific cod prohibited species \n                catch allocation to the non-cooperative limited access \n                fishery.\n            (2) No sooner than 7 years after approval of a single \n        fisheries cooperative under section 2 of this Act, the Council \n        may modify the harvest limitation established under section \n        2(b) if such modification does not negatively impact any \n        eligible member of the longline catcher processor subsector.\n    (c) Protections for the Gulf of Alaska Pacific Cod Fishery.--The \nCouncil may recommend for approval by the Secretary such harvest \nlimitations of Pacific cod by the longline catcher processor subsector \nin the Western Gulf of Alaska and the Central Gulf of Alaska as may be \nnecessary to protect coastal communities and other Gulf of Alaska \nparticipants from potential competitive advantages provided to the \nlongline catcher processor subsector by this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO THE MAGNUSON-STEVENS ACT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Consistent with section 301(a) of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1851(a)), a single fishery cooperative approved \nunder section 2 of this Act is intended to enhance conservation and \nsustainable fishery management, reduce and minimize bycatch, promote \nsocial and economic benefits, and improve the vessel safety of the \nlongline catcher processor subsector in the BSAI.\n    (b) Transition Rule.--A single fishery cooperative approved under \nsection 2 of this Act is deemed to meet the requirements of section \n303A(i) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1853a(i)) as if it had \nbeen approved by the Secretary within 6 months after the date of \nenactment of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management \nReauthorization Act of 2006, unless the Secretary makes a \ndetermination, within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthat application of section 303A(i) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act to the \ncooperative approved under section 2 of this Act would be inconsistent \nwith the purposes for which section 303A was added to the Magnuson-\nStevens Act.\n    (c) Cost Recovery.--Consistent with section 304(d)(2) of the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1854(d)(2)), the Secretary is \nauthorized to recover reasonable costs to administer a single fishery \ncooperative approved under section 2 of this Act.\n\nSEC. 7.
