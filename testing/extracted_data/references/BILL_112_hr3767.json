FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The First Special Service Force (in this Act referred \n        to as the ``Force'') was organized as a joint American-Canadian \n        unit activated in July 1942 at Fort Harrison near Helena, \n        Montana.\n            (2) The Force was initially intended to target military and \n        industrial installations that were supporting the German war \n        effort, including important hydroelectric plants, which would \n        severely limit the production of strategic materials used by \n        the Axis powers.\n            (3) From July 1942 through June 1943, volunteers of the \n        Force trained in hazardous, arctic conditions, in the mountains \n        of western Montana, and the waterways of Camp Bradford, \n        Virginia.\n            (4) The combat echelon of the Force totaled 1,800 \n        soldiers--half American, half Canadian. There were also 800 \n        American members of the Service Battalion, which provided \n        important support for the combat troops.\n            (5) A special bond developed between the Canadian and \n        American soldiers. They were not segregated by geography, \n        although it was commanded by an American colonel.\n            (6) The Force was unique, as it was the only unit formed \n        during World War II consisting of troops from 2 different \n        countries.\n            (7) In October 1943, the Force went to Italy, where it \n        fought in battles south of Cassino, including Monte La Difensa \n        and Monte Majo.\n            (8) These mountain peaks were a critical anchor of the \n        German defense line, and on December 3, 1943, the Force's units \n        ascended to the top of La Difensa's precipitous face. Climbing \n        through the night, the battalion suffered heavy casualties and \n        overcame fierce resistance to overtake the German line.\n            (9) After La Difensa, the Force continued to fight tough \n        battles at high altitudes, in rugged terrain, and in severe \n        weather. After battles on the strongly defended Italian peaks \n        of Sammucro, Vischiataro, and Remetanea, the Force's combat \n        units had been reduced from 1,800 to fewer than 500.\n            (10) In 1944, the Force went to the Anzio Beachhead for 4 \n        months, engaging in raids and aggressive patrols. On June 4, \n        1944, members of the Force were the first Allied troops to \n        liberate Rome.\n            (11) After Rome, the Force moved to southern Italy, where \n        it prepared to assist in the liberation of France.\n            (12) During the early morning of August 15, 1944, the Force \n        made silent landings on Les Iles D'Hyeres, small islands in the \n        Mediterranean Sea along the southern coast of France. They \n        faced a sustained and withering assault from the German \n        garrisons, as the Force progressed from the islands to the \n        Franco-Italian border.\n            (13) After securing the Franco-Italian border, the United \n        States Army ordered the disbandment of the First Special \n        Service Force on December 5, 1944, in Nice, France.\n            (14) In 251 days of combat, the Force suffered 2,314 \n        casualties, or 134 percent of its combat strength. It captured \n        more than 30,000 prisoners, won 5 United States campaign stars, \n        and 8 Canadian battle honors. It never failed a mission.\n            (15) The United States is forever indebted to the acts of \n        bravery and selflessness of these troops, risking their lives \n        in covert missions for the cause of freedom.\n            (16) The unparalleled work of the Force along the seas and \n        skies of Europe were critical in repelling the Nazi advance and \n        liberating numerous French and Italian communities.\n            (17) The bond between the American and Canadian service \n        members has endured over the decades, as they continue to meet \n        every year for reunions, alternating between Canada and the \n        United States.\n            (18) The traditions and honors exhibited by the First \n        Special Service Force are carried forward with its lineage \n        embracing outstanding active units of 2 great democracies in \n        the Special Forces of the United States, the Canadian Airborne \n        Regiment, and the Canadian Special Operations Regiment.\n\nSEC. 2.
