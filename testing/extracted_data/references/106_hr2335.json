FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) hydroelectric power is an irreplaceable source of \n        clean, economic, renewable energy with the unique capability of \n        supporting reliable electric service while maintaining \n        environmental quality;\n            (2) hydroelectric power is the leading renewable energy \n        resource of the United States;\n            (3) hydroelectric power projects provide multiple benefits \n        to the United States, including recreation, irrigation, flood \n        control, water supply, and fish and wildlife benefits;\n            (4) in the next 15 years, the bulk of all non-Federal \n        hydroelectric power capacity in the United States is due to be \n        relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;\n            (5) the process of licensing hydroelectric projects by the \n        Commission--\n                    (A) does not produce optimal decisions, because the \n                agencies that participate in the process are not \n                required to consider the full effects of their \n                mandatory and recommended conditions on a license;\n                    (B) is inefficient, in part because agencies do not \n                always submit their mandatory and recommended \n                conditions by a time certain;\n                    (C) is burdened by uncoordinated environmental \n                reviews and duplicative permitting authority; and\n                    (D) is burdensome for all participants and too \n                often results in litigation; and\n            (6) while the alternative licensing procedures available to \n        applicants for hydroelectric project licenses provide important \n        opportunities for the collaborative resolution of many of the \n        issues in hydroelectric project licensing, those procedures are \n        not appropriate in every case and cannot substitute for \n        statutory reforms of the hydroelectric licensing process.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to achieve the objective of relicensing \nhydroelectric power projects to maintain high environmental standards \nwhile preserving low cost power by--\n            (1) requiring agencies to consider the full effects of \n        their mandatory and recommended conditions on a hydroelectric \n        power license and to document the consideration of a broad \n        range of factors;\n            (2) requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \n        impose deadlines by which Federal agencies must submit proposed \n        mandatory and recommended conditions to a license; and\n            (3) making other improvements in the licensing process.\n\nSEC. 4.
