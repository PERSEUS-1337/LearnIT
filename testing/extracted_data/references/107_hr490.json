    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Gifted and Talented Students \nEducation Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Gifted and talented students give evidence of high \n        performance capability in specific academic fields, or in areas \n        such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership \n        capacity, and require services and activities not ordinarily \n        provided by a school in order to fully develop such \n        capabilities. These children are from all cultural, racial, and \n        ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic groups; some have \n        disabilities and for some, English is not their first language. \n        Many of these students have been historically underrepresented \n        in gifted education programs.\n            (2) Because gifted and talented students generally are more \n        advanced academically, are able to learn more quickly and study \n        in more depth and complexity than others their age, their \n        special educational needs require opportunities and experiences \n        that are different from those generally available in regular \n        education programs.\n            (3) There currently is no Federal requirement to identify \n        or serve the Nation's approximately 3,000,000 gifted and \n        talented students.\n            (4) While some States and school districts allocate \n        resources to educate gifted and talented students, others do \n        not. Additionally, State laws and State and local funding, \n        identification, and accountability mechanisms vary widely, \n        resulting in a vast disparity of services for this special-\n        needs population.\n            (5) If the United States is to compete successfully in the \n        global economy, it is important that more students achieve to \n        higher levels, and that highly capable students receive an \n        education that prepares them to perform the highly innovative \n        and challenging work performed in today's workplace.\n            (6) The performance of 12th-grade advanced students in the \n        United States on the Third International Mathematics and \n        Science Study (TIMSS) was among the lowest in the world. In \n        each of 5 physics content areas and in each of 3 math content \n        areas, the performance of physics and advanced mathematics \n        students in the United States was among the lowest of \n        participating countries.\n            (7) Typical elementary school students with academic gifts \n        and talents have already mastered 35 to 50 percent of the \n        school year's content in several subject areas before the year \n        begins.\n            (8) In 1990, fewer than 2 cents out of every $100 spent on \n        elementary and secondary education in the United States was \n        devoted to providing challenging programming for the Nation's \n        gifted and talented students.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide grants to \nStates to support programs, classes, and other services designed to \nmeet the needs of the Nation's gifted and talented students in \nelementary and secondary schools.\n\nSEC. 3.
