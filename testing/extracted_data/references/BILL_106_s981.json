PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide grants to institutions that \ncarry out early childhood education training programs to enable the \ninstitutions to include violence prevention training as part of the \npreparation of individuals pursuing careers in early childhood \ndevelopment and education.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Aggressive behavior in early childhood is the single \n        best predictor of aggression in later life.\n            (2) Aggressive and defiant behavior predictive of later \n        delinquency is increasing among our Nation's youngest children. \n        Without prevention efforts, higher percentages of juveniles are \n        likely to become violent juvenile offenders.\n            (3) Research has demonstrated that aggression is primarily \n        a learned behavior that develops through observation, \n        imitation, and direct experience. Therefore, children who \n        experience violence as victims or as witnesses are at increased \n        risk of becoming violent themselves.\n            (4) In a study at a Boston city hospital, 1 out of every 10 \n        children seen in the primary care clinic had witnessed a \n        shooting or a stabbing before the age of 6, with 50 percent of \n        the children witnessing in the home and 50 percent of the \n        children witnessing in the streets.\n            (5) A study in New York found that children who had been \n        victims of violence within their families were 24 percent more \n        likely to report violent behavior as adolescents, and \n        adolescents who had grown up in families where partner violence \n        occurred were 21 percent more likely to report violent \n        delinquency than individuals not exposed to violence.\n            (6) Aggression can become well-learned and difficult to \n        change by the time a child reaches adolescence. Early childhood \n        offers a critical period for overcoming risk for violent \n        behavior and providing support for prosocial behavior.\n            (7) Violence prevention programs for very young children \n        yield economic benefits. By providing health and stability to \n        the individual child and the child's family, the programs may \n        reduce expenditures for medical care, special education, and \n        involvement with the judicial system.\n            (8) Primary prevention can be effective. When preschool \n        teachers teach young children interpersonal problem-solving \n        skills and other forms of conflict resolution, children are \n        less likely to demonstrate problem behaviors.\n            (9) There is evidence that family support programs in \n        families with children from birth through 5 years of age are \n        effective in preventing delinquency.\n\nSEC. 4.
