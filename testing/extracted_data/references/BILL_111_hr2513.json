FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is no mandatory Federal training requirement for \n        State, local, tribal, and territorial food protection \n        officials, and training varies by State.\n            (2) In June 2000, the Office of the Inspector General \n        (``OIG'') of the Department of Health and Human Services \n        released a report on oversight by the Food and Drug \n        Administration (``FDA'') of State food inspection contracts. In \n        this report the OIG recommended that FDA take steps to promote \n        equivalency among Federal and State food safety standards, \n        inspection programs, and enforcement practices.\n            (3) Under contract with the FDA, State employees perform \n        over half of all FDA inspections at domestic food processing \n        plants. Inspections are performed under State laws and \n        authorities, the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n        Cosmetic Act, or both. In fiscal year 2008, States conducted \n        approximately 10,500 FDA food contract inspections. Overall, \n        States conduct nearly 80,000 inspections annually of food \n        processing plants, but the majority of these inspections are \n        not recognized by FDA as meeting any standard.\n            (4) No national accreditation process exists to assure \n        State and local food protection programs provide adequate \n        protections to ensure effectiveness or equivalency to Federal \n        programs.\n\nSEC. 3. FOOD PROTECTION TRAINING ACTIVITIES AND INSTITUTE.\n\n    Subchapter D of chapter VII of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct (21 U.S.C. 379k et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 747.
