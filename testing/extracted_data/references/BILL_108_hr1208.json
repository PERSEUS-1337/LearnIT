FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has been effectively engaged in the \n        Northern Ireland peace process through both participating in \n        negotiations and contributing to the economic development of \n        the region.\n            (2) Both the Government of Ireland and the Irish people and \n        the Government of the United Kingdom and the British people are \n        long-standing friends of the United States and the American \n        people.\n            (3) In 1986, the United States, in support of the Agreement \n        Between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the \n        United Kingdom (``Anglo-Irish Agreement'') dated November 15, \n        1985, initiated annual contributions to the International Fund \n        for Ireland (``International Fund'') to help bolster economic \n        development and support programs that would foster peace and \n        reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the affected border \n        areas of the Republic of Ireland.\n            (4) The United States has been a generous and faithful \n        donor to the International Fund, contributing more than \n        $386,000,000 to help improve relations between Catholics and \n        Protestants in Northern Ireland through the creation of \n        thousands of jobs and cross community business development.\n            (5) More than 80 percent of the International Fund's \n        investments have been in disadvantaged areas offering work \n        experience and important job training programs for \n        disadvantaged and unemployed youth through the economic, \n        social, and physical regeneration of deprived areas.\n            (6) The International Fund has also developed a series of \n        community-building programs promoting greater dialogue and \n        understanding between Catholics and Protestants and leadership \n        programs designed to develop a new generation of leaders in \n        Northern Ireland to bring about a more peaceful and prosperous \n        future in the region.\n            (7) Through the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 \n        (Public Law 99-415), the United States also seeks to ensure \n        that its contributions promote ``reconciliation in Northern \n        Ireland and the establishment of a society in Northern Ireland \n        in which all may live in peace, free from discrimination, \n        terrorism, and intolerance, and with the opportunity for both \n        communities to participate fully in the structures and \n        processes of government.''.\n            (8) The Good Friday Agreement reached by the Government of \n        Ireland, the Government of the United Kingdom, and political \n        party leaders on April 10, 1998, created the Northern Ireland \n        Executive Assembly and Executive Committee and provided for a \n        ``democratically elected Assembly in Northern Ireland which is \n        inclusive in its membership, capable of exercising executive \n        and legislative authority, and subject to safeguards to protect \n        the rights and interests of all sides of the community.''.\n            (9) The Good Friday Agreement also called for police reform \n        and establishment of a ``new beginning'' in policing in \n        Northern Ireland with an effective, accountable, and fair \n        police service capable of attracting and sustaining support \n        from the community as a whole, capable of maintaining law and \n        order, and based on principles of protection of human rights.\n            (10) In 1999, the Independent Commission on Policing in \n        Northern Ireland, mandated by the Good Friday Agreement, made \n        175 recommendations for policing reform in Northern Ireland, \n        some of which have been implemented.\n            (11) In 2002, the Department of State, as required by \n        section 701(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, \n        Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228), issued a ``Report on \n        Policing Reform and Human Rights in Northern Ireland'' and \n        concluded that among key areas of concern that had not been \n        fully implemented was the establishment of a critically-needed \n        new police training facility and an increase in funding for \n        training programs.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) United States assistance for the International Fund has \n        contributed greatly to the economic development of Northern \n        Ireland and that both objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement \n        Support Act of 1986, economic development and reconciliation, \n        remain critical to achieving a just and lasting peace in the \n        region, especially in the economically-depressed areas;\n            (2) although there has been positive economic development \n        in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, \n        International Fund contributions to support much-needed \n        projects in economically-depressed areas of Northern Ireland \n        remain very important, and an expansion of efforts in \n        reconciliation projects as a way to promote peace and economic \n        stability is also encouraged; and\n            (3) since policing reform is a significant part of winning \n        public confidence and acceptance in the new form of government \n        in Northern Ireland, the International Fund is encouraged to \n        support programs that enhance relations between communities, \n        and between the police and the communities they serve, promote \n        human rights training for police, and enhance peaceful \n        mediation in neighborhoods of continued conflict.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT SUPPORT ACT OF 1986.\n\n    (a) Findings and Purposes.--Section 2(b) of the Anglo-Irish \nAgreement Support Act of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing: ``Furthermore, the International Fund is encouraged to \nsupport programs that enhance relations between communities, and \nbetween the police and the communities they serve, promote human rights \ntraining for police, enhance peaceful mediation in neighborhoods of \ncontinued conflict, promote training programs to enhance the new \ndistrict partnership police boards recommended by the Patten \nCommission, and assist in the transition of former British military \ninstallations and prisons into sites for peaceful, community-supported \nactivities, such as housing, retail, and commercial development.''.\n    (b) United States Contributions to the International Fund.--Section \n3 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(c) Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005.--Of the amounts made available \nfor fiscal years 2004 and 2005 to carry out chapter 4 of part II of the \nForeign Assistance Act of 1961 (relating to the economic support fund), \nthere are authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000 for each such \nfiscal year for United States contributions to the International Fund. \nAmounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations \nunder the preceding sentence are authorized to remain available until \nexpended. Of the amount authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years \n2004 and 2005 under this subsection, it is the sense of Congress that \nnot less than 20 percent of such amount for each such fiscal year \nshould be used to carry out the last sentence of section 2(b).''.\n    (c) Annual Reports.--Section 6(1) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement \nSupport Act of 1986 is amended by adding at the end before the \nsemicolon the following: ``, specifically through improving local \ncommunity relations and relations between the police and the people \nthey serve''.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives March 31, 2003.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 JEFF TRANDAHL,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
