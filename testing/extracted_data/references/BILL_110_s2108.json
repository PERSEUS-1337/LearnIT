FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Each year 3,000,000 pregnancies, or one-half of all \n        pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and 4 in 10 \n        of these unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n            (2) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency \n        contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended \n        pregnancy for women of reproductive potential and has approved \n        over-the-counter access to the emergency contraceptive Plan B \n        for adults.\n            (3) The most commonly used forms of emergency contraception \n        are regimens of ordinary birth control pills. Taken within 72 \n        hours of unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure, \n        emergency contraception can reduce the risk of pregnancy by as \n        much as 89 percent. Recent medical evidence confirms that \n        emergency contraception can be effective up to 5 days after \n        unprotected intercourse or contraception failure.\n            (4) Emergency contraception, also known as postcoital \n        contraception, is a responsible means of preventing pregnancy \n        that works like other hormonal contraception by delaying \n        ovulation preventing fertilization and may prevent \n        implantation.\n            (5) Emergency contraception does not cause abortion and \n        will not affect an established pregnancy.\n            (6) Increased usage of emergency contraception could reduce \n        the number of unintended pregnancies, thereby reducing the need \n        for abortion.\n            (7) Emergency contraceptive use in the United States \n        remains low, and 1 in 3 women of reproductive age remain \n        unaware of the method.\n            (8) Although the American College of Obstetricians and \n        Gynecologists recommends that doctors routinely discuss \n        emergency contraception with women of reproductive age during \n        their annual visit, only 1 in 4 obstetricians/gynecologists \n        routinely discuss emergency contraception with their patients, \n        suggesting the need for greater provider and patient education.\n            (9) It is estimated that 25,000 to 32,000 women become \n        pregnant each year as a result of rape or incest, half of whom \n        choose to terminate their pregnancy. If used correctly, \n        emergency contraception could help many of these rape survivors \n        avoid the additional trauma of facing an unintended pregnancy.\n            (10) A recent study conducted by Ibis Reproductive Health \n        found that less than 18 percent of hospitals provide emergency \n        contraception at a woman's request without restrictions. At \n        nearly 50 percent of hospitals, emergency contraception is \n        unavailable even in cases of sexual assault.\n            (11) In light of their safety and efficacy, both the \n        American Medical Association and the American College of \n        Obstetricians and Gynecologists have endorsed more widespread \n        availability of emergency contraceptive.\n            (12) Healthy People 2010, published by the Office of the \n        Surgeon General, establishes a 10-year national public health \n        goal of increasing the proportion of health care providers who \n        provide emergency contraception to their patients.\n            (13) Public awareness campaigns targeting women and health \n        care providers will help remove many of the barriers to \n        emergency contraception and will help bring this important \n        means of pregnancy prevention to women in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
