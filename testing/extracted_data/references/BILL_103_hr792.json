CLAIMS PROCEDURE.\n\n    The Black Lung Benefits Act is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new part:\n\n                      ``PART D--SPECIAL PROVISIONS\n\n``SEC. 441. CLAIMS.\n\n    ``(a) Standard.--If a claim is filed after the date of the \nenactment of this section under part C for death or total disability of \na miner due to pneumoconiosis, such miner shall be presumed to have \nbeen totally disabled by pneumoconiosis or to have died because of \npneumoconiosis if the conditions described in any one of the following \nparagraphs are met:\n            ``(1) A single positive chest roentgenogram (x-ray), \n        biopsy, or autopsy of such miner indicates the existence of \n        pneumoconiosis.\n            ``(2) A single set of ventilatory studies of such miner \n        indicates the presence of a chronic respiratory or pulmonary \n        disease that meets or exceeds the severity standards of \n        regulations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        published at 20 C.F.R. 410.490(b)(1)(ii).\n            ``(3) A single set of blood gas studies of such miner \n        indicates the presence of an impairment in the transfer of \n        oxygen from the lungs to the blood that meets or exceeds the \n        severity standards of regulations of the Secretary of Labor \n        published at 20 C.F.R. 727.203(a)(3).\n            ``(4) Other medical evidence involving such miner, \n        including the documented opinion of a physician exercising \n        reasonable medical judgment, indicates the presence of a \n        respiratory disease or pulmonary impairment that would prevent \n        the miner from performing his usual coal mine work.\nThe person who submits such claim shall not be required to prove the \nmatters described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) by a preponderance \nof the evidence or by any higher evidentiary standard.\n    ``(b) Causation.--\n            ``(1) If a claim is filed after the date of the enactment \n        of this section under part C for death or total disability due \n        to pneumoconiosis and if the miner with respect to whom the \n        claim was filed worked 10 or more years in a coal mine and \n        presents evidence which proves the evidence of the matter \n        described in any paragraph of subsection (a), there shall be a \n        rebuttable presumption that the miner's pneumoconiosis arose \n        out of the miner's coal mine employment. No evidence shall be \n        excluded in determining the length of a miner's coal mine \n        employment. In the absence of complete Social Security \n        Administration records, affidavits from the miner's co-workers \n        shall be accepted as sufficient proof of the coal miner's \n        period of employment.\n            ``(2) If a miner is unable to prove 10 years of employment \n        in a coal mine, the miner may prove that the miner's \n        pneumoconiosis is due to the miner's coal mine employment \n        through other evidence.\n    ``(c) Rebuttal of Presumption.--\n            ``(1) The presumption under subsection (a) that a miner is \n        totally disabled by pneumoconiosis may be rebutted only if--\n                    ``(A) there is evidence that establishes that the \n                claimant is in fact doing the claimant's usual coal \n                mine work, or\n                    ``(B) in light of all relevant evidence, it is \n                established that the miner is able to do the miner's \n                usual coal mine work or comparable and gainful work.\n        A physician's opinion that the miner is not totally disabled \n        shall not rebut such presumption when invoked by qualifying \n        ventilatory studies or arterial blood gas testing.\n            ``(2) In connection with a rebuttal of a presumption under \n        subsection (a), the Secretary of Labor may submit not more than \n        1 opinion from an examining or consulting physician and not \n        more than 3 x-ray readings to supplement such evidence.\n            ``(3) The presumption under subsection (b) may be rebutted \n        only by clear and convincing proof that the miner's \n        pneumoconiosis, established by a condition described in \n        subsection (a), did not arise, in whole or in part, out of the \n        miner's coal mine employment.\n\n``SEC. 442. APPLICATION OF SECTION 441.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Section 441 shall apply to all claims filed \nunder part C on and after the date of the enactment of this Act, except \nthat the Secretary of Labor shall review any claim that--\n            ``(1) was filed under part B or part C, and\n            ``(2) is either pending on the date of enactment of this \n        Act or has been denied on or before such date,\nto determine if the evidence establishes eligibility under the \npresumption of section 441(a). The Secretary shall review each such \nclaim regardless of whether the claimant also filed any subsequent \nclaim under part B or C or such claim resulted in an award of benefits. \nThe Secretary's review of a claim which resulted in the award of \nbenefits may not result in the reversal or forfeiture of such benefits. \nThe Secretary shall promptly notify each claimant having a claim \nsubject to review under this subsection that the claim shall be \nreviewed by the Secretary in accordance with this subsection.\n    ``(b) Procedure.--\n            ``(1) In carrying out the review of a claim under \n        subsection (a), the Secretary shall not allow the claimant or \n        any other party to submit additional medical or other evidence \n        if the Secretary determines that the evidence on file meets the \n        criteria of eligibility set forth in section 441(a). If the \n        Secretary determines that the evidence on file does not meet \n        the criteria of eligibility set forth in section 441(a), the \n        Secretary shall provide an opportunity for the claimant to \n        present additional medical or other evidence to substantiate \n        the claimant's claim under such criteria and shall notify the \n        claimant of that opportunity. The Secretary shall not be \n        permitted to supplement the evidence in any claim reviewed \n        under subsection (a). Each claim reviewed under this section \n        shall be afforded the administrative and judicial review that \n        is afforded claims that are not subject to this section.\n            ``(2) If a claim is determined under subsection (a) to meet \n        the eligibility requirements of section 441(a), the individual \n        for which the claim was submitted shall be awarded benefits \n        prospectively (unless, at the time of such determination, the \n        individual is receiving black lung benefits prospectively \n        pursuant to an award made in connection with a separate claim) \n        and retroactively for any period beginning on or after January \n        1, 1974, for which the claimant (1) has not received benefits, \n        and (2) is eligible under the statutory and regulatory \n        provisions governing the retroactive payment of benefits for \n        claims that are not subject to the special review required by \n        subsection (a).\n\n``SEC. 443. PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.\n\n    Benefits payable under any claim which is determined under section \n441 or 442 to be eligible for benefits shall be paid from the fund.\n\n``SEC. 444. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n    ``A claimant who files a claim after the date of enactment of this \nAct and whose claim is denied by the Department of Labor's Benefits \nReview Board pursuant to the procedure of section 21(b) of the \nLongshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 921(b)), may \npetition for review in the United States District Court for the \ndistrict in which the claimant last worked as a coal miner or where the \nclaimant resides at the time the appeal is filed, whichever the \nclaimant chooses. Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n405(g)) shall govern all such petitions for review, except that (1) \neach reference therein to the Secretary shall be interpreted as meaning \nthe Secretary of Labor, and (2) if the claim was denied because of the \napplication of a regulation which violates this Act or any other \nFederal law, the period in which a claimant may petition for review \nshall not apply. A petition for review under this section may not be \ndenied because the claimant has not exhausted the administrative \nremedies available to the claimant.\n\n``SEC. 445.

GENERAL PROVISIONS.\n\n    ``(a) Multiple Claims.--If a claimant has had a claim denied under \nthis Act, the Secretary shall permit the claimant to file an additional \nclaim under this part without a showing of a material change in the \nclaim.
