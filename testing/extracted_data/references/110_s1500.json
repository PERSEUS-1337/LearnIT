    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Support for Democracy and Human \nRights in Zimbabwe Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) When Zimbabwe achieved independence in 1980, its \n        economic and democratic prospects were bright and President \n        Robert Mugabe was hailed as a liberator. However, 27 years \n        later, the economy of Zimbabwe has collapsed as income per \n        capita has fallen below the 1953 level and President Mugabe's \n        Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) \n        government has increasingly and systematically exercised \n        repression of political opposition and engaged in violations of \n        human rights.\n            (2) The Department of State's 2006 Country Report on Human \n        Rights Practices states that Zimbabwe's 2002 presidential \n        election and 2005 parliamentary elections were neither free nor \n        fair, and reports that President Mugabe's government interfered \n        with the campaign activities of the opposition, intimidated \n        voters, and distributed food in a partisan manner.\n            (3) The Department of State Report also finds that the \n        Government of Zimbabwe continues to--\n                    (A) restrict freedom of assembly, movement, and \n                association;\n                    (B) forcibly evict civilians from their land; and\n                    (C) harass and abuse members of the opposition, the \n                media, the religious community, civil society, and \n                organized labor.\n            (4) According to the Freedom House Freedom in the World \n        2007 report, ``In 2006, Zimbabwe suffered from a further \n        deterioration of political rights and civil liberties amid a \n        near-total collapse of the country's economy.''.\n            (5) Zimbabwe is a member of the United Nations, the African \n        Union, the Southern African Development Community, the African \n        Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the \n        World Trade Organization, and a party to the Universal \n        Declaration of Human Rights, the African Charter on Human and \n        Peoples' Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and \n        Political Rights.\n            (6) Section 2 of the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic \n        Recovery Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-99; 22 U.S.C. 2151 note) \n        states, ``It is the policy of the United States to support the \n        people of Zimbabwe in their struggle to effect peaceful, \n        democratic change, achieve broad-based and equitable economic \n        growth, and restore the rule of law.''.\n            (7) In 2002 and 2003, the United States imposed financial \n        and immigration sanctions targeted against selected \n        individuals, a ban on the transfer of defense items and \n        services, and a suspension of nonhumanitarian government-to-\n        government assistance, although the United States remains one \n        of the leading providers of humanitarian assistance to the \n        people of Zimbabwe.\n            (8) The United Nations, the European Union, the United \n        States, human rights organizations, and many others have \n        condemned the security forces of Zimbabwe for the beating, \n        detention, and arrest of opposition and civil society members \n        attending a prayer meeting on March 11, 2007.\n            (9) In March 2007, the heads of state of the Southern \n        African Development Community announced that the President of \n        South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, will mediate between President \n        Mugabe and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change in \n        advance of the 2008 presidential election, but failed to \n        condemn the Government of Zimbabwe for its human rights abuses \n        and restriction of democratic space.\n            (10) On March 30, 2007, it was announced that the ZANU-PF \n        central committee had chosen President Mugabe as the party's \n        candidate for the 2008 election and that the parliamentary \n        elections will also be held in 2008, instead of 2010.\n            (11) A Human Rights Watch report released in May 2007 \n        concluded, ``Arbitrary arrests, detentions, and brutal beatings \n        by police and security forces skyrocketed in March and April, \n        and continue unabated. . . . The Zimbabwean government is \n        violating the human rights of its citizens with impunity.''.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to support the people of Zimbabwe in their efforts to \n        promote democracy and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe; and\n            (2) to call on President Mugabe to immediately restore \n        democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE.\n\n    The following is the sense of Congress:\n            (1) The United States welcomes and commends the \n        announcement by the Southern African Development Community that \n        the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, will lead \n        negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties in \n        Zimbabwe to resolve the political and humanitarian crisis in a \n        way that reflects the will of the people of Zimbabwe and \n        respects international standards.\n            (2) The creation of a level playing field for those who \n        want to participate in the political process in Zimbabwe and \n        the encouragement of transparency in the political process \n        should be priority objectives in the negotiations.\n            (3) All preparations should be made to hold free, fair, and \n        peaceful elections in accordance with international standards, \n        such as the Southern African Development Community \n        Parliamentary Forum Election Norms and Guidelines.\n            (4) Cooperation between the United States, regional players \n        in Africa, and the wider international community is an \n        important component of a proactive strategy to support \n        democratic rule and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe.\n            (5) Normalized relations with the Government of Zimbabwe \n        are desirable, but until the Government of Zimbabwe promotes \n        democracy and the rule of law, the United States will continue \n        to isolate the Government of Zimbabwe and expand financial and \n        travel sanctions targeted against those responsible for \n        repressing the people of Zimbabwe.\n            (6) The United States Permanent Representative to the \n        United Nations should use the voice and vote of the United \n        States in the United Nations Security Council to emphasize the \n        threat to international peace and security posed by the \n        Government of Zimbabwe.\n\nSEC. 5.
