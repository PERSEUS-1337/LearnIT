FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) International travel to the United States generates \n        more than $134 billion annually in exports and supports 1.8 \n        million United States jobs.\n            (2) Each overseas visitor spends an average of $4,000 at \n        hotels, restaurants, and other United States businesses.\n            (3) As an industry sector, travel and tourism creates one \n        of the country's only balance-of-trade surpluses, valued at \n        $31.7 billion in 2010.\n            (4) Global travel spending is expected to double over the \n        next decade, reaching $2.1 trillion.\n            (5) While world-wide long-haul international travel grew by \n        40 percent between 2000 and 2010, the United States market \n        share of long-haul travel dropped from 17 percent in 2000 to 12 \n        percent during the same timeframe.\n            (6) Over that decade, the United States lost the \n        opportunity to welcome 78 million visitors and generate $606 \n        billion in direct and downstream spending.\n            (7) The volume of travel to the United States, as compared \n        with other global destinations, is particularly uncompetitive \n        from emerging markets with fast growing demand.\n            (8) Lagging overseas arrivals result in large part from a \n        United States visa application process that is perceived by \n        potential business and leisure travelers as inefficient, time \n        consuming, and inaccessible.\n            (9) The Government Accountability Office has reported that \n        the Department of State's efforts to address staffing, \n        facilities, and other consular constraints are generally \n        temporary, unsustainable, and insufficient to meet expected \n        increases in demand for nonimmigrant visa applications.\n            (10) Instituting new procedures to make the visa process \n        more efficient without reducing security protocols and \n        developing longer-term plans that accurately meet increasing \n        workload demand can systemically address visa application \n        backlogs and inefficiencies.\n            (11) By regaining 17 percent of the long-haul travel market \n        in 2015 and sustaining it through 2020, the United States can \n        attract 98 million more visitors, create 1.3 million additional \n        jobs, and generate $859 billion in United States economic \n        output by 2020.\n            (12) Increased international travel to the United States \n        also achieves United States foreign policy objectives by \n        introducing foreign visitors the United States and to \n        Americans, who are the United States best goodwill ambassadors.\n            (13) The Department of State recently implemented some \n        reforms to accelerate visa application processing in China and \n        Brazil, laying the foundation to increase capacity, but still \n        requires additional reforms to meet demand on a permanent, \n        systemic basis.\n            (14) Removing the self-imposed barriers in the visa \n        application process that currently discourage inbound \n        international travel to the United States would yield \n        significant economic and public diplomacy benefits for the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3. VISA PROCESSING.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of State \nshall set a visa processing standard of 12 or fewer calendar days at \nUnited States diplomatic and consular missions in China, Brazil, and \nIndia, and use machine readable nonimmigrant visa fees to hire a \nsufficient number of Foreign Service officers and limited non-career \nappointment consular officers to meet and maintain such standard \nthroughout the year.\n\nSEC. 4. VISA VIDEO-CONFERENCING.\n\n    (a) Pilot Program.--The Secretary of State shall conduct a two-year \npilot program for the processing of nonimmigrant visas using secure \nremote video-conferencing technology as a method for conducting visa \ninterviews of applicants, and shall work with other Federal agencies \nthat use such secure communications to help ensure security of the \nvideo-conferencing transmission and encryption.\n    (b) Rulemaking.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall initiate a \nrulemaking process to establish the pilot program described in \nsubsection (a), criteria for participation in such program, and the fee \nfor such program in accordance with subsection (d).\n    (c) Participation.--The Secretary of State shall ensure that the \npilot program described in subsection (a) includes as many visa \napplicants as practicable by--\n            (1) establishing a reasonable cost of enrollment;\n            (2) providing such applicants with clear and consistent \n        eligibility guidelines; and\n            (3) making program enrollment convenient and easily \n        accessible.\n    (d) Fees.--The Secretary of State may impose a fee for the pilot \nprogram described in subsection (a). Such fee may not exceed the \naggregate costs associated with such program and shall be credited to \nthe Department of State for purposes of carrying out such program. \nAmounts so credited shall remain available until expended.\n    (e) Report.--Not later than one year after initiating the pilot \nprogram described in subsection (a) and again not later than 90 days \nafter the conclusion of the two-year period referred to in such \nsubsection, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on \nForeign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \nForeign Relations of the Senate a report on such pilot program. Each \nsuch report shall assess the efficacy of using secure remote video-\nconferencing technology as a method for conducting visa interviews of \napplicants, including any effect such method may have on an \ninterviewer's ability to determine an applicant's credibility and \nuncover fraud, and shall include recommendations on whether such \nprogram should be continued, broadened, or modified.\n\nSEC. 5. DATA ON VISA INTERVIEW WAIT TIMES.\n\n    The Secretary of State shall post on the Web site of the Department \nof State the following data relating to nonimmigrant visas for each \nUnited States diplomatic and consular mission:\n            (1) The monthly median wait times measured in calendar days \n        for the past 12 months for a nonimmigrant visa interview \n        appointment.\n            (2) The monthly median wait times measured in calendar days \n        for the past 12 months for a nonimmigrant visa to be processed.\n\nSEC. 6.
