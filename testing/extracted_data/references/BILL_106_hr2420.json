FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Internet access services are inherently interstate and \n        international in nature, and should therefore not be subject to \n        regulation by the States.\n            (2) The imposition of regulations by the Federal \n        Communications Commission and the States has impeded the rapid \n        delivery of high speed Internet access services to the public, \n        thereby reducing consumer choice and welfare.\n            (3) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 represented a \n        careful balance between the need to open up local \n        telecommunications markets to competition and the need to \n        increase competition in the provision of interLATA voice \n        telecommunications services.\n            (4) In enacting the prohibition on Bell operating company \n        provision of interLATA services, Congress recognized that \n        certain telecommunications services have characteristics that \n        render them incompatible with the prohibition on Bell operating \n        company provision of interLATA services, and exempted such \n        services from the interLATA prohibition.\n            (5) High speed data services and Internet access services \n        constitute unique markets that are likewise incompatible with \n        the prohibition on Bell operating company provision of \n        interLATA services.\n            (6) Since the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of \n        1996, the Federal Communications Commission has construed the \n        prohibition on Bell operating company provision of interLATA \n        services in a manner that has impeded the development of \n        advanced telecommunications services, thereby limiting consumer \n        choice and welfare.\n            (7) Internet users should have choice among competing \n        Internet service providers.\n            (8) Internet service providers should have the right to \n        interconnect with high speed data networks in order to provide \n        service to Internet users.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is therefore the purpose of this Act to provide \nmarket incentives for the rapid delivery of advanced telecommunications \nservices--\n            (1) by deregulating high speed data services and Internet \n        access services;\n            (2) by clarifying that the prohibition on Bell operating \n        company provision of interLATA services does not extend to the \n        provision of high speed data services and Internet access \n        services;\n            (3) by ensuring that consumers can choose among competing \n        Internet service providers; and\n            (4) by ensuring that Internet service providers can \n        interconnect with competitive high speed data networks in order \n        to provide Internet access service to the public.\n\n SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS\n\n    (a) Amendments.--Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \nU.S.C. 153) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraph (20) as paragraph (21);\n            (2) by redesignating paragraphs (21) through (52) as \n        paragraphs (24) through (54), respectively;\n            (3) by inserting after paragraph (19) the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(20) High speed data service.--The term `high speed data \n        service' means any service that consists of or includes the \n        offering of a capability to transmit, using a packet-switched \n        or successor technology, information at a rate that is \n        generally not less than 384 kilobits per second in at least one \n        direction.'';\n            (4) by inserting after paragraph (22) the following new \n        paragraphs:\n            ``(23) Internet.--The term ``Internet'' means collectively \n        the myriad of computer and telecommunications facilities, \n        including equipment and operating software, which comprise the \n        interconnected world-wide network of networks that employ the \n        Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or any \n        predecessor or successor protocols to such protocol, to \n        communicate information of all kinds by wire or radio.\n            ``(24) Internet Access Service.--The term `Internet access \n        service' means (A) a service that combines computer processing, \n        information storage, protocol conversion, and routing with \n        transmission to enable users to access Internet content and \n        services, and (B) the transmission of such service, but does \n        not include the portion of such transmission from the user to \n        the provider of such service.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n            (1) Section 230(f) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n        U.S.C. 230(f)) is amended--\n                    (A) by striking paragraph (1); and\n                    (B) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through (4) as \n                paragraphs (1) through (3), respectively.\n            (2) Section 223(h)(2) of such Act (47 U.S.C. 223(h)(2)) is \n        amended by striking ``230(f)(2)'' and inserting ``230(f)(1)''.\n\n SEC. 4.
