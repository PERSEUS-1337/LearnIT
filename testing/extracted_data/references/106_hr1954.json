FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) The vast majority of State statutes and common law \n        follow the generally accepted principle of law that a party \n        should be held liable only for harm that the party could guard \n        against.\n            (2) A small number of State common laws and statutes still \n        do not recognize this accepted principle of law, and continue \n        to subject companies that rent or lease motor vehicles to \n        vicarious liability for the negligence of their rental \n        customers in operating the motor vehicle simply because of the \n        company's ownership, even where the rental company has not been \n        negligent in any way and the motor vehicle operated properly.\n            (3) An even smaller minority of State laws impose unlimited \n        liability on the companies for the tortious acts of their \n        customers, without regard to fault.\n            (4) These small number of vicarious liability laws pose a \n        significant competitive barrier to entry for smaller companies \n        attempting to compete in these markets, in contravention of the \n        fundamental legal principle of fairness prohibiting liability \n        without fault.\n            (5) Furthermore, because rented or leased motor vehicles \n        are frequently driven across State lines, these small number of \n        vicarious liability laws impose a disproportionate and undue \n        burden on interstate commerce by increasing rental rates for \n        all customers across the nation.\n            (6) Due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n        costs, consumers face higher vehicle rental costs in all States \n        because of the increased insurance expenses required to provide \n        coverage in the interstate insurance and rental markets.\n            (7) Rental fairness will lessen burdens on interstate \n        commerce and decrease litigiousness.\n            (8) Legislation to address these concerns is an appropriate \n        exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses 3, 9, and 18 \n        of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United \n        States, and the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
