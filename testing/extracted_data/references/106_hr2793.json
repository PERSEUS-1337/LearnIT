FINDINGS AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Secretary of Agriculture must provide the \n        leadership necessary to ensure that sound science is used to \n        develop Federal policy decisions and rules regarding private \n        agricultural lands and other rural lands.\n            (2) Public attention has gradually turned from the \n        manufacturing industry toward agriculture as a source of water \n        pollution.\n            (3) Various studies allege that agricultural production is \n        a source of nutrients and other forms of non-point source \n        pollution.\n            (4) Although many of these studies are based on erroneous \n        or incomplete data, Federal agencies are continuing to increase \n        the paperwork and financial burden on farmers and ranchers \n        through regulatory requirements based on these studies.\n            (5) Any Federal policy recommendations that may be issued \n        by any Federal agency to address water pollution problems \n        related to agricultural lands should be based on sound science, \n        subject to adequate peer review, and should take into account \n        the economic feasibility of implementing such recommendations \n        at the farm level.\n            (6) The majority of farmers and ranchers voluntarily manage \n        their land in ways that protect the productivity and quality of \n        their soil.\n            (7) Federal, State, and local technical assistance efforts \n        are ongoing to assist farmers and ranchers in implementing \n        voluntary conservation measures to assess and reduce the risk \n        of non-point source water pollution contributions from \n        agricultural production.\n            (8) Farmers and ranchers seeking technical assistance from \n        the Department of Agriculture share detailed data and \n        information about their operations and trust that this \n        information will be kept confidential.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this Act:\n            (1) Interagency working group.--The term ``Interagency \n        Working Group'' means the Interagency Agricultural Water \n        Quality Policy Working Group established pursuant to section 3.\n            (2) Advisory committee.--The term ``advisory committee'' \n        means the advisory committee to address agriculture-related \n        water quality issues established pursuant to section 4.\n            (3) Sound science.--The term ``sound science'' means \n        technical or scientific information or techniques that have \n        been subjected to independent peer review, publication in one \n        or more scientific journals, or subjected to some other \n        unbiased process which assures independent scholarly critique \n        of research or field trial results and conclusions, including \n        consideration of the accuracy of collection and analysis for \n        all underlying data. In addition, in all cases where \n        replication of research results is feasible, the term can be \n        applied only to information or techniques that have \n        demonstrated repeatable results in similar trials at other \n        times or at multiple locations.\n\nSEC. 3.
