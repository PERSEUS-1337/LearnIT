SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Public Utility Holding Company Act \nof 1996''.\n\n   TITLE I--REPEAL OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935\n\nSEC. 101. PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was intended to \nfacilitate the work of State and Federal regulators by placing certain \nconstraints on the activities of holding company systems. Developments \nsince 1935, including changes in other regulation and in the industry \nitself, have called into question the continued relevance of the model \nof regulation established by the statute.\n    (b) There is, however, a continuing need for limited Federal \nregulation in this area to ensure the rate protection of utility \nconsumers. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1996 is intended \nto eliminate unnecessary regulation, yet still provide for consumer \nprotection by providing for State commission access to books and \nrecords of all companies in a holding company system, and for Federal \naudit authority and oversight of affiliate transactions, to the extent \nthat such activities affect rates, while, at the same time, affording \ncompanies the flexibility required to compete in today's energy \nmarkets.\n\nSEC. 102. REPEAL OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935.\n\n    The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, is \nhereby repealed, effective one year from the date of enactment of this \nAct.\n\n TITLE II--ENACTMENT OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1996\n\nSEC. 201. PURPOSE.\n\n    Limited Federal regulation is necessary to supplement the work of \nState commissions for the continued rate protection of electric and gas \nutility consumers. This Act is intended to address these concerns by \nproviding for Federal and State access to books and records of all \ncompanies in a holding company system and for federal oversight of \naffiliate transactions, to the extent that such activities affect \nrates.\n\nSEC. 202.
