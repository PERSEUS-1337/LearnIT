Livestock: Use of Antimicrobial Drugs\n14400.\nFor purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:\n(a) \u201cMedically important antimicrobial drug\u201d means an antimicrobial drug listed in Appendix A of the federal Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Guidance for Industry #152, including critically important, highly important, and important antimicrobial drugs, as that appendix may be amended.\n(b) \u201cLivestock\u201d means all animals and poultry, including aquatic and amphibian species, that are raised, kept, or used for profit.

The guidelines shall include scientifically validated practical alternatives to the use of medically important antimicrobial drugs, including, but not limited to, the introduction of effective vaccines and good hygiene and management practices.\n(b) The department shall consult with livestock producers, licensed veterinarians, and any other relevant stakeholders on ensuring livestock timely access to treatment for producers in rural areas with limited access to veterinary care.\n(c) For purposes of this section, \u201cantimicrobial stewardship\u201d is a commitment to do all of the following:\n(1) To use medically important antimicrobial drugs only when necessary to treat, control, and, in some cases, prevent, disease.\n(2) To select the appropriate medically important antimicrobial drug and the appropriate dose, duration, and route of administration.\n(3) To use medically important antimicrobial drugs for the shortest duration necessary and to administer them to the fewest animals necessary.\n14405.\n(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that the department coordinate with the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal Food and Drug Administration, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to implement the expanded antimicrobial resistance surveillance efforts included in the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, and that the information gathered through this effort will help lead to a better understanding of the links between antimicrobial use patterns in livestock and the development of antimicrobial resistant bacterial infections.\n(b) (1) The department shall gather information on medically important antimicrobial drug sales and usage, as well as antimicrobial resistant bacteria and livestock management practice data. Monitoring efforts shall not be duplicative of the National Animal Health Monitoring System and the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, and, to the extent feasible, the department shall coordinate with the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the federal Food and Drug Administration in the development of these efforts.\n(2) In coordinating with the National Animal Health Monitoring System and the National Antimicrobial Resistant Monitoring System, the department shall gather representative samples from all of the following:\n(A) California\u2019s major livestock segments.\n(B) Regions with considerable livestock production.\n(C) Representative segments of the food production chain.\n(c) The department shall work with willing participants to gather samples and shall consult with, and conduct outreach to, livestock producers, licensed veterinarians, and any other relevant stakeholders on the implementation of the monitoring efforts.

Information may be shared with federal agencies so long as it is protected by the federal Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347).\n14408.\n(a) A person who violates this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) for each day a violation occurs.\n(b) (1) For a second or subsequent violation, a person who violates this chapter shall be punishable by an administrative fine, levied by the secretary, in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500) for each day a violation occurs.\n(2) In addition to the administrative fine, the violator shall attend an educational program on the judicious use of medically important antimicrobial drugs that has been approved by the secretary. The violator shall successfully complete the program and provide proof to the secretary within 90 days from the occurrence of the violation.\n(c) Subdivisions (a) and (b) do not apply to licensed veterinarians.

Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nIn order to ensure the confidentiality of the information collected pursuant to this act and the integrity of that information for regulatory and enforcement purposes, it is necessary that this act take effect."
