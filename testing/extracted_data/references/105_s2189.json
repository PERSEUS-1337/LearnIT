FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in many parts of the United States, water supplies are \n        insufficient to meet current or expected future demand during \n        certain times of the year;\n            (2) a number of factors (including growing populations, \n        increased demands for food and fiber production, and new \n        environmental demands for water) are placing increased demands \n        on existing water supply sources;\n            (3) increased water conservation, water quality \n        enhancement, and more efficient use of water supplies could \n        help meet increased demands on water sources;\n            (4) in States that recognize rights to conserved water for \n        persons who conserve it, irrigation suppliers, farmers, \n        ranchers, and other users could gain rights to use conserved \n        water while also increasing the quantity of water available for \n        other beneficial uses by implementing measures to reduce water \n        loss during transport to, or application on, the fields;\n            (5) reducing the quantity of water lost during transport to \n        the fields and improving water quality can help areas better \n        meet changing population and economic needs; and\n            (6) the role of the Federal Government in helping meet \n        those changing water needs should be to provide financial \n        assistance to help irrigators, farmers, and ranchers implement \n        practical, cost-effective water quality and conservation \n        measures.\n\nSEC. 3. USE OF STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS FOR WATER CONSERVATION \n              IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n    Section 603 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \n1383) is amended--\n            (1) in the first sentence of subsection (c)--\n                    (A) by striking ``and (3)'' and inserting ``(3)''; \n                and\n                    (B) by inserting before the period at the end the \n                following: ``, (4) for construction of water \n                conservation improvements by eligible recipients under \n                subsection (i)''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(i) Water Conservation Improvements.--\n            ``(1) Definition of eligible recipient.--In this \n        subsection, the term `eligible recipient' means a municipality, \n        quasi-municipality, municipal corporation, special district, \n        conservancy district, irrigation district, water users' \n        association, tribal authority, intermunicipal, interstate, or \n        State agency, nonprofit private organization, a member of such \n        an association, authority, agency, or organization, or a \n        lending institution, located in a State that has enacted laws \n        that--\n                    ``(A) provide a water user who invests in a water \n                conservation improvement with a right to use water \n                conserved by the improvement, as allowed by State law;\n                    ``(B) provide authority to reserve minimum flows of \n                streams in the State; and\n                    ``(C) prohibit transactions that adversely affect \n                existing water rights.\n            ``(2) Financial assistance.--A State may provide financial \n        assistance from its water pollution control revolving fund to \n        an eligible recipient to construct a water conservation \n        improvement, including--\n                    ``(A) piping or lining of an irrigation canal;\n                    ``(B) wastewater and tailwater recovery or \n                recycling;\n                    ``(C) irrigation scheduling;\n                    ``(D) water use measurement or metering;\n                    ``(E) on-field irrigation efficiency improvements; \n                and\n                    ``(F) any other improvement that the State \n                determines will provide water conservation benefits.\n            ``(3) Voluntary participation.--The participation of an \n        eligible recipient in the water conservation improvement shall \n        be voluntary.\n            ``(4) Use of conserved water.--The quantity of water \n        conserved through the water conservation improvement shall be \n        allocated in accordance with applicable State law, including \n        any applicable State law requiring a portion of the conserved \n        water to be used for instream flow enhancement or other \n        conservation purposes.\n            ``(5) Limitation on use for irrigated agriculture.--\n        Conserved water made available under paragraph (4) shall not be \n        used to irrigate land that has not previously been irrigated \n        unless the use is authorized by State law and will not diminish \n        water quality.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
