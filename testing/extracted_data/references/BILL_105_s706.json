FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) independent studies have shown that the safety and \n        discipline of students in public school systems are ranked as \n        the top 2 concerns of the public with respect to matters \n        relating to the administration of public school systems;\n            (2) administrators of public school systems must be given \n        the resources necessary to ensure that the students and the \n        personnel of such systems are provided educational and working \n        environments that are safe and orderly; and\n            (3) if the misconduct of a student who is a child with a \n        disability is not a manifestation of a disability of the \n        student, the student should be subject to the same disciplinary \n        measures that are provided in the rules or code of conduct of \n        an educational entity for a student who is a child without a \n        disability, including a disciplinary measure such as a \n        cessation of educational services.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to permit educational entities to use fair disciplinary \n        measures against all students, including children with \n        disabilities; and\n            (2) to require educational entities--\n                    (A) to include in the educational record of a \n                student who is a child with a disability or a student \n                who is a child without a disability a statement of \n                disciplinary measures taken against the student; and\n                    (B) to transmit the statement with the educational \n                record of the student to other educational entities if \n                the student transfers from an elementary school or \n                secondary school (as the terms are defined in section \n                602(c)) to another such school.\n\nSEC. 4. DISCIPLINE OF STUDENTS WHO ARE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES.\n\n    (a) Maintenance of Disciplinary Records.--Section 612 of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1412) is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n            ``(8) The State has in effect a State law that requires \n        State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and \n        intermediate educational units--\n                    ``(A) to include in the educational record of a \n                child with a disability or a child without a disability \n                a statement of any disciplinary measure taken against \n                the child that results in an out-of-school suspension \n                of more than 10 days or an expulsion from school; and\n                    ``(B) in a case in which the child with a \n                disability or the child without a disability is \n                transferred from an elementary school or secondary \n                school (as the terms are defined in section 602(c), or \n                section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n                Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801), whichever are applicable) \n                to another such school (in the State or in another \n                State), to transmit the statement with the educational \n                record to other educational entities involved with such \n                a transfer.\n        The statement described in subparagraph (A) for a child with a \n        disability or a child without a disability may include a \n        description of any behavior engaged in by the child that \n        required a disciplinary measure, a description of the \n        disciplinary measure taken against the child, and any other \n        information that is relevant to the safety of the child and the \n        individuals involved with the child.''.\n    (b) Disciplinary Measures.--\n            (1) Use of disciplinary measures when the behavior of a \n        child is not a manifestation of the disability of the child.--\n        Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 \n        U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 615 \n        the following:\n\n``SEC. 615A. USE OF DISCIPLINARY MEASURES WHEN THE BEHAVIOR OF A CHILD \n              IS NOT A MANIFESTATION OF THE DISABILITY OF THE CHILD.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--A State educational agency, a local educational \nagency, or an intermediate educational unit may use a long-term \ndisciplinary measure to address the behavior of a child with a \ndisability that is a violation of the rules or code of conduct of such \nan educational entity, if--\n            ``(1) the behavior was not a manifestation of the \n        disability of the child; and\n            ``(2) the long-term disciplinary measure applies to the \n        child with a disability to the same extent the long-term \n        disciplinary measure applies to a child without a disability \n        who engages in the same behavior.\n    ``(b) Provision of Educational Services.--In the case of a child \nwith a disability who engages in behavior that violates the rules or \ncode of conduct of an educational entity described in subsection (a), \nthe child shall continue to receive educational services in accordance \nwith this Act, unless--\n            ``(1) the behavior of the child was not a manifestation of \n        the disability of the child; and\n            ``(2) the policy of the educational entity is to cease \n        educational services to any child determined to be engaged in \n        such behavior.\n    ``(c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to \nlimit the rights provided for children with disabilities under section \n615.\n    ``(d) Definition.--In this section, the term `long-term \ndisciplinary measure' means a disciplinary action that is carried out \nby an educational entity described in subsection (a) for a period of \nmore than 10 school days.''.\n            (2) Alternative Educational Placement for Threatening \n        Behavior.--Section 615(e)(3)(B)(i) of the Individuals with \n        Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(3)(B)(i)) is \n        amended by striking ``jurisdiction of such agency,'' and \n        inserting ``jurisdiction of such agency or is determined by a \n        hearing officer to have been engaged in behavior in such school \n        that posed a threat to the safety of individuals involved with \n        the child,''.\n    (c) Definitions.--Section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(c) In sections 612(8) and 615A, the term `child without a \ndisability' means an individual--\n            ``(1) who is enrolled in an elementary school or secondary \n        school (as the terms are defined in section 14101 of the \n        Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n        8801); and\n            ``(2) who is not a child with a disability.''.\n\nSEC. 5. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) when Congress enacted the Individuals with Disabilities \n        Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.), Congress made a \n        commitment to provide funding for the State grant program under \n        the Act at a level of 40 percent of the national average per-\n        pupil expenditure; and\n            (2) since the enactment of such Act, Congress has only \n        funded the State grant program at 7 percent of the national \n        average per-pupil expenditure.\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \nCongress should follow through on its original funding commitment and \nprovide funding for the State grant program under the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act at the level of 40 percent of the national \naverage per-pupil expenditure."
