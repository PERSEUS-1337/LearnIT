FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture \n        Organization (FAO) report, ``The State of Food and Agriculture \n        1998'', approximately 828,000,000 people are chronically \n        undernourished in the world today. While no region is immune to \n        hunger, the vast majority of these people live in 87 low-\n        income, food-deficit countries.\n            (2) Many of the world's hungry are children, approximately \n        300,000,000. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) \n        report, ``State of the World's Children 2001'', states that 32 \n        percent of the world's children under five years of age--\n        approximately 193,000,000--have stunted growth, which is the \n        key indicator for under-nutrition. Hunger in the early stages \n        of development is particularly debilitating. As reported by \n        UNICEF, optimal neural development in a child, which affects \n        physical, mental, and cognitive development, depends on good \n        nutrition and stimulation during the first months and years of \n        life.\n            (3) The causes of hunger are complex, but are most often \n        associated with poverty and lack of empowerment. In developing \n        countries, where poverty is endemic, governments face low \n        revenues and high debt burdens, funding is inadequate for basic \n        health and education, agricultural productivity and marketing \n        systems are weak and under-performing, employment opportunities \n        are lacking, public institutions are often weak, in some \n        countries, HIV/AIDS is pandemic, and many people struggle just \n        to meet their basic needs.\n            (4) Poor children rarely receive adequate education. UNICEF \n        reports that more than 130,000,000 primary-school-age children \n        in developing countries do not go to school, and 60 percent of \n        these children are girls. In 2000, the United Nations \n        Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) \n        reported that for developing countries, an estimated \n        250,000,000 children from ages five to fourteen are laborers, \n        and fifty percent work full time. Lack of education and the \n        resulting poor literacy limit the growth potential of children. \n        Education develops cognitive skills, improves long-term \n        productivity and offers a child protection from the hazards of \n        labor or exploitation. Long-term studies indicate that \n        increased literacy rates are critical to economic development. \n        In countries that achieve an 80 percent or better literacy rate \n        among girls and women, the birthrate decreases.\n            (5)(A) Food aid has been shown to have lasting benefits for \n        children in developing countries when part of multi-faceted \n        programs aimed at pregnant women, nursing mothers, infants and \n        children five years and younger.\n            (B) Mother-child health (MCH) programs reduce the incidence \n        of malnutrition and under-nutrition and promote proper growth \n        by providing supplemental food to pregnant women and nursing \n        mothers, along with nutritious take-home foods and health care \n        to mothers and children under the age of two.\n            (C) Early childhood development programs provide children \n        between the ages of three and six with meals and training in \n        basic skills, while mothers learn about basic sanitation, first \n        aid and respiratory and diarrheal diseases, the greatest \n        killers of young children in poor countries.\n            (D) Food for Education programs reduce the incidence of \n        hunger and enhance educational attendance and performance by \n        providing school meals or take-home rations, along with \nimprovements in educational quality and the school environment.\n            (E) Although the conditions and challenges in developing \n        countries differ greatly from those in the United States, these \n        international food aid programs are similar in concept to the \n        women, infants and children (WIC) program, the Head Start \n        program, and the school breakfast and school lunch programs in \n        the United States.\n            (6) Over the past 50 years, United States international \n        food assistance has contributed to alleviating hunger and its \n        causes and is an integral part of United States foreign policy. \n        From the Marshall Plan to the establishment in 1954 of the Food \n        for Peace program (or Public Law 480) and the Food for Progress \n        Act of 1985, American farmers have played a key role in \n        ensuring that the United States is able to respond to \n        emergencies such as famine, natural disasters, and war, and to \n        contribute to global development initiatives. These programs \n        continue because food is greatly needed in poor countries that \n        cannot produce or afford to import adequate amounts of food to \n        meet their minimal needs.\n            (7) 7,900,000 metric tons of agricultural commodities, \n        worth $1,500,000,000 in commodity purchases, were approved \n        during fiscal year 2000 to provide food aid to 91 countries, as \n        authorized under section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of \n        1949, the Food for Progress Program, and Public Law 480. \n        Programs were implemented in the field by nongovernmental and \n        private voluntary organizations, cooperatives, the United \n        Nations World Food Program, and governments.\n            (8) American farmers benefit directly from food aid \n        programs by selling commodities for international development \n        and hunger programs. In the longer term, the economic uplift \n        from food aid programs improves the living standards and \n        purchasing power of citizens in developing countries, expanding \n        markets for American agricultural products, goods, and \n        services.\n            (9) Two of the most successful and beneficial bipartisan \n        programs ever launched on behalf of children in the United \n        States have been the United States school lunch and school \n        breakfast programs, and the women, infants, and children (WIC) \n        program. While hunger among children has not yet been \n        eradicated in the United States, over the past 22 years, \n        America has provided a nutritious meal to most students who \n        cannot afford one. Currently, about 27,000,000 children are fed \n        every day through these programs.\n            (10) On May 30, 2000, during the opening ceremonies of the \n        National Nutrition Summit, Senators George McGovern and Robert \n        Dole praised the Federal Government for reducing hunger in \n        America since 1969. They called upon the United States \n        Government to reduce hunger in the developing world through \n        child nutrition programs similar to the United States school \n        lunch, school breakfast, and WIC programs.\n            (11) On July 23, 2000, the G-8 Summit in Okinawa, Japan, \n        endorsed a proposal put forward by the United States, the \n        Global Food for Education Initiative, to pursue a pilot \n        preschool and school feeding program.\n            (12) On December 28, 2000, in addition to other \n        international food aid program commitments, the United States \n        launched a $300,000,000 pilot program, the Global Food for \n        Education Initiative, through the United States Department of \n        Agriculture, to provide meals, take-home rations, and other \n        assistance to an estimated 9,000,000 needy pre-school and \n        school-age children in 38 countries. Using authority under the \n        Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act and section 416(b) of \n        the Agricultural Act of 1949, food commodities will be \n        purchased from American farmers by the United States Department \n        of Agriculture, which will be distributed in fiscal year 2001 \n        through 49 projects developed by United States-based private \n        voluntary organizations and cooperatives, and by the United \n        Nations World Food Program. Senators McGovern and Dole urged \n        the United States Congress to make this a permanently funded \n        program and to engage the international community in a \n        multilateral effort to end child hunger over the next three \n        decades.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.\n\n    The Secretary of Agriculture (hereinafter in this Act referred to \nas the ``Secretary'') shall, using the authority of section 416(b) of \nthe Agricultural Act of 1949 (hereinafter in this Act referred to as \n``section 416(b)'') and in accordance with this Act, provide eligible \ncommodities and financial and technical assistance to establish, \ncontinue, and expand--\n            (1) preschool and school feeding programs to improve food \n        security, reduce the incidence of hunger, and improve \n        educational opportunity; and\n            (2) maternal, infant, and child nutrition programs for \n        pregnant women, nursing mothers, infants, and children 5 years \n        of age and younger.\n\nSEC. 4.
