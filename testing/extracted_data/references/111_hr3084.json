SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Chinook Nation \nRestoration Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Chinook Nation made a significant contribution to \n        the historic journey of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to \n        the Pacific Ocean by greeting the expedition and their company \n        as well as trading with them throughout the winter of 1805-\n        1806.\n            (2) The United States subsequently recognized the Chinook \n        Nation as an Indian tribe in the Anson Dart (Tansy Point) \n        Treaty of 1851, and the Isaac Stevens (Chehalis River) Treaty \n        of 1855, but neither treaty was ratified, resulting in serious \n        harm to the Chinook people.\n            (3) As a result of the failure of the United States to \n        protect the Chinook Nation and people, the Chinooks lost their \n        historic lands on the Columbia River, and a great number of \n        them succumbed to poverty and disease in the 19th century.\n            (4) It was the intent of Congress in the Act of March 4, \n        1911 (36 Stat. 1345), to provide restitution to the Chinook \n        people in the form of allotments of land on existing Indian \n        reservations, which the Supreme Court of the United States \n        upheld in Halbert v. United States (283 U.S. 753 (1931)).\n            (5) Congress named four of the five tribes of the Chinook \n        Nation, the Lower Chinook, Wahkiakum, Cathlamet, and Clatsop, \n        in the Western Oregon Termination Act of 1954, and this Act is \n        the only basis for termination of the Federal relationship with \n        the Tribe.\n            (6) The Chinook Nation has remained active on the Lower \n        Columbia River and Willapa Bay in the vicinity of the \n        reservation area of the Tansy Point Treaty and is well-known to \n        neighboring tribes and other communities.\n            (7) The Chinook people have survived and maintained their \n        language, Chinookwawa, and culture despite decades of neglect \n        by the United States.\n            (8) With different Administrations disagreeing about the \n        legal status of the Chinook Nation, it is time for Congress to \n        restore the Chinook Nation to Federal tribal status.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For the purposes of this Act, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Member.--The term ``member'' means an enrolled member \n        of the Chinook Nation as of the date of enactment of this Act, \n        or an individual who has been placed on the membership role in \n        accordance with this Act.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior.\n            (3) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Chinook Indian \n        Nation, composed of the Lower Chinook, Wahkiakum, Cathlamet, \n        Clatsop, and Willapa Tribes.\n            (4) State.--The term ``State'' means the State of \n        Washington.\n            (5) State territorial waters.--The term ``State territorial \n        waters'' means all waters within the territorial limits of the \n        State of Washington.\n\nSEC. 3.
