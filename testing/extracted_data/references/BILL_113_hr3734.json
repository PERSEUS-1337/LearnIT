FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the National Science Foundation, 2 percent \n        of students studying science, technology, engineering, or math \n        (STEM) are computer science majors, while 60 percent of STEM \n        jobs are in the computing field.\n            (2) The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that computer \n        programming jobs are growing at twice the national job growth \n        average, and these jobs are high paying middle class jobs that \n        can secure the financial future of many American families and \n        also help grow the United States economy.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) secondary schools should focus on preparing career and \n        technical students, including underrepresented groups such as \n        minorities and women, for academic and technical opportunities \n        in postsecondary education or entry into a high paying, skilled \n        job in the computer programming field;\n            (2) elementary schools and secondary schools should place \n        emphasis on coding and computer programming as a vocational and \n        technical education track;\n            (3) educators should rethink the way coding as a skill is \n        conceptualized within the education system and in our society; \n        and\n            (4) learning to write and read code is critical to creating \n        and innovating in cyberspace, and learning this language is \n        also a skill critical to the national security and economic \n        competitiveness of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. CODING AS A CRITICAL FOREIGN LANGUAGE.\n\n    Section 6002(b)(1) of the America COMPETES Act (20 U.S.C. \n9802(b)(1)) is amended by inserting ``, including a computer \nprogramming language,'' after ``a foreign language''.\n\nSEC. 5.
