FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) According to the United States Census, by the year \n        2050, 1 in 4 Americans will be of Hispanic origin.\n            ``(2) Despite the dramatic increase in the Hispanic \n        population in the United States, the National Center for \n        Education Statistics reported that in 1999, Hispanics accounted \n        for only 4 percent of the master's degrees, 3 percent of the \n        doctor's degrees, and 5 percent of first-professional degrees \n        awarded in the United States.\n            ``(3) Although Hispanics constitute 10 percent of the \n        college enrollment in the United States, they comprise only 3 \n        percent of instructional faculty in college and universities.\n            ``(4) The future capacity for research and advanced study \n        in the United States will require increasing the number of \n        Hispanics pursuing postbaccalaureate studies.\n            ``(5) Hispanic-serving institutions are leading the Nation \n        in increasing the number of Hispanics attaining graduate and \n        professional degrees.\n            ``(6) Among Hispanics who received master's degrees in \n        1999-2000, 25 percent earned them at Hispanic-serving \n        institutions.\n            ``(7) Between 1991 and 2000, the number of Hispanic \n        students earning master's degrees at Hispanic-serving \n        institutions grew 136 percent, the number receiving doctor's \n        degrees grew by 85 percent, and the number earning first-\n        professional degrees grew by 47 percent.\n            ``(8) It is in the National interest to expand the capacity \n        of Hispanic-serving institutions to offer graduate and \n        professional degree programs.\n            ``(9) Research is a key element in graduate education and \n        undergraduate preparation, particularly in science and \n        technology, and Congress desires to strengthen the role of \n        research at Hispanic serving-institutions. University research, \n        whether performed directly or through a university's nonprofit \n        research institute or foundation, is considered an integral \n        part of the institution and mission of the university.\n    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this part are--\n            ``(1) to expand postbaccalaureate educational opportunities \n        for, and improve the academic attainment of, Hispanic students; \n        and\n            ``(2) to expand and enhance the postbaccalaureate academic \n        offerings of high quality that are educating the majority of \n        Hispanic college students and helping large numbers of Hispanic \n        students and low-income individuals complete postsecondary \n        degrees.\n\n``SEC. 512.
