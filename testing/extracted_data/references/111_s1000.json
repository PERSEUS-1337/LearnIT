    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Starting Early Starting Right Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Children in child care learn and develop skills they \n        need to succeed in school and in life. Child care is also \n        fundamental to helping families get ahead by giving parents the \n        support and peace of mind they need to be productive at work.\n            (2) Child care teachers and providers carry the \n        responsibility of providing a safe, nurturing, and stimulating \n        setting for children entrusted to them each day.\n            (3) In 2006, the average wage for a child care worker was \n        $9.05 per hour or $18,820 annually. For full-time, full-year \n        work this is only slightly above the 2006 poverty guidelines of \n        $16,600 for a mother with 2 children.\n            (4) As a result of low wages and limited benefits, many \n        child care providers do not work for long periods in the child \n        care field. Only 65 percent of those employed in the child care \n        field in 2005 were still working in child care in 2006. Such \n        high turnover rates deny children consistent and stable \n        relationships with their teachers.\n            (5) Current reimbursement rates for child care providers \n        receiving Federal funds are insufficient to recruit and retain \n        qualified child care providers and to ensure high-quality early \n        care and education services for children.\n            (6) Research shows that high-quality child care helps low-\n        income children enter school ready to succeed. One study found \n        that children who had enrolled in high-quality child care \n        demonstrated greater mathematical ability and thinking and \n        attention skills, and experienced fewer behavior problems than \n        other children in second grade. Effects were particularly \n        strong for low-income children.\n            (7) Millions of low-income children could benefit from \n        high-quality child care. In 2007, 10,500,000 children under age \n        6 (43 percent) lived in low-income families (families with \n        incomes below 200 percent of poverty).\n            (8) Inadequate funding has reduced the number of children \n        with access to child care. Only about 1 in 7 eligible children \n        receives Federal child care assistance.\n            (9) Many women work in low-wage jobs and cannot cover the \n        cost of child care. For example, two-thirds of working poor \n        families headed by single mothers who paid for child care spent \n        at least 40 percent of their cash income on child care.\n            (10) Problems with child care can make it difficult for \n        parents, particularly low-income parents, to work, causing them \n        to lose wages, be denied a promotion, or lose their jobs.\n            (11) Research shows that single mothers and former welfare \n        recipients who received child care assistance were much more \n        likely to remain employed after 2 years than those who did not \n        receive child care assistance.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve--\n            (1) access to high-quality early learning and child care \n        for low-income children and working families; and\n            (2) the quality of child care and the number of high-\n        quality child care providers.\n\nSEC. 3.
