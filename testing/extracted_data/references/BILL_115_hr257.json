FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) For more than 3,000 years, the Jewish people have \n        maintained a continuous connection and presence in the land of \n        Israel and their eternal and indivisible capital city of \n        Jerusalem.\n            (2) The State of Israel was established on May 14, 1948, in \n        the wake of World War II in order to serve as a homeland and \n        place of refuge for the Jewish people.\n            (3) From 1948 to 1967, Jerusalem was a divided city and not \n        all Israeli citizens of all faiths were entitled to visit the \n        holy sites, and Jews from other countries were restricted in \n        their access to holy sites in the area controlled by Jordan. In \n        1967, the city of Jerusalem was reunited during the conflict \n        known as the Six Day War, and since 1967, Jerusalem has been a \n        unified city administered by Israel, and persons of all faiths \n        have been guaranteed full access to the holy sites within the \n        city.\n            (4) On July 31, 1988, Jordan relinquished its disputed \n        sovereignty claims to Judea and Samaria and East Jerusalem, and \n        therefore sovereign claims to these areas remain ``disputed'', \n        not ``occupied''.\n            (5) In 1990, Congress unanimously adopted Senate Concurrent \n        Resolution 106, which declares that Congress ``strongly \n        believes that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which \n        the rights of every ethnic religious group are protected''.\n            (6) In 1995, Congress overwhelmingly approved the Jerusalem \n        Embassy Act (Public Law 104-45), requiring the establishment of \n        the United States Embassy in Jerusalem not later than May 31, \n        1999.\n            (7) The United States maintains its embassy in the \n        functioning capital in every country except in the State of \n        Israel.\n            (8) Israel has far exceeded the 1907 Hague Regulation as \n        directed by international law. Israel has taken all measures to \n        restore and ensure public order and safety in Jerusalem.\n            (9) Jerusalem has been far safer and more protected under \n        Israel's administration than under any previous authorities.\n            (10) Civil life is entirely present in Jerusalem, and all \n        government institutions and related frameworks are also \n        present, including the Knesset, the Bank of Israel, the \n        Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister's and \n        President's offices, and the Supreme Court.\n\nSEC. 3. RECOGNITION OF JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND \n              RELOCATION OF THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY FROM TEL AVIV TO \n              JERUSALEM.\n\n    (a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to recognize \nJerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel, both de jure \nand de facto.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the United States should recognize the sovereign status \n        of an undivided Jerusalem as the capital of the State of \n        Israel;\n            (2) recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and \n        transferring the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel \n        Aviv will send a signal of United States commitment and resolve \n        to Israel;\n            (3) the President and the Secretary of State should \n        publicly affirm as a matter of United States policy that \n        Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital of the State of \n        Israel;\n            (4) the President should immediately implement the \n        provisions of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 (Public Law \n        104-45), as amended by section 4 of this Act, and begin the \n        process of relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to \n        Jerusalem; and\n            (5) United States officials should refrain from any actions \n        that contradict United States law on this subject.\n    (c) Identification of Jerusalem on Government Documents.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, any official document of \nthe United States Government which lists countries and their capital \ncities shall identify Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n    (d) Relocation.--Not later than January 1, 2019, the President \nshall relocate the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n\nSEC. 4.
