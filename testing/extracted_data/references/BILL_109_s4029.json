This number increases to 147,000 when all schools of \n        nursing are taken into account.\n            (4) Insufficient numbers of faculty is the primary reason \n        given by schools of nursing for not accepting qualified \n        applicants.\n            (5) The average age of doctorally-prepared nurse faculty is \n        almost 56 years old.\n            (6) Nurses are the healthcare providers most likely to \n        intercept medication errors before the errors reach patients \n        and result in adverse events.\n            (7) Employing a greater proportion of more highly educated \n        nurses may reduce the rates of patient mortality.\n\nSEC. 3.
