FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Career uniformed service members and their families \n        endure unique and extraordinary demands and sacrifices during \n        the course of a decades-long career protecting freedoms for all \n        Americans.\n            (2) The extent of these demands and sacrifices is never so \n        evident as in wartime, not only in today's Global War on \n        Terrorism, but also during the last 6 decades of hot and cold \n        wars when today's retired service members were on continuous \n        call to enter into harm's way when and as needed.\n            (3) The demands and sacrifices are such that few Americans \n        are willing to accept them for a multi-decade career.\n            (4) The primary offset for enduring the extraordinary \n        sacrifices inherent in a military career is a system of \n        extraordinary retirement benefits, including health care \n        coverage considerably better than that afforded civilian \n        workers, that a grateful Nation provides for those who choose \n        to subordinate much of their personal life to the national \n        interest for so many years.\n            (5) Many private sector firms are curtailing health \n        benefits and shifting significantly higher costs to their \n        employees.\n            (6) One effect of such curtailment is that retired service \n        members who work for such employers increasingly depend on the \n        TRICARE coverage they earned by their military service.\n            (7) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts \n        to constrain TRICARE program costs, a large part of the \n        Department's effort has been aimed at shifting a larger share \n        of cost burdens to retired service members.\n            (8) The beneficiary cost increases proposed by the \n        Department of Defense fail to recognize adequately that career \n        service members paid enormous in-kind premiums through their \n        extended service and sacrifice.\n            (9) A significant share of the Nation's health care \n        providers refuse to accept new TRICARE patients because TRICARE \n        pays them significantly less than commercial insurance programs \n        and imposes unique administrative requirements.\n            (10) The Department of Defense has chosen to count the \n        accrual deposit to the Department of Defense Medicare-Eligible \n        Retiree Health Care Fund against the budget of the Department \n        of Defense, contrary to the amendments made by section 725 of \n        Public Law 108-375.\n            (11) Leaders of the Department of Defense have reported to \n        Congress that counting such deposits against the budget of the \n        Department of Defense is impinging on other readiness needs, \n        including weapons programs, an inappropriate situation which \n        section 725 of Public Law 108-375 was intended expressly to \n        prevent.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have a \n        committed health benefits obligation to retired uniformed \n        service members that exceeds the obligation of corporate \n        employers to civilian employees; and\n            (2) the Department of Defense has many additional options \n        to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that do \n        not disadvantage beneficiaries and should pursue any and all \n        such options rather than seeking large fee increases for \n        beneficiaries.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON INCREASES OF CERTAIN HEALTH COSTS AND \n              RESTRICTIONS ON HEALTH BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS FOR MEMBERS \n              AND RETIREES OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES AND THEIR \n              DEPENDENTS.\n\n    (a) Prohibition on Increase in Charges Under Contracts for Medical \nCare.--Section 1097(e) of title 10, United States Code, is amended in \nthe last sentence--\n            (1) by striking ``during the period beginning on'' and \n        inserting ``after''; and\n            (2) by striking ``, and ending on September 30, 2011''.\n    (b) Prohibition on Increase in Amount of Cost Sharing Requirement \nUnder Pharmacy Benefits Program.--Section 1074g(a)(6)(A) of title 10, \nUnited States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: \n``After September 30, 2011, the dollar amount of a cost sharing \nrequirement (whether established as a percentage or a fixed dollar \namount) may not be increased.''.\n    (c) Prohibition on Increase in Charges for Inpatient Care.--Section \n1086(b)(3) of title 10, United States Code, is amended by striking \n``during the period beginning on April 1, 2006, and ending on September \n30, 2011''.\n    (d) Prohibition on Increase in Premiums Under TRICARE Coverage for \nCertain Members in the Selected Reserve.--Section 1076d(d)(3) of title \n10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n            ``(3) Beginning on October 1, 2011, the monthly amount of \n        the premium for TRICARE Standard coverage under this section \n        may not be increased to be more than the amount in effect for \n        the month of September 2011.''.\n    (e) Prohibition on Increase in Premiums Under TRICARE Coverage for \nCertain Members of the Retired Reserve.--Section 1076e(d) of title 10, \nUnited States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \nparagraph:\n    ``(6) Beginning on October 1, 2011, the monthly amount of the \npremium for TRICARE Standard coverage under this section may not be \nincreased to be more than the amount in effect for the month of \nSeptember 2011.''."
