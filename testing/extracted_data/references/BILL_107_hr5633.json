SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Asthma \nAssessment and State Tracking Act of 2002'' (FAAST Act).\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Asthma summary.--Asthma is a serious chronic condition \n        affecting many Americans. Asthma accounts for an estimated 3 \n        million lost workdays for adults and 10.1 million lost school \n        days in children annually. Over the past 20 years mortality, \n        morbidity, and hospital discharge rates attributed to asthma \n        have substantially increased. Between 1979 and 1998, the age-\n        adjusted mortality rate increased 56 percent while the \n        prevalence rate increased by almost 22 percent in males and 97 \n        percent in females between 1982 and 1996.\n            (2) Race-specific prevalence.--In 1996, the prevalence rate \n        of asthma in whites was 53.5 per 1,000 persons while the \n        prevalence rate in blacks was 69.6 per 1,000 persons. Both of \n        these rates represent significant differences from the rates \n        reported in 1982, when they were 34.6 and 39.2 for whites and \n        blacks, respectively.\n            (3) Economic costs of asthma.--Asthma entails an annual \n        economic cost to the Nation in direct health care costs of $8.1 \n        billion; indirect costs (lost productivity) add another $4.6 \n        billion for a total of $12.7 billion. Inpatient hospital \n        services represented the largest single direct medical \n        expenditure, over $3.5 billion. The value of reduced \n        productivity due to loss of school days represented the largest \n        single indirect cost at $1.5 billion.\n\nSEC. 2. ASTHMA SCREENING FOR EARLY HEAD START AND HEAD START PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Early Head Start Programs.--Section 645A of the Head Start Act \n(42 U.S.C. 9840a) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(h) Asthma Screening.--\n            ``(1) In general.--An entity that receives assistance under \n        this section may carry out a program under which the entity--\n                    ``(A) determines whether a child eligible to \n                participate in the program described in subsection (a) \n                has each received an asthma screening test using a test \n                that is appropriate for age and risk factors on the \n                enrollment of the child in the program; and\n                    ``(B) in the case of a child who has not received \n                such an asthma screening test, ensures that the \n                enrolled child receives such a test either by referral \n                or by performing the test (under contract or \n                otherwise).\n            ``(2) Reimbursement.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--On the request of an entity that \n                performs or arranges for the performance of an asthma \n                screening test under paragraph (1) on a child who is \n                eligible for or receiving medical assistance under a \n                State plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act \n                (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), the Secretary of Health and \n                Human Services, notwithstanding any other provision of, \n                or limitation under, title XIX of the Social Security \n                Act, shall reimburse the entity, from funds that are \n                made available under that title, for 100 percent of the \n                cost of the test and data reporting.\n                    ``(B) Costs.--The costs of a test conducted under \n                this subsection--\n                            ``(i) shall include reimbursement for \n                        testing devices and associated supplies \n                        approved for sale by the Food and Drug \n                        Administration and used in compliance with \n                        section 353 of the Public Health Service Act \n                        (42 U.S.C. 263a); and\n                            ``(ii) shall include reimbursement for \n                        administering the tests and related services, \n                        as determined appropriate by the State agency.\n            ``(3) Head start.--This subsection shall apply to Head \n        Start programs that include coverage, directly or indirectly, \n        for infants and toddlers under the age of 3 years.''.\n    (b) Head Start Programs.--Section 642(b) of the Head Start Act (42 \nU.S.C. 9837(b)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (10), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n            (2) in paragraph (11), by striking the period at the end \n        and inserting ``; and''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(12) with respect to an agency that elects to carry out a \n        program under section 645A(h), comply with the requirements of \n        such section in the case of each child eligible to participate \n        in the Head Start program to be carried out by the agency.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
