FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Congress enacted the Act entitled ``An Act to authorize \n        the temporary supplying of vacancies in the executive \n        departments'', approved July 23, 1868 (commonly referred to as \n        the ``Vacancies Act''), to--\n                    (A) preclude the extended filling of a vacancy in \n                an office of an executive or military department \n                subject to Senate confirmation, without the submission \n                of a Presidential nomination;\n                    (B) provide an exclusive means to temporarily fill \n                such a vacancy; and\n                    (C) clarify the role of the Senate in the exercise \n                of the Senate's constitutional advice and consent \n                powers in the Presidential appointment of certain \n                officers;\n            (2) subchapter III of chapter 33 of title 5, United States \n        Code, includes a codification of the Vacancies Act, and \n        (pursuant to an amendment on August 17, 1988, to section 3345 \n        of such title) specifically applies such vacancy provisions to \n        all Executive agencies, including the Department of Justice;\n            (3) the legislative history accompanying the 1988 amendment \n        makes clear in the controlling committee report that the \n        general administrative authorizing provisions for the Executive \n        agencies, which include sections 509 and 510 of title 28, \n        United States Code, regarding the Department of Justice, do not \n        supersede the specific vacancy provisions in title 5, United \n        States Code;\n            (4) there are statutory provisions of general \n        administrative authority applicable to every Executive \n        department and other Executive agencies that are similar to \n        sections 509 and 510 of title 28, United States Code, relating \n        to the Department of Justice;\n            (5) despite the clear intent of Congress, the Attorney \n        General of the United States has continued to interpret the \n        provisions granting general administrative authority to the \n        Attorney General under sections 509 and 510 of title 28, United \n        States Code, to supersede the specific vacancy provisions in \n        title 5, United States Code;\n            (6) the interpretation of the Attorney General would--\n                    (A) virtually nullify the vacancy provisions under \n                subchapter III of chapter 33 of title 5, United States \n                Code;\n                    (B) circumvent the clear intention of Congress to \n                preclude the extended filling of certain vacancies and \n                provide for the temporary filling of such vacancies; \n                and\n                    (C) subvert the constitutional authority and \n                responsibility of the Senate to advise and consent in \n                certain appointments;\n            (7) it is necessary to further clarify the intention of \n        Congress to reject the interpretation of the Attorney General \n        by modernizing the intricate language of the long-standing \n        Vacancies Act; and\n            (8) to ensure compliance by the executive branch with the \n        Vacancies Act, the Act needs an express enforcement mechanism.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL VACANCIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 33 of title 5, United States Code, is \namended by striking sections 3345 through 3349 and inserting the \nfollowing:\n``Sec. 3345.
