FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Approximately 5,300,000 Americans are chronically \n        infected with the hepatitis B virus (referred to in this \n        section as ``HBV''), the hepatitis C virus (referred to in this \n        section as ``HCV''), or both.\n            (2) In the United States, chronic HBV and HCV are the most \n        common cause of liver cancer, one of the most lethal and \n        fastest growing cancers in the United States. Chronic HBV and \n        HCV are the most common cause of chronic liver disease, liver \n        cirrhosis, and the most common indication for liver \n        transplantation. Chronic HCV is also a leading cause of death \n        in Americans living with HIV/AIDS, many of whom are coinfected \n        with chronic HBV, HCV, or both. At least 15,000 deaths per year \n        in the United States can be attributed to chronic HBV and HCV.\n            (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention (referred to in this section as the ``CDC''), \n        approximately 2 percent of the population of the United States \n        is living with chronic HBV, HCV, or both. The CDC has \n        recognized HCV as the Nation's most common chronic bloodborne \n        virus infection and HBV as the deadliest vaccine-preventable \n        disease.\n            (4) HBV is easily transmitted and is 100 times more \n        infectious than HIV. According to the CDC, HBV is transmitted \n        through percutaneous (i.e., puncture through the skin) or \n        mucosal contact with infectious blood or body fluids. HCV is \n        transmitted by percutaneous exposures to infectious blood.\n            (5) The CDC conservatively estimates that in 2008 \n        approximately 18,000 Americans were newly infected with HCV and \n        more than 38,000 Americans were newly infected with HBV.\n            (6) There were 10 outbreaks reported to CDC for \n        investigation in 2009 related to healthcare acquired infection \n        of HBV and HCV. There were another 6,748 patients potentially \n        exposed to one of the viruses.\n            (7) Chronic HBV and chronic HCV usually do not cause \n        symptoms early in the course of the disease, but after many \n        years of a clinically ``silent'' phase, CDC estimates show more \n        than 33 percent of infected individuals will develop cirrhosis, \n        end-stage liver disease, or liver cancer. Since most \n        individuals with chronic HBV, HCV, or both are unaware of their \n        infection, they do not know to take precautions to prevent the \n        spread of their infection and can unknowingly exacerbate their \n        own disease progression.\n            (8) HBV and HCV disproportionately affect certain \n        populations in the United States. Although representing only 5 \n        percent of the population, Asian and Pacific Islanders account \n        for over half of the 1,400,000 domestic chronic HBV cases. Baby \n        boomers (those born between 1945 and 1965) account for more \n        than 75 percent of domestic chronic HCV cases. In addition, \n        African-Americans, Latinos (Latinas), and American Indian/\n        Native Alaskans are among the groups which have \n        disproportionately high rates of HBV infections, HCV \n        infections, or both in the United States.\n            (9) For both chronic HBV and chronic HCV, behavioral \n        changes can slow disease progression if diagnosis is made \n        early. Early diagnosis, which is determined through simple \n        diagnostic tests, can reduce the risk of transmission and \n        disease progression through education and vaccination of \n        household members and other susceptible persons at risk.\n            (10) Advancements have led to the development of improved \n        diagnostic tests for viral hepatitis. These tests, including \n        rapid, point of care testing and others in development can \n        facilitate testing, notification of results and post-test \n        counseling, and referral to care at the time of the testing \n        visit. In particular, these tests are also advantageous because \n        they can be used simultaneously with HIV rapid testing for \n        persons at risk for both HCV and HIV infections.\n            (11) For those chronically infected with HBV or HCV, \n        regular monitoring can lead to the early detection of liver \n        cancer at a stage where a cure is still possible. Liver cancer \n        is the second deadliest cancer in the United States however, \n        liver cancer has received little funding for research, \n        prevention, or treatment.\n            (12) Treatment for chronic HCV can eradicate the disease in \n        approximately 75 percent of those currently treated. The \n        treatment of chronic HBV can effectively suppress viral \n        replication in the overwhelming majority (over 80 percent) of \n        those treated thereby reducing the risk of transmission and \n        progression to liver scarring or liver cancer even though a \n        complete cure is much less common than for HCV.\n            (13) To combat the viral hepatitis epidemic in the United \n        States, in May 2011, the Department of Health and Human \n        Services released, Combating the Silent Epidemic of Viral \n        Hepatitis: Action Plan for the Prevention, Care & Treatment of \n        Viral Hepatitis. The Institute of Medicine of the National \n        Academies produced a 2010 report on the Federal response to HBV \n        and HCV titled: Hepatitis and Liver Cancer: A National Strategy \n        for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis B and C. The \n        recommendations and guidelines provide a framework for HBV and \n        HCV prevention, education, control, research, and medical \n        management programs.\n            (14) The annual health care costs attributable to viral \n        hepatitis in the United States are significant. For HBV, it is \n        estimated to be approximately $2,500,000,000 ($2,000 per \n        infected person). In 2000, the lifetime cost of HBV--before the \n        availability of most of the current therapies--was \n        approximately $80,000 per chronically infected person, or more \n        than $100,000,000,000. For HCV, medical costs for patients are \n        expected to increase from $30,000,000,000 in 2009 to over \n        $85,000,000,000 in 2024. Avoiding these costs by screening and \n        diagnosing individuals earlier--and connecting them to \n        appropriate treatment and care will save lives and critical \n        health care dollars. Currently, without a comprehensive \n        screening, testing and diagnosis program, most patients are \n        diagnosed too late when they need a liver transplant costing at \n        least $314,000 for uncomplicated cases or when they have liver \n        cancer or end stage liver disease which costs between $30,980 \n        to $110,576 per hospital admission. As health care costs \n        continue to grow, it is critical that the Federal Government \n        invests in effective mechanisms to avoid documented cost \n        drivers.\n            (15) According to the Institute of Medicine report in 2010 \n        (described in paragraph (13)), chronic HBV and HCV infections \n        cause substantial morbidity and mortality despite being \n        preventable and treatable. Deficiencies in the implementation \n        of established guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and \n        medical management of chronic HBV and HCV infections perpetuate \n        personal and economic burdens. Existing grants are not \n        sufficient for the scale of the health burden presented by HBV \n        and HCV.\n            (16) Screening and testing for chronic HBV and HCV are \n        aligned with the Healthy People 2020 goal to increase \n        immunization rates and reduce preventable infectious diseases. \n        Awareness of disease and access to prevention and treatment \n        remain essential components for reducing infectious disease \n        transmission.\n            (17) Federal support is necessary to increase knowledge and \n        awareness of HBV and HCV and to assist State and local \n        prevention and control efforts in reducing the morbidity and \n        mortality of these epidemics.\n            (18) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the \n        discretion to carry out this Act directly and through whichever \n        of the agencies of the Public Health Service the Secretary \n        determines to be appropriate, which may (in the Secretary's \n        discretion) include the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration, \n        the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, \n        the National Institutes of Health (including the National \n        Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities), and other \n        agencies of such Service.\n\nSEC. 3.
