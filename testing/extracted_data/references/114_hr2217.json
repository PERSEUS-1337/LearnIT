FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Neglect, hunger, abuse, and other forms of trauma \n        present significant challenges to young children's learning and \n        social-emotional development.\n            (2) Trauma-informed and trauma-sensitive caregiving is an \n        ideal targeted intervention for vulnerable children who \n        experience trauma.\n            (3) A child's development relies significantly on the \n        development of executive function skills, including cognitive \n        flexibility, self-regulation, and effortful control and \n        attention.\n            (4) Focusing on these skills, even though they are not \n        obviously academic, is critical in order to improve children's \n        long-term outcomes.\n            (5) Providing high-quality early childhood education can \n        protect young children from some of the most adverse effects of \n        poverty, enable their healthy development, strengthen their \n        health, and reduce or mediate toxic stress responses to adverse \n        experiences.\n            (6) Robust support, professional development, and \n        specialized training for the early education and care workforce \n        is essential to providing a high-quality early education to \n        every child.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS.\n\n    Section 648 of the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9843) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(3)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (A)--\n                            (i) in clause (ii) by striking ``and'' at \n                        the end,\n                            (ii) in clause (iii) by striking ``and'' at \n                        the end, and\n                            (iii) by adding at the end the following:\n                            ``(iv) activities that support the \n                        implementation of evidence-based trauma-\n                        informed practices, age-appropriate positive \n                        behavioral interventions and supports, early \n                        childhood mental health consultation, and \n                        prevention of suspension and expulsion; and\n                            ``(v) activities that appropriately \n                        increase the level of coordination between Head \n                        Start agencies and other programs that serve \n                        very young children, in order to increase the \n                        general quality, availability, and reliability \n                        of services provided; and'',\n                    (B) in subparagraph (B)--\n                            (i) in clause (xv) by striking ``and'' at \n                        the end,\n                            (ii) in clause (xvi) by striking the period \n                        at the end and inserting ``; and'', and\n                            (iii) by adding at the end the following:\n                            ``(xvii) assist Head Start agencies in \n                        adopting evidence-based approaches to best \n                        identify and serve children whose experiences \n                        have elicited a toxic stress response.'',\n            (2) in subsection (b)(2)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (F) by striking ``and'' at the \n                end,\n                    (B) in subparagraph (G) by striking the period at \n                the end and inserting a semicolon, and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(H) in evidence-based trauma-informed practices, \n                as well as early childhood mental health consultation \n                and age-appropriate positive behavioral interventions \n                and supports; and\n                    ``(I) in helping children who have experienced, or \n                are experiencing, trauma or toxic stress.'', and\n            (3) in subsection (d)(1)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (G) by striking ``and children \n                under 3 years of age, where applicable'' and inserting \n                ``children who experience trauma, and children under 3 \n                years of age, especially for whom such experiences have \n                caused a toxic stress response, including appropriate \n                training and professional development on evidence-based \n                trauma-informed practices and early childhood mental \n                health consultation'',\n                    (B) by redesignating subparagraph (I) as \n                subparagraph (J), and\n                    (C) by inserting after subparagraph (H) the \n                following:\n                    ``(I) Activities designed to prevent suspension and \n                expulsion and to increase utilization of age-\n                appropriate positive behavioral interventions and \n                supports.''."
