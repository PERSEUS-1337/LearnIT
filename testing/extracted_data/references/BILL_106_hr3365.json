PREKINDERGARTEN PROGRAM.\n\n    Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                   ``PART L--PREKINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS\n\n``SEC. 10995A. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Countless studies have shown what every parent \n        already knows: High-quality preschool education programs work. \n        They prepare children to learn when they go to school, and the \n        programs increase the success of students throughout their \n        lives.\n            ``(2) Children who get a high-quality prekindergarten \n        education are more likely to increase their overall IQ, improve \n        their results on achievement tests, and increase their chances \n        of graduating from high school and pursuing some form of higher \n        education. These same children are less likely to repeat a \n        grade level and have less need for special education \n        instruction than those with no preschool background, thus \n        saving local educational agencies funds that might otherwise be \n        necessary to provide special education instruction.\n            ``(3) Prekindergarten education makes an enormous \n        difference in the lives of children from lower-income families. \n        The following specific results were found for children eligible \n        for Head Start services or child care assistance, children who \n        belong to a single parent, 2-child families earning less than \n        $22,000 per year, or families of 4 earning less than $31,000 \n        per year--\n                    ``(A) 29 percent of the children who attended \n                prekindergarten program were employed in jobs paying \n                over $2,000 by age 27, as opposed to 7 percent of those \n                from the same income group who did not receive \n                prekindergarten education.\n                    ``(B) Only 57 percent of the children who attended \n                a prekindergarten program grew up to become single \n                mothers, as opposed to 83 percent of the same income \n                group who did not attend a prekindergarten program.\n                    ``(C) 36 percent of the children who attended a \n                prekindergarten program grew up to own their own homes, \n                as opposed to only 13 percent of the same income group \n                who did not attend such a program.\n                    ``(D) Less than 13 percent of the boys in the group \n                who attended a prekindergarten program grew up to be \n                arrested 5 or more times, as opposed to 49 percent of \n                the boys from the same income group who did not attend \n                a prekindergarten program.\n\n``SEC. 10995B.
