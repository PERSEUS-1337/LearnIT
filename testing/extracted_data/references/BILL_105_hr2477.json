FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Voting participation in the United States is lower than \n        in any other advanced industrialized democracy.\n            (2) The rights of eligible citizens to seek election to \n        office, vote for candidates of their choice and associate for \n        the purpose of taking part in elections, including the right to \n        create and develop new political parties, are fundamental in a \n        democracy. The rights of citizens to participate in the \n        election process, provided in and derived from the first and \n        fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, have consistently \n        been promoted and protected by the Federal Government. These \n        rights include the right to cast an effective vote and the \n        right to associate for the advancement of political beliefs, \n        which includes the ``constitutional right . . . to create and \n        develop new political parties.'' Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, \n        112 S.Ct. 699 (1992). It is the duty of the Federal Government \n        to see that these rights are not impaired in elections for \n        Federal office.\n            (3) Certain restrictions on access to the ballot impair the \n        ability of citizens to exercise these rights and have a direct \n        and damaging effect on citizens' participation in the electoral \n        process.\n            (4) Many States unduly restrict access to the ballot by \n        nonmajor party candidates and nonmajor political parties by \n        means of such devices as excessive petition signature \n        requirements, insufficient petitioning periods, \n        unconstitutionally early petition filing deadlines, petition \n        signature distribution criteria, and limitations on eligibility \n        to circulate and sign petitions.\n            (5) Many States require political parties to poll an unduly \n        high number of votes or to register an unduly high number of \n        voters as a precondition for remaining on the ballot.\n            (6) In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional an \n        Ohio law requiring a nonmajor party candidate for President to \n        qualify for the general election ballot earlier than major \n        party candidates. This Supreme Court decision, Anderson v. \n        Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983) has been followed by many lower \n        courts in challenges by nonmajor parties and candidates to \n        early petition filing deadlines. See, e.g., Stoddard v. Quinn, \n        593 F. Supp. 300 (D.Me. 1984); Cripps v. Seneca County Board of \n        Elections, 629 F. Supp. 1335 (N.D.Oh. 1985); Libertarian Party \n        of Nevada v. Swackhamer, 638 F. Supp. 565 (D. Nev. 1986); \n        Cromer v. State of South Carolina, 917 F.2d 819 (4th Cir. \n        1990); New Alliance Party of Alabama v. Hand, 933 F. 2d 1568 \n        (11th Cir. 1991).\n            (7) In 1996, 34 States required nonmajor party candidates \n        for President to qualify for the ballot before the second major \n        party national convention (Arizona, California, Colorado, \n        Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, \n        Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, \n        Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New \n        Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, \n        Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, \n        Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and \n        Wyoming). Twenty-six of these States required nonmajor party \n        candidates to qualify before the first major party national \n        convention (Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \n        Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, \n        Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New \n        Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, \n        South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and West \n        Virginia).\n            (8) Under present law, in 1996, nonmajor party candidates \n        for President were required to obtain at least 701,089 petition \nsignatures to be listed on the ballots of all 50 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia--28 times more signatures than the 25,500 required \nof Democratic Party candidates and 13 times more signatures than the \n54,250 required of Republican Party candidates. To be listed on the \nballot in all 50 States and the District of Columbia with a party \nlabel, nonmajor party candidates for President were required to obtain \napproximately 651,475 petition signatures and 89,186 registrants. \nThirty-two of the 41 States that hold Presidential primaries required \nno signatures of major party candidates for President (Arkansas, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, \nMississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North \nCarolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, \nSouth Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, \nWisconsin). Only three States required no signatures of nonmajor party \ncandidates for President (Arkansas, Colorado, and Louisiana; Colorado \nand Louisiana, however, required a $500 filing fee).\n            (9) Under present law, the number of petition signatures \n        required by the States to list a major party candidate for \n        Senate on the ballot in 1996 ranged from zero to 15,000. The \n        number of petition signatures required to list a nonmajor party \n        candidate for Senate ranged from zero to 196,788. Thirty-one \n        States required no signatures of major party candidates for \n        Senate (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, \n        Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, \n        Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, \n        Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North \n        Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, \n        Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming). Only one \n        State required no signatures of nonmajor party candidates for \n        Senate, provided they were willing to be listed on the ballot \n        without a party label (Louisiana, although a $600 filing fee \n        was required, and to run with a party label, a candidate was \n        required to register 111,121 voters into his or her party).\n            (10) Under present law, the number of petition signatures \n        required by the States to list a major party candidate for \n        Congress on the ballot in 1996 ranged from zero to 2,000. The \n        number of petition signatures required to list a nonmajor party \n        candidate for Congress ranged from zero to 13,653. Thirty-one \n        States required no signatures of major party candidates for \n        Congress (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, \n        Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, \n        Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, \n        Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, \n        Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Washington, West \n        Virginia, Wyoming). Only one State required no signatures of \n        nonmajor party candidates for Congress, provided they are \n        willing to be listed on the ballot without a party label \n        (Louisiana, although a $600 filing fee was required).\n            (11) Under present law, in 1996, eight States required \n        additional signatures to list a nonmajor party candidate for \n        President on the ballot with a party label (Alabama, Arizona, \n        Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Tennessee). \n        Thirteen States required additional signatures to list a \n        nonmajor party candidate for Senate or Congress on the ballot \n        with a party label (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, \n        Idaho, Hawaii, Kansas, Louisiana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, \n        Oregon, Tennessee). Two of these States (Ohio and Tennessee) \n        required 5,000 signatures and 25 signatures, respectively, to \n        list a nonmajor party candidate for President or Senate on the \n        ballot in 1996, but required 33,463 signatures and 37,179 \n        signatures, respectively, to list the candidate on the ballot \n        with her or his party label. One State (California) required a \n        nonmajor party to have 89,006 registrants in order to have its \n        candidate for President listed on the ballot with a party \n        label.\n            (12) Under present law, in 1996 one State (California) \n        required nonmajor party candidates for President or Senate to \n        obtain 147,238 signatures in 105 days, but required major party \n        candidates for Senate to obtain only 65 signatures in 105 days, \n        and required no signatures of major party candidates for \n        President. Another State (Texas) required nonmajor party \n        candidates for President or Senate to obtain 43,963 signatures \n        in 75 days, and required no signatures of major party \n        candidates for President or Senate.\n            (13) Under present law, in 1996, seven States required \n        nonmajor party candidates for President or Senate to collect a \n        certain number or percentage of their petition signatures in \n        each congressional district or in a specified number of \n        congressional districts (Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New \n        Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Virginia). Only three of \n        these States impose a like requirement on major party \n        candidates for President or Senate (Michigan, New York, \n        Virginia).\n            (14) Under present law, in 1996, 20 States restricted the \n        circulation of petitions for nonmajor party candidates to \n        residents of those States (California, Colorado, Connecticut, \n        District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, \n        Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, \n        Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, \n        Wisconsin). Two States restricted the circulation of petitions \n        for nonmajor party candidates to the county or congressional \n        district where the circulator lives (Kansas and Virginia).\n            (15) Under present law, in 1996, three States prohibited \n        people who voted in a primary election from signing petitions \n        for nonmajor party candidates (Nebraska, New York, Texas, West \n        Virginia). Twelve States restricted the signing of petitions to \n        people who indicate intent to support or vote for the candidate \n        or party (California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, \n        Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, \nUtah). Five of these 12 States required no petitions of major party \ncandidates (Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah), and only \none of the six remaining States restricted the signing of petitions for \nmajor party candidates to people who indicate intent to support or vote \nfor the candidate or party (New Jersey).\n            (16) In two States (Louisiana and Maryland), no nonmajor \n        party candidate for Senate has qualified for the ballot since \n        those States' ballot access laws have been in effect.\n            (17) In two States (Georgia and Louisiana), no nonmajor \n        party candidate for the United States House of Representatives \n        has qualified for the ballot since those States' ballot access \n        laws have been in effect.\n            (18) Restrictions on the ability of citizens to exercise \n        the rights identified in this subsection have \n        disproportionately impaired participation in the electoral \n        process by various groups, including racial minorities.\n            (19) The establishment of fair and uniform national \n        standards for access to the ballot in elections for Federal \n        office would remove barriers to the participation of citizens \n        in the electoral process and thereby facilitate such \n        participation and maximize the rights identified in this \n        subsection.\n            (20) The Congress has authority, under the provisions of \n        the Constitution of the United States in sections 4 and 8 of \n        article I, section 1 of article II, article VI, the thirteenth, \n        fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments, and other provisions of \n        the Constitution of the United States, to protect and promote \n        the exercise of the rights identified in this subsection.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish fair and uniform standards regulating \n        access to the ballot by eligible citizens who desire to seek \n        election to Federal office and political parties, bodies, and \n        groups which desire to take part in elections for Federal \n        office; and\n            (2) to maximize the participation of eligible citizens in \n        elections for Federal office.\n\nSEC. 3. BALLOT ACCESS RIGHTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--An individual shall have the right to be placed as \na candidate on, and to have such individual's political party, body, or \ngroup affiliation in connection with such candidacy placed on, a ballot \nor similar voting materials to be used in a Federal election, if--\n            (1) such individual presents a petition stating in \n        substance that its signers desire such individual's name and \n        political party, body or group affiliation, if any, to be \n        placed on the ballot or other similar voting materials to be \n        used in the Federal election with respect to which such rights \n        are to be exercised;\n            (2) with respect to a Federal election for the office of \n        President, Vice President, or Senator, such petition has a \n        number of signatures of persons qualified to vote for such \n        office equal to one-tenth of one percent of the number of \n        persons who voted in the most recent previous Federal election \n        for such office in the State, or 1,000 signatures, whichever is \n        greater;\n            (3) with respect to a Federal election for the office of \n        Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the \n        Congress, such petition has a number of signatures of persons \n        qualified to vote for such office equal to one-half of one \n        percent of the number of persons who voted in the most recent \n        previous Federal election for such office, or, if there was no \n        previous Federal election for such office, 1,000 signatures;\n            (4) with respect to a Federal election the date of which \n        was fixed 345 or more days in advance, such petition was \n        circulated during a period beginning on the 345th day and \n        ending on the 75th day before the date of the election; and\n            (5) with respect to a Federal election the date of which \n        was fixed less than 345 days in advance, such petition was \n        circulated during a period established by the State holding the \n        election, or, if no such period was established, during a \n        period beginning on the day after the date the election was \n        scheduled and ending on the tenth day before the date of the \n        election, provided, however, that the number of signatures \n        required under paragraph (2) or (3) shall be reduced by \\1/270\\ \n        for each day less than 270 in such period.\n    (b) Special Rule.--An individual shall have the right to be placed \nas a candidate on, and to have such individual's political party, body, \nor group affiliation in connection with such candidacy placed on, a \nballot or similar voting materials to be used in a Federal election, \nwithout having to satisfy any requirement relating to a petition under \nsubsection (a), if that or another individual, as a candidate of that \npolitical party, body, or group, received one percent of the votes cast \nin the most recent general Federal election for President or Senator in \nthe State.\n    (c) Savings Provision.--Subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply \nwith respect to any State that provides by law for greater ballot \naccess rights than the ballot access rights provided for under such \nsubsections.\n\nSEC. 4.
