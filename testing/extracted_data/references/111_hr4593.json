    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Keeping Faith With the Greatest \nGeneration Military Retirees Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) No statutory health care program existed for members of \n        the uniformed services who entered service prior to December 7, \n        1956, and retired after serving a minimum of 20 years.\n            (2) Recruiters, re-enlistment counselors, and officers at \n        all levels of the uniformed services, and other government \n        officials, as agents of the United States Government, used \n        recruiting tactics that allowed members who entered the \n        uniformed services prior to December 7, 1956, to believe they \n        would be entitled to fully paid lifetime health care upon \n        retirement.\n            (3) In the decision of Schism v. United States (No. 99-\n        1402) on November 18, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals \n        for the Federal Circuit said: ``[W]e must affirm the district \n        court's judgment and can do no more than hope Congress will \n        make good on the promises recruiters made in good faith to \n        plaintiffs and others of the World War II and Korean War era--\n        from 1941 to 1956, when Congress enacted its first health care \n        insurance act for military members, excluding older retirees. . \n        . . We cannot readily imagine more sympathetic plaintiffs than \n        the retired officers of the World War II and Korean War era \n        involved in this case. They served their country for at least \n        20 years with the understanding that when they retired they and \n        their dependents would receive full free health care for life. \n        The promise of such health care was made in good faith and \n        relied upon. Again, however, because no authority existed to \n        make such promises in the first place, and because Congress has \n        never ratified or acquiesced to this promise, we have no \n        alternative but to uphold the judgment against the retirees' \n        breach-of-contract claim. . . . Perhaps Congress will consider \n        using its legal power to address the moral claims raised by \n        [the plaintiffs] on their own behalf, and indirectly for other \n        affected retirees.''.\n            (4) Only the United States Congress can make good on the \n        promises recruiters made in good faith to plaintiffs and others \n        of the World War II and Korean War era.\n\nSEC. 3. WAIVER OF MEDICARE PART B PREMIUM FOR CERTAIN MILITARY \n              RETIREES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1839 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395r) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(2), by striking ``The monthly \n        premium'' and inserting ``Except as provided in subsection (j), \n        the monthly premium''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(j)(1) The amount of the monthly premium for an eligible \nindividual enrolled under this part is equal to $0.\n    ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term `eligible individual' \nmeans--\n            ``(A) an individual who is entitled to retired or retainer \n        pay based upon service in the uniformed services (as defined in \n        section 101 of title 10, United States Code) that began before \n        December 7, 1956;\n            ``(B) the spouse (as determined under section 7703 of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986) of an individual described in \n        subparagraph (A); and\n            ``(C) the widow or widower, as the case may be, of an \n        individual described in subparagraph (A).\n    ``(3) With respect to years beginning after the date of the \nenactment of this subsection, the monthly premium rate calculated under \nsubsection (a)(3) for individuals enrolled under this part who are not \neligible individuals under this subsection shall be determined without \nregard to benefits and administrative costs attributable to such \neligible individuals during such years.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subsection (i) of such section is \namended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(7) Inapplicability to certain military retirees.--This \n        subsection shall not apply to eligible individuals (as defined \n        in subsection (j)(2)).''.\n    (c) Effective Date; Rebate Mechanism.--\n            (1) In general.--The amendments made by this section shall \n        apply to premiums for months beginning on or after the date \n        that is 45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Rebate method.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services shall use the rebate method established pursuant to \n        section 625(a)(2) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, \n        Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173, \n        117 Stat. 2318) to provide rebates to eligible individuals (as \n        defined in subsection (j)(2) of section 1839 of the Social \n        Security Act, as added by subsection (a)) of any premium or \n        premium penalty paid under such section for months described in \n        paragraph (1)."
