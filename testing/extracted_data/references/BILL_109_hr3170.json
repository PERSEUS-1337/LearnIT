FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) For purposes of animal health investigation and \n        surveillance, there needs to be an identification system that \n        can trace animals from the time of first movement of the animal \n        from its original premise to the time of slaughter of the \n        animal in less than 48 hours.\n            (2) The beef industry estimates that the United States \n        cattle industry lost approximately $3,000,000,000 in export \n        value on beef, beef variety meats, hides, and tallow during the \n        12 months since a December 2003 diagnosis in the United States \n        of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. A livestock identification \n        system may have prevented some of this loss.\n            (3) In order to be as efficient as possible, the livestock \n        identification system needs to be automated and electronic with \n        participants using compatible technologies.\n            (4) The livestock identification system needs to be \n        flexible enough to adapt to changes in technology and to the \n        demands of the industry and the markets.\n            (5) The best technology available should be used for the \n        livestock identification system while still allowing for \n        registration into the system for livestock owners who are \n        economically disadvantaged.\n            (6) Confidentiality of information on animal movements, \n        sales, and ownership is necessary to ensure that livestock \n        owners have the confidence to comply with and fully participate \n        in the livestock identification system.\n            (7) Besides animal disease surveillance, the livestock \n        identification system should provide a commercial information \n        exchange infrastructure that would allow for enhanced marketing \n        opportunities.\n\nSEC. 3. LIVESTOCK IDENTIFICATION BOARD.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established a board to be known as the \n``Livestock Identification Board''.\n    (b) Duties.--The duties of the Board shall be to--\n            (1) establish and maintain an electronic livestock \n        identification system that--\n                    (A) is capable of tracing all livestock in the \n                United States from the time of first movement of the \n                livestock from its original premise to the time of \n                slaughter of such livestock in less than 48 hours;\n                    (B) tracks all relevant information about the \n                livestock, including--\n                            (i) the livestock identification number or \n                        the group or lot identification number for the \n                        livestock, as applicable;\n                            (ii) the date the livestock identification \n                        number or the group or lot identification \n                        number was assigned;\n                            (iii) the premise identification number;\n                            (iv) the species of the livestock;\n                            (v) the date of birth of the livestock, to \n                        the extent possible;\n                            (vi) the sex of the livestock;\n                            (vii) any other information the Board \n                        considers appropriate for animal disease \n                        surveillance;
