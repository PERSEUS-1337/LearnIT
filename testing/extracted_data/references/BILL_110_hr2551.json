FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress strongly supports providing every honorably \n        discharged veteran the opportunity to be buried in a national \n        veterans cemetery in recognition of their sacrifices for the \n        freedoms enjoyed by every United States citizen;\n            (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs has determined that \n        a population threshold of 170,000 eligible people living within \n        a 75-mile service radius is appropriate to merit the \n        establishment of a new national cemetery in areas of greatest \n        need nationwide.\n            (3) Although the Department of Veterans Affairs estimates a \n        projected veterans population of 133,000 within a 75-mile \n        radius of the city of Bellevue, Nebraska, an independent \n        analysis conducted by the Metropolitan Area Planning Agency \n        located in Omaha, Nebraska, concluded that 172,500 people who \n        reside within a 75-mile radius of Bellevue would be eligible to \n        be buried in a national cemetery.\n            (4) Congress has consistently authorized the construction \n        of six new national cemeteries every four years since 1999, \n        with the first six established by the Veterans Millennium \n        Health Care and Benefits Act (Public Law 106-117) and the next \n        six established by the National Cemetery Expansion Act of 2003 \n        (Public Law 108-109).\n            (5) The 2002 independent ``Future Burial Needs'' report \n        completed for the Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to \n        section 613 of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits \n        Act recommended Omaha, Nebraska as a location for a new \n        national cemetery to be built in 2005.\n            (6) The Midwest Health Care Network of the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs, which is responsible for the provision of \n        health care for veterans residing in Iowa and Nebraska, \n        currently serves a high population of aging veterans.\n            (7) Major veterans and military advocacy organizations \n        endorse the establishment of a national cemetery to serve \n        veterans and their family members in eastern Nebraska and \n        western Iowa, including the Nebraska Department of Disabled \n        American Veterans, the Heartland of America Chapter of the \n        Military Officers Association of America, the Great Plains \n        Chapter of Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Nebraska \n        Department of Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Nebraska chapter of \n        Vietnam Veterans of America, the Nebraska Military Order of the \n        Purple Heart, the Nebraska State Air Force Association, the Air \n        Force Sergeants Association, Chapter 984, the Nebraska \n        Department of the American Legion, the Forty & Eight Charitable \n        Veterans, the Nebraska chapter of the American Ex-Prisoners of \n        War, the Nebraska chapter of Gold Star Wives, the Korean War \n        Veterans Association, Nebraska Chapter 1, the Marine Corps \n        League in Nebraska, and the Nebraska Department of American \n        Veterans.\n            (8) Such organizations represent a combined membership of \n        at least 85,700 veterans and military advocates in the State of \n        Nebraska.\n\nSEC. 2.
