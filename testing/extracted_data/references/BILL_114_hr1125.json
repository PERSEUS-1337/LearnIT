FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Studies indicate that children as young as 3 years old \n        are able to grasp financial concepts and that basic financial \n        habits are largely formulated by age 7.\n            (2) Research shows that children born to low-income parents \n        who are good financial savers are more likely to move up the \n        economic ladder than children from low-income households that \n        do not save. According to a 2011 study controlled for income \n        and demographic factors, youth who own financial accounts are 7 \n        times more likely to attend college.\n            (3) If tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as Roth IRAs \n        could be opened for children between the ages of zero and 18, \n        these individuals are likely to acquire substantially more tax-\n        free assets by retirement age than their peers.\n            (4) Children who possess retirement accounts from a young \n        age will benefit from longer exposure to compound interest and \n        can be expected to attain higher levels of financial literacy, \n        college graduation and retirement security in adulthood.\n            (5) Greater private retirement savings for Americans of all \n        ages will increase personal financial security and \n        responsibility, reducing the likelihood that seniors will need \n        to rely solely on Social Security for their retirement income.\n            (6) Federal policy should better enable parents, guardians \n        and families of all income levels to encourage youth saving and \n        investment for retirement at an earlier age.\n            (7) Federal policy should help create retirement savings \n        incentives for low-income Americans because studies show that \n        low-income Americans will save more for retirement if there are \n        incentives and structures in place to help them do so. A \n        refundable incentive like the Saver's Credit would reach 50 \n        million low-income households--nearly 10 times the number a \n        non-refundable credit reaches.\n\nSEC. 3. YOUNG SAVERS ACCOUNT.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Accounts.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code \n        of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(g) Young Savers Account.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in this subsection, a \n        young savers account shall be treated in the same manner as a \n        Roth IRA.\n            ``(2) Young savers account.--For purposes of this \n        subsection, the term `young savers account' means, with respect \n        to any taxable year, a Roth IRA which is maintained on behalf \n        of an individual who has not attained age 18 before the close \n        of the taxable year and which is designated (in such manner as \n        the Secretary may prescribe) at the time of establishment as a \n        young savers account.\n            ``(3) Contribution limits.--In the case of any \n        contributions for any taxable year to 1 or more young savers \n        accounts maintained on behalf of an individual, each of the \n        following contribution limits for the taxable year shall be \n        increased as follows:\n                    ``(A) The contribution limit applicable to the \n                individual under subsection (c)(2) shall be increased \n                by the aggregate amount of qualified young saver \n                contributions to such accounts for the taxable year.\n                    ``(B) The contribution limits applicable to the \n                young savers accounts under subsection (a)(1) or \n                (b)(2)(B) of section 408, whichever is applicable, \n                shall be increased by the deductible amount in effect \n                under section 219(b)(5) for such taxable year \n                (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) \n                thereof).\n            ``(4) Qualified young saver contributions.--For purposes of \n        this subsection--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The term `qualified young saver \n                contribution' means a contribution by an individual \n                (with respect to whom a young savers account is not \n                maintained during the taxable year) to a young savers \n                account maintained on behalf of another individual.\n                    ``(B) Limitations.--\n                            ``(i) Limit on accounts with respect to \n                        individual.--The aggregate amount of \n                        contributions which may be made for any taxable \n                        year to all young savers accounts maintained on \n                        behalf of an individual shall not exceed the \n                        deductible amount in effect for the taxable \n                        year under section 219(b)(5) (determined \n                        without regard to subparagraph (B) thereof).\n                            ``(ii) Limit on contributors.--The \n                        aggregate amount of qualified young saver \n                        contributions an individual may make for any \n                        taxable year to all young savers accounts shall \n                        not exceed the deductible amount in effect for \n                        the taxable year under section 219(b)(5) \n                        (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) \n                        thereof), reduced by any contributions made by \n                        or on behalf of the individual to any Roth IRA \n                        maintained on behalf of the individual.''.\n    (b) Eligible for Savers Credit.--Paragraph (1) of section 25B(d) of \nsuch Code is amended by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph \n(B)(ii), by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (C) and \ninserting ``, and'', and by adding at the end the following new \nsubparagraph:\n                    ``(D) the amount of any contribution to a young \n                savers account.''.\n    (c) Refund Payable to Young Savers Account.--\n            (1) In general.--Subchapter B of chapter 65 of the Internal \n        Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the \n        following new section:\n\n``SEC. 6433.
