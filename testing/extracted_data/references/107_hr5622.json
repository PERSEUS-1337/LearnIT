    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Trade Enhancement Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Recent financial crises affecting key trading partners \n        show that the health of the international economic system \n        depends on open, competitive markets.\n            (2) Resolution of these financial crises, which tend to \n        arise in relatively closed markets, depends on structural \n        reform.\n            (3) Restrictive foreign government polices, private \n        restraints, and collaborative public-private barriers \n        perpetuate an unacceptably large United States trade deficit \n        which is now once again growing sharply.\n            (4) More broadly, import barriers in major foreign markets \n        injure United States industries by restricting United States \n        exports, by creating profit sanctuaries which serve as \n        platforms for injurious dumping, and by causing shipments from \n        third countries to be diverted to the United States market.\n            (5) The agreements adopted by the World Trade Organization \n        do not currently provide a basis to address sophisticated \n        methods of blocking market access and effective competition in \n        a foreign market, particularly the growing number of joint \n        public-private market access barriers, including nontransparent \n        forms of regulation, which impose a substantial burden on \n        United States and world commerce.\n            (6) Partially as a result of changes effected by the \n        agreements adopted by the World Trade Organization, section 301 \n        of the Trade Act of 1974 does not currently address private and \n        joint public-private market access barriers as effectively as \n        it should.\n            (7)(A) The limitations of the investigative abilities of \n        the United States Trade Representative were highlighted in the \n        investigation conducted under section 301 of the Trade Act of \n        1974 of the wheat trade practices of the Canadian Wheat Board.\n            (B) In the case referred to in subparagraph (A), the Trade \n        Representative concluded that not only did Canada grant the \n        Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) ``special monopoly rights and \n        privileges which disadvantage United States wheat farmers'', \n        but the CWB also ``refused to provide USTR certain necessary \n        information'' for the section 301 investigation.\n\n   TITLE I--FOREIGN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE MARKET ACCESS BARRIERS\n\nSEC. 101. AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 301(D) OF THE TRADE ACT OF 1974.\n\n    (a) Unjustifiable Acts, Policies, and Practices.--Section \n301(d)(4)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411(d)(4)(A)) is \namended to read as follows:\n            ``(4)(A) An act, policy, or practice is unjustifiable if \n        the act, policy, or practice--\n                    ``(i) is in violation of, or inconsistent with, the \n                international legal rights of the United States; or\n                    ``(ii) constitutes fostering by a foreign \n                government of systematic anticompetitive activities by \n                persons or among persons in one or more foreign \n                countries that have the effect of restricting, on a \n                basis that is inconsistent with commercial \n                considerations, access of United States goods or \n                services to a foreign market or diverting foreign goods \n                or services toward the United States market.''.\n    (b) Unreasonable Acts, Policies, and Practices.--Section \n301(d)(3)(B)(i)(IV) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n2411(d)(3)(B)(i)(IV)) is amended to read as follows:\n                            ``(IV) market opportunities, including the \n                        toleration by a foreign government of \n                        systematic anticompetitive activities by \n                        persons or among persons in one or more foreign \n                        countries that have the effect of restricting, \n                        on a basis that is inconsistent with commercial \n                        considerations, access of United States goods \n                        or services to a foreign market or diverting \n                        foreign goods or services toward the United \n                        States market.''.\n\nSEC. 102.
