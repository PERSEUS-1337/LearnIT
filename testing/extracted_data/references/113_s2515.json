FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Supreme Court's 1999 decision in Olmstead v. L.C., \n        527 U.S. 581 (1999), held that the unnecessary segregation of \n        individuals with disabilities is a violation of the Americans \n        with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.).\n            (2) Under Olmstead, individuals generally have the right to \n        receive their supports and services in home and community-based \n        settings, rather than in institutional settings, if they so \n        choose.\n            (3) Olmstead envisioned that States would provide \n        appropriate long-term services and supports to individuals with \n        disabilities through home and community-based services and end \n        forced segregation in nursing homes and other institutions.\n            (4) While there has been progress in rebalancing State \n        spending on individuals with disabilities in institutions as \n        compared to home and community-based settings, more than 75 \n        percent of States continue to spend the majority of their long-\n        term care dollars on nursing homes and other institutional \n        settings, and the number of individuals with disabilities under \n        age 65 in nursing homes increased between 2008 and 2012.\n            (5) As of June 2013, there were more than 200,000 \n        individuals younger than age 65 in nursing homes--almost 16 \n        percent of the total nursing home population.\n            (6) Thirty-eight studies published from 2005 to 2012 \n        concluded that providing services in home and community-based \n        settings is less costly than providing care in a nursing home \n        or other institutional setting.\n            (7) No clear or centralized reporting system exists to \n        compare how effectively States are meeting the Olmstead \n        mandate.\n\nSEC. 3. ENSURING MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE CARE IN A \n              HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SETTING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (80), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n            (2) in paragraph (81), by striking the period and inserting \n        ``; and''; and\n            (3) by inserting after paragraph (81) the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(82) in the case of any individual with respect to whom \n        there has been a determination that the individual requires the \n        level of care provided in a nursing facility, intermediate care \n        facility for the mentally retarded, institution for mental \n        disease, or other similarly restrictive or institutional \n        setting--\n                    ``(A) provide the individual with the choice and \n                opportunity to receive such care in a home and \n                community-based setting, including rehabilitative \n                services, assistance and support in accomplishing \n                activities of daily living, instrumental activities of \n                daily living, and health-related tasks, and assistance \n                in acquiring, maintaining, or enhancing skills \n                necessary to accomplish such activities, tasks, or \n                services;\n                    ``(B) ensure that each such individual has an equal \n                opportunity (when compared to the receipt and \n                availability of nursing facility services) to receive \n                care in a home and community-based setting, if the \n                individual so chooses, by ensuring that the provision \n                of such care in a home and community-based setting is \n                widely available on a statewide basis for all such \n                individuals within the State; and\n                    ``(C) meet the requirements of section 1904A \n                (relating to the provision of care in a home and \n                community-based setting).''.\n    (b) Requirements for Community Care Options.--Title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) is amended by inserting \nafter section 1904 the following new section:\n\n         ``provisions related to home and community-based care\n\n    ``Sec. 1904A.
