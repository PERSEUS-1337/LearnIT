117 Stat. 1411).\n    (b) Elements.--The study under subsection (a) shall address the \nfollowing:\n            (1) The state of the current intertheater airlift fleet of \n        the Air Force, including the extent to which the increased use \n        of heavy airlift aircraft in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation \n        Enduring Freedom, and other ongoing operations is affecting the \n        aging of the aircraft of that fleet.\n            (2) The adequacy of the current intertheater airlift force, \n        including whether or not the current target number of 301 \n        airframes for the Air Force heavy lift aircraft fleet will be \n        sufficient to support future expeditionary combat and non-\n        combat missions as well as domestic and training mission \n        demands consistent with the requirements of the National \n        Military Strategy.\n            (3) The optimal mix of C-5 aircraft and C-17 aircraft for \n        the intertheater airlift fleet of the Air Force, and any \n        appropriate mix of C-5 aircraft and C-17 aircraft for \n        intratheater airlift missions, including an assessment of the \n        following:\n                    (A) The cost advantages and disadvantages of \n                modernizing the C-5 aircraft fleet when compared with \n                procuring new C-17 aircraft, which assessment shall be \n                performed in concert with the Cost Analysis Improvement \n                Group and be based on program life cycle cost estimates \n                for the respective aircraft.\n                    (B) The military capability of the C-5 aircraft and \n                the C-17 aircraft, including number of lifetime flight \n                hours, cargo and passenger carrying capabilities, and \n                mission capable rates for such airframes. In the case \n                of assumptions for the C-5 aircraft, and any \n                assumptions made for the mission capable rates of the \n                C-17 aircraft, sensitivity analyses shall also be \n                conducted to test assumptions. The military capability \n                study for the C-5 aircraft shall also include an \n                assessment of the mission capable rates after each of \n                the following:\n                            (i) Successful completion of the Avionics \n                        Modernization Program (AMP) and the Reliability \n                        Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP).\n                            (ii) Partially successful completion of the \n                        Avionics Modernization Program and the \n                        Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining \n                        Program, with partially successful completion \n                        of either such program being considered the \n                        point at which the continued execution of such \n                        program is no longer supported by cost-benefit \n                        analysis.\n                    (C) The tactical capabilities of strategic airlift \n                aircraft, the potential increase in use of strategic \n                airlift aircraft for tactical missions, and the value \n                of such capabilities to tactical operations.\n                    (D) The value of having more than one type of \n                aircraft in the strategic airlift fleet, and the \n                potential need to pursue a replacement aircraft for the \n                C-5 aircraft that is larger than the C-17 aircraft.\n            (4) The means by which the Air Force was able to restart \n        the production line for the C-5 aircraft after having closed \n        the line for several years, and the actions to be taken to \n        ensure the production line for the C-17 aircraft could be \n        restarted if necessary, including--\n                    (A) an analysis of the costs of closing and re-\n                opening the production line for the C-5 aircraft; and\n                    (B) an assessment of the costs of closing and re-\n                opening the production line for the C-17 aircraft on a \n                similar basis.\n            (5) The financial effects of retiring, upgrading and \n        maintaining, or continuing current operations of the C-5A \n        aircraft fleet on procurement decisions relating to the C-17 \n        aircraft.\n            (6) The impact that increasing the role and use of \n        strategic airlift aircraft in intratheater operations will have \n        on the current target number for strategic airlift aircraft of \n        301 airframes, including an analysis of the following:\n                    (A) The appropriateness of using C-5 aircraft and \n                C-17 aircraft for intratheater missions, as well as the \n                efficacy of these aircraft to perform current and \n                projected future intratheater missions.\n                    (B) The interplay of existing doctrinal \n                intratheater airlift aircraft (such as the C-130 \n                aircraft and the future Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA)) \n                with an increasing role for C-5 aircraft and C-17 \n                aircraft in intratheater missions.\n                    (C) The most appropriate and likely missions for C-\n                5 aircraft and C-17 aircraft in intratheater operations \n                and the potential for increased requirements in these \n                mission areas.\n                    (D) Any intratheater mission sets best performed by \n                strategic airlift aircraft as opposed to traditional \n                intratheater airlift aircraft.\n                    (E) Any requirements for increased production or \n                longevity of C-5 aircraft and C-17 aircraft, or for a \n                new strategic airlift aircraft, in light of the matters \n                analyzed under this paragraph.\n            (7) Taking into consideration all applicable factors, \n        whether or not the replacement of C-5 aircraft with C-17 \n        aircraft on a one-for-one basis will result in the retention of \n        a comparable strategic airlift capability.\n    (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to \nexclude from the study under subsection (a) consideration of airlift \nassets other than the C-5 aircraft or C-17 aircraft that do or may \nprovide intratheater and intertheater airlift, including the potential \nthat such current or future assets may reduce requirements for C-5 \naircraft or C-17 aircraft.\n    (d) Collaboration With Transcom.--The federally funded research and \ndevelopment center selected under subsection (a) shall conduct the \nstudy required by that subsection and make the report required by \nsubsection (e) in concert with the United States Transportation \nCommand.\n    (e) Report by FFRDC.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than February 4, 2009, the \n        federally funded research and development center selected under \n        subsection (a) shall submit to the Secretary of Defense, the \n        congressional defense committees, and the Comptroller General \n        of the United States a report on the study required by \n        subsection (a).\n            (2) Review by gao.--Not later than 90 days after receipt of \n        the report under paragraph (1), the Comptroller General shall \n        submit to the congressional defense committee a report on the \n        study conducted under subsection (a) and the report under \n        paragraph (1).
