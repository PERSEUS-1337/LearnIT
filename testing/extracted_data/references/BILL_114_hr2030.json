FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human \n        carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a \n        substance;\n            (2) the International Agency for Research on Cancer has \n        classified asbestos as a class 1 human carcinogen;\n            (3) despite the enactment of the Asbestos Information Act \n        of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; Public Law 100-577), which sought \n        to improve transparency and public awareness of the presence of \n        asbestos in commercial materials and products, many people in \n        the United States still incorrectly believe that--\n                    (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; \n                and\n                    (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos \n                through the use of new commercial products;\n            (4) asbestos is still being imported and used, and is \n        otherwise present as a contaminant, in some consumer and \n        industrial products in the United States;\n            (5) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the \n        manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in \n        commerce of many asbestos-containing products are not banned in \n        the United States, including--\n                    (A) cement corrugated sheet;\n                    (B) cement flat sheet;\n                    (C) clothing;\n                    (D) pipeline wrap;\n                    (E) roofing felt;\n                    (F) vinyl floor tile;\n                    (G) cement shingle;\n                    (H) millboard;\n                    (I) cement pipe;\n                    (J) automatic transmission components;\n                    (K) clutch facings;\n                    (L) friction materials;\n                    (M) disc brake pads;\n                    (N) drum brake linings;\n                    (O) brake blocks;\n                    (P) gaskets;\n                    (Q) non-roofing coatings; and\n                    (R) roof coatings;\n            (6) consumers and workers are at risk of asbestos exposure, \n        and families of workers are also put at risk because of \n        asbestos brought home by the workers on the shoes, clothes, \n        skin, and hair of the workers;\n            (7) the Environmental Working Group estimates that as many \n        as 10,000 citizens of the United States die each year from \n        mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;\n            (8) the National Institutes of Health reported to Congress \n        that mesothelioma is a difficult disease to detect, diagnose, \n        and treat;\n            (9) mesothelioma responds poorly to conventional \n        chemotherapy, and although new combination treatments for \n        mesothelioma have demonstrated some benefits--\n                    (A) the median survival period for mesothelioma is \n                only 1 year after diagnosis of the disease; and\n                    (B) the majority of mesothelioma patients die \n                within 2 years of diagnosis of the disease; and\n            (10) until asbestos is completely banned from being used in \n        or imported into the United States, transparent and accessible \n        information about the location and identity of asbestos and \n        asbestos-containing products in the United States is necessary \n        to better protect consumers, workers, families, and the people \n        of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCT DATABASE.\n\n    The Asbestos Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; Public \nLaw 100-577) is amended--\n            (1) in section 4--\n                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (7) as \n                paragraphs (4) through (8), respectively; and\n                    (B) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n            ``(3) Asbestos-containing product.--The term `asbestos-\n        containing product' means any product (including any part) to \n        which asbestos is deliberately or knowingly added or in which \n        asbestos is deliberately used or knowingly present in any \n        concentration.'';\n            (2) in section 2, by inserting ``(referred to in this Act \n        as the `Administrator')'' after ``Administrator of the \n        Environmental Protection Agency''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 5.
