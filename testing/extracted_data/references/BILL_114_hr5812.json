CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Over the past half century, Congress has passed \n        numerous civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination on the \n        basis of ``sex,'' a designation long understood to be grounded \n        in objective biology up to the present day. There is no \n        evidence that Congress or the American people ever understood \n        the word sex or gender in civil rights laws to include \n        subjective self-identification.\n            (2) For years, advocates have pressed Congress to include a \n        person's subjective self-declared ``gender identity'' in \n        Federal civil rights laws that prohibit sex discrimination. \n        Congress has declined to do so except for the Shepard-Byrd Act \n        of 2009 and the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of \n        2013 where gender identity is defined as ``actual or perceived \n        gender-related characteristics'' with ``gender'', there \n        referring to characteristics associated with biological males \n        and females.\n            (3) This demonstrates that when Congress wants to protect \n        sex, it does so explicitly; when it wants to also elevate \n        gender identity it does so explicitly; and when it does not \n        want to elevate gender identity, it can do so either explicitly \n        or by simply not disturbing the status quo.\n            (4) Despite the complete clarity of this point, President \n        Barack Obama's administration has attempted to effectively \n        replace the word ``sex'' with the phrase ``gender identity'' \n        for purposes of Federal antidiscrimination law and policy \n        through a series of unilateral executive actions.\n            (5) For example, on December 15, 2014, Attorney General \n        Eric Holder announced that the Department of Justice would \n        reinterpret the ban on ``sex'' discrimination under title VII \n        of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to encompass ``gender \n        identity.'' This was followed on March 27, 2015, by an Equal \n        Employment Opportunity Commission decision holding that \n        declining to use a female pronoun to address a male who \n        identifies as female constituted ``sex'' discrimination under \n        title VII.\n            (6) On May 9, 2016, the Obama administration sued the State \n        of North Carolina and threatened it with fines and loss of \n        Federal funding if it did not adopt the administration's \n        incorrect readings of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n        and title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.\n            (7) On May 13, 2016, the Departments of Justice and \n        Education issued a ``significant guidance'' letter stating that \n        under title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ``when a \n        school provides sex-segregated activities and facilities, \n        transgender students must be allowed to participate in such \n        activities and access such facilities consistent with their \n        gender identity.'' The guidance further states that schools \n        ``must treat a student's gender identity as the student's sex'' \n        including in the context of ``sex-segregated restrooms, locker \n        rooms, shower facilities, housing, and athletic teams, as well \n        as single-sex classes.'' In other words, the Departments \n        consider it a title IX violation if a person of the male sex \n        who self-identifies as a female is not granted unfettered \n        access to women's or girls' dorms, showers, locker rooms, and \n        bathrooms. This, despite assurance that such a thing would \n        never happen from the likes of Ruth Bader Ginsburg who wrote in \n        1975 that ``separate places to disrobe, sleep, perform personal \n        bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by \n        regard for individual privacy.'' This position was codified in \n        Federal regulations, 34 CFR 106.33, which state that recipients \n        of Federal funds ``may provide separate toilet, locker room, \n        and shower facilities on the basis of sex,'' with sex obviously \n        referring to biology.\n            (8) Also on May 13, 2016, the Department of Health and \n        Human Services finalized regulations that redefined the \n        Affordable Care Act's prohibition on ``sex'' discrimination in \n        federally funded health programs and activities to cover \n        ``gender identity'', thereby opening health care professionals \n        and insurers to extensive liability if they decline to \n        participate in or pay for ``gender transition'' treatments or \n        ``sex change'' operations.\n            (9) The Obama administration's actions are an affront to \n        the rule of law, the separation of powers, the will of the \n        people, language, history, safety, privacy, and biological \n        realities.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to prevent the executive branch from unilaterally \n        rewriting Federal civil rights laws by enacting or implementing \n        any policy or undertaking any enforcement action that is based \n        on construing the term ``sex'' or ``gender'' to mean ``gender \n        identity''; and\n            (2) to ensure that gender identity is not treated as a \n        protected class in Federal law or policy without the \n        affirmative approval of the people's representatives in \n        Congress.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF POLICIES REDEFINING SEX TO MEAN GENDER IDENTITY.\n\n    (a) Rule of Construction.--In determining the meaning of any \nFederal civil rights law, and of any related ruling, regulation, \nguidance, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and \nagencies of the United States, the words ``sex'' and ``gender'' and \ntheir equivalents shall not be interpreted to mean ``gender identity'' \nor its equivalent, and the words ``man'' and ``woman'' and their \nequivalents shall refer exclusively to a person's sex.\n    (b) Rule of Interpretation.--No Federal civil rights law shall be \ninterpreted to treat gender identity or transgender status as a \nprotected class, unless such law expressly designates ``gender \nidentity'' or ``transgender status'' as a protected class.\n    (c) Definition of ``Federal Civil Rights Law''.--For purposes of \nthis Act, the term ``Federal civil rights law'' means any Federal law \nprohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex or gender, including \ntitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.), the Fair \nHousing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), and any other Federal law or \nprovision thereof prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex or \ngender."
