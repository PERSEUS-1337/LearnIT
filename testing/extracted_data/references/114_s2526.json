of the investments the \n                        consortium proposes and the implementation \n                        strategy the consortium intends to use to \n                        address gaps in such ecosystem.\n                            (vi) A description of outcome-based \n                        metrics, benchmarks, and milestones that the \n                        consortium will track and the evaluation \n                        methods the consortium will use while \n                        designated as a manufacturing community to \n                        gauge performance of the strategy of the \n                        consortium to improve the manufacturing in the \n                        region of the consortium.\n                            (vii) Such

   proposal.\n                    (B) How the manufacturing concentration of the \n                applicant competitively ranks nationally according to \n                measures described in paragraph (5)(B)(ii).\n            (7) Certain communities previously recognized.--Subject to \n        subparagraph (B), each consortium that was designated as a \n        manufacturing community by the Secretary in carrying out the \n        Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership initiative \n        of the Department of Commerce before the date of the enactment \n        of this Act shall be deemed a manufacturing community \n        designated under this subsection as long as such consortium is \n        still designated as a manufacturing community by the Secretary \n        as part of such initiative.\n    (e) Receipt of Transferred Funds.--The Secretary may accept amounts \ntransferred to the Secretary from the head of another participating \nagency to carry out this section."
