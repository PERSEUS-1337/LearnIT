The collecting platform shall remit the amount to the city, county, or city and county that levied the tax pursuant to applicable requirements of local ordinances governing the tax.\n(c) (1) On or before March 1, 2017, the Controller shall develop and publicly notice both of the following:\n(A) Procedures that a platform shall use to notify the Controller if the platform elects to become a collecting platform.\n(B) Procedures that a city, county, or city and county shall use to notify the Controller if the city, county, or city and county elects to become a collecting jurisdiction.\n(2) The Controller shall also develop and publicly notice both of the following:\n(A) Procedures that a collecting platform shall use to notify the Controller if the collecting platform discontinues its election to become a collecting platform.\n(B) Procedures that a collecting jurisdiction shall use to notify the Controller if the collecting jurisdiction discontinues its election to become a collecting jurisdiction.\n(d) (1) On or before April 30, 2017, a platform may elect to become a collecting platform by using the procedures developed pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) to notify the Controller of the platform\u2019s election.\n(2) On or before April 30, 2017, a city, county, or city and county may elect to become a collecting jurisdiction by using the procedures developed pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) to notify the Controller of the city\u2019s, county\u2019s, or city and county\u2019s election.

For each collecting platform reviewed or audited, the Controller shall submit a report to each city, county, or city and county in which the collecting platform collected and remitted taxes. The report shall contain a description of the review or audit findings and identify any errors in the collection and remittance of tax revenues within each city, county, or city and county that were determined as a result of the review or audit. The audit or review shall not reveal any personally identifiable taxpayer or operator information, including, but not limited, to a taxpayer\u2019s or operator\u2019s name and property address.\n(2) It is unlawful for the Controller, any person having an administrative duty under this section, or any person who obtains access to information contained in, or derived from, any audit or review, report, or other records of the Controller pursuant to this section, to make known in any manner whatever the business affairs, operations, or any other information pertaining to any platform or any other person required to provide information subject to audit or review to the Controller or the amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth or disclosed in any such information provided to the Controller, or to permit any audit or review or copy thereof or any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person.\n(3) When requested by a city, county, or city and county that is not a collecting jurisdiction, the Controller shall permit any duly authorized officer or employee of that city, county, or city and county to examine the records of the Controller pertaining to the audit or review of collections by a platform within that city, county, or city and county. Except as otherwise provided herein, this paragraph shall not be construed to allow any officer or employee of that city, county, or city and county to examine any records of any platform. Information obtained by examination of Controller records as permitted in this paragraph shall be used only for purposes related to the collection of local transient occupancy tax.\n(4) If the Controller believes that any information obtained pursuant to paragraph (3) has been disclosed to any person or has been used for purposes not permitted by paragraph (3), then notwithstanding paragraph (3), the Controller may impose conditions on access to the Controller\u2019s records that the Controller considers reasonable in order to protect the confidentiality of those records.\n(5) A platform, city, county, or city and county may appeal any findings identified in a review or audit report submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) by providing a notice of appeal to the Controller\u2019s General Counsel. The notice of appeal shall be filed within 60 days from the date of the final review or audit report and shall identify the issues being appealed and the basis and reason for the appeal. The Controller\u2019s General Counsel shall review the issued appealed and may hold an informal appeal conference for purposes of taking additional information and shall issue a determination within 90 days of receipt of the appeal.\n(6) The Controller may recover the reasonable costs, measured by the Controller\u2019s standard rate, of an audit or review conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) from the collecting platform that was audited or reviewed.\n(h) Unless the platform and the city, county, or city and county mutually agree to terminate the agreement, all of the following shall apply to a platform and a city, county, or city and county that, on or before June 1, 2016, have entered into a binding legal agreement relating to the collection of any tax levied pursuant to this chapter:\n(1) The platform and the city, county, or city and county shall continue to be bound by the agreement and any election made by the platform or the city, county, or city and county pursuant to this section shall not be effective as to any other party to the agreement.\n(2) The platform and the city, county, or city and county shall notify the Controller of the agreement.\n(3) The platform\u2019s collection or remittance of taxes levied pursuant to this chapter pursuant to the agreement shall not be subject to review or audit by the Controller pursuant to subdivision (g).\n(i) A collecting platform that complies with review or audit parameters established by the Controller pursuant to this section shall not be required to provide to any local jurisdiction, including a collecting jurisdiction, personally identifiable information relating to operators using the collecting platform, or concerning transactions facilitated in the local jurisdiction by the collecting platform.\n(j) This section does not limit the existing authority of a local jurisdiction to regulate operators, including any local regulation that requires operators to provide information concerning transactions conducted in the jurisdiction, provided that the requirements do not discriminate against transactions facilitated through a platform.\nSEC. 2.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that providing short-term rental online platforms with uniform transient occupancy tax administration requirements will establish a level playing field among all providers and decrease the cost of complying with statutory collection and remittance requirements, and is therefore a matter of statewide concern and shall apply to charter cities, charter counties, and charter cities and counties.\nSEC. 3.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 7282.5 to the Revenue and Taxation Code, imposes a limitation on the public\u2019s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nLimiting disclosure of records obtained or generated by the Controller or a city, county, or city and county pertaining to audits or reviews of a platform\u2019s collection and remittance of transient occupancy taxes furthers the purposes of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution by appropriately balancing the interest in public disclosure with the interest in preserving the confidentiality of taxpayer information and ensuring that this information is not used for improper purposes.\nSEC. 4.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 7282.5 to the Revenue and Taxation Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies. Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:\nThe preservation of the confidentiality of taxpayer information is furthered by ensuring that cities, counties, and cities and counties do not disclose information contained in, or derived from, any audit or review conducted by the Controller of a platform\u2019s collection and remittance of transient occupancy taxes.\nSECTION 1.\nSection 53051 of the\nGovernment Code\nis amended to read:\n53051.\n(a)Within 50 working days after the date of commencement of its legal existence, the governing body of each public agency shall file with the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State and also with the county clerk of each county in which the public agency maintains an office, a statement of the following facts:\n(1)The full, legal name of the public agency.\n(2)The official mailing address of the governing body of the public agency.\n(3)The name and residence or business address of each member of the governing body of the public agency.\n(4)The name, title, and residence or business address of the chairman, president, or other presiding officer, and clerk or secretary of the governing body of such public agency.\n(b)Within 10 working days after any change in the facts required to be stated pursuant to subdivision (a), an amended statement containing the information required by subdivision (a) shall be filed as provided therein. The information submitted to the Secretary of State shall be on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State.\n(c)It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State and of the county clerk of each county to establish and maintain an indexed \u201cRoster of Public Agencies,\u201d to be so designated, which shall contain all information filed as required in subdivisions (a) and (b), which roster is hereby declared to be a public record."
