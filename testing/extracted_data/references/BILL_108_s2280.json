ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    The Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall, in consultation \nwith the National Science Foundation and other appropriate Federal \nagencies, establish a coordinated national ocean exploration program \nwithin the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of the program are the following:\n            (1) To explore the physical, biological, chemical, \n        geological, archaeological, temporal, and other related \n        characteristics of the oceans to benefit, inform, and inspire \n        the American people.\n            (2) To create missions and scientific activities of \n        discovery that will improve our understanding, appreciation, \n        and stewardship of the unique marine ecosystems, organisms, \n        chemistry, and geology of the world's oceans, and to enhance \n        knowledge of submerged maritime historical and archaeological \n        sites.\n            (3) To facilitate discovery of marine natural products from \n        these ecosystems that may have potential beneficial uses, \n        including those that may help combat disease or provide \n        therapeutic benefits.\n            (4) To communicate such discoveries and knowledge to \n        policymakers, regulators, researchers, educators, and \n        interested nongovernmental entities in order to support policy \n        decisions and to spur additional scientific research and \n        development.\n            (5) To maximize effectiveness by integrating multiple \n        scientific disciplines, employing the diverse resources of the \n        ocean science community, and making ocean exploration data and \n        information available in a timely and consistent manner.\n            (6) To achieve heightened education, environmental \n        literacy, public understanding and appreciation of the oceans.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORITIES.\n\n    In carrying out the program the Administrator of the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall--\n            (1) conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages or other \n        scientific activities in conjunction with other Federal \n        agencies or academic or educational institutions, to survey \n        little known areas of the marine environment, inventory, \n        observe, and assess living and nonliving marine resources, and \n        report such findings;\n            (2) give priority attention to deep ocean regions, with a \n        focus on surveying deep water marine systems that hold \n        potential for important scientific and medical discoveries, \n        such as hydrothermal vent communities and seamounts;\n            (3) conduct scientific voyages to locate, define, and \n        document historic shipwrecks, submerged sites, and other ocean \n        exploration activities that combine archaeology and \n        oceanographic sciences;\n            (4) develop, in consultation with the National Science \n        Foundation, a transparent process for reviewing and approving \n        proposals for activities to be conducted under this program;\n            (5) enhance the technical capability of the United States \n        marine science community by promoting the development of \n        improved oceanographic research, communication, navigation, and \n        data collection systems, as well as underwater platforms and \n        sensors;\n            (6) conduct public education and outreach activities that \n        improve the public understanding of ocean science, resources, \n        and processes, in conjunction with relevant educational \n        programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration, the National Science Foundation, and other \n        agencies;\n            (7) accept donations of property, data, and equipment to be \n        applied for the purpose of exploring the oceans or increasing \n        knowledge of the oceans; and\n            (8) establish an ocean exploration forum to encourage \n        partnerships and promote communication among experts and other \n        stakeholders in order to enhance the scientific and technical \n        expertise and relevance of the national program.\n\nSEC. 5. EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TASK FORCE.\n\n    The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in \ncoordination with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, \nthe U.S. Geological Survey, Office of Naval Research, and relevant \ngovernmental, non-governmental, academic, and other experts, shall \nconvene an ocean technology and infrastructure task force to develop \nand implement a strategy--\n            (1) to facilitate transfer of new exploration technology to \n        the program;\n            (2) to improve availability of communications \n        infrastructure, including satellite capabilities, to the \n        program;\n            (3) to develop an integrated, workable and comprehensive \n        data management information processing system that will make \n        information on unique and significant features obtained by the \n        program available for research and management purposes; and\n            (4) to encourage cost-sharing partnerships with \n        governmental and non-governmental entities that will assist in \n        transferring exploration technology and technical expertise to \n        the program.\n\nSEC. 6. INTERAGENCY FINANCING.\n\n    The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National \nScience Foundation, and other Federal agencies involved in the program, \nare authorized to participate in interagency financing and share, \ntransfer, receive and spend funds appropriated to any federal \nparticipant the program for the purposes of carrying out any \nadministrative or programmatic project or activity under this section. \nFunds may be transferred among such departments and agencies through an \nappropriate instrument that specifies the goods, services, or space \nbeing acquired from another Federal participant and the costs of the \nsame.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration to carry out the program--\n            (1) $45,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2010; \n        and\n            (2) $55,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2011 through 2016.\n\n            Passed the Senate November 16, 2004.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                             Secretary.\n108th CONGRESS\n\n  2d Session\n\n                                S. 2280\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n                                 AN ACT\n\n To establish a coordinated national ocean exploration program within \n          the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."
