DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) Environmental sciences.--The term ``environmental \n        sciences'' means the full range of fields of study (including \n        biological, physical, chemical, geological, and social \n        sciences, engineering, and humanities) relevant to the \n        understanding of environmental problems.\n            (2) Intermountain west.--The term ``Intermountain West'' \n        means Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and the far eastern areas \n        of Oregon and Washington.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In order to maintain quality of life, economic growth \n        should be balanced with environmental protection and \n        incorporate collaborative scientific inquiry, technology \n        development, and public policy.\n            (2) The environmental science data and knowledge fail to \n        adequately support long-term policy leading to questions of \n        science quality, credibility, and utility, resulting in an \n        atmosphere of adversarial science.\n            (3) Individuals affected by decisions regarding natural \n        resources are not effectively involved in determining the \n        needs, setting the agenda, and participating in environmental \n        research and development.\n            (4) Coordinated environmental research and development of \n        Federal and State agencies is necessary to support effective \n        policy and environmental and economic sustainability.\n            (5) Decisions regarding the management of natural resources \n        can significantly impact a region's economy and its residents' \n        quality of life.\n            (6) The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \n        Laboratory is the only multiprogrammatic federally funded \n        research and development laboratory in the Intermountain West \n        region of the United States, a region which will be greatly \n        impacted by future natural resource decisions.\n            (7) The creation of a Natural Resources Institute that \n        focuses the scientific strengths of government, universities, \n        and industry in collaboration with a wide variety of \n        individuals affected by decisions regarding natural resources \n        will expedite sustainable environmental and natural resource \n        decisionmaking, which will result in the creation and retention \n        of jobs and savings to taxpayers.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to create a Natural Resources Institute \nto--\n            (1) coordinate research and develop appropriate and \n        systematic approaches to managing natural resources and the \n        specific tools and mechanisms necessary to implement these \n        approaches;\n            (2) support public policy development by facilitating the \n        creation of public-private partnerships necessary to implement \n        systematic approaches to natural resource use and management;\n            (3) provide education and training regarding natural \n        resources for a wide variety of users, including the public, \n        local and regional government, and industry, by developing \n        training programs and educational curricula using modern \n        information systems such as the Internet and video \n        teleconferencing;\n            (4) facilitate the creation of commercial enterprises by \n        involving local economic development agencies, technology \n        incubators, research institutes, and the private sector to \n        apply derived use science and technology; and\n            (5) transfer information and analyses regarding natural \n        resources to persons and organizations to allow informed \n        decisionmaking and eliminate duplication of environmental \n        studies.\n\nSEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES INSTITUTE.\n\n    There is hereby established a Natural Resources Institute (in this \nAct referred to as the ``Institute''), the purpose of which shall be to \nprovide a neutral forum to develop scientific solutions that improve \nthe economic and environmental viability of the Intermountain West \nregion of the United States.
