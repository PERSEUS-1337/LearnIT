SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business \nCredit Card Act of 2009''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In past recessions, economic recovery has frequently \n        been led by the creation of millions of new, small businesses.\n            (2) Today, however, small business owners are severely \n        limited in their ability to finance new business ventures \n        because their access to capital through their usual resources \n        has dried up, and the lack of access continues to grow.\n            (3) Small businesses are being pushed into using credit \n        cards as their primary source of working capital.\n            (4) This use of credit card credit is especially true for \n        rapidly growing businesses that are not traditional brick and \n        mortar operations, and lack the assets necessary for a \n        traditional loan.\n            (5) Yet, 28 percent of businesses surveyed recently said \n        they had been subject to a decrease in their line of credit or \n        a credit card limit in the past 6 months.\n            (6) And, this decrease in credit card limits occurred \n        despite the fact that 69 percent of the small businesses in the \n        survey cited worsening credit card terms.\n            (7) In 2008, 44 percent of the small businesses surveyed \n        used credit cards to finance their business.\n            (8) In 1993, only 16 percent of small businesses used \n        credit cards as a source of financing.\n            (9) One-third of small businesses using credit cards carry \n        a monthly balance in excess of $10,000.\n\nSEC. 2. EXTENDING CREDIT CARD PROTECTIONS UNDER THE TRUTH IN LENDING \n              ACT TO SMALL BUSINESSES.\n\n    (a) Definition of Consumer.--Section 103(h) of the Truth in Lending \nAct (15 U.S.C. 1602(h)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``(h) The adjective `consumer', used with \n        reference to a credit transaction, characterizes the \n        transaction as one in which the party to whom credit is offered \n        or extended is'' and inserting ``(h) Consumer.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n        term `consumer', when used as a adjective to describe or modify \n        a credit transaction or credit plan, means a transaction or \n        credit plan under which credit is offered or extended to''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(2) Small business included under certain \n        circumstances.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--For purposes of any provision of \n                this title relating to a credit card account under an \n                open end credit plan, the term `consumer' includes any \n                qualified small business.\n                    ``(B) Qualified small business.--For purposes of \n                subparagraph (A), the term `qualified small business' \n                means, with respect to any credit card account under an \n                open end credit plan, any business concern having 50 or \n                fewer employees, whether or not--\n                            ``(i) the credit card account is in the \n                        name of an individual or a business entity;

and\n                    (B) by inserting ``other than qualified small \n                businesses'' after ``organizations''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (3), by striking ``$25,000'' and inserting \n        ``$50,000''.\n    (c) Business Credit Card Amendments.--Section 135 of the Truth in \nLending Act (15 U.S.C. 1645) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``The exemption provided by'' and inserting \n        ``(a) In General.--The exemption provided by''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(b) Qualified Small Business Opt Out From Coverage.--\n            ``(1) Notice of coverage.--The disclosures under section \n        127(a) before opening a credit card account under an open end \n        credit plan for a qualified small business shall include a \n        clear and conspicuous disclosure--\n                    ``(A) that the qualified small business is treated \n                as a consumer under this title and is subject to the \n                requirements of this title as a consumer;\n                    ``(B) that the business may elect, in accordance \n                with this subsection, to be exempt, under section \n                104(1), from this title to the same extent as any \n                business other than a qualified small business;
