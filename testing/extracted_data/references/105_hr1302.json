    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Pay Act of \n1997''.\n    (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \nexpressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other \nprovision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \nother provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Wage differentials exist between equivalent jobs \n        segregated by sex, race, and national origin in Government \n        employment and in industries engaged in commerce or in the \n        production of goods for commerce:\n            (2) The existence of such wage differentials--\n                    (A) depresses wages and living standards for \n                employees necessary for their health and efficiency;\n                    (B) prevents the maximum utilization of the \n                available labor resources;\n                    (C) tends to cause labor disputes, thereby \n                burdening, affecting, and obstructing commerce;\n                    (D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n                commerce; and\n                    (E) constitutes an unfair method of competition.\n            (3) Discrimination in hiring and promotion has played a \n        role in maintaining a segregated work force.\n            (4) Many women and people of color work in occupations \n        dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national \n        origin.\n            (5)(A) A General Accounting Office analysis of wages in the \n        civil service of the State of Washington found that in 1985 of \n        the 44 jobs studied that paid less than the average of all \n        equivalent jobs, approximately 39 percent were female-dominated \n        and approximately 16 percent were male dominated.\n            (B) A study of wages in Minnesota using 1990 Decennial \n        Census data found that 75 percent of the wage differential \n        between white and non-white workers was unexplained and may be \n        a result of discrimination.\n            (6) Section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n        prohibits discrimination in compensation for ``equal work'' on \n        the basis of sex.\n            (7) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits \n        discrimination in compensation because of race, color, \n        religion, national origin, and sex. The United States Supreme \n        Court, in its decision in County of Washington v. Gunther, 452 \n        U.S. 161 (1981), held that title VII's prohibition against \n        discrimination in compensation also applies to jobs which do \n        not constitute ``equal work'' as defined in section 6(d) of the \n        Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Decisions of lower courts, \n        however, have demonstrated that further clarification of \n        existing legislation is necessary in order effectively to carry \n        out the intent of Congress to implement the Supreme Court's \n        holding in its Gunther decision.\n            (8) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n        discrimination in compensation based upon sex, race, and \n        national origin continue to exist more than 3 decades after the \n        passage of section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n        and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Elimination of such barriers \n        would have positive effects, including--\n                    (A) providing a solution to problems in the economy \n                created by discriminating wage differentials;\n                    (B) substantially reducing the number of working \n                women and people of color earning low wages, thereby \n                reducing the dependence on public assistance; and\n                    (C) promoting stable families by enabling working \n                family members to earn a fair rate of pay.\n\nSEC. 3. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUIVALENT JOBS.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 206) is amended by adding at \nthe end the following:\n    ``(g)(1)(A) No employer having employees subject to any provisions \nof this section shall discriminate between its employees on the basis \nof sex, race, or national origin by paying wages to employees or groups \nof employees at a rate less than the rate at which the employer pays \nwages to employees or groups of employees of the opposite sex or \ndifferent race or national origin for work in equivalent jobs, except \nwhere such payment is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit \nsystem, or a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of \nproduction.\n    ``(B) An employer who is paying a wage rate differential in \nviolation of subparagraph (A) shall not, in order to comply with the \nprovisions of such subparagraph, reduce the wage rate of any employee.\n    ``(2) No labor organization or its agents representing employees of \nan employer having employees subject to any provision of this section \nshall cause or attempt to cause such an employer to discriminate \nagainst an employee in violation of paragraph (1)(A).\n    ``(3) For purposes of administration and enforcement of this \nsubsection, any amounts owing to any employee which have been withheld \nin violation of paragraph (1)(A) shall be deemed to be unpaid minimum \nwages or unpaid overtime compensation under this section or section 7.\n    ``(4) As used in this subsection:\n            ``(A) The term `labor organization' means any organization \n        of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee \n        or plan, in which employees participate and which exists for \n        the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers \n        concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, \n        hours of employment, or conditions of work.\n            ``(B) The term `equivalent jobs' means jobs that may be \n        dissimilar, but whose requirements are equivalent, when viewed \n        as a composite of skills, effort, responsibility, and working \n        conditions.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 13(a) (29 U.S.C. 213(a)) is \namended in the matter before paragraph (1) by striking ``section 6(d)'' \nand inserting ``sections 6(d) and 6(g)''.\n\nSEC. 4.

REMEDIES.\n\n    Section 16 (29 U.S.C. 216) is amended--\n            (1) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(f) In any action brought under this section for violation of \nsection 6(g), the court shall, in addition to any other remedies \nawarded to the prevailing plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow expert fees as \npart of the costs.
