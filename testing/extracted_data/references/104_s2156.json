    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be referred to as the ``Tenth Amendment Enforcement \nAct of 1996''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in most areas of governmental concern, State \n        governments possess both the Constitutional authority and the \n        competence to discern the needs and the desires of the People \n        and to govern accordingly;\n            (2) Federal laws and agency regulations, which have \n        interfered with State powers in areas of State jurisdiction, \n        should be restricted to powers delegated to the Federal \n        Government by the Constitution;\n            (3) the framers of the Constitution intended to bestow upon \n        the Federal Government only limited authority over the States \n        and the people;\n            (4) under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, the \n        powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, \n        nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States \n        respectively, or to the people; and\n            (5) the courts, which have in general construed the Tenth \n        Amendment not to restrain the Federal Government's power to act \n        in areas of State jurisdiction, should be directed to strictly \n        construe Federal laws and regulations which interfere with \n        State powers with a presumption in favor of State authority and \n        against Federal preemption.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--On or after January 1, 1997, any statute enacted \nby Congress shall include a declaration--\n            (1) that authority to govern in the area addressed by the \n        statute is delegated to Congress by the Constitution, including \n        a citation to the specific Constitutional authority relied \n        upon;\n            (2) if the statute interferes with State powers or preempts \n        any State or local government law, regulation or ordinance, \n        that Congress specifically finds that the Federal Government is \n        the better level of government to govern in the area addressed \n        by the statute; and\n            (3) if the statute interferes with State powers or preempts \n        any State or local government law, regulation or ordinance, \n        that Congress specifically intends to interfere with State \n        powers or preempt State or local government law, regulation, or \n        ordinance, and that such preemption is necessary.\n    (b) Factual Findings.--The Congress shall make specific factual \nfindings in support of the declarations described in this section.\n\nSEC. 4. POINT OF ORDER.\n\n    (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in either the Senate or \nHouse of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution, or \namendment that does not include a declaration of Congressional intent \nas required under section 3.\n    (b) Rulemaking.--This section is enacted--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n        and House of Representatives, and as such, it is deemed a part \n        of the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives, but is \n        applicable only with respect to the matters described in \n        section 3 and supersedes other rules of the Senate or House of \n        Representatives only to the extent that such sections are \n        inconsistent with such rules; and\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n        the Senate or House of Representatives to change such rules at \n        any time, in the same manner as in the case of any rule of the \n        Senate or House of Representatives.\n\nSEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT ON STATUTORY PREEMPTION.\n\n    (a) Report.--Within 90 days after each Congress adjourns sine die, \nthe Congressional Research Service shall prepare and make available to \nthe public a report on the extent of Federal statutory preemption of \nState and local government powers enacted into law during the preceding \nCongress or adopted through judicial interpretation of Federal \nstatutes.\n    (b) Contents.--The report shall contain--\n            (1) a cumulative list of the Federal statutes preempting, \n        in whole or in part, State and local government powers;\n            (2) a summary of Federal legislation enacted during the \n        previous Congress preempting, in whole or in part, State and \n        local government powers;\n            (3) an overview of recent court cases addressing Federal \n        preemption issues; and\n            (4) other information the Director of the Congressional \n        Research Service determines appropriate.\n    (c) Transmittal.--Copies of the report shall be sent to the \nPresident and the chairman of the appropriate committees in the Senate \nand House of Representatives.\n\nSEC. 6.

PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW.\n\n    ``(a) No executive department or agency or independent agency shall \nconstrue any statutory authorization to issue regulations as \nauthorizing preemption of State law or local ordinance by rulemaking or \nother agency action unless--\n            ``(1) the statute expressly authorizes issuance of \n        preemptive regulations; and\n            ``(2) the executive department, agency or independent \n        agency concludes that the exercise of State power directly \n        conflicts with the exercise of Federal power under the Federal \n        statute, such that the State statutes and the Federal rule \n        promulgated under the Federal statute cannot be reconciled or \n        consistently stand together.\n    ``(b) Any regulatory preemption of State law shall be narrowly \ntailored to achieve the objectives of the statute pursuant to which the \nregulations are promulgated and shall explicitly describe the scope of \npreemption.\n    ``(c)(1) When an executive department or agency or independent \nagency proposes to act through rulemaking or other agency action to \npreempt State law, the department or agency shall provide all affected \nStates notice and an opportunity for meaningful and timely input by \nduly elected or appointed State and local government officials or their \ndesignated representatives in the proceedings.\n    ``(2) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall be forwarded to the \nGovernor, the Attorney General and the presiding officer of each \nchamber of the legislature of each State setting forth the extent and \npurpose of the preemption.\n    ``(3) In the table of contents of each Federal Register, there \nshall be a separate list of preemptive regulations contained within \nthat Register.\n    ``(4) The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) shall not \napply to participation in rulemaking or other agency action by duly \nelected or appointed State and local government officials or their \ndesignated representatives acting in their official capacities.\n    ``(d) Unless a final executive department or agency or independent \nagency rule or regulation contains an explicit provision declaring the \nFederal Government's intent to preempt State or local government powers \nand an explicit description of the extent and purpose of that \npreemption, the rule or regulation shall not be construed to preempt \nany State or local government law, ordinance or regulation.\n    ``(e)(1) Each executive department or agency or independent agency \nshall review the rules and regulations issued by the department or \nagency that preempt, in whole or in part, State or local government \npowers. Each executive department or agency or independent agency shall \npublish in the Federal Register a plan for such review. Such plan may \nbe amended by the department or agency at any time by publishing a \nrevision in the Federal Register.\n    ``(2) The purpose of the review under paragraph (1) shall be to \ndetermine whether and to what extent such rules are to continue without \nchange, consistent with the stated objectives of the applicable \nstatutes, or are to be altered or repealed to minimize the effect of \nthe rules on State or local government powers.\n    ``(3) The plan under paragraph (1) shall provide for the review of \nall such department or agency rules and regulations within 10 years \nafter the date of publication of such rules and regulations as final \nrules. For rules and regulations in effect more than 10 years on the \neffective date of this section, the plan shall provide for review \nwithin 3 years after such effective date.\n    ``(f) Any Federal rule or regulation promulgated after January 1, \n1997, that is promulgated in a manner inconsistent with this section \nshall not be binding on any State or local government, and shall not \npreempt any State or local government law, ordinance, or regulation.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 5 of \ntitle 5, United States Code, is amended by adding after the item for \nsection 559 the following:\n\n``560.
