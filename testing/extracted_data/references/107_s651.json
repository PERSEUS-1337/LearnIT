    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care Consumers Assistance \nFund Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) All consumers need information and assistance to \n        understand their health insurance choices and to facilitate \n        effective and efficient access to needed health services. Many \n        do not understand their health care coverage, despite the \n        current efforts of both the public and private sectors.\n            (2) Federally initiated health care consumer assistance and \n        information programs targeted to consumers of long-term care \n        and to medicare beneficiaries under title XVIII of the Social \n        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) are effective, as are a \n        number of State and local consumer assistance initiatives.\n            (3) The principles, policies, and practices of health plans \n        for providing safe, effective, and accessible health care can \n        be enriched by State-based collaborative, independent \n        education, problem resolution, and feedback programs. Health \n        care consumer assistance programs have proven their ability to \n        meet this challenge.\n            (4) Many states have created health care consumer \n        assistance programs. The Federal Government can assist the \n        States in developing and maintaining effective health care \n        consumer assistance programs.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n(referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a fund, \nto be known as the ``Health Care Consumer Assistance Fund'', to be used \nto award grants to eligible States to enable such States to carry out \nconsumer assistance activities (including programs established by \nStates prior to the enactment of this Act) designed to provide \ninformation, assistance, and referrals to consumers of health insurance \nproducts.\n    (b) State Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \nthis section a State shall prepare and submit to the Secretary an \napplication at such time, in such manner, and containing such \ninformation as the Secretary may require, including a State plan that \ndescribes--\n            (1) the manner in which the State will ensure that the \n        health care consumer assistance office (established under \n        subsection (d)) will assist health care consumers in accessing \n        needed care by educating and assisting health insurance \n        enrollees to be responsible and informed consumers;\n            (2) the manner in which the State will coordinate and \n        distinguish the services provided by the health care consumer \n        assistance office with the services provided by the long-term \n        care ombudsman authorized by the Older Americans Act of 1965 \n        (42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), the State health insurance \n        information program authorized under section 4360 of the \n        Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-4), \n        the protection and advocacy program authorized under the \n        Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of \n        1986 (42 U.S.C. 10801 et seq.), and any other programs that \n        provide information and assistance to health care consumers;\n            (3) the manner in which the State will coordinate and \n        distinguish the health care consumer assistance office and its \n        services from enrollment services provided under the medicaid \n        and State children's health insurance programs under titles XIX \n        and XXI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq. and \n        1397aa et seq.), and medicare and medicaid health care fraud \n        and abuse activities including those authorized by Federal law \n        under title 11 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1301 et \n        seq.), and State health insurance departments and health plan \n        programs that perform similar functions;\n            (4) the manner in which the State will provide services to \n        underserved and minority populations and populations residing \n        in rural areas;\n            (5) the manner in which the State will establish and \n        implement procedures and protocols, consistent with applicable \nFederal and State confidentiality laws, to ensure the confidentiality \nof all information shared by consumers and their health care providers, \nhealth plans, or insurers with the office established under subsection \n(d)(1) and to ensure that no such information is used, released or \nreferred without the express prior permission of the consumer in \naccordance with section 4(b), except to the extent that the office \ncollects or uses aggregate information;\n            (6) the manner in which the State will oversee the health \n        care consumer assistance office, its activities and product \n        materials, and evaluate program effectiveness;\n            (7) the manner in which the State will provide for the \n        collection of non-Federal contributions for the operations of \n        the office in an amount that is not less than 25 percent of the \n        amount of Federal funds provided under this Act; and\n            (8) the manner in which the State will ensure that funds \n        made available under this Act will be used to supplement, and \n        not supplant, any other Federal, State, or local funds expended \n        to provide services for programs described under this Act and \n        those described in paragraphs (3) and (4).\n    (c) Amount of Grant.--\n            (1) In general.--From amounts appropriated under section 4 \n        for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall award a grant to a State \n        in an amount that bears the same ratio to such amounts as the \n        number of individuals within the State covered under a health \n        insurance plan (as determined by the Secretary) bears to the \n        total number of individuals covered under a health insurance \n        plan in all States (as determined by the Secretary).
