FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Currently, child care assistance for children from low-\n        income working families is severely underfunded, allowing only \n        1 in 7 eligible children to receive child care assistance for \n        children from birth to age 13.\n            (2) Funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant \n        Act of 1990 has remained relatively flat for 5 years, making it \n        more difficult for children from eligible families to receive \n        child care assistance.\n            (3) In the majority of United States families, parents, \n        whether married or single, must work to provide economic \n        security for their families and, not the least, for the infants \n        newly welcomed into the families. Fifty-five percent of women \n        with children less than 1 year of age are part of the \n        workforce, while 73 percent of women with children 1 year of \n        age or older are in the workforce.\n            (4) Research shows that the quality and nature of \n        caretaking in the first months and years of life are critical \n        to a young child's subsequent brain development, social \n        development, and well-being. Healthy early development depends \n        on nurturing and responsible relationships.\n            (5) Research also shows that there is an extreme shortage \n        of quality, affordable child care for infants. Numerous studies \n        document lack of infant care and, in particular, affordable \n        care that meets basic health and safety standards, particularly \n        in rural areas. The current number of infant slots of licensed \n        child care providers can only meet 18 percent of the potential \n        need. The shortage is even more acute in rural areas, \n        especially those with a high percentage of low-wage residents.\n            (6) For the well-being of United States children, and for \n        the economic security of the families on which the children \n        depend, working parents should be able to provide child care \n        for infants themselves without undermining family economic \n        stability.\n\nSEC. 3. AT-HOME INFANT CARE.\n\n    The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended \nby inserting after section 658G (42 U.S.C. 9858e) the following:\n\n``SEC. 658H.
