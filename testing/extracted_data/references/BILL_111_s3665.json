FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Pakistan currently enjoys a strong private sector and \n        entrepreneurial spirit. The country is working to consolidate \n        macroeconomic stability and initiate structural reforms with \n        support from the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Stand-By \n        Agreement. A more stable economy in Pakistan will help support \n        Pakistan's robust private sector. Enterprise Funds established \n        in partnership with United States partners like Poland, \n        Hungary, Albania, Russia, and other European countries have \n        proven beneficial to their economies. Creating a similar fund \n        in close partnership with the people of Pakistan could help \n        sustain and expand their reform efforts as well as empower \n        entrepreneurs in Pakistan with the resources required to create \n        desperately needed employment opportunities.\n            (2) A 2009 assessment released by the IMF noted, ``Economic \n        growth in Pakistan is starting to recover; large-scale \n        manufacturing output has started to increase, the improvement \n        in the global economy has helped manufacturing exports, and the \n        private sector credit growth has picked up somewhat as \n        businesses rebuild their working capital. Looking ahead, a \n        resumption of higher growth is needed to raise living standards \n        and will require improvements in the business climate to \n        stimulate higher investment by local and foreign investors.''\n            (3) Pakistan has seen a dramatic fall in foreign direct \n        investment (FDI) in recent years. According to Pakistan's Board \n        of Investment (BOI), foreign direct investment dropped by 40.7 \n        percent from the July 2008-June 2009 time period to the July \n        2009-June 2010 time period. Pakistan secured $5,139,600,000 in \n        FDI in 2006-2007 and $5,152,800,000 in 2007-2008, but the \n        amount dropped to $2,205,000,000 in 2009-2010.\n            (4) According to the Asian Development Bank's 2008 report \n        on Pakistan's private sector, Pakistan's private sector is by \n        far the biggest contributor to GDP and is the biggest employer \n        in the country. According to Pakistan's Small and Medium Sized \n        Development Authority (SMEDA), small and medium sized \n        enterprises (SMEs) constitute nearly 90 percent of all \n        enterprises in Pakistan, employ 80 percent of the non-\n        agricultural labor force, and constitute an approximately 40 \n        percent share of annual GDP. Pakistan's SMEs are particularly \n        constrained by lack of access to financial and other resources. \n        Accelerating the growth of existing SMEs and providing \n        innovative entrepreneurs with resources to set up new ventures \n        has the potential to significantly contribute to stability \n        through job creation and support overall economic success in \n        Pakistan.\n            (5) The shortage of risk capital in Pakistan stems from the \n        effects of the global economic crisis but has been greatly \n        exacerbated by both political and security challenges plaguing \n        the country. Establishing an enterprise fund could help \n        reinforce financial institutions within the country, provide \n        debt and equity investment for commercially viable SMEs, \n        provide debt and equity investment in private sector entities \n        and initiatives in the energy sector, and make the investment \n        environment more attractive to domestic and international \n        investors.\n            (6) Creation of an enterprise fund could promote the growth \n        of the private sector in Pakistan while simultaneously \n        incentivize companies to operate within the formal economy. \n        Estimates by the IMF and World Bank suggest that the informal \n        or underground economy in Pakistan far exceeds the fiscal \n        activity government institutions are able to systematically \n        measure. Any company or business supported by the enterprise \n        fund would be required to operate within specific legal and \n        accounting standards and comply with applicable tax codes. In a \n        country with extremely low levels of tax collection--less than \n        2 percent of the population is believed to pay personal taxes--\n        leadership by the private sector could set an invaluable \n        example within the country.\n            (7) To help foster and support the fledgling private sector \n        after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Congress, through enactment \n        of the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 \n        (22 U.S.C. 5401 et seq.) and the FREEDOM Support Act (22 U.S.C. \n        5801 et seq.), authorized nearly $1,200,000,000 for the United \n        States Agency for International Development (USAID) to \n        establish 10 new investment funds, collectively known as the \n        ``Enterprise Funds'', throughout Central and Eastern Europe and \n        the former Soviet Union. These funds channeled funding into \n        over 500 enterprises in 19 countries, leveraged an additional \n        $5,000,000,000 in private investment capital from outside the \n        United States Government, provided substantial development \n        capital where supply was limited, created or sustained over \n        260,000 jobs through investment and development activities, \n        funded $74,000,000 in technical assistance to strengthen the \n        private sector, and is expected to recoup 137 percent of the \n        original USAID funding.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to promote the private sector in Pakistan, while \n        considering the development impact of investments and \n        profitability of those investments, particularly in small- and \n        medium-sized enterprises, the energy and electricity sector, \n        and joint ventures with participants from the United States and \n        Pakistan;\n            (2) to promote policies and practices conducive to \n        strengthening the private sector in Pakistan through measures \n        including loans, microloans, equity investments, insurance, \n        guarantees, grants, feasibility studies, technical assistance, \n        training for businesses receiving investment capital, and other \n        measures;\n            (3) to promote good corporate governance and transparency \n        in Pakistan, foster competition, catalyze productivity \n        improvements in existing businesses, and strengthen local \n        capital markets;\n            (4) to promote security through job creation in the private \n        sector in Pakistan and to further the creation of a middle \n        class in Pakistan; and\n            (5) to promote private sector adherence to tax codes in \n        Pakistan and, where appropriate, foster improvements in the tax \n        code and regulatory environment in Pakistan in order to support \n        economic development.\n\nSEC. 4.
