Local educational agencies seeking to participate in Public Utilities Commission proceedings must hire attorneys and experts at their own expense, using the state and local dollars that were designated for educational programs.\n(c) The cost of intervening in Public Utilities Commission proceedings is often prohibitive for local educational agencies; therefore, the perspectives of local educational agencies are often lost during proceedings to discuss rate changes.\n(d) The Public Utilities Commission\u2019s Intervenor Compensation Program is intended to ensure that individuals and groups that represent residential or small commercial electric utility customers have the financial resources to bring their concerns and interests to the commission during formal proceedings.\n(e) As a regional agency, a county office of education is the appropriate intervenor in a proceeding affecting any local educational agency in whole or part within the county.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 1802 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:\n1802.\nAs used in this article:\n(a) \u201cCompensation\u201d means payment for all or part, as determined by the commission, of reasonable advocate\u2019s fees, reasonable expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs of preparation for and participation in a proceeding, and includes the fees and costs of obtaining an award under this article and of obtaining judicial review, if any.\n(b) (1) \u201cCustomer\u201d means any of the following:\n(A) A participant representing consumers, customers, or subscribers of any electrical, gas, telephone, telegraph, or water corporation that is subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.\n(B) A representative who has been authorized by a customer.\n(C) A representative of a group or organization authorized pursuant to its articles of incorporation or bylaws to represent the interests of residential customers, or to represent small commercial customers who receive bundled electric service from an electrical corporation.\n(D) (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), a county office of education or a\ncommunity college district.\nconsortium of public school districts or agencies.\n(ii)\n(I)\nA\ncounty office of education may\nconsortium of public school districts or agencies shall only\nparticipate or intervene pursuant to this article on behalf of\nany of the\na\nlocal\nK\u2013\n12\neducational\nagencies in whole or part within the county or on behalf of itself.\nagency in a commission proceeding relating to gas or electricity rates.\n(II) A representative of a consortium of public school districts or agencies participating or intervening pursuant to this article in a commission proceeding shall not have had a direct financial interest in the resolution of the commission proceeding within the two years preceding the filing of comments with the commission, and shall not have a direct financial interest in the resolution of the proceeding sooner than two years after that resolution.\n(2) \u201cCustomer\u201d does not include any state, federal, or local government agency, any publicly owned public utility, or any entity that, in the commission\u2019s opinion, was established or formed by a local government entity for the purpose of participating in a commission proceeding.\n(c) \u201cExpert witness fees\u201d means recorded or billed costs incurred by a customer for an expert witness.\n(d) \u201cOther reasonable costs\u201d means reasonable out-of-pocket expenses directly incurred by a customer that are directly related to the contentions or recommendations made by the customer that resulted in a substantial contribution.\n(e) \u201cParty\u201d means any interested party, respondent public utility, or commission staff in a hearing or proceeding.\n(f) \u201cProceeding\u201d means an application, complaint, or investigation, rulemaking, alternative dispute resolution procedures in lieu of formal proceedings as may be sponsored or endorsed by the commission, or other formal proceeding before the commission.\n(g) \u201cSignificant financial hardship\u201d means either that the customer cannot afford, without undue hardship, to pay the costs of effective participation, including advocate\u2019s fees, expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs of participation, or that, in the case of a group or organization, the economic interest of the individual members of the group or organization is small in comparison to the costs of effective participation in the proceeding.\n(h) \u201cSmall commercial customer\u201d means\nany\na\nnonresidential customer with a maximum peak demand of less than 50 kilowatts. The commission may establish rules to modify or change the definition of \u201csmall commercial customer,\u201d including use of criteria other than a peak demand threshold, if the commission determines that the modification or change will promote participation in proceedings at the commission by organizations representing small businesses, without incorporating large commercial and industrial customers.\n(i) \u201cSubstantial contribution\u201d means that, in the judgment of the commission, the customer\u2019s presentation has substantially assisted the commission in the making of its order or decision because the order or decision has adopted in whole or in part one or more factual contentions, legal contentions, or specific policy or procedural recommendations presented by the customer.\nWhere\nIf\nthe customer\u2019s participation has resulted in a substantial contribution, even if the decision adopts that customer\u2019s contention or recommendations only in part, the commission may award the customer compensation for all reasonable advocate\u2019s fees, reasonable expert fees, and other reasonable costs incurred by the customer in preparing or presenting that contention or recommendation."
