FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Neotropical migratory bird populations in nations \n        within the range of neotropical migratory birds have continued \n        to decline to the point that the long-term survival of various \n        species in the wild is in jeopardy.\n            (2) 90 North American bird species are listed as endangered \n        species or threatened species under section 4 of the Endangered \n        Species Act of 1973, and 124 species of migratory birds are \n        currently on the United States Fish an Wildlife Service's List \n        of Migratory Nongame Birds of Management Concern.\n            (3) The United States, through 4 bilateral treaties, has \n        responsibility of maintaining healthy populations of 778 \n        species of migratory nongame birds and 58 species of migratory \n        game birds that migrate between the Caribbean, Latin America, \n        and North America.\n            (4) The Government of Mexico presently lists approximately \n        390 birds species as endangered, threatened, vulnerable, or \n        rare.\n            (5) Healthy bird populations provide important economic \n        benefits, such as control of detrimental insects on \n        agricultural crops, thus preventing the loss of millions of \n        dollars each year to farming and timber interests.\n            (6) Neotropical migratory birds travel across many \n        international borders, therefore the conservation of these \n        species requires that safeguards be established at both the \n        beginning and end of the migration routes, as well as at \n        essential stopover areas along the way.\n            (7) Because the challenges facing the conservation of \n        neotropical migratory birds are so great, resources to date \n        have not been sufficient to cope with continued loss of habitat \n        and the consequent reduction of neotropical migratory bird \n        populations.\n            (8) To reduce, remove, or otherwise effectively address \n        these treaties through the long-term viability of populations \n        of neotropical migratory birds in the wild will require the \n        joint commitment and efforts of nations within the range of \n        neotropical migratory birds and the private sector.\n            (9) A Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation fund would \n        much-needed support for projects aimed at protecting critical \n        habitat for declining migratory bird species,in an innovative \n        way that promotes conservation partnerships and cost sharing \n        through joint Federal and non-Federal support mechanisms.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical \n        migratory birds.\n            (2) To assist in the conservation and protection of \n        neotropical migratory birds by supporting the conservation \n        programs of neotropical migratory bird range states and the \n        CITES Secretariat.\n            (3) To provide financial resources for those programs.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``CITES'' means the Convention on \n        International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and \n        Flora, signed on March 3, 1973, and its appendices.\n            (2) The term ``Commission'' means the Migratory Bird \n        Conservation Commission established by the Migratory Bird \n        Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 715 et seq.).\n            (3) The term ``conservation'' means the use of methods and \n        procedures necessary to bring neotropical migratory birds to \n        the point at which there are sufficient populations in the wild \n        to ensure that the various species of such birds do not become \n        extinct, including all activities associated with scientific \n        resource management, such as conservation, protection, \n        restoration, acquisition, and management of habitat; research \n        and monitoring of known populations; CITES enforcement; law \n        enforcement through community participation; conflict \n        resolution initiatives; and community outreach and education.\n            (4) The term ``Fund'' means the Neotropical Migratory Bird \n        Conservation Fund established under section 6(a).\n            (5) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n        Interior.\n\nSEC. 5.
