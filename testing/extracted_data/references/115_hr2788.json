SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Health Equity and Access under the \nLaw for Immigrant Women and Families Act of 2017'' or as the ``HEAL for \nImmigrant Women and Families Act of 2017''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Insurance coverage reduces harmful health disparities \n        by alleviating cost barriers to and increasing utilization of \n        basic preventive health services, especially among low-income \n        and underserved populations, and especially among women.\n            (2) Based solely on their immigration status, many \n        immigrants and their families face legal restrictions on their \n        ability to obtain health insurance coverage through Medicaid, \n        CHIP, and Health Insurance Exchanges.\n            (3) Lack of health insurance contributes to persistent \n        disparities in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of \n        negative health outcomes borne by immigrants and their \n        families.\n            (4) Immigrant women are disproportionately of reproductive \n        age, low-income, and lacking health insurance coverage. Legal \n        barriers to affordable health insurance coverage therefore \n        particularly exacerbate their risk of negative sexual, \n        reproductive, and maternal health outcomes, with lasting health \n        and economic consequences for immigrant women, their families, \n        and society as a whole.\n            (5) Denying coverage or imposing waiting periods for \n        coverage unfairly hinders the ability of immigrants to take \n        responsibility for their own health and economic well-being and \n        that of their families. To fully and productively participate \n        in society, access to health care is fundamental, which for \n        women includes access to the services necessary to plan whether \n        and when to have a child.\n            (6) The population of immigrant families in the United \n        States is expected to continue to grow. Indeed one in four \n        children in the United States is part of an immigrant family. \n        It is therefore in the Nation's shared public health and \n        economic interest to remove legal barriers to affordable health \n        insurance coverage based on immigration status.\n            (7) Although Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \n        recipients are authorized to live and work in the United \n        States, they have been unfairly excluded from the definition of \n        lawfully present and lawfully residing for purposes of health \n        insurance coverage by the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, including Medicaid and the Children's Health \n        Insurance Program (CHIP).\n            (8) Immigration law is constantly evolving and new \n        immigration categories for individuals with federally \n        authorized presence in the United States may be created.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that all \nindividuals who are granted federally authorized presence are treated \nas being lawfully present in the United States for purposes of \neligibility under all federally funded health care programs.\n\nSEC. 3.

For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a \n        State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such \n        session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the \n        State legislature.\n\nSEC. 4.
