FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) All students experience learning losses when they do \n        not engage in educational activities during the summer.\n            (2) Students on average lose more than 1 month's worth of \n        reading skills, and 2 months or more in mathematics facts and \n        skills, during the summer.\n            (3) The impact of summer learning loss is greatest for \n        children living in poverty, for children with learning \n        disabilities, and for children who do not speak English at \n        home.\n            (4) While middle-class children's test scores plateau or \n        even rise during the summer months, scores plummet for children \n        living in poverty. Disparities grow, so that reading scores of \n        disadvantaged students can fall more than 3 months behind the \n        scores of their middle-class peers.\n            (5) Summer learning losses by children living in poverty \n        accumulate over the elementary school years, so that their \n        achievement scores fall further and further behind the scores \n        of their more advantaged peers as the children progress through \n        school.\n            (6) This summer slide is costly for American education. \n        Analysis by Professor Harris Cooper and his colleagues finds \n        that 2 months of the school year are lost: 1 month spent in \n        reteaching and 1 month spent not providing new instruction.\n            (7) Analysis of summer learning programs has demonstrated \n        their effectiveness. In the BELL programs in Boston, New York, \n        and Washington, DC, students gained several months' worth of \n        reading and mathematics skills in 6 weeks, with a majority of \n        those students moving to a higher performance category, as \n        assessed by standardized mathematics and reading tests. In the \n        Center for Summer Learning's Teach Baltimore Summer Academy, \n        randomized studies show that students who regularly attended \n        the program for not less than 2 summers gained advantages of 70 \n        to 80 percent of 1 full grade level in reading over control-\n        group peers who did not attend summer school.\n            (8) Summer learning programs are proven to remedy, \n        reinforce, and accelerate learning, and can serve to close the \n        achievement gap in education.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to create opportunities for summer \nlearning by providing summer learning grants to eligible students, in \norder to--\n            (1) provide the students with access to summer learning;\n            (2) facilitate the enrollment of students in elementary \n        schools or youth development organizations during the summer;\n            (3) promote collaboration between teachers and youth \n        development professionals in order to bridge gaps between \n        schools and youth programs; and\n            (4) encourage teachers to try new techniques, acquire new \n        skills, and mentor new colleagues.\n\nSEC. 4.
