FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has a crucial stake in supporting the \n        presence abroad of United States Government personnel \n        representing United States interests.\n            (2) United States Government personnel and missions abroad \n        are confronted by serious security risks, including the threat \n        of terrorism, which will continue for the foreseeable future.\n            (3) The Accountability Review Board process was established \n        in 1986 by Congress to conduct a thorough assessment of \n        security-related incidents at or related to a United States \n        Government mission abroad.\n            (4) Each assessment by a Board is expected to promote \n        strengthened security measures, and to provide for the \n        accountability of United States Government personnel with \n        security-related responsibilities.\n            (5) The terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, on September \n        11, 2012, that took the lives of four United States Government \n        personnel has brought unprecedented attention to the work of \n        such Boards.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \neffectiveness of Accountability Review Boards would be improved by \nreconstituting such Boards to increase their independence from the \nDepartment of State.\n\nSEC. 3.
