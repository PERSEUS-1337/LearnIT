These 8 companies have received \n        $2,900,000,000 in taxpayer funds to enroll veterans from 2009 \n        to 2013.\n            (4) An analysis of 15 publicly traded companies that \n        operate institutions of higher education shows that, on \n        average, such companies spend 28 percent of expenditures on \n        advertising, marketing, and recruiting.\n\nSEC. 2.
