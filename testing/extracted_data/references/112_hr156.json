FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Vietnam remains a one-party state, ruled and controlled \n        by the Communist Party of Vietnam, which continues to deny the \n        right of citizens to change their government.\n            (2) Although in recent years the National Assembly of \n        Vietnam has on occasion played a role as a forum for \n        highlighting local concerns, corruption, and inefficiency, the \n        National Assembly remains subject to the direction of the \n        Communist Party of Vietnam and that party maintains control \n        over the selection of candidates in national and local \n        elections.\n            (3) The Government of Vietnam forbids public challenge to \n        the legitimacy of the one-party state, restricts freedoms of \n        opinion, the press, assembly, and association, and tightly \n        limits access to the Internet and telecommunication. \n        Cyberattacks originating from Vietnam-based servers have \n        disabled dissident websites and the Government of Vietnam \n        introduced new restrictions on public internet shops while \n        continuing to restrict access to numerous overseas and domestic \n        blogs, news sites, and other websites perceived to carry \n        content critical of the Government of Vietnam.\n            (4) The Government of Vietnam continues to detain, \n        imprison, place under house arrest, convict, and otherwise \n        restrict individuals for the peaceful expression of dissenting \n        political or religious views, including democracy and human \n        rights activists, independent trade union leaders, non-state-\n        sanctioned publishers, journalists, bloggers, members of ethnic \n        minorities, and unsanctioned religious groups.\n            (5) The Government of Vietnam has also failed to improve \n        labor rights, continues to harass, arrest, and imprison workers \n        rights activists, including Doan Huy Chuong, Do Thi Minh Hanh, \n        and Nguyen Hoang Quoc Hung, and restricts the right to organize \n        independently.\n            (6) The Government of Vietnam continues to limit freedom of \n        religion, pressure all religious groups to come under the \n        control of government- and party-controlled management boards, \n        and restrict the operation of independent religious \n        organizations, including the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam \n        and members of unsanctioned Mennonite, Cao Dai, Theravada \n        Buddhist, and Hoa Hao Buddhist religious groups and independent \n        Protestant house churches, primarily in the central and \n        northern highlands. Religious leaders who do not conform to the \n        Government's demands are often harassed, arrested, imprisoned, \n        or put under house arrest.\n            (7) As noted in the October 2009 report of the United \n        States Commission on International Religious Freedom, ``[T]here \n        continue to be far too many serious abuses and restrictions of \n        religious freedom in the country. Individuals continue to be \n        imprisoned or detained for reasons related to their religious \n        activity or religious freedom advocacy; police and government \n        officials are not held fully accountable for abuses; \n        independent religious activity remains illegal; and legal \n        protection for government-approved religious organizations are \n        both vague and subject to arbitrary or discriminatory \n        interpretations based on political factors. In addition, \n        improvements experienced by some religious communities are not \n        experienced by others, including the Unified Buddhist Church of \n        Vietnam (UBCV), independent Hoa Hao, Cao Dai, and Protestant \n        groups, and some ethnic minority Protestants and Buddhists. \n        Also, over the past year, property disputes between the \n        government and the Catholic Church in Hanoi led to detention, \n        threats, harassment, and violence by `contract thugs' against \n        peaceful prayer vigils and religious leaders.''.\n            (8) Despite reported progress in church openings and legal \n        registrations of religious venues, the Government of Vietnam \n        has halted most religious reforms since the Department of State \n        lifted the ``country of particular concern'' for religious \n        freedom violations designation for Vietnam in November 2006.\n            (9) Unregistered ethnic minority Protestant congregations \n        suffer severe abuses because of actions by the Government of \n        Vietnam, which have included forced renunciations of faith, \n        pressure to join government-recognized religious groups, arrest \n        and harassment, the withholding of social programs provided for \n        the general population, destruction of churches and pagodas, \n        confiscation and destruction of property, and subjection to \n        severe beatings.\n            (10) During peaceful Catholic prayer vigils calling for the \n        return of government-confiscated church properties during 2008 \n        at the Thai Ha Church in Ha Noi, protestors were dispersed \n        after being harassed, some were detained, and some of the \n        church property was destroyed. Similar incidents happened at \n        Bau Sen, Loan Ly, and Tam Toa parishes in central Vietnam and \n        more recently at Dong Chiem parish in Hanoi, where religious \n        statues and a crucifix were destroyed and parishioners and \n        clergies were physically harmed, and at Con Dau parish, where \n        police forcibly dispersed a Catholic funeral ceremony in May \n        2010 to a cemetery located on disputed land. Afterwards, police \n        and members of the civilian defense forces arrested and \n        interrogated dozens of Con Dau parishioners, with one \n        parishioner dying from injuries sustained during a beating in \n        July 2010 by civilian defense forces and two women suffered \n        miscarriages resulted from police tortures. Catholics continue \n        to face some restrictions on selection of clergy, the \n        establishment of seminaries and seminary candidates, and \n        restrictions on individual cases of travel and church \n        registration. Dissident clerics such as Father Phan Van Loi and \n        Father Nguyen Van Ly are currently under house arrest.\n            (11) The Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam suffers \n        persecution as the Government of Vietnam continues to restrict \n        contacts and movement of senior clergy for refusing to join the \n        state-sponsored Buddhist organizations, the Government \n        restricts expression and assembly, and the Government continues \n        to harass and threaten monks, nuns, and youth leaders of the \n        Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. The Supreme Patriarch of \n        Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, Thich Quang Do, is \n        currently under house arrest.\n            (12) The Bat Nha Buddhists monastery in Lam Dong province \n        was attacked by government thugs in October 2009. About 400 \n        monks and nuns were physically abused and forcibly evicted from \n        the monastery.\n            (13) The Government of Vietnam continues to suppress the \n        activities of other religious adherents, including Cao Dai, Hoa \n        Hao, Mennonites, and Montagnard Christians belonging to \n        churches that lack official recognition or have chosen not to \n        affiliate with the state-sanctioned groups, including through \n        the use of detention and imprisonment.\n            (14) Ethnic minority Hmong in the Northwest Highlands of \n        Vietnam also suffer restrictions, abuses, and persecution by \n        the Government of Vietnam, and although the Government is now \n        allowing some Hmong Protestants to organize and conduct \n        religious activity, some government officials continue to deny \n        or ignore additional applications for registration.\n            (15) The Government of Vietnam controls all print and \n        electronic media, including access to the Internet, jams the \n        signals of some foreign radio stations, including Radio Free \n        Asia, and has detained and imprisoned individuals who have \n        posted, published, sent, or otherwise distributed democracy-\n        related materials.\n            (16) People arrested in Vietnam because of their political \n        or religious affiliations and activities and charged with \n        vaguely defined national security crimes are not accorded due \n        process of law. During the pre-trial investigatory phase of \n        their detention, religious and political prisoners are often \n        held incommunicado without access to legal counsel and family \n        members. They are routinely tortured during interrogation to \n        force them to confess to crimes they did not commit or to \n        falsely denounce others. Their trials are usually closed to \n        international press and diplomats and members of the public.\n            (17) Vietnam continues to be a source country for the \n        commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor of women and \n        girls and for men and women legally entering into international \n        labor contracts who subsequently face conditions of debt \n        bondage or forced labor, and is a destination country for child \n        trafficking and continues to have internal human trafficking.\n            (18) Congress has passed numerous resolutions condemning \n        human rights violations in Vietnam, indicating that although \n        there has been an expansion of relations with the Government of \n        Vietnam, it should not be construed as approval of the ongoing \n        and serious violations of fundamental human rights in Vietnam, \n        particularly those enshrined in the International Covenant on \n        Civil and Political Rights, of which Vietnam is a signatory.\n            (19) Enhancement of relations between the United States and \n        Vietnam has provided an opportunity for a human rights \n        dialogue, but is unlikely to lead to future progress on human \n        rights issues in Vietnam unless the United States makes clear \n        that such progress is an essential prerequisite for further \n        enhancements in the bilateral relationship.\n\nSEC. 3.
