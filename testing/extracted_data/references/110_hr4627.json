TAX-FAVORED WITHDRAWALS FROM RETIREMENT PLANS FOR MORTGAGE \n              RELIEF.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nshall not apply to any qualified mortgage relief distribution.\n    (b) Aggregate Dollar Limitation.--\n            (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the \n        aggregate amount of distributions received by an individual \n        which may be treated as qualified mortgage relief distributions \n        for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of--\n                    (A) $25,000, over\n                    (B) the aggregate amounts treated as qualified \n                mortgage relief distributions received by such \n                individual for all prior taxable years.\n            (2) Treatment of plan distributions.--If a distribution to \n        an individual would (without regard to paragraph (1)) be a \n        qualified mortgage relief distribution, a plan shall not be \n        treated as violating any requirement of the Internal Revenue \n        Code of 1986 merely because the plan treats such distribution \n        as a qualified mortgage relief distribution, unless the \n        aggregate amount of such distributions from all plans \n        maintained by the employer (and any member of any controlled \n        group which includes the employer) to such individual exceeds \n        $25,000.\n            (3) Controlled group.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the \n        term ``controlled group'' means any group treated as a single \n        employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 \n        of such Code.\n    (c) Amount Distributed May Be Repaid.--\n            (1) In general.--Any individual who receives a qualified \n        mortgage relief distribution may, at any time during the 5-year \n        period beginning on the day after the date on which such \n        distribution was received, make one or more contributions in an \n        aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of such distribution \n        to an eligible retirement plan of which such individual is a \n        beneficiary and to which a rollover contribution of such \n        distribution could be made under section 402(c), 403(a)(4), \n        403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16) of the Internal Revenue \n        Code of 1986, as the case may be.\n            (2) Treatment of repayments of distributions from eligible \n        retirement plans other than iras.--For purposes of such Code, \n        if a contribution is made pursuant to paragraph (1) with \n        respect to a qualified mortgage relief distribution from an \n        eligible retirement plan other than an individual retirement \n        plan, then the taxpayer shall, to the extent of the amount of \n        the contribution, be treated as having received the qualified \n        mortgage relief distribution in an eligible rollover \n        distribution (as defined in section 402(c)(4) of such Code) and \n        as having transferred the amount to the eligible retirement \n        plan in a direct trustee to trustee transfer within 60 days of \n        the distribution.\n            (3) Treatment of repayments for distributions from iras.--\n        For purposes of such Code, if a contribution is made pursuant \n        to paragraph (1) with respect to a qualified mortgage relief \n        distribution from an individual retirement plan (as defined by \n        section 7701(a)(37) of such Code), then, to the extent of the \n        amount of the contribution, the qualified mortgage relief \n        distribution shall be treated as a distribution described in \n        section 408(d)(3) of such Code and as having been transferred \n        to the eligible retirement plan in a direct trustee to trustee \n        transfer within 60 days of the distribution.\n    (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n            (1) Qualified mortgage relief distribution.--Except as \n        provided in subsection (b), the term ``qualified mortgage \n        relief distribution'' means any distribution from an eligible \n        retirement plan made on or after the date of the enactment of \n        this Act and before January 1, 2010, if--\n                    (A) such distribution is made during any 90-day \n                period beginning on the date of any increase which \n                occurs under the terms of the loan in the interest rate \n                applicable to acquisition indebtedness (as defined in \n                section 163(h)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n                1986, without regard to clause (ii) thereof) with \n                respect to the principal residence of the taxpayer, and\n                    (B) the adjusted gross income (as defined in \n                section 62 of the such Code) of the taxpayer for the \n                taxable year of such distribution does not exceed \n                $114,000 ($166,000 in the case of a joint return under \n                section 6013 of such Code).\n        For purposes of subparagraph (A), any increase in interest rate \n        which occurs after May 31, 2005, and before the date of the \n        enactment of this Act shall be treated as occurring on such \n        date of enactment.\n            (2) Eligible retirement plan.--The term ``eligible \n        retirement plan'' shall have the meaning given such term by \n        section 402(c)(8)(B) of such Code.\n            (3) Principal residence.--The term ``principal residence'' \n        has the same meaning as when used in section 121 of such Code.\n    (e) Income Inclusion Spread Over 5 Year Period for Qualified \nMortgage Relief Distributions.--\n            (1) In general.--In the case of any qualified mortgage \n        relief distribution, unless the taxpayer elects not to have \n        this subsection apply for any taxable year, any amount required \n        to be included in gross income for such taxable year shall be \n        so included ratably over the 5-taxable year period beginning \n        with such taxable year.\n            (2) Special rule.--For purposes of paragraph (1), rules \n        similar to the rules of subparagraph (E) of section 408A(d)(3) \n        of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall apply.\n    (f) Special Rules.--\n            (1) Exemption of distributions from trustee to trustee \n        transfer and withholding rules.--For purposes of sections \n        401(a)(31), 402(f), and 3405 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n        1986, qualified mortgage relief distributions shall not be \n        treated as eligible rollover distributions.\n            (2) Qualified mortgage relief distributions treated as \n        meeting plan distribution requirements.--For purposes of such \n        Code, a qualified mortgage relief distribution shall be treated \n        as meeting the requirements of sections 401(k)(2)(B)(i), \n        403(b)(7)(A)(ii), 403(b)(11), and 457(d)(1)(A) of such Code.\n    (g) Provisions Relating to Plan Amendments.--\n            (1) In general.--If this subsection applies to any \n        amendment to any plan or annuity contract, such plan or \n        contract shall be treated as being operated in accordance with \n        the terms of the plan during the period described in paragraph \n        (2)(B)(i).\n            (2) Amendments to which subsection applies.--\n                    (A) In general.--This subsection shall apply to any \n                amendment to any plan or annuity contract which is \n                made--\n                            (i) pursuant to any amendment made by this \n                        section, or pursuant to any regulation issued \n                        by the Secretary of the Treasury or the \n                        Secretary of Labor under this section, and\n                            (ii) on or before the last day of the first \n                        plan year beginning on or after January 1, \n                        2010, or such later date as the Secretary of \n                        the Treasury may prescribe.\n                In the case of a governmental plan (as defined in \n                section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), \n                clause (ii) shall be applied by substituting the date \n                which is 2 years after the date otherwise applied under \n                clause (ii).\n                    (B) Conditions.--This subsection shall not apply to \n                any amendment unless--\n                            (i) during the period--\n                                    (I) beginning on the date the \n                                legislative or regulatory amendment \n                                described in subparagraph (A)(i) takes \n                                effect (or in the case of a plan or \n                                contract amendment not required by such \n                                legislative or regulatory amendment, \n                                the effective date specified by the \n                                plan), and\n                                    (II) ending on the date described \n                                in
