FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Consumer use of mobile services has dramatically \n        increased over the last 2 decades, with many consumers relying \n        primarily or solely on a mobile device for voice, data, and \n        Internet use.\n            (2) Consumer disputes of mobile services agreements often \n        involve small amounts in controversy.\n            (3) Disputes involving small amounts in controversy are \n        well-suited for class litigation, as class litigation allows a \n        more efficient process than numerous similar individual \n        actions, distributes the costs of litigation across a large \n        pool of plaintiffs, and may present a stronger incentive for a \n        defendant to cease or change harmful behavior.\n            (4) Many contracts for mobile services contain clauses that \n        require aggrieved consumers to waive their right to litigate as \n        an individual or class and instead submit to binding \n        arbitration of any future dispute.\n            (5) Several States have found, through legislation or case \n        law, that the clauses described in paragraph (4) are \n        unconscionable or unenforceable when they bar class litigation.\n            (6) On April 27, 2011, the Supreme Court, in its decision \n        in AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. _, slip op. \n        (2011), held that States must enforce mandatory binding \n        arbitration clauses even if they bar class litigation.\n            (7) The Concepcion decision restricts consumers' ability to \n        resolve disputes against providers of mobile services.\n\nSEC. 3. ARBITRATION OF MOBILE SERVICE DISPUTES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title 9, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n\n     ``CHAPTER 4--ARBITRATION OF COMMERCIAL MOBILE SERVICE DISPUTES\n\n``Sec.\n``401.
