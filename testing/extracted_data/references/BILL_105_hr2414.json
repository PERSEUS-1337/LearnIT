FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress hereby finds the following:\n            (1) It is appropriate and timely to--\n                    (A) honor the unique Federal republic of 50 States \n                that comprise the United States; and\n                    (B) promote the diffusion of knowledge among the \n                youth of the United States about the individual States, \n                their history and geography, and the rich diversity of \n                the national heritage.\n            (2) The circulating coinage of the United States has not \n        been modernized within the past 25 years.\n            (3) A circulating commemorative 25-cent coin program could \n        produce earnings of $110,000,000 from the sale of silver proof \n        coins and sets over the 10-year period of issuance and would \n        produce indirect earnings of an estimated $2,600,000,000 to \n        $5,100,000,000 to the United States Treasury, money that will \n        replace borrowing to fund the national debt to at least that \n        extent.\n            (4) It is appropriate to launch a commemorative circulating \n        coin program that encourages young people and their families to \n        collect memorable tokens of all the States for the face value \n        of the coins.\n\nSEC. 3.
