    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Every year, an estimated 12,000,000 children under the \n        age of 5 years die, mostly of easily preventable causes, and \n        about 160,000,000 children are severely or moderately \n        malnourished throughout the world.\n            (2) Despite significant progress made in child survival \n        efforts, 32,000 children continue to die every day, largely \n        from preventable causes.\n            (3) Of the 12,000,000 children under 5 who die each year \n        from preventable causes, 6,000,000 die directly or indirectly \n        from malnutrition.\n            (4) The under-5 mortality rate (171 per 1,000 live births) \n        in the least developed countries is nearly 25 times that of the \n        industrialized nations.\n            (5) Diarrheal dehydration remains one of the world's most \n        widespread child killers, claiming over 2,000,000 children \n        under the age of 5 each year in developing countries, and for \n        just 7 cents per dose per child, oral rehydration therapy and \n        continued feeding (ORT), a simple, cost-effective treatment \n        given at home, could prevent as many as 90 percent of all child \n        deaths from diarrheal diseases.\n            (6) Although 80 percent of children are now being \n        vaccinated against the 6 major killer diseases (measles, \n        tetanus, whooping cough, tuberculosis, polio, and diphtheria), \n        2,000,000 children are still dying from these diseases each \n        year. Only $30,000,000 ($15 per child) would provide vaccines, \n        syringes, needles, cold chain equipment, and health workers' \n        training and salaries needed to immunize 2,000,000 children \n        against these 6 major childhood diseases.\n            (7) Malaria kills more than 1,000,000 children under the \n        age of 5 each year, or 1 child every 30 seconds, but for less \n        than $15,000,000, all of these children could be provided bed \n        nets to help protect them from this deadly disease.\n            (8) An estimated 2,900,000,000 people lack access to \n        adequate sanitation, up from 2,600,000,000 in 1990, and without \n        a stronger commitment to sanitation, it will be difficult to \n        reduce the incidence of diarrhea, a leading child killer, and \n        other diseases that flourish in unsanitary conditions. For only \n        $5.50, 1 plastic latrine pan and outlet pipe could provide safe \n        sanitation for 1 family, and for $150, a handpump, pipe, and \n        accessories for equipping a shallow well could benefit up to \n        250 people.\n            (9) 2,200,000 children under the age of 5 die each year in \n        developing countries of acute respiratory infections (ARI). \n        Appropriate treatment of ARI, including early diagnosis and the \n        proper use of antibiotics, could avert 30 to 60 percent of ARI-\n        related child deaths.\n            (10) About 100,000,000 children under the age of 5 suffer \n        from vitamin A deficiency, which impairs children's ability to \n        resist illnesses and contributes to nearly 25 percent of under-\n        5 deaths in developing countries, but 6 cents can buy 3 vitamin \n        A capsules to protect a child against blindness and other \n        health risks from vitamin A deficiency for 1 year, or \n        $6,000,000 could protect 100,000,000 children annually against \n        such blindness and other health risks.\n            (11) Because a major global immunization campaign is \n        nearing the goal of eradicating polio, a 10-year effort to \n        eradicate polio through childhood vaccination and surveillance \n        would cost only $100,000,000 per year.\n            (12) Up to 1,500,000 children annually could be saved by \n        increased breast-feeding because breast-fed infants are up to \n        25 times less likely to die of diarrheal disease, and 4 times \n        less likely to die of acute respiratory infections.\n            (13) Nevertheless, estimates that each year more than \n        540,000 infants are infected by Mother To Child Transmission \n        (MTCT) of the HIV virus in Africa alone indicate the urgent \n        need for safe and practical alternatives to breast-feeding by \n        nursing mothers who are HIV-positive to help prevent the \n        transmission of the virus to their babies.\n\nSEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR CHILD SURVIVAL PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n            (1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated for \n        fiscal year 2000 $345,000,000 for infant and child health \n        programs under chapters 1 and 10 of part I of the Foreign \n        Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 and 2293 et seq.) that \n        have a direct, measurable, and high impact on reducing the \n        incidence of illness and death among children.\n            (2) Additional requirement.--Of the amount appropriated \n        pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under paragraph \n        (1), not less than 25 percent of such amount shall be allocated \n        for programs of United States-based, citizen-supported, private \n        voluntary organizations that implement community-based \n        programs.\n    (b) Limitation on Population Planning Assistance.--Notwithstanding \nany other provision of law, not more than $285,000,000 of the amounts \nappropriated in title II of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, \nand Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2000, to carry out any of the \nprovisions of law described in such title may obligated or expended for \npopulation planning activities or other population assistance, \nincluding all programs and activities designed to control fertility or \nto reduce or delay childbirths or pregnancies."
