FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) work is inherently American and honorable;\n            (2) work is of fundamental importance to any orderly \n        society which reveres such common values as responsibility, \n        independence, and respect for others;\n            (3) in order to reduce recidivism, provide restitution to \n        victims, reparations to communities, and promote the values of \n        responsibility, independence, and respect for others, the \n        Federal Government should enact policies which expand work, \n        educational, and life skills opportunities for prisoners \n        incarcerated in Federal and State penal institutions;\n            (4) American taxpayers are justified to expect that \n        prisoners reimburse the United States Treasury for the cost of \n        their incarceration, and in addition, that prisoners should \n        make monetary restitution to a fund which benefits the victims \n        of crime;\n            (5) prisoners should be prohibited from engaging in certain \n        types of activities which are not healthy and conducive to \n        their successful rehabilitation and restitution;\n            (6) prisoners should not have access to certain amenities \n        which are unnecessary, enhance leisure activities, or do not \n        promote successful rehabilitation;\n            (7) existing Federal laws limit prisoners from engaging in \n        work, and do not impose mandatory work requirements for \n        prisoners;\n            (8) existing barriers to prisoner labor should be removed \n        and Federal laws should be strengthened to ensure that \n        prisoners, their victims, taxpayers, and society in general \n        reap the maximum benefits and positive values associated with \n        work; and\n            (9) when implemented effectively, shock incarceration, or \n        ``boot camp'' programs, can provide offenders with a heightened \n        sense of personal responsibility, confidence, self-discipline, \n        and an increased ability to make a successful return to the \n        community while maximizing and fostering a safe and orderly \n        work environment for corrections' personnel.\n\nSEC. 3.
