FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) as a tool to justify Federal actions by the Secretary \n        of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency to address greenhouse gas emissions, including the \n        regulation or prohibition of the exploration, mining, \n        production, and use of coal and other fossil fuels as energy \n        sources, the social cost of greenhouse gases, specifically the \n        social cost of carbon and the social cost of methane, \n        represents the hypothetical cost of 1 incremental ton of carbon \n        dioxide or methane emissions in a given year;\n            (2) the document of the Office of Management and Budget \n        entitled ``Circular A-4'' and dated September 17, 2003--\n                    (A) guides Federal agencies on the development of \n                regulatory impact analysis required under Executive \n                Order 12866 (5 U.S.C. 601 note; relating to regulatory \n                planning and review) and other authorities; and\n                    (B) instructs Federal agencies to include discount \n                rates of 3 and 7 percent and evaluate the costs and \n                benefits of the regulatory action that accrue to \n                citizens and residents of the United States;\n            (3) the social cost of carbon estimates were first \n        developed in 2009 by an interagency working group that included \n        the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the \n        Environmental Protection Agency and fail to comply with the 3- \n        and 7-percent discount rates prescribed by the document of the \n        Office of Management and Budget entitled ``Circular A-4'' and \n        dated September 17, 2003;\n            (4) while the document of the Office of Management and \n        Budget entitled ``Circular A-4'' and dated September 17, 2003, \n        specifies that, in carrying out an evaluation of the global \n        effects of a rule, regulation, or action, the evaluation shall \n        be reported separately from domestic costs and benefits of that \n        rule, regulation, or action, the social cost of carbon instead \n        calculates the global benefits in lieu of, not in addition to, \n        the domestic effects of a rule, regulation, or action;\n            (5) the use of the social cost of carbon estimates in \n        rulemakings by the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of \n        the Environmental Protection Agency without an opportunity for \n        public notice and comment violates scientific peer review \n        requirements and the commitment of the President to transparent \n        and open government, as outlined in the memorandum of the \n        President entitled ``Transparency and Open Government: \n        Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and \n        Agencies'' and dated January 21, 2009;\n            (6) in July 2015, as part of a revision of the social cost \n        of carbon in response to over 150 substantive comments and in \n        acknowledgment of the faulty process by which the social cost \n        of carbon estimates were developed, the Director of the Office \n        of Management and Budget requested that the National Academies \n        of Science, Engineering, and Medicine review and make \n        recommendations for the improvement of the social cost of \n        carbon estimates;\n            (7) shortly after the commencement of the review referred \n        to in paragraph (6), the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency used the social cost of methane estimate \n        developed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency, without appropriate peer review or opportunity for \n        public notice and comment, to justify the costs and benefits \n        of--\n                    (A) the proposed rule entitled ``Oil and Natural \n                Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New and Modified \n                Sources'' (80 Fed. Reg. 56593 (September 18, 2015)); \n                and\n                    (B) the final rule entitled ``Oil and Natural Gas \n                Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and \n                Modified Sources'' (81 Fed. Reg. 35824 (June 3, 2016)) \n                and the accompanying regulatory impact analysis \n                entitled ``Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Final Oil \n                and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, \n                Reconstructed, and Modified Sources'', prepared by the \n                Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air and \n                Radiation, in May 2016 and identified by docket ID \n                number EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0505-7630;\n            (8) continued use of the social cost of carbon and the \n        social cost of methane by the Secretary of Energy and the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency ignores \n        sound science for the purpose of eliminating the exploration, \n        mining, production, and use of the abundant domestic sources of \n        fossil fuel energy of the United States; and\n            (9) the regulations of the Secretary of Energy and the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency are \n        costing families of the United States billions of dollars each \n        year and are justified, in large part, by the social cost of \n        greenhouse gases, including the social cost of carbon and the \n        social cost of methane.\n\nSEC. 3.
