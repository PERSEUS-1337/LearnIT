FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The 51-mile stretch of the Columbia River, known as the \n        ``Hanford Reach'', provides 80 percent of the fall Chinook \n        salmon in the river system, critical habitat for wildlife, a \n        high-quality waterfowl sanctuary, as well as numerous scenic, \n        historic, and recreational opportunities for the public.\n            (2) In 1996 Congress, through Public Law 104-333, \n        prohibited damming, dredging, channeling, or other such \n        activities along the Hanford Reach in order to help preserve \n        and protect the unique environmental benefits of the region.\n            (3) The lands surrounding the Hanford Reach area of the \n        Columbia River, Washington, should be properly managed in order \n        to protect plant, fish, wildlife, cultural, recreational, and \n        scenic resources, while preserving access to these lands.\n            (4) Recognizing the unique and pristine values of the area, \n        local citizens in cooperation with Federal and State \n        authorities have developed a comprehensive protection plan \n        which has enhanced salmon habitat along the Hanford Reach. This \n        plan, known as the Vernita Bar Agreement, has preserved the \n        free flowing, riparian character of the Hanford Reach, and \n        serves as a blueprint for further successful management along \n        the Columbia River.\n            (5) Although dozens of local, State, and Federal \n        environmental protection and management laws and regulations \n        exist for the Hanford Reach, management efforts can be better \n        integrated and can lead to more efficient use of public \n        resources and improved habitat and recreation management.\n            (6) Inasmuch as Federal financial resources are \n        constrained, joint partnerships among Federal, State, and local \n        entities can provide long-term habitat and wildlife management, \n        maintain recreational opportunities, and develop a responsible \n        and environmentally sound management plan for the Hanford \n        Reach.\n            (7) The people and the governments of Benton, Franklin, and \n        Grant Counties desire to enter into such a partnership with the \n        State of Washington and the United States to ensure the \n        continued protection of plant, fish, wildlife, cultural, \n        recreational, and scenic resources on the lands surrounding the \n        Hanford Reach.\n            (8) Such a cooperative partnership will provide a forum for \n        public input from the entire region and ensure the long-term \n        protection of the river as wild, scenic, and accessible.\n            (9) Congress recommends the formation of a commission, with \n        Federal, State and local members, to manage the Reach in \n        accordance with the above goals.\n            (10) The commission will be structured to ensure that each \n        entity will have equal standing to make or reject management \n        decisions.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to protect and enhance the plant \nresources, fish and wildlife resources, cultural resources, \nrecreational access and other uses of the Hanford Reach through a joint \npartnership with Federal, State and local governments.\n\nSEC. 4.
