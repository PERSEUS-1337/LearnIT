FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Current efforts to stem the tide of illegal immigrants \n        crossing into the United States have fallen far short of need.\n            (2) The number of illegal immigrants currently in the \n        United States is approximating 11 million.\n            (3) Cities, counties, and States are forced to absorb the \n        costs of illegal immigration without compensation from the \n        Federal Government or employers.\n            (4) United States companies continue to recruit and hire \n        illegal immigrants and thereby aid in the erosion of the border \n        security of the United States.\n            (5) The hiring of illegal immigrants has had a negative \n        impact on the employment opportunities of legal immigrants and \n        United States citizens.\n            (6) Federal law expressly prohibits the hiring of illegal \n        immigrants.\n            (7) In 2004, only three United States companies were cited \n        for hiring illegal immigrants.\n\nSEC. 3.
