ENERGY CONSERVATION CORPS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) established in \n        1933 was one of the singularly successful Federal programs in \n        American history.\n            (2) The CCC provided work and vocational training for \n        3,500,000 unemployed young Americans through projects designed \n        to develop and conserve the country's natural resources and \n        build and maintain its infrastructure.\n            (3) Projects included environmental clean up, wild fire \n        prevention, erosion control, vegetation mapping, invasive \n        species removal, reforestation, recreational facility \n        construction, trail building, swamp drainage, flood relief, and \n        disaster response.\n            (4) This extensive development and improvement of public \n        lands by the CCC was in large part responsible for the modern \n        national and State park systems.\n            (5) Today, an estimated 3,800,000 18-24 year olds, roughly \n        15 percent of all young adults, are neither employed nor in \n        school. Since 2000 alone, the ranks of these nonengaged young \n        adults have grown by 700,000, a 19 percent increase.\n            (6) High school dropouts are at high risk of incarceration. \n        Approximately 16 percent of all young men, ages 18-24, without \n        a high school degree or GED are either incarcerated or on \n        parole at any point in time. According to a 2002 Report from \n        the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2,000,000 people are \n        incarcerated at an average annual cost of $20,000 per inmate--\n        for a total cost of $40,000,000,000 per year.\n            (7) In testimony before the House Education and the \n        Workforce Committee in 2005, Secretary of Education Margaret \n        Spellings said that dropouts ``cost our Nation more than $260 \n        billion'' in ``lost wages, lost taxes, and lost productivity \n        over their lifetimes''.\n            (8) Energy inefficiencies account for at least 50 percent \n        of all United States energy use.\n            (9) According to the World Watch Institute, United States \n        electricity use could be reduced by 70 percent through \n        efficiency gains alone.\n            (10) Estimates indicate that while the average United \n        States household's energy costs are equal to 7 percent of \n        household income, low-income households spend 17 percent of \n        their household earnings on energy.\n            (11) In a manner similar to the CCC of the 1930s, \n        disconnected young people can be mobilized to retrofit, \n        weatherize, and otherwise improve the energy efficiency of \n        residential and public facilities that account for more than 40 \n        percent of carbon emissions.\n            (12) The rehabilitation, renovation, and retrofitting of \n        these facilities by disconnected youth engaged in public \n        service benefit the disconnected youth, the facility resident \n        and owners, the communities in which they are located, as well \n        as the environment as shared by all.\n            (13) Service and conservation corps, by providing \n        educational and training opportunities to disconnected youth \n        through national and community service projects, have an \n        established record of administering such projects.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section--\n            (1) to create an Energy Conservation Corps that will \n        provide educational and economic opportunities to disadvantaged \n        and disconnected youth by engaging them in team-based service \n        projects designed to promote and improve the energy \n        conservation and efficiency of residential and public buildings \n        and spaces; and\n            (2) through the Energy Conservation Corps, to stimulate \n        interest among young people in stewardship of the environment \n        and natural resources and lifelong service to their communities \n        and the United States.\n    (c) Establishment of the Energy Conservation Corps.--\n            (1) In general.--The Energy Conservation Corps is hereby \n        established in the Department of Energy.\n            (2) Age and background.--The Energy Conservation Corps \n        shall consist of individuals between the ages of 16 and 25, \n        inclusive, at least 50 percent of whom come from disadvantaged \n        or disconnected backgrounds.\n            (3) Civil service.--Individuals may be enrolled in the \n        Energy Conservation Corps without regard to the civil service \n        and classification laws, rules, or regulations of the United \n        States.\n            (4) Duration.--Individuals may be enrolled in the Energy \n        Conservation Corps for up to 24 months.\n            (5) Opportunities.--Energy Conservation Corps will provide \n        such individuals with opportunities to further their education, \n        through programs designed to help them obtain a high school \n        diploma, GED, job training, professional certificate, or access \n        to post-secondary education.\n            (6) Projects.--Energy Conservation Corps will engage such \n        individuals in service projects, primarily team-based, designed \n        to increase energy efficiency and improve natural resources \n        use.\n    (d) Eligible Applicants.--\n            (1) Supporting organizations.--The Secretary shall accept \n        applications from qualified service and conservation corps, and \n        nonprofit organizations, units of State, county, and local \n        government, and institutions of higher education for the \n        purpose of establishing, operating, and supporting Corps.\n            (2) Qualifications.--Applicants shall demonstrate an \n        ability to--\n                    (A) provide Corpsmembers with access to programs to \n                obtain a high school diploma or GED;
