FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On August 30, 1999, the East Timorese people voted \n        overwhelmingly in favor of independence from Indonesia in \n        elections organized by the United Nations Assistance Mission in \n        East Timor (UNAMET). Pro-integration militias, with the support \n        of the Indonesian military, attempted to prevent then \n        retaliated against this vote by launching a campaign of terror \n        and violence. As a result, over 500,000 people, or \n        approximately \\2/3\\ of the population, were displaced. Hundreds \n        were murdered, and many were raped.\n            (2) The violent campaign devastated East Timor's \n        infrastructure, including its schools, water and power \n        supplies, and transportation and communications systems. The \n        militias destroyed or severely damaged 60 to 80 percent of \n        public and private property across East Timor. Virtually all \n        vestiges of government, public services (including sanitation), \n        and public security in East Timor also collapsed.\n            (3) The International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) \n        entered East Timor in September 1999 and successfully restored \n        order. INTERFET was organized and led by Australia, with the \n        active participation of the Philippines, South Korea, New \n        Zealand, and Thailand.\n            (4) On October 25, 1999, the United Nations Security \n        Council established a new mandate for its operations in East \n        Timor. The United Nations Transitional Administration for East \n        Timor (UNTAET), which replaced UNAMET, was directed to provide \n        overall administration of East Timor, guide the people of East \n        Timor in the establishment of a new democratic government, and \n        maintain security and order.\n            (5) The leadership of UNTAET and the East Timorese \n        leadership currently anticipate that East Timor will become an \n        independent nation in mid- to late-2001.\n            (6) East Timor is one of the poorest places in Asia. A \n        large percentage of the population live below the poverty line, \n        only 20 percent of East Timor's population is literate, most of \n        East Timor's people remain unemployed, the annual per capita \n        Gross National Product is $340, and life expectancy is only 56 \n        years.\n            (7) The World Bank and the United Nations have estimated \n        that it will require $300,000,000 in development assistance \n        over the next three years in order to meet East Timor's basic \n        development needs. Donor countries, including the United \n        States, have pledged a total of $173,000,000 to the Trust Fund \n        established by the World Bank to manage the distribution of \n        donor funds in East Timor, and $37,000,000 to the Trust Fund of \n        UNTAET.\n            (8) The United States has been a leading contributor to the \n        development of East Timor since 1994. As a result of the United \n        States Agency for International Development's funding a \n        successful coffee cooperative project, small farmers have been \n        able to enter the cash economy and to increase the amount of \n        money earned from the coffee they grow.\n            (9) The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related \n        Programs Appropriations Act, 2000, provided $25,000,000 for \n        East Timor. Utilizing these funds, the United States Agency for \n        International Development has helped to restart the coffee \n        cooperative project after it ceased to operate during the \n        militia rampage, funded job creation programs for East \n        Timorese, contributed to UNTAET and to the World Bank Trust \n        Fund for East Timor, supported community organizations, and \n        funded forensics, human rights, independent media, and judicial \n        development projects.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO SUPPORT FOR EAST TIMOR.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the United States--\n            (1) should support formation of broad-based democracy in \n        East Timor, and help lay the groundwork for East Timor's \n        economic recovery, the strengthening of East Timor's security, \n        and the promotion of East Timor's ability to play a positive \n        role in the Asia-Pacific region and in international \n        organizations.\n            (2) should continue to support the provision of bilateral \n        and multilateral assistance to East Timor, with such assistance \n        targeted to creation of jobs, promotion of civil society, \n        preparation for East Timor's first elections, development of \n        East Timor's educational and health care systems, and support \n        for East Timor's judicial system and the truth and \n        reconciliation process;\n            (3) should begin to lay the groundwork, prior to East \n        Timor's independence, for an equitable future trade and \n        investment relationship with East Timor, including trade and \n        investment promotion activities to be carried out by the \n        Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade and \n        Development Agency, and the Export-Import Bank of the United \n        States;\n            (4) should officially open a diplomatic mission in East \n        Timor as soon as possible to ensure that the United States can \n        continue to play a leadership role in building East Timor's \npolitical and economic future; and\n            (5) should support the efforts by the United Nations to \n        ensure justice and accountability related to past atrocities in \n        East Timor through United Nations investigations, United \n        Nations support for the development of East Timor's judicial \n        system, and the possible establishment of an international \n        tribunal for East Timor.\n\nSEC. 4.
