FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services \n        is deterred by the potential for liability actions against them \n        and the organizations they serve;\n            (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n        organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n        associations, social service agencies, educational \n        institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely \n        affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of \n        directors and service in other capacities;\n            (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n        is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n        programs than would be obtainable if volunteers were \n        participating;\n            (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n        effective social service programs, many of which are national \n        in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and \n        represent some of the most successful public-private \n        partnerships, protection of volunteerism through clarification \n        and limitation of the personal liability risks assumed by the \n        volunteer in connection with such participation is an \n        appropriate subject for Federal legislation;\n            (5) services and goods provided by volunteers and nonprofit \n        organizations would often otherwise be provided by private \n        entities that operate in interstate commerce;\n            (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n        costs, volunteers and nonprofit organizations face higher costs \n        in purchasing insurance, through interstate insurance markets, \n        to cover their activities; and\n            (7) reform efforts should respect the role of the States in \n        the development of civil justice rules, but recognize the \n        national Government's role.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the interests \nof social service program beneficiaries and taxpayers and to sustain \nthe availability of programs, nonprofit organizations, and governmental \nentities that depend on volunteer contributions by reforming the laws \nto provide certain protections from liability abuses related to \nvolunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental entities.\n\nSEC. 3. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n    (a) Preemption.--This Act preempts the laws of any State to the \nextent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act, except that this \nAct shall not preempt any State law that provides additional protection \nfrom liability relating to--\n            (1) volunteers or to any category of volunteers in the \n        performance of services for a nonprofit organization or \n        governmental entity; and\n            (2) nonprofit organizations or governmental entities.\n    (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This Act shall \nnot apply to any civil action in a State court against a volunteer, \nnonprofit organization, or governmental entity in which all parties are \ncitizens of the State if such State enacts a statute--\n            (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n            (2) declaring the election of such State that this Act \n        shall not apply to such civil action in the State; and\n            (3) containing no other provisions.\n\nSEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.\n\n    (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as provided in \nsubsections (b) and (d), no volunteer of a nonprofit organization or \ngovernmental entity shall be liable for harm caused by an act or \nomission of the volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity if--\n            (1) the volunteer was acting within the scope of the \n        volunteer's responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n        governmental entity at the time of the act or omission;\n            (2) if appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly \n        licensed, certified, or authorized by the appropriate \n        authorities for the activities or practice in the State in \n        which the harm occurred, where the activities were or practice \n        was undertaken within the scope of the volunteer's \n        responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or governmental \n        entity; and\n            (3) the harm was not caused by willful or criminal \n        misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a \n        conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the \n        individual harmed by the volunteer.\n    (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers to Organizations and \nEntities.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any \ncivil action brought by any nonprofit organization or any governmental \nentity against any volunteer of such organization or entity.\n    (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization or Entity.--Except as \nprovided under subsection (e), nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to affect the liability of any nonprofit organization or \ngovernmental entity with respect to harm caused to any person.\n    (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--If the laws of a \nState limit volunteer liability subject to one or more of the following \nconditions, such conditions shall not be construed as inconsistent with \nthis section:\n            (1) A State law that requires a nonprofit organization or \n        governmental entity to adhere to risk management procedures, \n        including mandatory training of volunteers.\n            (2) A State law that makes the organization or entity \n        liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the same \n        extent as an employer is liable for the acts or omissions of \n        its employees.\n            (3) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n        inapplicable if the volunteer was operating a motor vehicle, \n        vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which the State requires \n        the operator or vehicle owner to possess an operator's license \n        or to maintain insurance.\n            (4) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n        inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of a \n        State or local government pursuant to State or local law.\n            (5) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n        applicable only if the nonprofit organization or governmental \n        entity provides a financially secure source of recovery for \n        individuals who suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a \n        volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity. A \n        financially secure source of recovery may be an insurance \n        policy within specified limits, comparable coverage from a risk \n        pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or alternative \n        arrangements that satisfy the State that the organization or \n        entity will be able to pay for losses up to a specified amount. \n        Separate standards for different types of liability exposure \n        may be specified.\n    (e) Limitation on Punitive Damages of Volunteers, Nonprofit \nOrganizations, and Governmental Entities.--\n            (1) General rule.--Punitive damages may not be awarded \n        against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental \n        entity in an action brought for harm because of the action of a \n        volunteer acting within the scope of the volunteer's \n        responsibilities to a nonprofit organization or governmental \n        entity unless the claimant establishes by clear and convincing \n        evidence that the harm was proximately caused by an action of \n        such volunteer which constitutes willful or criminal \n        misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights \n        or safety of the individual harmed.\n            (2) Construction.--Paragraph (1) does not create a cause of \n        action for punitive damages and does not preempt or supersede \n        any State law to the extent that such law would further limit \n        the award of punitive damages.\n    (f) Exceptions to Limitations on Liability.--The limitations on the \nliability of a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental \nentity under this section shall not apply to any misconduct that--\n            (1) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term is \n        defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code) or act \n        of international terrorism (as that term is defined in section \n        2331 of title 18) for which the defendant has been convicted in \n        any court;\n            (2) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used in the \n        Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note));\n            (3) involves a sexual offense, as defined by applicable \n        State law, for which the defendant has been convicted in any \n        court;\n            (4) involves misconduct for which the defendant has been \n        found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law; or\n            (5) where the defendant was under the influence (as \n        determined pursuant to applicable State law) of intoxicating \n        alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct.\n\nSEC. 5.

The court shall render a separate judgment against each \n        defendant in an amount determined pursuant to the preceding \n        sentence.\n            (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n        determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n        defendant under this section, the trier of fact shall determine \n        the percentage of responsibility of each person responsible for \n        the claimant's harm, whether or not such person is a party to \n        the action.\n\nSEC. 6.
