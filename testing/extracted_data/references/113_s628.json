FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since September 11, 2001, approximately 30,000 veterans \n        have been separated from the Armed Forces on the basis of a \n        personality disorder or adjustment disorder.\n            (2) Nearly all veterans who are separated on the basis of a \n        personality or adjustment disorder are prohibited from \n        accessing service-connected disability compensation, disability \n        severance pay, and disability retirement pay.\n            (3) Many veterans who are separated on the basis of a \n        personality or adjustment disorder are unable to find \n        employment because of the ``personality disorder'' or \n        ``adjustment disorder'' label on their Certificate of Release \n        or Discharge from Active Duty.\n            (4) The Government Accountability Office has found that the \n        regulatory compliance of the Department of Defense in \n        separating members of the Armed Forces on the basis of a \n        personality or adjustment disorder was as low as 40 percent \n        between 2001 and 2007.\n            (5) Expansion of the authority of the Physical Disability \n        Board of Review to include review of the separation of members \n        of the Armed Forces on the basis of a mental condition not \n        amounting to disability, including separation on the basis of a \n        personality or adjustment disorder, is warranted in order to \n        ensure that any veteran wrongly separated on such basis will \n        have the ability to access disability benefits and employment \n        opportunities available to veterans.\n\nSEC. 3. REVIEW BY PHYSICAL DISABILITY BOARD OF REVIEW OF MILITARY \n              SEPARATION ON BASIS OF A MENTAL CONDITION NOT AMOUNTING \n              TO DISABILITY.\n\n    (a) Members Entitled to Review by Physical Disability Board of \nReview.--Section 1554a of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``disability \n        determinations of covered individuals by Physical Evaluation \n        Boards'' and inserting ``disability and separation \n        determinations regarding certain members and former members of \n        the armed forces described in subsection (b)''; and\n            (2) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following \n        new subsection:\n    ``(b) Covered Individuals.--For purposes of this section, covered \nindividuals are members and former members of the armed forces who--\n            ``(1) during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, \n        and ending on December 31, 2014, are separated from the armed \n        forces due to unfitness for duty because of a medical condition \n        with a disability rating of 20 percent disabled or less and are \n        found to be not eligible for retirement; or\n            ``(2) before December 31, 2014, are separated from the \n        armed forces due of unfitness for duty because of a mental \n        condition not amounting to disability, including separation on \n        the basis of a personality disorder or adjustment disorder.''.\n    (b) Nature and Scope of Review.--Such section is further amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (d), (e), and (f) as \n        subsections (e), (f), and (g), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new \n        subsection (d):\n    ``(d) Review of Separations Due to Unfitness for Duty Because of a \nMental Condition Not Amounting to Disability.--(1) Upon the request of \na covered individual described in paragraph (2) of subsection (b), or a \nsurviving spouse, next of kin, or legal representative of a covered \nindividual described in such paragraph, the Physical Disability Board \nof Review shall review the findings and decisions of the Physical \nEvaluation Board with respect to such covered individual.
