    "content": "During the 110 th Congress, several House and Senate committees have engaged in oversight activities, including hearings and requests for expeditious production of documents and information regarding the Administration's warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance programs, as possible changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended, were explored. In July 2007, an unclassified summary of the National Intelligence Estimate on \"The Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland\" was released. It expressed the judgment, in part, that the U/S. Homeland will face a persistent and evolving threat over the next three years, the main threat coming from Islamic terrorist groups and cells, particularly Al Qaeda. On August 2, 2007, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) released a statement on \"Modernization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\" In his statement, Admiral McConnell viewed such modernization as necessary to respond to technological changes and to meet the Nation's current intelligence collection needs. He deemed it essential for the Intelligence Community to provide warning of threats to the United States. He perceived two critically needed changes. First, he stated that a court order should not be required for gathering foreign intelligence from foreign targets located overseas, although he did agree to court review of related procedures after commencement of the needed collection. Second, he contended that liability protection was needed for those who furnished aid to the government in carrying out its foreign intelligence collection efforts. On August 5, 2007, the Protect America Act of 2007, P.L. 110-55 , was enacted into law with a 180 day sunset provision, providing a temporary solution to concerns raised by the Director of National Intelligence. Both the House and the Senate have considered or are considering possible legislation to provide a longer-term statutory approach to these concerns. On November 15, 2007, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3773 , the Responsible Electronic Surveillance That is Overseen, Reviewed, and Effective Act of 2007 or the RESTORE Act of 2007. On October 26, 2007, Senator Rockefeller reported S. 2248 , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2007 or the FISA Amendment Act of 2007, an original bill, from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. S. 2248 was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 1, 2007. On November 16, 2007, S. 2248 was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by Senator Leahy with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. On December 14, 2007, Senator Reid made a motion to proceed with consideration of S. 2248 , and presented a cloture motion on the motion to proceed. The motion to proceed was then withdrawn. On December 17, 2007, the Senate considered the motion to proceed with the measure. Cloture on the motion to proceed was invoked by a vote of 76-10, Record Vote Number 435. After some debate in the closing hours before the Senate broke for the holidays, a decision was made to revisit the measure when the Members returned in January. Senate floor activities on S. 2248 resumed on January 23 and 24, 2008. A modified version of the Senate Judiciary Committee's amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2248 was tabled. Senator Reid sought unanimous consent for consideration of the House-passed bill, H.R. 3773 , but Senator McConnell objected. Senator Rockefeller, for himself and Senator Bond, proposed an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2248 ( S.Amdt. 3911 ). On January 28, 2008, a cloture motion by Senator McConnell on this amendment failed to pass. A cloture motion on an amendment proposed by Senator Reid to S. 2248 to extend the sunset on the Protect America Act for an additional 30 days ( S.Amdt. 3918 ) also fell short of the required votes. Other amendments to S. 2248 have been proposed. On January 29, 2008, both the House and the Senate passed H.R. 5104 , a 15-day extension to the sunset for the Protect America Act, to allow further time to consider, pass, and go to conference on proposed legislation to amend FISA, while ensuring that the intelligence community would have the authority it needed in the intervening period. Pursuant to an agreement and order of January 31, 2008, S.Amdts. 3909, as modified; 3932, as modified; 3960, as modified; and S.Amdt. 3945 were agreed to, while other amendments were scheduled for floor debate. In the ensuing floor consideration to date, S.Amdt. 3941 was agreed to, while S.Amdts. 3913 and 3915 failed to pass on February 7, 2008. S.Amdt. 3930 fell short of the requisite 60 votes and was withdrawn on February 6, 2008. Still pending are S.Amdts. 3938, as modified, 3911, 3907, 3927, 3919, 3920, and 3910. Floor debate is anticipated to continue early next week, with additional votes expected on Tuesday, February 12, 2008. H.R. 3773 , S. 2248 and the Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2248 , each includes amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This report provides a side by side comparison of the provisions of these three measures, using H.R. 3773 as the basis for the comparison. As title I of FISA defines a number of key terms critical to understanding the import of the bills' language, a glossary of FISA terms as defined in section 101 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801 is attached to assist in understanding the effect of these measures. Senator Reid introduced two additional FISA bills on December 10, 2007, S. 2440 and S. 2441 , which were read twice the following day and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar as Numbers 529 and 530, respectively. S. 2402 was introduced by Senator Specter on December 3, 2007, and referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In Committee markup on December 13, 2007, an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2402 was adopted by unanimous consent. Then, by a vote of 5-13, the Committee rejected S. 2402 , as amended. The proposal would have permitted substitution of the government for electronic communication service providers in law suits where certain criteria were met. These bills will not be included in this side-by-side comparison.
