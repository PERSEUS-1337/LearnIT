FINDINGS; DEFINITION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The current and future health care needs of veterans \n        residing in the eight southern counties of New Jersey are not \n        being fully met by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n            (2) Travel times for southern New Jersey veterans to \n        existing Department of Veterans Affairs health care facilities \n        in Pennsylvania and Delaware fall within the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs health planning criteria, but those criteria \n        fail to recognize that the area is largely rural and its \n        roadways are congested, creating significant access barriers to \n        veterans in need of care and thereby resulting in suppressed \n        demand for care.\n            (3) Projections of future growth in demand for health care \n        by veterans in southern New Jersey support sustainable \n        enrollment of veterans needing Department of Veterans Affairs \n        health care.\n            (4) The number of veterans residing in southern New Jersey \n        is increasing as more veterans retire in the area and new \n        veterans seek services in the wake of large-scale deployments \n        of National Guard and Reservists from the area. According to \n        United States census data, the veteran population in the eight \n        counties of southern New Jersey is greater than 235,000.\n            (5) By the end of 2004, 62 percent of the serving members \n        of the New Jersey National Guard will have been deployed on \n        active duty in support of the global war on terror and will be \n        eligible for enrollment in the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        health care system.\n    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this Act, the term ``southern New \nJersey'' means the following counties of the State of New Jersey: \nOcean, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, Salem, Cumberland, Atlantic, and \nCape May.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICAL CARE FOR VETERANS IN SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY.\n\n    (a) Determination.--Not later than March 15, 2006, the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs shall determine, and notify Congress pursuant to \nsubsection (b), whether the needs of veterans in southern New Jersey \nfor full-service medical care shall be met--\n            (1) through a project for a public-private venture to \n        provide inpatient and outpatient services and long-term care to \n        veterans at an existing facility in southern New Jersey; or\n            (2) through a project for construction of a new full-\n        service, 100-bed Department of Veterans Affairs medical center \n        in southern New Jersey.\n    (b) Notification and Prospectus.--Not later than March 15, 2006, \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to Congress a report--\n            (1) identifying which of the two options specified in \n        subsection (a) has been selected by the Secretary; and\n            (2) providing, for the option selected, a prospectus that \n        includes, at a minimum, the matter specified in paragraphs (1) \n        through (8) of section 8104(b) of title 38, United States Code, \n        and the project time lines.\n\nSEC. 4.
