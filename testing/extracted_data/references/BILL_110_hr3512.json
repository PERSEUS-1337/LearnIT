FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to a 2005 report by the Government \n        Accountability Office (in this section referred to as ``GAO''), \n        college textbook costs have risen at twice the rate of \n        inflation.\n            (2) According to the GAO report, the cost of textbooks can \n        increase a student's overall college costs from 8 percent at \n        private institutions to over 72 percent at some public \n        institutions and community colleges.\n            (3) According to a report by the Advisory Committee on \n        Student Financial Assistance, requested by Congress, current \n        grant and scholarship programs which can barely meet the \n        challenge of rising tuition costs are not sufficient to \n        mitigate the costs of college textbooks.\n            (4) According to the GAO report, publishers have begun to \n        develop and distribute alternatives to college textbooks in \n        order to provide less expensive materials, but they have had to \n        incorporate the development costs into the prices of domestic \n        textbook sales.\n            (5) According to the GAO report, there has not been a \n        sufficient demand for textbook alternatives to offset \n        publishers' development costs and reduce the overall costs of \n        college textbooks.\n            (6) According to the GAO report, publishers have engaged in \n        agreements with overseas distributors to restrict the re-\n        importation of overseas textbooks in the United States, \n        regardless of content similarities, thus restricting students \n        from purchasing lower-cost textbooks from overseas.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that:\n            (1) There is not sufficient communication and transparency \n        between all the stakeholders in the textbook market, leading to \n        unnecessary frustrations and misunderstandings about the rising \n        costs of college textbooks.\n            (2) The textbook market by its nature puts students at a \n        disadvantage when it comes to affecting the prices of textbooks \n        because it does not include them in the decision-making process \n        for ultimate textbook purchases.\n            (3) Students should be fully informed about the costs of \n        textbooks before registering for classes in order to be aware \n        of the full cost of higher education.\n            (4) Students should have the ability, whenever possible, to \n        seek out and purchase lower-cost alternatives to textbooks so \n        as to reduce the cost of higher education.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE AND INTENT.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to ensure that every student in higher \neducation is offered better and more timely access to affordable course \nmaterials by educating and informing faculty, students, administrators, \ninstitutions of higher education, bookstores, distributors, and \npublishers on all aspects of the selection, purchase, sale, and use of \nthe course materials. It is the intent of this Act--\n            (1) to have all involved parties work together to identify \n        ways to decrease the cost of college textbooks and supplemental \n        materials for students while protecting the academic freedom of \n        faculty members to select high quality course materials for \n        students;\n            (2) that--\n                    (A) textbook publishers and distributors should \n                work with faculty to understand the cost to students of \n                purchasing faculty selected textbooks, including the \n                disclosure of prices and bundling practices;\n                    (B) college bookstores should work with faculty to \n                review timelines and processes for ordering and \n                stocking selected textbooks, and disclose textbook \n                costs to faculty and students in a timely manner;\n                    (C) institutions of higher education should be \n                encouraged to implement numerous options to address \n                textbook affordability; and\n                    (D) institutions of higher education should work \n                with student organizations to help students understand \n                the factors driving textbook costs and available \n                methods and resources to mitigate the effects of those \n                costs.\n\nSEC. 4.
