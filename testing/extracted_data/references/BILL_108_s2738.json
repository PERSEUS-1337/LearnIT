FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) Samuel de Champlain (1567-1635) was a French explorer \n        and navigator who mapped much of northeastern North America and \n        established a settlement in Quebec;\n            (2) in 1609, Champlain entered the valley where he observed \n        the lake that today carries his name, Lake Champlain, which \n        borders the States of Vermont and New York and a portion of the \n        border between Canada and the United States;\n            (3) the 8,234 square mile Lake Champlain Basin is an \n        extraordinary cultural, historical, and recreational resource \n        that had a significant role in the history and culture of pre-\n        European America, colonial North America, and the formation and \n        early development of the United States;\n            (4) Lake Champlain has a recognized national significance, \n        not only for scenic beauty, but also for the impact of the lake \n        on the local, regional, and national economy;\n            (5) Lake Champlain is supported by a watershed of more than \n        8,200 square miles and supports a regional economy of more than \n        $9,000,000,000;\n            (6) the importance of Lake Champlain spreads throughout the \n        Northeast, because residents of New England and the Mid-\n        Atlantic States cherish the lake and the resources of the lake \n        for recreational, ecological, and scenic values; and\n            (7) the States of Vermont and New York have both \n        established Champlain 400th Commemoration Commissions.\n    (b) Purpose.--\n            (1) In general.--The purpose of this Act is to establish \n        the Samuel de Champlain 400th Commemoration Commission to \n        provide technical and financial assistance to the States of \n        Vermont and New York and communities in the States to \n        commemorate--\n                    (A) the arrival of Samuel de Champlain into the \n                Champlain Valley; and\n                    (B) the heritage of the greater Lake Champlain \n                Basin.\n            (2) Inclusions.--The assistance described in paragraph (1) \n        shall, at a minimum--\n                    (A) ensure a suitable national observance, in 2009, \n                of the Samuel de Champlain anniversary by complementing \n                the programs and activities of the States of Vermont \n                and New York;\n                    (B) cooperate with and assist the programs and \n                activities of the States in commemorating the Samuel de \n                Champlain 2009 anniversary;\n                    (C) assist in ensuring that the commemoration \n                provides an excellent visitor experience and beneficial \n                interaction between visitors and the natural and \n                cultural resources of the Champlain Valley;\n                    (D) assist in ensuring that the Samuel de Champlain \n                2009 observances are inclusive and appropriately \n                recognize the experiences and heritage of all peoples \n                present when Samuel de Champlain arrived in the \n                Champlain Valley;\n                    (E) provide assistance to States, localities, and \n                nonprofit organizations in the development of programs, \n                activities, and facilities to recognize the cultural \n                and historical significance of Lake Champlain;\n                    (F) facilitate international involvement in the \n                Samuel de Champlain 2009 commemoration;\n                    (G) support and facilitate marketing efforts for a \n                commemorative coin, stamp, and related activities for \n                the Samuel de Champlain commemoration;\n                    (H) support and facilitate the related efforts of \n                the Lake Champlain Basin Program and the Champlain \n                400th Commemoration Commissions established by the \n                States of Vermont and New York; and\n                    (I) assist in the appropriate development of \n                heritage tourism and economic benefits to the United \n                States.\n\n SEC. 3.
