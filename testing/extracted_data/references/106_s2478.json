FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) an important facet of the history of the United States \n        is the story of how the United States was populated;\n            (2) the migration, immigration, and settlement of the \n        population of the United States--\n                    (A) is broadly termed the ``peopling of America''; \n                and\n                    (B) is characterized by--\n                            (i) the movement of groups of people across \n                        external and internal boundaries of the United \n                        States and territories of the United States; \n                        and\n                            (ii) the interactions of those groups with \n                        each other and with other populations;\n            (3) each of those groups has made unique, important \n        contributions to American history, culture, art, and life;\n            (4) the spiritual, intellectual, cultural, political, and \n        economic vitality of the United States is a result of the \n        pluralism and diversity of the American population;\n            (5) the success of the United States in embracing and \n        accommodating diversity has strengthened the national fabric \n        and unified the United States in its values, institutions, \n        experiences, goals, and accomplishments;\n            (6)(A) the National Park Service's official thematic \n        framework, revised in 1996, responds to the requirement of \n        section 1209 of the Civil War Sites Study Act of 1990 (16 \n        U.S.C. 1a-5 note; Public Law 101-628), that ``the Secretary \n        shall ensure that the full diversity of American history and \n        prehistory are represented'' in the identification and \n        interpretation of historic properties by the National Park \n        Service; and\n            (B) the thematic framework recognizes that ``people are the \n        primary agents of change'' and establishes the theme of human \n        population movement and change--or ``peopling places''--as a \n        primary thematic category for interpretation and preservation; \n        and\n            (7) although there are approximately 70,000 listings on the \n        National Register of Historic Places, sites associated with the \n        exploration and settlement of the United States by a broad \n        range of cultures are not well represented.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to foster a much-needed understanding of the diversity \n        and contribution of the breadth of groups who have peopled the \n        United States; and\n            (2) to strengthen the ability of the National Park Service \n        to include groups and events otherwise not recognized in the \n        peopling of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
