    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Children from Peer-to-\nPeer Pornography Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Peer-to-peer file trading software has been very widely \n        distributed. The most popular of these programs has been \n        downloaded over 200 million times, and at any one time, there \n        are over 3 million people using it.\n            (2) Peer-to-peer systems are emerging as a conduit for the \n        distribution of pornographic images and videos, including child \n        pornography. Child pornography is easily found and downloaded \n        using peer-to-peer systems.\n            (3) Child pornography has become increasingly available on \n        peer-to-peer systems. In 2002, there was a fourfold increase in \n        the number of reports of child pornography on peer-to-peer \n        systems.\n            (4) Approximately 40 percent of users of peer-to-peer \n        systems are juveniles.\n            (5) Juvenile users of peer-to-peer systems are at \n        significant risk of inadvertent exposure to pornography, \n        including child pornography, because searches on innocuous \n        keywords likely to be used by juveniles produce a high \n        proportion of pornographic images.\n            (6) The availability of peer-to-peer systems as a \n        distribution mechanism for child pornography may lead to \n        further sexual abuse of children, because the production of \n        child pornography is intrinsically related to sexual abuse of \n        children.\n            (7) Peer-to-peer systems also pose serious security and \n        privacy threats to users. Among other things, peer-to-peer \n        software often gives others access to all the files that are \n        stored on a user's hard drive, and many users, including \n        juvenile users and their parents, do not even know of these \n        threats.\n            (8) In light of these considerations, it is important that \n        Federal law provide appropriate protection for juvenile users \n        of peer-to-peer systems.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Commission'' means the Federal Trade \n        Commission;\n            (2) the term ``juvenile'' means an individual under the age \n        of 18;\n            (3) the term ``parent'' includes a legal guardian;\n            (4) the terms ``peer-to-peer file trading software'' and \n        ``peer-to-peer system'' have the definition given to such terms \n        by the regulations to be promulgated under section 3(b)(1);\n            (5) the term ``verifiable parental consent'' means any \n        reasonable effort (taking into consideration available \n        technology) to ensure that a parent of a juvenile receives \n        notice as described in section 3(b)(2)(A) and authorizes the \n        distribution of peer-to-peer file trading software to the \n        juvenile, including efforts such as those constituting \n        ``verifiable parental consent'' under the Children's Online \n        Privacy Protection Act of 1998;\n            (6) the term ``verification of majority'' means any \n        reasonable effort (taking into consideration available \n        technology) to ensure that a recipient of peer-to-peer file \n        trading software is not a juvenile, including efforts such as \n        accepting and verifying a credit card number in connection with \n        a distribution of peer-to-peer file trading software; and\n            (7) the term ``person'' means any individual, partnership, \n        corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, or other \n        entity.\n\nSEC. 4. REGULATION OF JUVENILE ACCESS TO PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKS.\n\n    (a) Acts Prohibited.--It is unlawful for any person to distribute \npeer-to-peer file trading software, or to authorize or cause peer-to-\npeer file trading software to be distributed by another person, in \ninterstate commerce in a manner that violates the regulations \nprescribed under subsection (b)(2).\n    (b) Regulations.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Commission shall promulgate regulations \nthat--\n            (1) define the term ``peer-to-peer file trading software'' \n        for purposes of this Act, with such definition to encompass \n        computer software that enables the transmission of computer \n        files or data over the Internet or any other public network of \n        computers and that has as its primary function the capability \n        to do all of the following--\n                    (A) enable a computer on which such software is \n                used to transmit files or data to another such \n                computer;\n                    (B) enable the user of one such computer to request \n                the transmission of files or data from another such \n                computer; and\n                    (C) enable the user of one such computer to \n                designate files or data available for transmission to \n                another such computer, but which definition excludes, \n                to the extent otherwise included, software products \n                legitimately marketed and distributed primarily for the \n                operation of business and home networks, the networks \n                of Internet access providers, or the Internet itself; \n                and\n            (2) require any person who distributes, or authorizes or \n        causes another person to distribute, peer-to-peer file trading \n        software in interstate commerce to--\n                    (A) provide clear and prominent notice to each \n                recipient of peer-to-peer file trading software, before \n                the peer-to-peer file trading software is provided to \n                the recipient, that use thereof may expose the user to \n                pornography, illegal activities, and security and \n                privacy threats;\n                    (B) check for the do-not-install beacon described \n                in subsection (c)(1) and not transmit peer-to-peer file \n                trading software to any computer with such beacon;\n                    (C) obtain verification of majority, or if a \n                recipient is a juvenile obtain verifiable parental \n                consent, before the peer-to-peer file trading software \n                is provided to the recipient;\n                    (D) ask whether or not each juvenile recipient of \n                peer-to-peer file trading software is a child under the \n                age of 13;\n                    (E) comply with the provisions of the Children's \n                Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 \n                et seq.) as to all information collected from children \n                in connection with the distribution of peer-to-peer \n                file trading software;\n                    (F) ensure that the peer-to-peer file trading \n                software has the capability to be readily disabled or \n                uninstalled by a user thereof, and prominent means to \n                access clear information concerning the availability \n                and use of that capability;\n                    (G) if the peer-to-peer file trading software has \n                the capability of automatically causing a user's \n                computer to function as a supernode or other focal \n                point for the transmission of files or data, or \n                information about the availability of files or data, \n                among other computers on which such software is used, \n                ensure that such software does not exercise that \n                capability unless the user receives clear and prominent \n                notice thereof and thereafter takes affirmative steps \n                to enable that capability;\n                    (H) if the peer-to-peer file trading software has \n                the capability of disabling or circumventing security \n                or other protective software on, or features of, the \n                user's computer or network, including a firewall, \n                software that protects against viruses or other \n                malicious code or a do-not-install beacon or other \n                parental control, ensure that such peer-to-peer file \n                trading software does not exercise that capability \n                unless the user receives clear and prominent notice \n                thereof and thereafter takes affirmative steps to \n                enable that capability;\n                    (I) if such person does not reside in the United \n                States, designate a resident agent for service of \n                process in the United States, and file with the \n                Commission such designation and the address of the \n                office or usual place of residence of the agent;\n                    (J) maintain reasonable records of its compliance \n                with the requirements set forth in this paragraph; and\n                    (K) establish and maintain reasonable procedures to \n                protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of \n                personal information contained in such records.\n    (c) Technological Measures.--The Commission shall--\n            (1) not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment \n        of this Act, in consultation with the Under Secretary for \n        Technology of the Department of Commerce, develop and make \n        readily available to the public functional requirements for \n        standard ``do-not-install'' beacons that provide an effective \n        technological means for parents to record on their computers \n        their desire that users not install or use peer-to-peer file \n        trading software on those computers;\n            (2) make available to the public a list of do-not-install \n        beacon products that have been certified by their producers as \n        conforming to such functional requirements; and\n            (3) if in any study required by section 6, it appears to \n        the Commission that any commonly-used peer-to-peer file trading \n        software does not have the capability required by subsection \n        (b)(2)(F), promptly make readily available to the public \n        information necessary to enable parents to disable or uninstall \n        such software on their computers, and if necessary to allow \n        parents to do so readily, develop and make available \n        technological means for parents to disable or uninstall such \n        software on their computers.\n    (d) Enforcement.--A violation of the regulations prescribed under \nsubsection (b)(2) shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining an \nunfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under section \n18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n57a(a)(1)(B)). In the case of any action arising under this Act against \na person that does not reside in the United States and has distributed \npeer-to-peer file trading software, or authorized or caused peer-to-\npeer file trading software to be distributed by another person, in \ninterstate commerce without designating an agent as required by \nsubsection (b)(2)(I), service of process may be made by filing the same \nin the office of the Commission.\n\nSEC. 5.
