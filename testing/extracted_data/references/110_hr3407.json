    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Positive Behavior for Effective \nSchools Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Educators and the general public cite disciplinary \n        issues as the leading challenge facing schools.\n            (2) There is significant evidence that zero tolerance and \n        other get-tough approaches to school discipline are ineffective \n        and even counter-productive.\n            (3) Learning and behavior are inextricably linked. The most \n        successful schools have high academic and behavior standards, \n        and improvements in student behavior and school climate are \n        correlated with improvements in academic outcomes and \n        graduation rates.\n            (4) Evidence-based practices for improving behavior and \n        creating a school climate more conducive to learning have not \n        been uniformly adopted and sustained.\n            (5) Many problems can be prevented or minimized with early \n        intervening services that have been shown to be effective and \n        reduce the need for more intensive and more costly \n        interventions.\n            (6) In particular, the use of positive behavior supports \n        leads to greater academic achievement, significantly fewer \n        disciplinary problems, lower suspension and expulsion rates, \n        greater inclusion, more time for instruction, and increased \n        opportunities for all students to achieve.\n            (7) The application of schoolwide positive behavior \n        supports decreases rates of problem behaviors by improving the \n        systematic and consistent use of active supervision, positive \n        feedback, and social skills instruction.\n            (8) When approaches such as positive behavior support are \n        paired with effective interventions and services for students \n        with significant needs, all students, including those with the \n        most challenging behaviors, can succeed.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to expand the use of \npositive behavior supports and other early intervening services in \nschools in order to systematically create a school climate that is \nhighly conducive to learning, reduce discipline referrals, and improve \nacademic outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3. POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT DEFINED.\n\n    Section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n(20 U.S.C. 7801) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(44) Positive behavior support.--The term `positive \n        behavior support' means a broad range of systemic and \n        individualized strategies for achieving important social and \n        learning outcomes while preventing problem behavior with all \n        students.''.\n\nSEC. 4. SCHOOLWIDE POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT.\n\n    (a) Flexibility To Use Title I Funds To Implement Schoolwide \nPositive Behavior Support.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 1003(b) of the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6303(b)) is \n        amended--\n                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as \n                subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively;\n                    (B) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``Of the amount''; \n                and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(2) Of the amount reserved under subsection (a) for any fiscal \nyear, the State educational agency may allocate funds to develop and \nimplement coordinated, early intervening services (including schoolwide \npositive behavior supports) for all students, including those who have \nnot been identified as needing special education but who need \nadditional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general \neducation environment.
