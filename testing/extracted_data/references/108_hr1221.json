STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE DRAWDOWN.\n\n    (a) Drawdowns Authorized To Address State or Regional Economic \nHarm.--Section 161(d)(2)(C) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n(42 U.S.C. 6241(d)(2)(C)) is amended by inserting ``, or on a State or \nregional economy'' after ``national economy''.\n    (b) Drawdowns Authorized To Combat Anti-Competitive Conduct.--\nSection 161(d) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. \n6241(d)) is further amended by adding at the end the following new \nparagraph:\n    ``(3) Reduction in supply caused by anticompetitive conduct.--\n            ``(A) In general.--For the purposes of this section, in \n        addition to the circumstances set forth in section 3(8) and in \n        paragraph (2) of this subsection, a severe energy supply \n        interruption shall be deemed to exist if the President \n        determines that--\n                    ``(i) there is a significant reduction in supply \n                that--\n                            ``(I) is of significant scope and duration; \n                        and\n                            ``(II) has caused a significant increase in \n                        the price of petroleum products;\n                    ``(ii) the increase in price is likely to cause a \n                significant adverse impact on the national economy, or \n                on a State or regional economy; and\n                    ``(iii) a substantial cause of the reduction in \n                supply is the anticompetitive conduct of--\n                            ``(I) 1 or more foreign countries or \n                        international entities; or\n                            ``(II) 1 or more producers, refiners, or \n                        marketers of petroleum products.\n            ``(B) Deposit and use of proceeds.--Proceeds from the sale \n        of petroleum drawn down pursuant to a Presidential \n        determination under subparagraph (A) shall--\n                    ``(i) be deposited in the SPR Petroleum Account; \n                and\n                    ``(ii) be used only for the purposes specified in \n                section 167.''.\n    (c) Reporting and Consultation Requirements.--When the price of a \nbarrel of crude oil exceeds $25 (in constant 2003 United States \ndollars) on the New York Mercantile Exchange for a period greater than \n14 days, the President, through the Secretary of Energy, shall, not \nlater than 30 days after the end of the 14-day period, submit to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a \nreport that--\n            (1) states the results of a comprehensive review of the \n        causes and potential consequences of the price increase;\n            (2) provides an estimate of the likely duration of the \n        price increase, based on analyses and forecasts of the Energy \n        Information Administration;\n            (3) provides an analysis of the effects of the price \n        increase on the cost of gasoline at the wholesale and retail \n        levels; and\n            (4) states whether, and provides a specific rationale for \n        why, the President does or does not support the drawdown and \n        distribution of a specified amount of oil from the Strategic \n        Petroleum Reserve.\n    (d) General Accounting Office Study.--The Comptroller General of \nthe United States shall, not later than 1 year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, transmit to the Congress a review of the \ndrawdown authority of the President with respect to the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, addressing--\n            (1) how and why the authority has changed over time;\n            (2) under what circumstances Presidents have actually \n        exercised the authority;\n            (3) what the impact on oil prices was as a result of the \n        exercising of the presidential authority; and\n            (4) the implications of expanding the drawdown authority \n        beyond the ``severe energy supply interruption'' standard, and \n        instead allowing the release of oil as a regular hedging tool \n        for oil companies, in which such companies could tap the \n        Strategic Petroleum Reserve as necessary to dampen price \n        shocks, but would be required to replace the oil, along with \n        additional barrels, at some predetermined time in the future.\n\nSEC. 4. MINIMUM INVENTORY LEVELS.\n\n    (a) Establishing Minimum Levels.--The Secretary of Energy shall \nestablish minimum inventory levels that producers, refiners, and \nmarketers of crude oil and petroleum products must maintain in order to \nlimit the impact unexpected supply disruptions have on prices at the \nwholesale and retail level.\n    (b) Different Industry Segments.--For the purposes of setting the \nminimum inventory levels, the Secretary may set varying levels for each \nsegment of the oil industry as he determines appropriate.\n    (c) Different Products.--For the purposes of setting the minimum \ninventory levels, the Secretary may set different levels for the \nvarious crude oil and petroleum products, including gasoline, home \nheating oil, and jet fuel.\n    (d) Seasonal Adjustment.--The Secretary may propose to adjust \nminimum inventory levels to reflect seasonal adjustments.\n    (e) Regional Variations.--The minimum inventory levels set by the \nSecretary shall take into account regional variations in supply and \ndemand, and market structure.\n\nSEC. 5. BAN ON EXPORTING OF ALASKAN OIL.\n\n    (a) Repeal of Provision Authorizing Exports.--Subsection (s) of \nsection 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 185(s)) is repealed.\n    (b) Reimposition of Prohibition on Exports.--Subsection (d) of \nSection 7 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. \n2406(d)) shall be effective as of the date of the enactment of this \nAct, and those provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979 \n(including sections 11 and 12) shall apply to the extent necessary to \ncarry out such section 7(d), notwithstanding section 20 of that Act and \nnotwithstanding any other provision of law that would otherwise allow \nthe export of oil to which such section 7(d) applies.\n\nSEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING OPEC AND THE WTO.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) No free market exists in oil production because of \n        collusion among large oil-producing countries.\n            (2) The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries \n        (OPEC) and other oil-producing countries have repeatedly agreed \n        to coordinated cutbacks in production, thus manipulating world \n        oil markets, resulting in de facto price fixing.\n            (3) This manipulation led to the highest price per barrel \n        of oil in nearly a decade, substantial increases in consumer \n        prices for items such as home heating oil and gasoline, and \n        continued price volatility.\n            (4) Rising oil prices greatly harm consumers, farmers, \n        small businesses, and manufacturers, increase the likelihood of \n        inflation, increase the cost of conducting interstate and \n        international commerce, and pose a strong threat to continued \n        economic growth.\n            (5) Article XI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n        Trade (GATT 1994) prohibits members of the World Trade \n        Organization (WTO) from setting quantitative restrictions on \n        the import or export of resources or products across their \n        borders; specifically the language reads: ``No prohibitions or \n        restrictions other than duties, taxes or other charges, whether \n        made effective through quotas, import or export licenses or \n        other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any \n        contracting party on the importation of any product of the \n        territory of any other contracting party or on the exportation \n        or sale for export of any product destined for the territory of \n        any other contracting party.''.\n            (6) The precise meaning of this provision was spelled out \n        in a GATT Panel Report issued in 1988 entitled ``Japan--Trade \n        in Semi-conductors', which noted, ``. . . this wording [in \n        article XI] was comprehensive: it applied to all measures \n        instituted or maintained by a contracting party prohibiting or \n        restricting the importation, exportation or sale for export of \n        products other than measures that take the form of duties, \n        taxes, or other charges. . . . This wording indicated clearly \n        that any measure instituted or maintained by a contracting \n        party which restricted the exportation or sale for export of \n        products was covered by this provision, irrespective of the \n        legal status of the measure.''.\n            (7) Oil production restrictions clearly qualify as a \n        ``quantitative restriction'' based on the original WTO rules \n        and the 1988 GATT panel report, which certify that only \n        ``duties, taxes or other charges'' are allowable, not pacts \n        among countries to limit production of a product for export.\n            (8) Article XX of GATT 1994, which sets out a series of \n        exceptions to article XI, notes that none of the exceptions are \n        valid if they are ``applied in a manner which would constitute \n        . . . a disguised restriction on international trade'', a \n        phrase which describes OPEC's production restrictions.\n            (9) Of the 11 OPEC countries, 6 are members of the WTO \n        (Kuwait, Indonesia, Nigeria, Qatar, Venezuela, and United Arab \n        Emirates), 2 have observer status and have applied to join the \n        WTO (Saudi Arabia and Algeria), and only 3 have no relationship \n        with the WTO (Libya, Iran, and Iraq).\n            (10) Of the remaining large oil-producing countries, Mexico \n        and Norway are members of the WTO, and Russia and Oman have \n        applied for membership.\n            (11) Given the substantial WTO membership and pending \n        membership of oil-producing countries, filing a complaint would \n        likely have an immediate impact on the current and future \n        behavior of these countries.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--The Congress strongly urges the President \nto instruct the United States Representative to the World Trade \nOrganization to file a complaint in the World Trade Organization \nagainst oil-producing countries for violating their obligations under \nthe rules of that organization."
