FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Methamphetamine use and production is growing rapidly \n        throughout the United States.\n            (2) Some materials and chemical residues remaining from the \n        production of methamphetamine pose novel environmental problems \n        in locations where methamphetamine laboratories have been \n        closed.\n            (3) There has been little standardization of measures for \n        determining when the site of a former methamphetamine \n        laboratory has been successfully remediated.\n            (4) Initial cleanup actions are generally limited to \n        removal of hazardous substances and contaminated materials that \n        pose an immediate threat to public health or the environment. \n        It is not uncommon for significant levels of contamination to \n        be found throughout residential structures where \n        methamphetamine has been manufactured, partially because of a \n        lack of knowledge of how to achieve an effective cleanup.\n            (5) Data on methamphetamine laboratory-related contaminants \n        of concern are very limited, and uniform cleanup standards do \n        not currently exist. In addition, procedures for sampling and \n        analysis of contaminants need to be researched and developed.\n            (6) Many States are struggling with establishing assessment \n        and remediation guidelines and programs to address the rapidly \n        expanding number of methamphetamine laboratories being closed \n        each year.\n\nSEC. 3. VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Voluntary Guidelines.--Not later than one year \nafter the date of enactment of this Act, the Assistant Administrator \nfor Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency (in \nthis Act referred to as the ``Assistant Administrator''), in \nconsultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nshall establish voluntary guidelines, based on the best currently \navailable scientific knowledge, for the remediation of former \nmethamphetamine laboratories, including guidelines regarding \npreliminary site assessment and the remediation of residual \ncontaminants.\n    (b) Considerations.--In developing the voluntary guidelines under \nsubsection (a), the Assistant Administrator shall consider, at a \nminimum--\n            (1) relevant standards, guidelines, and requirements found \n        in Federal, State, and local laws and regulations;\n            (2) the varying types and locations of former \n        methamphetamine laboratories; and\n            (3) the expected cost of carrying out any proposed \n        guidelines.\n    (c) States.--The voluntary guidelines should be designed to assist \nState and local governments in the development and the implementation \nof legislation and other policies to apply state-of-the-art knowledge \nand research results to the remediation of former methamphetamine \nlaboratories. The Assistant Administrator shall work with State and \nlocal governments and other relevant non-Federal agencies and \norganizations, including through the conference described in section 5, \nto promote and encourage the appropriate adoption of the voluntary \nguidelines.\n    (d) Updating the Guidelines.--The Assistant Administrator shall \nperiodically update the voluntary guidelines as the Assistant \nAdministrator, in consultation with States and other interested \nparties, determines to be necessary and appropriate to incorporate \nresearch findings and other new knowledge.\n\nSEC. 4. RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    The Assistant Administrator shall establish a program of research \nto support the development and revision of the voluntary guidelines \ndescribed in section 3. Such research shall--\n            (1) identify methamphetamine laboratory-related chemicals \n        of concern;\n            (2) assess the types and levels of exposure to chemicals of \n        concern identified under paragraph (1), including routine and \n        accidental exposures, that may present a significant risk of \n        adverse biological effects;\n            (3) identify the research efforts necessary to better \n        address biological effects and to minimize adverse human \n        exposures;\n            (4) evaluate the performance of various methamphetamine \n        laboratory cleanup and remediation techniques; and\n            (5) support other research priorities identified by the \n        Assistant Administrator in consultation with States and other \n        interested parties.\n\nSEC. 5. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CONFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Conference.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, and at least every third year thereafter, the \nAssistant Administrator shall convene a conference of appropriate State \nagencies, as well as individuals or organizations involved in research \nand other activities directly related to the environmental, or \nbiological impacts of former methamphetamine laboratories. The \nconference should be a forum for the Assistant Administrator to provide \ninformation on the guidelines developed under section 3 and on the \nlatest findings from the research program described in section 4, and \nfor the non-Federal participants to provide information on the problems \nand needs of States and localities and their experience with guidelines \ndeveloped under section 3.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 3 months after each conference, the \nAssistant Administrator shall submit a report to the Congress that \nsummarizes the proceedings of the conference, including a summary of \nany recommendations or concerns raised by the non-Federal participants \nand how the Assistant Administrator intends to respond to them. The \nreport shall also be made widely available to the general public.\n\nSEC. 6. RESIDUAL EFFECTS STUDY.\n\n    (a) Study.--Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Assistant Administrator shall enter into an arrangement \nwith the National Academy of Sciences for a study of the status and \nquality of research on the residual effects of methamphetamine \nlaboratories. The study shall identify research gaps and recommend an \nagenda for the research program described in section 4. The study shall \npay particular attention to the need for research on the impacts of \nmethamphetamine laboratories on--\n            (1) the residents of buildings where such laboratories are, \n        or were, located, with particular emphasis given to biological \n        impacts on children; and\n            (2) first responders.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 3 months after the completion of the \nstudy, the Assistant Administrator shall transmit to Congress a report \non how the Assistant Administrator will use the results of the study to \ncarry out the activities described in sections 3 and 4.\n\nSEC. 7. METHAMPHETAMINE DETECTION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.\n\n    The Director of National Institute of Standards and Technology, in \nconsultation with the Assistant Administrator, shall support a research \nprogram to develop--\n            (1) new methamphetamine detection technologies, with \n        emphasis on field test kits and site detection; and\n            (2) appropriate standard reference materials and validation \n        procedures for methamphetamine detection testing.\n\nSEC. 8. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to add to or limit the \nregulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nSEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    (a) Environmental Protection Agency.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out this \nAct $3,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2009.\n    (b) National Institute of Standards and Technology.--There are \nauthorized to be appropriated to the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology to carry out this Act $1,500,000 for each of the fiscal \nyears 2006 through 2009.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives December 13, 2005.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
