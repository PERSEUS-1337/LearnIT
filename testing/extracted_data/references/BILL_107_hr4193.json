The aggrieved party may \nat any time within 60 days after the date notice is given under this \nparagraph file a petition with the United States district court for the \ndistrict in which party resides or in which the party's principal place \nof business is located for a de novo judicial review of the denial, \nsuspension, revocation, or assessment.
