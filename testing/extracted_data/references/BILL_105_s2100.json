FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the General Accounting Office, 63 \n        institutions of higher education were in violation of the \n        amendments made by the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act \n        of 1990 since the enactment of such Act in 1990. The Department \n        of Education has not taken punitive action against these \n        institutions.\n            (2) The Department of Education's interpretation of the \n        statutory definition of campus has enabled institutions of \n        higher education to underreport the instances of crimes \n        committed against students.\n            (3) In order to improve public awareness of crimes \n        committed on college and university campuses, it is essential \n        that Congress act to clarify existing law and to discourage \n        underreporting of offenses covered by the amendments made by \n        the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990.\n\nSEC. 3.
