CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 1999, 61 percent of adults in the United States were \n        overweight or obese;\n            (2) all age, racial, and ethnic groups, and both genders, \n        have experienced increases in the percentage of persons who are \n        overweight or obese;\n            (3) each year in the United States, approximately 300,000 \n        deaths are associated with obesity;\n            (4) overweight and obesity are associated with heart \n        disease, certain types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, stroke, \n        arthritis, breathing problems, and psychological disorders, \n        such as depression;\n            (5) in 2000, the economic cost of obesity in the United \n        States was approximately $117,000,000,000;\n            (6) it is recommended that American adults accumulate at \n        least 30 minutes, and American children accumulate at least 60 \n        minutes, of moderate physical activity most days of the week, \n        though more may be needed to prevent weight gain, to lose \n        weight, or to maintain weight loss;\n            (7) less than one-third of American adults engage in these \n        recommended amounts of physical activity;\n            (8) 40 percent of adults in the United States do not \n        participate in any leisure-time physical activity;\n            (9) physical activity is important in preventing and \n        treating overweight and obesity and is extremely helpful in \n        maintaining weight loss, especially when combined with healthy \n        eating;\n            (10) there is a direct positive relationship between the \n        level of individual and community use of public recreational \n        facilities and services, access to and condition of such \n        facilities, and the diversity and quality of services relative \n        to current and potential uses; and\n            (11) medical and other research document a direct positive \n        relationship between active recreation and disease prevention \n        and general wellness.\n\nSEC. 3.
