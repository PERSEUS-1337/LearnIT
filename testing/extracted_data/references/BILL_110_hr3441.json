FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In addition to handling traditional management duties, \n        the school principal is now expected to be an instructional \n        leader--to possess the content knowledge and instructional \n        skills to guide teaching and learning in the school.\n            (2) There is a clear expectation within the amendments made \n        by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 that principals become \n        instructional leaders. Section 2113(c) of the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child \n        Left Behind Act of 2001, calls for principals to have ``the \n        instructional leadership skills to help teachers teach and \n        students learn'' and ``to help students meet challenging State \n        student academic achievement standards''.\n            (3) Despite this recognition of the importance of \n        instructional leadership, adequate attention and resources have \n        not been committed to training and supporting school principals \n        in the standards of instructional leadership.\n            (4) Licensure of school principals typically does not give \n        adequate emphasis to instructional leadership skills in the \n        certification process.\n            (5) The term ``highly qualified principal'' added by the No \n        Child Left Behind Act of 2001 should be defined and developed \n        to include a strong emphasis on instructional leadership.\n\nSEC. 3.
