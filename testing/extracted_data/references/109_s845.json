    "title": "A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit retired servicemembers who have a service-connected disability to receive disability compensation and either retired pay or Combat-Related Special Compensation and to eliminate the phase-in period with respect to such concurrent receipt.",
    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) For more than 100 years before 1999, all disabled \n        military retirees were required to fund their own veterans' \n        disability compensation by forfeiting $1 of earned retired pay \n        for each $1 received in veterans' disability compensation.\n            (2) Since 1999, Congress has enacted legislation every year \n        to progressively expand eligibility criteria for relief of the \n        retired pay disability offset and further reduce the burden of \n        financial sacrifice on disabled military retirees.\n            (3) Absent adequate funding to eliminate the sacrifice for \n        all disabled retirees, Congress has given initial priority to \n        easing financial inequities for the most severely disabled and \n        for combat-disabled retirees.\n            (4) In the interest of maximizing eligibility within cost \n        constraints, Congress effectively has authorized full \n        concurrent receipt for all qualifying retirees with 100 percent \n        disability ratings and all with combat-related disability \n        ratings, while phasing out the disability offset to retired pay \n        over 10 years for retired members with noncombat-related, \n        service-connected disability ratings of 50 percent to 90 \n        percent.\n            (5) In pursuing these good-faith efforts, Congress \n        acknowledges the regrettable necessity of creating new \n        thresholds of eligibility that understandably are disappointing \n        to disabled retirees who fall short of meeting those new \n        thresholds.\n            (6) Congress is not content with the status quo.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that military retired pay earned by \nservice and sacrifice in defending the Nation should not be reduced \nbecause a military retiree is also eligible for veterans' disability \ncompensation awarded for service-connected disability.\n\nSEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR PAYMENT OF BOTH RETIRED PAY AND VETERANS' \n              DISABILITY COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN ADDITIONAL MILITARY \n              RETIREES WITH COMPENSABLE SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITIES.\n\n    (a) Extension of Concurrent Receipt Authority to Retirees With \nService-Connected Disabilities Rated Less Than 50 Percent.--Section \n1414(a) of title 10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(a) Payment of Both Retired Pay and Compensation.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Subject to subsection (b), an individual \n        who is a qualified retiree for any month is entitled to be paid \n        both retired pay and veterans' disability compensation for that \n        month without regard to sections 5304 and 5305 of title 38.\n            ``(2) Qualified retirees.--For purposes of this section, a \n        qualified retiree, with respect to any month, is a member or \n        former member of the uniformed services who--\n                    ``(A) is entitled to retired pay, other than in the \n                case of a member retired under chapter 61 of this title \n                with less than 20 years of service creditable under \n                section 1405 of this title and less than 20 years of \n                service computed under section 12732 of this title; and\n                    ``(B) is entitled for that month to veterans' \n                disability compensation.''.\n    (b) Repeal of Phase-In of Concurrent Receipt of Retired Pay and \nVeterans' Disability Compensation.--Section 1414 of title 10, United \nStates Code, is further amended--\n            (1) by striking subsection (c);\n            (2) by redesignating subsections (d) and (e) as subsections \n        (c) and (d), respectively; and\n            (3) in subsection (d), as redesignated, by striking \n        subparagraph (4).\n    (c) Clerical Amendments.--\n            (1) The heading for section 1414 of title 10, United States \n        Code, is amended to read as follows:\n``Sec. 1414.
