ONCOLOGY CARE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in \nthis section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a pilot \nprogram (in this section referred to as the ``OCQI program'') under \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act to evaluate the impact of three \nprovider-led approaches described in subsection (b) to improve care \nquality and outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with cancer while \naddressing care cost drivers by creating greater efficiencies in the \nprogram.\n    (b) Approaches Described.--The approaches described in this \nsubsection are the following approaches to the delivery of oncology \ncare:\n            (1) Evidence-based guideline adherence.--Reducing variation \n        in care through adherence to evidence-based guidelines that \n        improves quality and reduces error.\n            (2) Patient education and care coordination services.--\n        Providing patients with--\n                    (A) dedicated educational sessions about the likely \n                effects of their cancers and treatments and how to \n                manage those prior to initiation of treatment, \n                preferably from an oncology nurse; and\n                    (B) continuous support throughout their course of \n                care.\n            (3) End-of-life planning and counseling services.--\n        Providing patients with poor prognoses with end-of-life \n        planning and counseling services with their physicians and \n        nurses in order to empower such patients and their families \n        with the best information available about their options to \n        assist such patients and families in making difficult choices \n        between pursuing potentially ineffective aggressive medical \n        treatments or pursuing hospice care or other palliative care to \n        improve quality of life in their final months.\n    (c) Description.--\n            (1) In general.--The OCQI program shall be designed in a \n        manner similar to that for the physician group practice \n        demonstration program under section 1866A of the Social \n        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395cc-1) and shall provide performance \n        payments to participating oncology groups that implement each \n        of the approaches described in subsection (b) equal to one-half \n        of the program savings generated by the participating group. \n        The other half of program savings shall be retained by the \n        Medicare program.\n            (2) Expenditure targets.--Under the OCQI program, the \n        Secretary shall establish per capita expenditure targets for \n        participating oncology groups, taking into account the risk \n        characteristics of the patients involved. Those groups that \n        meet the performance goals established by the Secretary and \n        achieve program savings against the expenditure targets shall \n        receive performance payments described in paragraph (1).\n            (3) Limitation on number of participating groups.--The \n        Secretary shall limit the number of groups that may participate \n        in the OCQI program to no more than 75 groups at any time.\n            (4) Limitation on duration.--The OCQI program shall be \n        conducted over a 3-year period.\n            (5) Limitation on patient selection.--The Secretary shall \n        prohibit groups participating in the OCQI program from \n        selecting the individual patients to be included in the \n        program.\n            (6) Penalties to prevent reductions in services.--The \n        Secretary may impose penalties on those groups participating in \n        the OCQI program that the Secretary determines have \n        inappropriately reduced cancer therapies, including supportive \n        care therapies (basing their determination on existing evidence \n        based, medically accurate guidelines). Any such penalties shall \n        be in the form of reductions to performance payments payable to \n        the groups under paragraph (1).\n    (d) Advisory Committee; Evaluation.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall appoint an advisory \n        committee composed of representatives of the oncology \n        community, including organizations representing physicians, \n        nurses, and patients, and industry representatives, to \n        collaborate with the Secretary on the creation and \n        implementation of the OCQI program, including the development \n        of appropriate expenditure targets, and to help analyze the \n        data generated by the OCQI program. The advisory committee \n        shall specifically advise the Secretary on the methods for \n        selecting practices in different regions of the United States \n        to particiapte in the OCQI program.\n            (2) Evaluation.--In consultation with the advisory \n        committee, Secretary shall evaluate the OCQI program to--\n                    (A) assess patient outcomes for patients \n                participating in the program as compared to such \n                outcomes to other individuals for the same health \n                conditions;\n                    (B) analyze the cost effectiveness of the services \n                for which performance payments are made under the \n                program, including an evaluation of the cost savings to \n                the Medicare program attributable to reductions in \n                physicians' services, emergency room visits, hospital \n                stays, drug costs, advanced imaging costs, and end-of-\n                life care;\n                    (C) determine the satisfaction of patients \n                participating in the program; and\n                    (D) refine the appropriate level and proportion of \n                the specific performance payments among the three \n                performance components of the program.\n    (e) Implementation.--If the Secretary determines that the OCQI \nprogram has been successful in improving care quality while lowering \nthe rate of growth of Medicare program expenditures, the Secretary is \nauthorized to include payments for the specific services paid under the \nOCQI program as performance payments as permanent, covered services \nunder the Medicare program."
