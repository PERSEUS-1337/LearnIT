FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) recreational fishing and hunting are important and \n        traditional activities in which millions of Americans \n        participate;\n            (2) recreational anglers and hunters have been and continue \n        to be among the foremost supporters of sound fish and wildlife \n        management and conservation in the United States;\n            (3) recreational fishing and hunting are environmentally \n        acceptable and beneficial activities that occur and can be \n        provided on Federal public lands and waters without adverse \n        effects on other uses or users;\n            (4) recreational anglers, hunters, and sporting \n        organizations provide direct assistance to fish and wildlife \n        managers and enforcement officers of the Federal Government as \n        well as State and local governments by investing volunteer time \n        and effort to fish and wildlife conservation;\n            (5) recreational anglers, hunters, and the associated \n        industries have generated billions of dollars of critical \n        funding for fish and wildlife conservation, research, and \n        management by providing revenues from purchases of fishing and \n        hunting licenses, permits, and stamps, as well as excise taxes \n        on fishing, hunting, and shooting equipment that have generated \n        billions of dollars of critical funding for fish and wildlife \n        conservation, research, and management;\n            (6) recreational shooting is also an important and \n        traditional activity in which millions of Americans \n        participate, safe recreational shooting is a valid use of \n        Federal public lands, including the establishment of safe and \n        convenient shooting ranges on such lands, and participation in \n        recreational shooting helps recruit and retain hunters and \n        contributes to wildlife conservation;\n            (7) opportunities to recreationally fish, hunt, and shoot \n        are declining, which depresses participation in these \n        traditional activities, and depressed participation adversely \n        impacts fish and wildlife conservation and funding for \n        important conservation efforts; and\n            (8) the public interest would be served, and our citizens' \n        fish and wildlife resources benefitted, by action to ensure \n        that opportunities are facilitated to engage in fishing and \n        hunting on Federal public land as recognized by Executive Order \n        No. 12962, relating to recreational fisheries, and Executive \n        Order No. 13443, relating to facilitation of hunting heritage \n        and wildlife conservation.\n\nSEC. 3.
