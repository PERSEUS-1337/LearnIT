DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Avoided conversion agreement.--The term ``avoided \n        conversion agreement'' means a permanent conservation easement \n        covering eligible land enrolled under a climate mitigation \n        contract providing that the eligible land covered will not be \n        converted for development. Avoided conversion agreements shall \n        be consistent with the guidelines of the Farm and Ranchland \n        Protection Program, Forest Legacy Program, or any other program \n        approved by the Secretary for use under this section to provide \n        consistency with Federal legal requirements for permanent \n        conservation easements.\n            (2) Climate mitigation contract.--The term ``climate \n        mitigation contract'' or ``contract'' means a contract of not \n        less than 15 years specifying the eligible practices that will \n        be undertaken, the acreage of eligible land upon which the \n        practices will be undertaken, the agreed rate of compensation \n        per acre, and a schedule to verify that the terms of the \n        contract have been fulfilled.\n            (3) Eligible lands.--The term ``eligible lands'' means \n        agricultural and forestland in the United States that is \n        privately owned at the time of initiation of a climate \n        mitigation contract.\n            (4) Eligible practice.--The term ``eligible practice'' \n        means an agricultural practice or forestry practice determined \n        by the Secretary to provide measurable increases in carbon \n        sequestration and storage on eligible lands beyond customary \n        practices on comparable lands.\n            (5) Program.--The term ``program'' means the carbon \n        incentives program required by this Act.\n            (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Agriculture.\n\nSEC. 3. SUPPLEMENTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN THE UNITED \n              STATES.\n\n    (a) Establishment and Purpose.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall \nestablish a carbon incentives program to achieve supplemental \ngreenhouse gas emissions reductions on private agricultural and \nforestland of the United States.\n    (b) Financial Incentive Payments.--The Secretary shall provide \nfinancial incentive payments under the program for activities that--\n            (1) measurably increase carbon sequestration and storage \n        over a designated contract period through management activities \n        on eligible lands; and\n            (2) maintain carbon sequestration and storage and avoid \n        future emissions through permanent avoided conversion \n        agreements on eligible lands.\n\nSEC. 4. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Contract Required.--To participate in the program, owners of \neligible lands shall enter into a climate mitigation contract with the \nSecretary.\n    (b) Program Components.--In establishing the program, the Secretary \nshall further provide that--\n            (1) funds distributed under this section shall not be \n        substituted for, or otherwise used as a basis for reducing, \n        funding authorized or appropriated under other programs to \n        compensate owners of eligible lands for activities that are not \n        covered under a climate mitigation contract;\n            (2) emissions reductions achieved through a climate \n        mitigation contract shall not be eligible for crediting under \n        any federally established offset program; and\n            (3) compensation for activities under this program shall be \n        set at such a rate so as not to exceed the net estimated \n        benefit an owner of eligible land would receive for the same \n        practices through crediting under any federally established \n        carbon offset program.\n\nSEC. 5. INCENTIVE PAYMENTS.\n\n    (a) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish regulations \nspecifying eligible practices and related compensation rates, \nstandards, and guidelines as the basis for developing climate \nmitigation contracts with owners of eligible lands.\n    (b) Set-Aside of Funds for Certain Purposes.--Not less than 35 \npercent of program funds shall be used to provide further incentives \nfor owners of eligible lands willing to undertake activities and enter \ninto agreements that protect carbon reductions and otherwise enhance \nenvironmental benefits achieved under a climate mitigation contract, \nwhich shall include--\n            (1) 10 percent to provide incentive payments for additional \n        management activities that increase the adaptive capacity of \n        lands under a climate mitigation contract, including but not \n        limited to activities that increase forest resilience to \n        reversal of stored carbon; and\n            (2) 25 percent to make funds available on a competitive \n        basis to compensate owners for entering avoided conversion \n        agreements on lands subject to a climate mitigation contract.\n\nSEC. 6. PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLEMENTAL REDUCTIONS.\n\n    In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall strive to achieve \nand report on progress toward reaching the following levels of carbon \nsequestration and storage through climate mitigation contracts:\n            (1) 100,000,000 tons of cumulative reductions by 2020.\n            (2) 200,000,000 tons of additional cumulative reductions by \n        2030.\n\nSEC. 7. PROGRAM MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, VERIFICATION, AND REPORTING.\n\n    (a) Measurement, Monitoring, and Verification.--The Secretary shall \nestablish and implement protocols that provide reasonable monitoring \nand verification of compliance with climate mitigation contracts, to \ninclude field sampling of actual performance to develop annual \nestimates of emissions reductions achieved under the program. Eligible \npractices and compensation rates may be adjusted for future climate \nmitigation contracts based on results of these measures.\n    (b) Reporting Requirement.--At least once every 18 months, the \nSecretary shall submit to Congress a report containing--\n            (1) an estimate of annual and cumulative reductions \n        generated through the program, determined using standardized \n        measures including economic efficiency; and\n            (2) a summary of any changes to the program that will be \n        made as a result of program measurement, monitoring, and \n        verification.\n    (c) Availability of Report.--Each report required by subsection (b) \nshall be available to the public through the official website of the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n\nSEC. 8.
