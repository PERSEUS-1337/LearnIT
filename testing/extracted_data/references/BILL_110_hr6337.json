FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The projected growth in the number and proportion of \n        older adults is unprecedented in United States history.\n            (2) By 2030, the population of the United States aged 65 \n        and older will exceed 70,000,000, about twice the number of \n        such individuals in 2000.\n            (3) In the December 2007 final report titled ``From \n        Isolation to Integration: Recommendations to Improve Quality in \n        Long-Term Care'' the National Commission for Quality Long-Term \n        Care reported that there is abundant evidence that the health \n        and long-term care workforce is not equipped in skills or in \n        numbers to respond adequately to the aging of the United States \n        population.\n            (4) Inadequate training in geriatrics and gerontology often \n        results in misdiagnoses, medication errors, inappropriate \n        services, and a lack of care coordination, particularly in \n        transitions from one setting to another, that are harmful to \n        older patients and costly to our health and long-term care \n        system.\n            (5) Twenty-five percent of medical students report \n        inadequate amounts of time devoted to geriatric training, 30 \n        percent feel unprepared to care for older adults in acute care \n        settings, and 42 percent say they are unprepared to care for \n        frail older people in nursing homes.\n            (6) Only 3 percent of psychologists view geriatrics as \n        their primary area of practice and only 28 percent of \n        psychologists have some graduate training in geriatrics or \n        gerontology.\n            (7) Less than 1 percent of nurses are certified \n        gerontological nurses and only 3 percent of advance practice \n        nurses specialize in aging.\n            (8) Only 5 percent of social workers are trained in aging \n        issues, yet 70 percent of licensed clinical social workers have \n        worked in some capacity with older adults and their families.\n            (9) By 2050, the United States will need three times as \n        many direct care workers in home, community-based, and \n        facility-based long-term care settings as are employed now to \n        meet the needs of the baby boom generation.\n\nSEC. 3.
