FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Racial and ethnic minorities receive lower-quality \n        health care, even when insurance status, income, age, and \n        severity of conditions are comparable.\n            (2) In overall health, at each stage of life until age 44, \n        African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans have, on \n        average, higher mortality rates than whites.\n            (3) The Department of Health and Human Services found at \n        least 6 areas in which racial and ethnic minorities experience \n        serious disparities in health access outcomes: infant \n        mortality, cancer screening and management, cardiovascular \n        disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS infection, and immunizations.\n            (4) African-American children are twice as likely to have \n        asthma and 6 times as likely to die from asthma as white \n        children.\n            (5) Asthma hospitalization rates are higher in urban, low-\n        income, and minority communities.\n            (6) African Americans are 30 percent more likely to die of \n        cancer than whites when differences in age are taken into \n        account.\n            (7) African-American women are at greater risk for being \n        diagnosed with more advanced forms of breast cancer.\n            (8) The African-American death rate due to diabetes is more \n        than twice that for whites when differences in age are taken \n        into account.\n            (9) African Americans are 30 percent more likely to die of \n        heart disease than whites when differences in age are taken \n        into account.\n            (10) Of the AIDS cases reported in 2000, 47 percent \n        involved African Americans.\n            (11) The annual AIDS case rate is 4 times higher for \n        Latinos than for whites.\n            (12) Infant mortality rates, one of the most sensitive \n        indicators of the health and well-being of a population, are \n        twice as high among African-American infants as whites.\n            (13) Studies show that even well-meaning physicians who are \n        not overtly biased or prejudiced typically demonstrate \n        unconscious negative racial attitudes.\n\nSEC. 3.
