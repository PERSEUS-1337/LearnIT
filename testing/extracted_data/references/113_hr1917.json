FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the \n        Soviet Union, Cuba is no longer a threat to the United States \n        or the Western Hemisphere;\n            (2) the continuation of the embargo on trade between the \n        United States and Cuba that was declared in 1962 is not \n        fulfilling the purpose for which it was established;\n            (3) in the former Soviet Union, the Eastern bloc countries, \n        China, and Vietnam, the United States is using diplomatic, \n        economic, cultural, academic, and scientific engagement to \n        support its policy of promoting democratic and human rights \n        reforms;\n            (4) extension to Cuba of unconditional normal trade \n        relations treatment would assist Cuba in developing its economy \n        based on free market principles and becoming competitive in the \n        global marketplace;\n            (5) the United States can best support democratic change \n        and human rights in Cuba by promoting trade and commerce, \n        travel, communications, and cultural, academic, and scientific \n        exchanges;\n            (6) expanding bilateral trade relations is likely to \n        promote further progress in Cuba on human rights and democratic \n        rule and assist Cuba in adopting regional and world trading \n        rules and principles; and\n            (7) Cuba was one of the founding members of the General \n        Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947 and is an original \n        member of the World Trade Organization, and extension of \n        unconditional normal trade relations treatment to Cuba would \n        enable the United States to avail itself of all rights under \n        the World Trade Organization with respect to Cuba.\n\nSEC. 3.
