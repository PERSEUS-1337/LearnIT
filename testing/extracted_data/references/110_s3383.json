FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) Harriet Tubman (born Araminta ``Minty'' Ross)--\n                    (A) was born into slavery in Maryland around 1822;\n                    (B) married John Tubman at age 25;\n                    (C) endured through her youth and young adulthood \n                the hardships of enslaved African-Americans; and\n                    (D) boldly emancipated herself from bondage in \n                1849;\n            (2) not satisfied with attaining her own freedom, Harriet \n        Tubman--\n                    (A) returned repeatedly for more than 10 years to \n                the places of her enslavement in Dorchester and \n                Caroline Counties, Maryland; and\n                    (B) under the most adverse circumstances led away \n                many family members and acquaintances to freedom in the \n                northern region of the United States and Canada;\n            (3) Harriet Tubman was--\n                    (A) called ``Moses'' by African-Americans and white \n                abolitionists; and\n                    (B) acknowledged as one of the most prominent \n                ``conductors'' of the resistance that came to be known \n                as the ``Underground Railroad'';\n            (4) in 1868, Frederick Douglass wrote that, with the \n        exception of John Brown, Douglass knew of ``no one who has \n        willingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our \n        enslaved people'' than Harriet Tubman;\n            (5) during the Civil War, Harriet Tubman--\n                    (A) was recruited to assist Union troops as a \n                nurse, a scout, and a spy; and\n                    (B) served in Virginia, Florida, and South \n                Carolina, where she is credited with facilitating the \n                rescue of hundreds of enslaved people;\n            (6) Harriet Tubman established in Auburn, New York, one of \n        the first incorporated homes for aged African-Americans in the \n        United States, which, 10 years before her death, she bequeathed \n        to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church;\n            (7) there are nationally significant resources comprised of \n        relatively unchanged landscapes associated with the early life \n        of Harriet Tubman in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties, \n        Maryland;\n            (8) there are nationally significant resources relating to \n        Harriet Tubman in Auburn, New York, including--\n                    (A) the residence of Harriet Tubman;\n                    (B) the Tubman Home for the Aged;\n                    (C) the Thompson Memorial AME Zion Church; and\n                    (D) the final resting place of Harriet Tubman in \n                Fort Hill Cemetery;\n            (9) in developing interpretive programs, the National Park \n        Service would benefit from increased scholarship of the \n        African-American experience during the decades preceding the \n        Civil War and throughout the remainder of the 19th century; and\n            (10) it is fitting and proper that the nationally \n        significant resources relating to Harriet Tubman be preserved \n        for future generations as units of the National Park System so \n        that people may understand and appreciate the contributions of \n        Harriet Tubman to the history and culture of the United States.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to preserve and promote stewardship of the resources in \n        Auburn, New York, and Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot \n        Counties, Maryland, relating to the life and contributions of \n        Harriet Tubman;\n            (2) to provide for partnerships with the African Methodist \n        Episcopal Zion Church, the States of New York and Maryland, \n        political subdivisions of the States, the Federal Government, \n        local governments, nonprofit organizations, and private \n        property owners for resource protection, research, \n        interpretation, education, and public understanding and \n        appreciation of the life and contributions of Harriet Tubman;\n            (3) to sustain agricultural and forestry land uses in \n        Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties, Maryland, that \n        remain evocative of the landscape during the life of Harriet \n        Tubman; and\n            (4) to establish a competitive grants program for scholars \n        of African-American history relating to Harriet Tubman and the \n        Underground Railroad.\n\nSEC. 3.
