FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Participation in sports teaches youth critical life \n        skills and has a significant positive impact on all areas of \n        their lives, especially for girls.\n            (2) Participation in sports results in many long-term \n        physical and psychological health benefits for girls. For \n        instance--\n                    (A) providing opportunities to play sports in \n                school is one key way to combat the rising rates of \n                childhood obesity, which is caused in large part by \n                physical inactivity;\n                    (B) girls who participate in sports have lower \n                rates of heart disease, breast cancer, and \n                osteoporosis; and\n                    (C) girls who participate in sports have higher \n                levels of confidence and self-esteem, lower levels of \n                depression, are less likely to be suicidal, and are \n                more likely to have a positive body image than female \n                non-athletes.\n            (3) Participation in sports promotes responsible social \n        behaviors and greater academic success among girls. For \n        instance--\n                    (A) girls who participate in sports are more likely \n                to refrain from sexual activity, are more likely to \n                defer having sex until a later age and to have fewer \n                sex partners, and are half as likely to experience an \n                unintended pregnancy as compared to female non-\n                athletes;\n                    (B) girls who participate in sports have higher \n                graduation rates, receive better grades, and score \n                higher on standardized tests than female students in \n                general;\n                    (C) girls who participate in sports have more \n                positive attitudes towards science, a field \n                traditionally predominated by males;\n                    (D) girls who participate in sports are less likely \n                to smoke or use illegal drugs;\n                    (E) girls who participate in sports often have \n                strengthened family relationships, including with their \n                fathers and other male family members; and\n                    (F) girls who participate in sports learn important \n                professional lessons that have a lifelong influence \n                (Eighty percent of women identified as key leaders in \n                Fortune 500 companies participated in sports while \n                growing up, and 82 percent of executive businesswomen \n                played sports, with the majority saying lessons learned \n                on the playing field contributed to their success in \n                business.).\n            (4) The opportunity to play sports in secondary school \n        helps many middle- and low-income students--who might otherwise \n        be unable to attend college--to gain access to higher \n        education.\n            (5) Physical inactivity is much more common among females \n        than males.\n            (6) Girls who are not involved in physical activity by age \n        10 have only a 10 percent chance of being athletic when they \n        are 25.\n            (7) Girls receive 1,100,000 fewer opportunities to play \n        high school sports than do boys, which translate into many lost \n        opportunities for athletic participation and scholarships.\n            (8) Several reports indicate that girls' teams often \n        receive inferior opportunities and benefits in other aspects of \n        athletics programs, including overall budgets; equipment; \n        uniforms; locker rooms and practice and competitive facilities; \n        scheduling of practices, games, and sports seasons; training \n        and medical services; coaches; and publicity.\n            (9) Students and parents should be aware of the athletic \n        opportunities and benefits that their schools provide to male \n        and female students.\n            (10) Without information about how athletic opportunities \n        and benefits are being allocated at the elementary and \n        secondary school level, students may be deprived of \n        opportunities to play sports and to attend college on an \n        athletic scholarship.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF STATISTICS ON EQUALITY IN ATHLETIC PROGRAMS.\n\n    Subpart 2 of part E of title IX of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7901 et seq.) is amended by adding at \nthe end the following:\n\n``SEC. 9537.
