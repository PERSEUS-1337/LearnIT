    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Columbia River Restoration Act of \n2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific \n        Northwest and the fourth largest river in the United States by \n        volume. The river is 1,243 miles long, and its drainage basin \n        includes 259,000 square miles, extending into 7 States and \n        British Columbia, Canada, and including all or part of 5 \n        national parks, the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, \n        and the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area.\n            (2) The Columbia River Basin and its tributaries provide \n        significant ecological and economic benefits to the Pacific \n        Northwest and the entire United States. Traditionally, the \n        Columbia River Basin and its tributaries were the largest \n        salmon producing river system in the world, with annual returns \n        peaking at as many as 30 million fish. The Columbia River \n        drainage basin includes more than 6 million acres of irrigated \n        agricultural land, and its 14 hydroelectric dams, combined with \n        additional dams on its tributaries, produce more hydroelectric \n        power than any other North American river.\n            (3) The Lower Columbia River Estuary stretches 146 miles \n        from the Bonneville Dam to the mouth of the Pacific Ocean, and \n        much of this area is degraded. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) \n        in salmon tissue and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in \n        salmon prey exceed estimated thresholds for delayed mortality, \n        increased disease susceptibility, and reduced growth. Legacy \n        contaminants (DDT and PCBs) banned in the 1970s are still \n        detected in river water, sediments, and juvenile Chinook \n        salmon. Several pesticides have been detected, including \n        atrazine and simazine, which can affect salmon behavior or act \n        as hormone disruptors. Emerging contaminants, such as hormone \n        disruptors from pharmaceutical and personal care products, have \n        been found in river water and juvenile male salmon. These \n        contaminants may impair salmon growth, health, and \n        reproduction.\n            (4) The Middle and Upper Columbia River Basin includes \n        1,050 miles of the mainstem Columbia River upstream of the \n        Bonneville Dam, including the 1,040 miles of its largest \n        tributary, the Snake River, and all of the tributaries to both \n        rivers. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Columbia \n        River Basin Fish Contaminant Survey detected the presence of 92 \n        priority pollutants, including PCBs, dioxins, furans, arsenic, \n        mercury, and DDE (a breakdown product of DDT), in fish that are \n        consumed by the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs, the \n        Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the \n        Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the \n        Nez Perce Tribe, as well as by other people consuming fish \n        throughout the Columbia River Basin. A fish consumption survey \n        by the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission showed that \n        tribal members were eating 6 to 11 times more fish than EPA's \n        estimated national average. The nuclear and toxic contamination \n        at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation presents an ongoing risk of \n        contamination in the Middle Columbia Basin. Sampling of \n        sediments by the EPA in 2004 documented widespread presence of \n        toxic flame retardants known as polyrominated diphenyl ethers.\n            (5) Contamination of the Middle and Upper Columbia River \n        Basin has a direct impact on water quality and habitat quality \n        in the Lower Columbia River Estuary. Investments in habitat \n        restoration and toxics reduction in the Middle and Upper \n        Columbia River Basin can have significant benefits for fish and \n        wildlife throughout the entire basin.\n            (6) Together with the Governors of Oregon and Washington, \n        the EPA created the Lower Columbia River Estuary Partnership \n        (Estuary Partnership) in 1995 to provide regional coordination \n        to focus on the lower river, to advance the science of the \n        ecosystem, and to deliver environmental results. The Estuary \n        Partnership was formed within the National Estuary Program and \n        provides a structure for organization and collaboration to \n        implement Federal priorities. The Estuary Partnership includes \n        all key Federal agencies as part of its management and \n        governing structure, including the EPA, the United States \n        Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration (NOAA), the Army Corps of Engineers, the Forest \n        Service, and tribal, State, and local governments.\n            (7) The Columbia River Basin was designated by the EPA as \n        an ``Estuary of National Significance'' in 1995 and a ``Large \n        Aquatic Ecosystem'' in 2006.\n            (8) The Estuary Partnership has developed an unparalleled \n        2-State, public and private partnership, including \n        unprecedented collaborative efforts among key Federal partners, \n        including the EPA, the NOAA, the USGS, and the Army Corps of \n        Engineers to advance Federal goals, and the Estuary Partnership \n        and its partners have gathered scientific information and \n        compiled data, and have made significant gains in habitat \n        protection and environmental education.\n            (9) Despite these advances, further degradation exists and \n        contaminants persist in the Columbia River Basin and are \n        impairing the health of fish, wildlife, and humans. Degraded \n        conditions in the river exacerbate the challenges already faced \n        by the 13 species of salmon and steelhead in the Columbia River \n        Basin listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered \n        Species Act of 1973.\n            (10) The ``Estuary Partnership Comprehensive Conservation \n        and Management Plan'' (1999), the ``Northwest Power and \n        Conservation Council Lower Columbia Province Plan'' (2004, \n        amended 2008), the draft ``NOAA Columbia River Estuary Recovery \n        Module for Salmon and Steelhead'' (2010), the States of Oregon, \n        Idaho, and Washington Recovery Plans, the ``Biological Opinion \n        for the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS)'' (2000, \n        2004, 2008), and the ``EPA Columbia Basin State of the River \n        Report for Toxics'' (2009) consistently identify habitat loss \n        and toxic contamination as threats to fish and wildlife.\n\nSEC. 3.
