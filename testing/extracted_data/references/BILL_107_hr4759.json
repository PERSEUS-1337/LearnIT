FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In August 1776, the fortifications at Governors Island, \n        New York, provided cover allowing George Washington's \n        Continental Army to escape a British onslaught during the \n        Battle of Long Island.\n            (2) The State of New York, for nominal consideration, ceded \n        control of Governors Island to the Federal Government in 1800 \n        to provide for the defense of the United States.\n            (3) Between 1800 and 1811, Castle Williams and Fort Jay \n        were constructed on Governors Island to anchor the defense of \n        New York Harbor.\n            (4) During the War of 1812, the combined firepower of \n        Castle Williams and Fort Jay and the Southwest Battery in \n        Manhattan dissuaded the British from making a direct attack on \n        New York City, which was the largest city in and principal \n        seaport of the United States at the time.\n            (5) Governors Island, including Castle Williams and Fort \n        Jay, played a significant role in the Civil War, World War I, \n        and World War II, and continued to serve the United States Army \n        through 1966, and thereafter the United States Coast Guard \n        until 1997.\n            (6) Castle Williams is named after Lieutenant Colonel \n        Jonathan Williams, who built the semicircular ``cheesebox'' \n        fort and later served as the first superintendent of the \n        Military Academy at West Point.\n            (7) The pentagonal Fort Jay, named after John Jay, is the \n        complement of Fort Wood on nearby Liberty Island, which serves \n        as the base of the Statue of Liberty.\n            (8) In Presidential Proclamation No. 7402 of January 19, \n        2001, former President Clinton established the Governors Island \n        National Monument, consisting of Castle Williams and Fort Jay \n        and certain additional lands, as depicted on the map entitled \n        ``Governors Island National Monument'' attached to the \n        proclamation.\n            (9) The Department of Justice has issued an opinion that \n        notwithstanding the Presidential Proclamation, the National \n        Monument could be sold and cease to exist if the rest of \n        Governors Island is conveyed to a party other than the United \n        States pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n            (10) More than 200 years of contributions to the history of \n        the United States, and the important educational and cultural \n        opportunities that Castle Williams and Fort Jay represent, \n        could be lost if the National Monument ceased to exist.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to prevent the deterioration of the historic military \n        buildings on Governors Island in New York Harbor;\n            (2) to ensure that Castle Williams and Fort Jay are--\n                    (A) retained in Federal ownership;\n                    (B) available for the benefit and inspiration of \n                the people of the United States; and\n                    (C) afforded protection by the National Park \n                Service as a unit of the National Park System; and\n            (3) to provide the general public with--\n                    (A) access to Governors Island;\n                    (B) access to open park space to experience the \n                majestic views of New York Harbor; and\n                    (C) opportunities that illustrate the significant \n                contributions of Governors Island to the history of the \n                United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
