FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Unchecked power by any branch leads to oppressive \n        transgressions on individual freedoms and ill-considered \n        government policies.\n            (2) The Founding Fathers enshrined checks and balances in \n        the Constitution to protect against government abuses to derail \n        ill-conceived domestic or foreign endeavors.\n            (3) Checks and balances make the Nation safer by preventing \n        abuses that would be exploited by Al Qaeda to boost terrorist \n        recruitment, would deter foreign governments from cooperating \n        in defeating international terrorism, and would make the \n        American people reluctant to support aggressive counter-\n        terrorism measures.\n            (4) Checks and balances have withered since 9/11 and an \n        alarming concentration of power has been accumulated in the \n        presidency based on hyper-inflated fears of international \n        terrorism and a desire permanently to alter the equilibrium of \n        power between the three branches of government.\n            (5) The unprecedented constitutional powers claimed by the \n        President since 9/11 subtracted national security and have been \n        asserted for non-national security purposes.\n            (6) Experience demonstrates that global terrorism can be \n        thwarted, deterred, and punished through muscular application \n        of law enforcement measures and prosecutions in Federal \n        civilian courts in lieu of military commissions or military \n        law.\n            (7) Congressional oversight of the executive branch is \n        necessary to prevent secret government, which undermines self-\n        government and invites lawlessness and maladministration.\n            (8) The post-9/11 challenges to checks and balances are \n        unique in the Nation's history because the war on global \n        terrorism has no discernable end.\n    (b) Purpose.--The American Freedom Agenda Act of 2007 is intended \nto restore the Constitution's checks and balances and protections \nagainst government abuses as envisioned by the Founding Fathers.\n\nSEC. 3. MILITARY COMMISSIONS; ENEMY COMBATANTS; HABEAS CORPUS.\n\n    (a) The Military Commissions Act of 2006 is hereby repealed.\n    (b) The President is authorized to establish military commissions \nfor the trial of war crimes only in places of active hostilities \nagainst the United States where an immediate trial is necessary to \npreserve fresh evidence or to prevent local anarchy.\n    (c) The President is prohibited from detaining any individual \nindefinitely as an unlawful enemy combatant absent proof by substantial \nevidence that the individual has directly engaged in active hostilities \nagainst the United States, provided that no United States citizen shall \nbe detained as an unlawful enemy combatant.\n    (d) Any individual detained as an enemy combatant by the United \nStates shall be entitled to petition for a writ of habeas corpus under \nsection 2241 of title 28, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 4. TORTURE OR COERCED CONFESSIONS.\n\n    No civilian or military tribunal of the United States shall admit \nas evidence statements extracted from the defendant by torture or \ncoercion.\n\nSEC. 5. INTELLIGENCE GATHERING.\n\n    No Federal agency shall gather foreign intelligence in \ncontravention of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. \n1801 et seq.). The President's constitutional power to gather foreign \nintelligence is subordinated to this provision.\n\nSEC. 6. PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS.\n\n    The House of Representatives and Senate collectively shall enjoy \nstanding to file a declaratory judgment action in an appropriate \nFederal district court to challenge the constitutionality of a \npresidential signing statement that declares the President's intent to \ndisregard provisions of a bill he has signed into law because he \nbelieves they are unconstitutional.\n\nSEC. 7. KIDNAPPING, DETENTIONS, AND TORTURE ABROAD.\n\n    No officer or agent of the United States shall kidnap, imprison, or \ntorture any person abroad based solely on the President's belief that \nthe subject of the kidnapping, imprisonment, or torture is a criminal \nor enemy combatant; provided that kidnapping shall be permitted if \nundertaken with the intent of bringing the kidnapped person for \nprosecution or interrogation to gather intelligence before a tribunal \nthat meets international standards of fairness and due process. A \nknowing violation of this section shall be punished as a felony \npunishable by a fine or imprisonment of up to 2 years.\n\nSEC. 8. JOURNALIST EXCEPTION TO ESPIONAGE ACT.\n\n    Nothing in the Espionage Act of 1917 shall prohibit a journalist \nfrom publishing information received from the executive branch or \nCongress unless the publication would cause direct, immediate, and \nirreparable harm to the national security of the United States.\n\nSEC. 9. USE OF SECRET EVIDENCE TO MAKE FOREIGN TERRORIST DESIGNATIONS.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other law, secret evidence shall not be used by \nthe President or any other member of the executive branch to designate \nan individual or organization with a United States presence as a \nforeign terrorist or foreign terrorist organization for purposes of the \ncriminal law or otherwise imposing criminal or civil sanctions."
