STUDY AND REPORT TO CONGRESS ON BOUTIQUE FUELS.\n\n    (a) Joint Study.--The Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency and the Secretary of Energy shall undertake a study of the \neffects on air quality, on the number of fuel blends, on fuel \navailability, on fuel fungibility, and on fuel costs of the State plan \nprovisions adopted pursuant to section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Clean Air \nAct (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)). The primary focus of such study shall be \nto determine how to develop a Federal fuels system that maximizes motor \nfuel fungibility and supply, preserves air quality standards, and \nreduces motor fuel price volatility that results from the proliferation \nof boutique fuels, and to recommend to the Congress such legislative \nchanges as are necessary to implement such a system. In furtherance of \nsuch a study, the Administrator and the Secretary shall, as \nappropriate, review studies and other actions of other Federal agencies \nconcerning boutique fuels with a view toward avoiding duplication of \neffort and the need to expedite such study.\n    (b) Study Areas of Responsibility.--In carrying out the study \nrequired by this section, the Administrator shall coordinate obtaining \ncomments from affected parties interested in the air quality impact \nassessment portion of the study, and the Secretary shall coordinate \nobtaining comments from affected parties interested in the fuel \navailability, number of fuel blends, fuel fungibility, and fuel costs \nportion of the study.\n    (c) Report to Congress.--The Administrator and the Secretary \njointly shall submit the results of the study required by this section \nin a report to the Congress not later than 12 months after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, together with any recommended regulatory and \nlegislative changes.
