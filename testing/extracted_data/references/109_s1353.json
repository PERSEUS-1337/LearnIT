    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``ALS Registry Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (referred to in this \n        section as ``ALS'') is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative \n        disease that affects motor nerve cells in the brain and the \n        spinal cord.\n            (2) The average life expectancy for a person with ALS is 2 \n        to 5 years from the time of diagnosis.\n            (3) The cause of ALS is not well understood.\n            (4) There is only one drug currently approved by the Food \n        and Drug Administration for the treatment of ALS, which has \n        thus far shown only modest effects, prolonging life by just a \n        few months.\n            (5) There is no known cure for ALS.\n            (6) More than 5,000 individuals in the United States are \n        diagnosed with ALS annually and as many as 30,000 individuals \n        may be living with ALS in the United States today.\n            (7) Studies have found relationships between ALS and \n        environmental and genetic factors, but those relationships are \n        not well understood.\n            (8) Scientists believe that there are significant ties \n        between ALS and any motor neuron diseases.\n            (9) Several ALS disease registries and databases exist in \n        the United States and throughout the world, including the SOD1 \n        database, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and \n        Stroke repository, and the Department of Veterans Affairs ALS \n        Registry.\n            (10) A single national system to collect and store \n        information on the prevalence and incidence of ALS in the \n        United States does not exist.\n            (11) The establishment of a national registry will help--\n                    (A) identify the incidence and prevalence of ALS in \n                the United States;\n                    (B) collect data important to the study of ALS;\n                    (C) promote a better understanding of ALS;\n                    (D) promote research into the genetic and \n                environmental factors that cause ALS;\n                    (E) provide a means for patients to contact \n                scientists researching the environmental and genetic \n                factors that cause ALS as well as those engaged in \n                clinical trials; and\n                    (F) enhance efforts to find treatments and a cure \n                for ALS.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 399O.
