In Arizona, this is the \n    second driest period in recorded history and the worst since 1904.\n        (2) In spite of decades of water conservation in the southwest \n    United States, irrigated agriculture uses more than 60 percent of \n    surface and ground water.\n        (3) The most inadequate water supplies in the United States are \n    in the Southwest, including the lower Colorado River basin and the \n    Great Plains River basins south of the Platte River. In these \n    areas, 70 percent of the water taken from the stream is not \n    returned.\n        (4) The amount of water being pumped out of groundwater sources \n    in many areas is greater than the amount being replenished, thus \n    depleting the groundwater supply.\n        (5) On August 20, 2002, the Board of the North American \n    Development Bank agreed to the creation in the bank of a Water \n    Conservation Investment Fund.\n        (6) The Water Conservation Investment Fund of the North \n    American Development Bank stated that up to $80,000,000 would be \n    available for grant financing of water conservation projects, which \n    grant funds would be divided equally between the United States and \n    Mexico.\n    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n        (1) water conservation projects are eligible for funding from \n    the North American Development Bank under the Agreement Between the \n    Government of the United States of America and the Government of \n    the United Mexican States Concerning the Establishment of a Border \n    Environment Cooperation Commission and a North American Development \n    Bank;\n        (2) the Board of the North American Development Bank should \n    support qualified water conservation projects that can assist \n    irrigators and agricultural producers; and\n        (3) the Board of the North American Development Bank should \n    take into consideration the needs of all of the border states \n    before approving funding for water projects, and strive to fund \n    water conservation projects in each of the border states.\n\nSEC. 6.
