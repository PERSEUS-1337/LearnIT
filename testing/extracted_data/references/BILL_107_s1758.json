FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (referred to \n        in this Act as the ``NBAC'') has reviewed the scientific and \n        ethical implications of human cloning and has determined that \n        the cloning of human beings is morally unacceptable;\n            (2) the NBAC recommended that Federal legislation be \n        enacted to prohibit anyone from conducting or attempting human \n        cloning, whether using Federal or non-Federal funds;\n            (3) the NBAC also recommended that the United States \n        cooperate with other countries to enforce mutually supported \n        prohibitions on human cloning;\n            (4) the NBAC found that somatic cell nuclear transfer (also \n        known as nuclear transplantation) may have many important \n        applications in medical research;\n            (5) the Institute of Medicine has found that nuclear \n        transplantation may enable stem cells to be developed in a \n        manner that will permit such cells to be transplanted into a \n        patient without being rejected;\n            (6) the NBAC concluded that any regulatory or legislative \n        actions undertaken to prohibit human cloning should be \n        carefully written so as not to interfere with other important \n        areas of research, such as stem cell research; and\n            (7)(A) biomedical research and clinical facilities engage \n        in and affect interstate commerce;\n            (B) the services provided by clinical facilities move in \n        interstate commerce;\n            (C) patients travel regularly across State lines in order \n        to access clinical facilities; and\n            (D) biomedical research and clinical facilities engage \n        scientists, doctors, and other staff in an interstate market, \n        and contract for research and purchase medical and other \n        supplies in an interstate market.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to prohibit any attempt to clone a \nhuman being while protecting important areas of medical research, \nincluding stem cell research.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON HUMAN CLONING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended by \ninserting after chapter 15, the following:\n\n               ``CHAPTER 16--PROHIBITION ON HUMAN CLONING\n\n``Sec.\n``301.
