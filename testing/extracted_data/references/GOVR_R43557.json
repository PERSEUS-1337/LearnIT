    "content": "The first section of this report provides an overview of the consideration of FY2015 legislative branch appropriations, with subsections covering each action, including the initial submission of the request on March 4, 2014; hearings held by the House and Senate Legislative Branch Subcommittees; markups held by the House Subcommittee on Legislative Branch, and House Committee on Appropriations; passage of H.R. 4487 , Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015, by the House on May 1, 2014; the markup and reporting of H.R. 4487 by the Senate Appropriations Committee on June 19, 2014; the enactment of continuing appropriations resolutions providing funding for the legislative branch ( P.L. 113-164 , enacted September 19, 2014; and P.L. 113-203 , enacted December 13, 2014); and the enactment of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 , Division H) on December 16, 2014. It is followed by a section on prior year actions and funding, which contains historical tables.  The report then addresses the FY2015 budget requests, hearings, and funding issues for individual legislative branch agencies and entities.  Finally, Table 4 through Table 8 list funding levels for FY2014, and FY2015 budget requests and House-passed, Senate-reported, and enacted levels for these accounts, while the Appendix lists House, Senate, and conference bills and reports and public law numbers and enactment dates since FY1998. The FY2015 U.S. Budget submitted on March 4, 2014, contains a request for $4.471 billion in new budget authority for legislative branch activities.  By law, the legislative branch request is submitted to the President and included in the budget without change.   Table 2 lists the dates of hearings of the legislative branch subcommittees in 2014. Prepared statements of witnesses were posted on the subcommittee websites. On April 4, 2014, the House subcommittee met to mark up the FY2015 bill. The mark provided $3.3 billion (not including Senate items, which are determined by the Senate). No amendments were offered, and it was reported to the full committee by voice vote.  On April 9, 2014, the full House Appropriations Committee held a markup of the FY2015 bill. One amendment was considered before the bill was ordered reported to the House. Representative Moran proposed the creation of an optional housing stipend of $25 per day for Members who live 50 or more miles away from Washington, DC, which failed. The House of Representatives took up consideration of H.R. 4487 on May 1, 2014. Pursuant to a rule ( H.Res. 557 , agreed to by voice vote on April 30, 2014), eight amendments were considered, including the following: An amendment offered by Representative Nugent to prohibit funding through the Member Representational Allowance (MRA) of vehicle leasing, excluding mobile district offices and short-term vehicle rentals. The amendment failed by a vote of 196-221. An amendment offered by Representative Speier to appropriate $500,000 to provide sexual harassment training for House offices, to be carried out by the Office of Compliance, with funds offset from the general administration fund of the Architect of the Capitol. The amendment was agreed to by voice vote. An amendment offered by Representative Gosar to reduce funding for the Botanic Garden to FY2014 levels and to transfer funds to the spending reduction account. The amendment was agreed to by a vote of 219-198. An amendment offered by Representative Broun of Georgia to reduce funding for the Capitol Visitor Center by $243,000, returning it to FY2014 levels. The amendment failed by a vote of 207-212. An amendment offered by Representative Duffy to defund the Open World Leadership Center Trust Fund. The amendment failed by voice vote. An amendment offered by Representative Hall to prohibit funds from being used to deliver printed copies of the Statement of Disbursements of the House to any Member of the House. The amendment was agreed to by voice vote. An amendment offered by Representative Wenstrup to prohibit funding for the delivery of printed copies of the House daily calendar to any Member of the House. The amendment was agreed to by voice vote. An amendment offered by Representative Holt to appropriate $2.5 million to reinstitute the Office of Technology Assessment, offset from funds in the House Historic Buildings Revitalization Trust Fund. The amendment failed by a vote of 164-248. H.R. 4487 , as amended, was passed by the House by a vote of 402-14. The Senate Appropriations Committee considered H.R. 4487 on June 19, 2014. It ordered the bill reported favorably with an amendment in the nature of a substitute.  No further action was taken on H.R. 4487 prior to the start of FY2015 on October 1, 2014.  The enactment of two continuing appropriations resolutions ( P.L. 113-164 and P.L. 113-203 ) provided funding for the legislative branch until the enactment of funding for the remainder of FY2015 in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, on December 16, 2014 ( P.L. 113-235 ). The FY2015 act provides $4.3 billion for legislative branch operations, an increase of 1.0% from the FY2014 enacted level. Neither a legislative branch appropriations bill, nor a continuing appropriations resolution (CR), containing FY2014 funding was enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013. A funding gap, which resulted in a partial government shutdown, ensued for 16 days. The funding gap was terminated by the enactment of a CR ( P.L. 113-46 ) on October 17, 2013. The CR provided funding through January 15, 2014. Following enactment of a temporary continuing resolution on January 15, 2014 ( P.L. 113-73 ), a consolidated appropriations bill was enacted on January 17 ( P.L. 113-76 ), providing $4.259 billion for the legislative branch for FY2014. FY2013 funding of approximately $4.061 billion was provided by P.L. 113-6 , which was signed into law on March 26, 2013. The act funded legislative branch accounts at the FY2012 enacted level, with some exceptions (also known as \"anomalies\"), and less across-the-board rescissions required by Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 . Section 3004 was intended to eliminate any amount by which the new budget authority provided in the act exceeds the FY2013 discretionary spending limits in Section 251(c)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as amended by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent to the enactment of P.L. 113-6 , OMB calculated that additional rescissions of 0.032% of security budget authority, and 0.2% of nonsecurity budget authority, would be required. The act did not alter the sequestration reductions implemented on March 1, which reduced most legislative branch accounts by 5.0%. The accompanying OMB report indicated a dollar amount of budget authority to be canceled in each account containing non-exempt funds.  Division G of the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-74 ) provided $4.307 billion for the legislative branch. This level was $236.9 million (-5.2%) below the FY2011 enacted level. P.L. 112-10 provided $4.543 billion for legislative branch operations in FY2011. This level represented a $125.1 million decrease from the $4.668 billion provided in the FY2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-68 ) and the FY2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-212 ). The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided $4.402 billion. In FY2009, an additional $25.0 million was provided for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. P.L. 111-32 , the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act, also contained funding for a new Capitol Police radio system ($71.6 million) and for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) ($2.0 million).  As seen in Table 3 , the legislative branch budget in constant dollars remains below the FY2004 level.  The following sections discuss the various legislative branch accounts as well as issues discussed during the hearings on the budget requests.  The Senate requested $907.2 million for FY2015, a 5.6% increase over the $859.3 million provided in FY2014. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $865.9 million, an increase of 0.8% from FY2014. The FY2015 act provides $864.3 million, an increase of 0.6%.

The U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) are responsible for the security of the Capitol Complex, including the U.S. Capitol, the House and Senate office buildings, the U.S. Botanic Garden, and the Library of Congress buildings and adjacent grounds.  The USCP requested $355.7 million for FY2015, an increase of 5.1% from the $338.5 million the USCP received in FY2014. The House-passed bill would have provided $348.0 million (+2.8%), while the Senate-reported version would have provided $344.0 million (+1.7%). The House-passed level was provided in the FY2015 act. Additional information on the USCP is presented in Table 7 . Appropriations for the police are contained in two accounts\u2014a salaries account and a general expenses account.

The House-passed bill would have provided $286.5 million (+2.7%), while the Senate-reported bill recommended $284.6 million (+2.0%). The House-passed level was provided in the FY2015 act. General Expenses\u2014the Capitol Police requested $64.3 million for general expenses, an increase of 8.1% from the $59.5 million provided in FY2014. The House-passed bill would have provided $61.5 million (+3.4%), while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase of $499 from the FY2014 enacted level. The House-passed level was provided in the FY2015 act. Another appropriation relating to the Capitol Police appears within the Architect of the Capitol account for Capitol Police buildings and grounds. USCP requested $25.6 million, an increase of 32.3% from the $19.3 million provided in FY2014. The House-passed bill would have provided $19.5 million (+0.7%), and the Senate-reported bill recommended $20.7 million (+6.8%). The FY2015 act provided $19.2 million (-1.0%). On March 24, 2014, the House subcommittee discussed the Capitol Police training requests, radio modernization program, recent incidents in which USCP was involved, and overtime use, and discrimination complaints issues related to door closures in the House side of the Capitol were discussed extensively. At a hearing on March 25, 2014, the Senate subcommittee discussed the incidents in which USCP was involved, and questions of increased access as funding returned to post-sequestration levels. The Office of Compliance is an independent and nonpartisan agency within the legislative branch. It was established to administer and enforce the Congressional Accountability Act, which was enacted in 1995. The act applies various employment and workplace safety laws to Congress and certain legislative branch entities. The Office of Compliance requested $4.02 million for FY2015, an increase of $152,000 (+3.9%) from the $3.87 million in the FY2014 act. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $3.96 million. The House-passed bill would have provided $4.5 million (+15.3%), including the $500,000 provided in the amendment offered by Representative Speier to provide sexual harassment training for House offices, with funds offset from the general administration fund of the Architect of the Capitol. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $3.96 million, an increase of $91,000 (+2.4%) from FY2014. The FY2015 act provided the Senate-reported level.  The Senate-reported version of H.R. 4487 contained language, subsequently included in the FY2015 act, authorizing the Office of Compliance to send notifications to covered employees electronically rather than through the mail.  CBO is a nonpartisan congressional agency created to provide objective economic and budgetary analysis to Congress. CBO cost estimates are required for any measure reported by a regular or conference committee that may vary revenues or expenditures. CBO requested $46.1 million for FY2015 (+0.8%). The House-passed bill would have provided $45.7 million, which was the level contained in the FY2014 act. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $46.1 million. The House-passed level was provided in the FY2015 act. At the House hearing on March 4, 2014, the subcommittee discussed the volume of CBO projections, and findings and projections in recent CBO products. Among the items discussed at the March 11, 2014, Senate subcommittee hearing were the number of requests received by CBO and its methodologies.  CBO requested two administrative provisions. One provision would make FY2015 funds available for the compensation of employees in specialty occupations with non-immigrant visas and another provision would make certain limited FY2015 unobligated balances available through FY2016. Neither the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of H.R. 4487 , nor the FY2015 act, contained these provisions.  The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the U.S. Capitol Complex, which includes the Capitol and its grounds, House and Senate office buildings, Library of Congress buildings and grounds, Capitol power plant, Botanic Garden, Capitol Visitor Center, and Capitol Police buildings and grounds. The Architect is responsible for the Supreme Court buildings and grounds, but appropriations for their expenses are not contained in the legislative branch appropriations bill. Operations of the Architect are funded in the following 10 accounts: general administration, Capitol building, Capitol grounds, Senate office buildings, House office buildings, Capitol power plant, Library buildings and grounds, Capitol Police buildings and grounds, Capitol Visitor Center, and Botanic Garden.  The Architect requested $676.6 million for FY2015, an increase of 12.4% from the FY2014 level of $602.0 million, which included $15.94 million for the next phase of the Capitol Dome restoration project.  The House-reported bill would have provided $488.6 million, not including funding for the Senate office buildings. The House-passed bill would have provided $484.9 million, including an amendment offered by Representative Gosar to reduce funding for the Botanic Garden to FY2014 levels and an amendment offered by Representative Speier to offset from the general administration fund of the Architect of the Capitol training provided by the Office of Compliance.  The Senate-reported bill would have provided $600.0 million.  The FY2015 act provided $600.2 million (-0.3%). The FY2014 request and the FY2015 House-passed, Senate-reported, and enacted levels for each of the AOC accounts is presented in Table 8 . The House-passed version of H.R. 4487 contained an administrative provision preventing the use of scrims containing photographs of building fa\u00e7ades during restoration or construction projects performed by AOC. The Senate-reported version of H.R. 4487 contained an administrative provision related to educational outreach efforts of the U.S. Botanic Garden. The FY2015 act contained the Botanic Garden educational outreach language as well as language prohibiting the use of funds for bonuses for contractors behind schedule or over budget.  Among the items discussed at the House subcommittee hearing on March 4, 2014, were funding for the Capitol Dome rehabilitation project, the prioritization of projects, and plans for the renovation of the Cannon House Office Building.  At a hearing on April 8, 2014, the Senate subcommittee discussed the restoration of the Capitol Dome, and the prioritization of projects.  The Library of Congress serves simultaneously as Congress's parliamentary library and the de facto national library of the United States. Its broader services to the nation include the acquisition, maintenance, and preservation of a collection of more than 158 million items in a wide range of traditional and new media; service to the general public and scholarly and library communities; administration of U.S. copyright laws by its Copyright Office; and administration of a national program to provide reading material to the blind and physically handicapped. Its direct services to Congress include the provision of legal research and law-related services by the Law Library of Congress, and a broad range of activities by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), including in-depth and nonpartisan public policy research, analysis, and legislative assistance for Members and committees and their staff; congressional staff training; information and statistics retrieval; and continuing legal education for Members of both chambers and congressional staff.

The House-passed bill would have provided $122.6 million (+2.8%), while the Senate-reported bill would have provided $122.1 million (+2.4%). The FY2015 act provided $119.99 million (+0.6%). GPO's budget authority is contained in three accounts. The FY2015 act renamed these accounts: (1) congressional printing and binding became congressional publishing, (2) Office of Superintendent of Documents (salaries and expenses) became Public Information Programs of the Superintendent of Documents (salaries and expenses), and (3) the revolving fund became the Government Publishing Office Business Operations Revolving Fund. Congressional publishing\u2014GPO requested $85.4 million (+7.1%). The House-passed bill would have provided $79.7 million, equivalent to the amount provided in the FY2014 act. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $82.5 million (+3.5%). The FY2015 act continued the FY2014 level. Public Information Programs of the Superintendent of Documents (salaries and expenses)\u2014GPO requested $32.2 million (+2.1%) for FY2015. The House-passed, Senate-reported, and enacted bills contained $31.5 million, the same amount provided by the FY2014 act. Government Publishing Office Business Operations Revolving fund\u2014the revolving fund supports the operation and maintenance of the Government Publishing Office.

The FY2015 act provided $8.8 million, an increase of $693,000 (+8.6%). The Senate-reported version of the bill includes a provision redesignating the Government Printing Office as the Government Publishing Office. Under this provision, the Public Printer would also be renamed the Director of the Government Publishing Office, while also making all references to staff gender neutral. This language was included in the FY2015 act. A separate bill redesignating GPO, S. 1947 , previously was reported by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration in April 2014.  The House subcommittee met on March 4, 2014, to discuss GPO's FY2015 budget request. The topics discussed included activities of the agency during the funding lapse, costs of printing and digital provision of government information, production of passports and secure credentials, the revolving fund, equal employment opportunity complaints, and the Federal Digital System (FDSys).  GAO responds to requests for studies of federal government programs and expenditures. GAO may also initiate its own work.  GAO requested $525.1 million for FY2015, not including offsetting collections. This represents an increase of 3.9% from the $505.4 million received in FY2014. The House-passed bill would have provided $519.6 million (+2.8%), while the Senate-reported bill would have provided $525.5 (+4.0%). The FY2015 act provided $522.0 million, an increase of $16.6 million (+3.3%). These levels do not include offsetting collections. GAO requested three administrative provisions: (1) amending the reviews and reports required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; (2) authorizing the detail of personnel from other branches or agencies of the Federal Government to GAO; and (3) establishing a Center for Audit Excellence to be operated on a fee-based basis.  H.R. 4487 , as passed by the House and reported by the Senate, included language establishing the Center. The FY2015 act also included this language.  At the House hearing on March 5, 2014, the subcommittee discussed issues including the number of requests accepted by GAO, savings achieved from GAO recommendations, and plans and justification for the Center for Audit Excellence.  The Senate subcommittee met on March 11, 2014, and discussed the number of requests received from Congress, performance management, and plans for the Center for Audit Excellence. The Open World Leadership Center administers a program that supports democratic changes in other countries by inviting their leaders to observe democracy and free enterprise in the United States. The first program was authorized by Congress in 1999 to support the relationship between Russia and the United States. The program encouraged young federal and local Russian leaders to visit the United States and observe its government and society. Established at the Library of Congress as the Center for Russian Leadership Development in 2000, the center was renamed the Open World Leadership Center in 2003, when the program was expanded to include specified additional countries. In 2004, Congress further extended the program's eligibility to other countries designated by the center's board of trustees, subject to congressional consideration. The center is housed in the Library and receives services from the Library through an inter-agency agreement. Open World requested $8.0 million for FY2015, an increase of 33.3% from the $6.0 million provided in FY2014.  The House-passed bill would have provided $3.42 million (-43.0%). In discussion during the subcommittee markup of the bill, subcommittee chair Tom Cole of Oklahoma stated that the reduction was developed in consultation with House leadership, and represented the percentage of Russian participants in Open World programs.  The Senate-reported bill would have provided $5.7 million, a decrease of $300,000 (-5.0%) from FY2014. This level was provided in the FY2015 act.  The center was created by Congress in 1988 to encourage public service by congressional staff through training and development programs. The center requested $430,000 for FY2015, the same as provided in the FY2014 act. This level was provided in the House-passed and Senate-reported bills and the FY2015 act.  Previously, $430,000, not including the across-board-rescission or sequestration, was provided for the center in FY2013. The FY2013 Senate-reported bill would have provided the requested level of $430,000. The FY2013 House-passed bill did not provide funding for the Stennis Center, and the House report stated the following:  The fiscal year 2012 Conference Agreement ( H.Rept. 112-331 ) directed that future budget requests from the John C. Stennis Center be accompanied by an appropriately detailed budget justification as requested in H.Rept. 112-148 . The Committee did not receive such justification and therefore has not provided the requested funding.  The $430,000 and directive for budget justifications included in the FY2012 conference report followed language in H.Rept. 112-148 , the FY2012 House report, which stated the following:  The Center was created by Congress in 1988 with an appropriation of $7.5 million which subsequently was transferred to the John C. Stennis Trust Fund and invested in non-expendable corpus Special Issue Certificates of Indebtedness with the U.S. Treasury. As reflected in the current Budget of the United States, the Center has $15 million invested with the Treasury, and at a 2 percent return should generate $300,000 that can be utilized for the annual operation of the program. Since the principal of the fund has doubled from the original appropriation and with reduced funding within the Legislative Branch, the Committee has provided zero funding for the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Training and Development.  The Committee directs that any further budget request from the John C. Stennis Center be accompanied by an appropriately detailed budget justification.  The Stennis Center was funded at $430,000 in FY2011 (less 0.2% from an across-the-board rescission), FY2010, FY2009, FY2008 (less 0.25% rescission from an across-the-board rescission), and FY2007.  The House-passed and Senate-reported versions of H.R. 4487 , as well as P.L. 113-235 , included recurring general provisions prohibiting appropriated funds for the maintenance and care of private vehicles; limiting funds to FY2015 unless otherwise expressly provided; making any changes in rates of compensation and designation permanent; making consulting services contracts a matter of public record; authorizing the costs of Legislative Branch Financial Managers Council (LBFMC); authorizing landscape maintenance by the AOC in a specified area; limiting transfers; and prohibiting restrictions on guided staff tours of the Capitol. Both the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of H.R. 4487 also included a provision freezing pay for Members of Congress in 2015. Division N (Section 8) of the FY2015 act enacted this freeze. Salaries for Members of Congress, however, are neither funded nor increased in the legislative branch or any other appropriations bill. In other years, provisions to prohibit the automatic adjustments have been discussed during consideration of other bills, and a prohibition could be included in any bill, or be introduced as a separate bill. For a list of the laws that have previously contained provisions prohibiting the annual pay adjustments, see \"Table 3. Legislative Vehicles Used for Pay Prohibitions, Enacted Dates, and Pay Language\" in CRS Report 97-1011, Salaries of Members of Congress: Recent Actions and Historical Tables , by [author name scrubbed].  The Senate-reported bill also included restrictions for bonus awards to contractors for work on projects for which the contractor is behind schedule or over budget. A version of this language was included as an administrative provision in the Architect of the Capitol section of the FY2015 act.  A provision of P.L. 113-235 (Section 736) also prohibits the use of funds for the painting of a portrait of an officer or employee of the federal government, including Members of Congress and the head of any office in the legislative branch.   Table 4 through Table 8 provide information on funding levels for the legislative branch overall, the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Capitol Police, and the Architect of the Capitol.  The tables are followed by an Appendix , which lists House, Senate, and conference bills and reports and public law numbers and enactment dates since FY1998.
