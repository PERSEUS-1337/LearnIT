FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2701 et \n        seq.)--\n                    (A) was passed directly in response to the Exxon \n                Valdez oil spill;\n                    (B) establishes strict liability for parties \n                responsible for the discharge of oil into navigable \n                waters, shorelines, or the exclusive economic zone;\n                    (C) establishes liability for damages, including \n                damages related to all cleanup and removal costs, \n                natural resources, real or personal property, \n                subsistence use of natural resources, government \n                revenues, diminished profit and earning capacity, and \n                increased public services; and\n                    (D) limits the liability of responsible parties for \n                damages beyond removal costs by vessel and facility \n                type;\n            (2) the annual report of the Coast Guard on liability \n        limits under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2701 et \n        seq.) for fiscal year 2009 indicates that 51 vessel oil spills \n        since the date of enactment of that Act caused damages that \n        exceeded the liability limits for the applicable class of \n        vessel;\n            (3) in the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of \n        2006 (Public Law 109-241; 120 Stat. 516), Congress increased \n        the liability limits under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 \n        U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) for single- and double-hulled vessels and \n        gave the Coast Guard the ability to further adjust those limits \n        for inflation;\n            (4) the Internal Revenue Service estimated the balance of \n        the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund established by section 9509 \n        of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to be $1,700,000,000 at \n        the end of fiscal year 2009, pending resolution of outstanding \n        claims against the Fund;\n            (5)(A) the cleanup of the oil spill resulting from the \n        grounding of the Exxon Valdez on Bligh Reef in Prince William \n        Sound on March 24, 1989, was declared complete in 1992 by the \n        Coast Guard and the State of Alaska and cost Exxon \n        $2,000,000,000;\n            (B) in a settlement approved by a United States district \n        court on October 9, 1991, Exxon paid the State of Alaska and \n        the Federal Government the equivalent of $900,000,000 (made in \n        annual payment over 10 years) to settle the civil claims \n        associated with the Exxon Valdez oil spill, of which a portion \n        was made for reimbursement for cleanup costs;\n            (C) under a separate settlement of Federal criminal \n        charges, Exxon also paid $25,000,000 in fines and $100,000,000, \n        divided equally between the United States and Alaska, as \n        restitution for criminal conduct by Exxon;\n            (D) in a case consolidated into the case styled Exxon \n        Shipping Co. v. Baker (128 S. Ct. 2605 (2008)), a jury awarded \n        $287,000,000 for damages to private parties and an additional \n        $5,000,000,000 in punitive damages; and\n            (E) after nearly 2 decades of appeals, on June 25, 2008, \n        the Supreme Court issued a judgment limiting punitive damages \n        to compensatory damages, calculated at $507,500,000, a \n        reduction to essentially 10 percent of the initial jury award;\n            (6) as of June 16, 2010, a scientific team under the \n        direction of Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, Secretary of the \n        Interior Ken Salazar, and the Chair of the National Incident \n        Command's Flow Rate Technical Group, Dr. Marcia McNutt \n        (Director of the United States Geological Survey), announced an \n        estimated flow rate of between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per \n        day of hydrocarbons into the Gulf of Mexico from the Macondo \n        Prospect well, known as MC 252, resulting from the blowout and \n        explosion of the mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater \n        Horizon that occurred on April 20, 2010, and resulting \n        hydrocarbon releases into the environment;\n            (7) that estimate greatly exceeds the estimated 10,800,000 \n        gallons (250,000 barrels) spilled by the grounding of the Exxon \n        Valdez on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989, \n        and is now the largest known oil spill in United States waters;\n            (8) the Gulf Coast region produced 1,273,424,000 pounds of \n        seafood in 2008 worth $697,591,000 to the fishermen in the Gulf \n        of Mexico, which is the second most productive fishing region \n        in the United States, boasting 4 of the top-10 commercial \n        fishing ports of the United States in Empire-Venice, \n        Intracoastal City, and Cameron, Louisiana, and Pascagoula-Moss \n        Point, Mississippi;\n            (9) recreational fisheries are important to the Gulf Coast \n        economy, with (according to the National Marine Fisheries \n        Service) 3,200,000 individuals taking 25,000,000 recreational \n        fishing trips in the Gulf region in 2008 in which 194,000,000 \n        fish were landed;\n            (10) as of June 7, 2010, the National Oceanic and \n        Atmospheric Administration closed 78,264 square miles of the \n        Gulf of Mexico to fishing, an area equivalent to 32.3 percent \n        of the total exclusive economic zone of the Gulf; and\n            (11) commercial sectors employing a wide spectrum of the \n        Gulf Coast population (including residents involved in tourism, \n        oil and gas exploration, and a host of support and service \n        industries) are experiencing a severe economic disruption due \n        to the blowout and explosion of the mobile offshore drilling \n        unit Deepwater Horizon that occurred on April 20, 2010, and \n        resulting hydrocarbon releases into the environment.\n\nSEC. 3.
