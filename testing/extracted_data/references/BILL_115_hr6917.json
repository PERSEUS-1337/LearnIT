CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internet and other communications technologies have \n        generated tremendous benefits for consumers and businesses \n        across all sectors of society. The United States is a world \n        leader in harnessing these benefits to advance the social and \n        economic well-being of its citizens. It is vital that U.S. law \n        and policy support these advances and do not unduly restrict \n        innovation or inhibit beneficial uses of these technologies.\n            (2) Like all technologies, the Internet and other \n        communications technologies can be misused by malicious actors. \n        These actors often target those in society who are most \n        vulnerable, including children, the elderly, and those whose \n        circumstances make them particularly susceptible to fraud, \n        harassment, or abuse.\n            (3) In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in \n        the nonconsensual online distribution of images depicting the \n        exposure of adult individuals' intimate body parts or depicting \n        adult individuals engaged in sexually explicit conduct. In many \n        cases, these adult individuals either did not consent to the \n        creation of this imagery, or had a reasonable expectation that \n        such material would remain private.\n            (4) The nonconsensual distribution of sexually intimate \n        imagery constitutes a gross violation of personal privacy and \n        human dignity. This distribution can have devastating impacts \n        on individuals depicted in such imagery, including on their \n        professional lives, personal relationships, personal safety, \n        and emotional well-being. Persons who intentionally distribute \n        private, sexually intimate imagery often do so to humiliate, \n        degrade, harass, threaten, or extort the individuals depicted.\n            (5) In some cases, the nonconsensual distribution of \n        sexually intimate imagery may violate Federal or State civil or \n        criminal law. In this regard, Congress notes efforts by the \n        Federal Trade Commission to address the nonconsensual \n        distribution of sexually explicit images through its powers \n        under the Federal Trade Commission Act.\n            (6) Those who perpetrate the nonconsensual distribution of \n        sexually intimate images often rely on interactive computer \n        services to facilitate such distribution. This conduct may \n        violate the terms of service or other terms imposed by \n        providers of these services. Many providers have adopted \n        policies, standards and procedures pursuant to which they will \n        remove or block access to nonconsensual sexually intimate \n        images upon notice.\n            (7) It is in the public interest to incentivize providers \n        of interactive computer services to adopt and enforce policies \n        that are reasonably calculated to remove or block access \n        through their services to sexually intimate imagery that has \n        been distributed without the consent of one or more individuals \n        depicted in that imagery.\n\nSEC. 3.

and\n                    (C) that are greater if the provider solicited the \n                nonconsensual sexually intimate imagery or profited \n                from the posting of such imagery.\n    (b) Requirements of Sexually Intimate Takedown Request Form.--A \nsexually intimate takedown request form satisfies the requirements of \nthis subsection if the form requires an individual seeking removal of \nsexually intimate imagery distributed without consent of the submitter \nthat is available or accessible through a provider's service to submit \nthe following information in writing to the designated agent of the \nprovider as described under subsection (a)(2)(A):\n            (1) A URL for each location where a sexually intimate image \n        depicting the submitter appears on the provider's service.\n            (2) An affirmation that the submitter had a reasonable \n        expectation of privacy in the location in which each image was \n        taken or recorded.\n            (3) A description of any other private information that \n        appears in the images.\n            (4) An affirmation that the submitter did not consent to \n        the distribution of the images on the provider's service.\n            (5) A statement about whether the submitter has sought one \n        or more protective measures in connection with any individual \n        who took or recorded the images, any other individual who \n        appears in the images, or any individual responsible for the \n        distribution of the images.\n            (6) An attestation that the submitter appears in the images \n        and that all information provided in the takedown request form \n        is true and accurate to the best of the submitter's knowledge.\n    (c) Incentives for Responsible Provider Action.--\n            (1) In general.--No cause of action shall lie in any court \n        against any provider (including any officer, employee, or \n        agent) if the provider meets the registration requirements \n        under subsection (a)(2)--\n                    (A) for any decision about whether to remove \n                sexually intimate images that the provider makes in a \n                good-faith response to the submission of a takedown \n                request form that meets the requirements of subsection \n                (b);
