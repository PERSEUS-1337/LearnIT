FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Conducting electronic surveillance of al Qaeda and \n        other international terrorist groups is integral to protecting \n        people in the United States from terrorism. Electronic \n        surveillance can assist in the detection and prevention of \n        terrorist plots.\n            (2) Electronic surveillance may, at times, involve \n        surveillance of persons in the United States. Such electronic \n        surveillance is lawful if conducted in accordance with the \n        Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and the Foreign \n        Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 or chapters 119 or 121 of \n        title 18, United States Code.\n            (3) It is essential that in protecting the United States \n        from enemies, the President does not compromise the civil \n        liberties that the President is charged with safeguarding. In \n        2004, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained in a plurality \n        opinion for the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, ``We have \n        long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check \n        for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's \n        citizens''.\n            (4) Section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the \n        United States provides that ``Congress shall have the Power . . \n        . to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for \n        carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other \n        Powers vested in this Constitution in the Government of the \n        United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof''.\n            (5) In passing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n        1978, Congress expressly determined that the Foreign \n        Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and chapters 119 and 121 \n        of title 18, United States Code, are the exclusive means by \n        which surveillance can be conducted in the United States.\n            (6) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 \n        U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) authorizes the Federal Government to \n        conduct electronic surveillance of persons in the United States \n        for purposes of gathering intelligence and counterintelligence. \n        The Act contains emergency procedures under which electronic \n        surveillance may begin up to 72 hours before the Federal \n        Government presents to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n        Court an application for a court order approving electronic \n        surveillance.\n            (7) The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n        States declares that ``The right of the people to be secure in \n        their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against \n        unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and \n        no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by \n        Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to \n        be searched, and the persons or things to be seized''.\n            (8) A determination of reasonableness under the Fourth \n        Amendment must ultimately be made by an independent magistrate, \n        not by an executive branch official.\n            (9) The Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law \n        107-40), passed by Congress on September 14, 2001, does not \n        constitute legal authorization for electronic surveillance not \n        authorized by chapters 119 or 121 of title 18, United States \n        Code, or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 \n        U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3. REITERATION OF CHAPTERS 119 AND 121 OF TITLE 18, UNITED STATES \n              CODE, AND THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT OF \n              1978 AS THE EXCLUSIVE MEANS BY WHICH DOMESTIC ELECTRONIC \n              SURVEILLANCE MAY BE CONDUCTED.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, chapters 119 and 121 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) shall be the exclusive means by \nwhich electronic surveillance may be conducted.\n\nSEC. 4.
