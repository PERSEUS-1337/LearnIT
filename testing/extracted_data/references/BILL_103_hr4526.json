FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Complaints of assault or abuse of children raised \n        during custody proceedings or under other circumstances are \n        often not pursued through criminal investigation and \n        prosecution in the same manner and with the same vigor that \n        similar complaints against adult victims are pursued.\n            (2) Complaints are often adjudicated in family courts ill-\n        equipped to, or jurisdictionally prohibited from, investigating \n        criminal matters.\n            (3) The failure by States, territories, and the District of \n        Columbia to bring their full criminal investigatory and \n        prosecutorial skills to bear regarding such complaints \n        regarding alleged child victims places these alleged child \n        victims at risk of further harm.\n            (4) Children are a discrete and insular minority, within \n        the Supreme Court's understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment \n        to the Constitution of the United States.\n            (5) Because of such status, children have been deprived of \n        equal and adequate enforcement of the laws, and particularly \n        those criminal laws prohibiting assault, battery, and torture.\n            (6) It would be a violation of the alleged child victims' \n        right to equal protection of law if enforcement actions are \n        brought to bear regarding alleged adult victims but not brought \n        to bear regarding child victims.\n\nSEC. 3. RIGHT TO PROTECTION; DUTY TO INTERVENE.\n\n    The Revised Statutes of the United States are amended by inserting \nafter section 1979 the following:\n\nSEC. 1979A. RIGHT TO PROTECTION; DUTY TO INTERVENE.\n\n    ``(a) Where the statutes, ordinances, regulations, custom, or usage \nof any State or territory or the District of Columbia provide for \ninvestigation and, where warranted, criminal prosecution in response to \ncomplaints of physical assault, sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual \nharassment of citizens or other persons within the jurisdiction \nthereof, these ordinances, regulations, customs, and usage shall be \napplied without regard to the age of the victim.\n    ``(b) Neither the investigation and determination of facts for the \npurpose of awarding guardianship for or custody of a minor, nor the act \nof awarding such guardianship or custody shall relieve any State or \nterritory or the District of Columbia of the duty to investigate and \ncriminally prosecute valid complaints against child victims in the same \nvigorous and timely manner as complaints against adult victims.\n    ``(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the \npublic disclosure of any victim's identity. To the contrary, to the \nmaximum extent possible, the identity of all child victims shall be \nprotected in any investigation and prosecution.\n    ``(d) Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, \nregulation, custom, or usage, of any State or territory or the District \nof Columbia, fails to provide the affirmative protection or \nintervention required pursuant to subsection (a) to a citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof shall be \nliable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress. Such protection and intervention \nas required by law shall not be limited to those cases in which the \ninjured party is in the physical or constructive custody of such \nperson.\n    ``(e) The failure of a State, county, locality, or the District of \nColumbia to comply with this section shall act as an absolute \ndisability to receipt of Federal grants for law-enforcement purposes as \notherwise provided for in such laws as Congress may from time to time \nenact.\n\n``SEC. 1979B. RELIEF.\n\n    ``An injured party under section 1979A may apply to the court for \nsuch relief as the court may grant in its discretion. Such relief may \ninclude injunctive relief, restraining orders, and monetary damages. \nSuch relief may not include punitive damages. Granting of such relief \nas the court may grant does not preclude criminal prosecution under the \nlaws of a State or the United States. Judgment entered on such action \nmay be considered by the Department of Justice in its determination of \nwhether a State, locality, or the District of Columbia has met the \nrequirements of section 1979A.\n\n``SEC. 1979C. ABSTENTION; DENOVO REVIEW.\n\n    ``The court may not abstain from hearing a case under section 1979B \nuntil the completion of State court proceedings or exhaustion of State \nremedies unless the defendant demonstrate by clear and convincing \nevidence that delay of Federal proceedings will not endanger the \ninjured party or deprive such party of the protection which is the \nsubject of the proceeding. In making any determination in a proceeding \nunder this section, the court may, in its discretion, review all \nfactual issues de novo, and shall not be limited by doctrines of res \njudicata or collateral estoppel, except that a final criminal \nconviction in a State or Federal court after a fully-litigated trial \nshall estop any review of the act or acts underlying such conviction.\n\n``SEC. 1979D. WHO MAY BRING.\n\n    ``An action under section 1979B may be brought by the injured \nparty, a guardian ad litem, a class of affected individuals, the \nAttorney General of the United States, or the attorney general of a \nState, commonwealth, territory. A refusal by such attorneys general to \nprosecute shall not act as a bar to private action.\n\n``SEC. 1979E. COSTS.\n\n    ``In any action under section 1979B, the court, in its discretion, \nmay allow the prevailing party, other than the United States or a \nState, territory or jurisdiction, a reasonable attorney's fee.''."
