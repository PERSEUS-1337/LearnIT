    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, approved as Proposition 47 by the voters at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election (the act), made significant changes to the state\u2019s criminal justice system by reducing the penalties for certain nonviolent, nonserious drug and property crimes. The act requires the state savings realized from these criminal justice changes to be deposited in the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund and spent on prevention and support services with the intent of reducing crime, including truancy and dropout prevention.\n(b) The act requires 25 percent of the moneys deposited in the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund to be allocated to the State Department of Education for administration of a grant program to reduce truancy and support pupils who are at risk of dropping out of school or who are victims of crime.\n(c) In accordance with the act, the funding provided to K\u201312 education should be used to help build the capacity of local educational agencies to identify and implement evidence-based, nonpunitive programs and practices to keep our most vulnerable pupils in school, consistent with each local educational agency\u2019s local control and accountability plan, including, but not limited to, its goals for pupil engagement and school climate.\n(d) California needs to increase the knowledge base concerning which strategies are most effective for improving pupil success and eliminating the school-to-prison pipeline, including, but not necessarily limited to, providing resources to local educational agencies to establish community schools and address pupil attendance problems in kindergarten and grades 1 to 3, inclusive. One manner in which this can be accomplished is for the local educational agencies participating in the K\u201312 education grant program pursuant to the act to report and evaluate outcomes using multiple measures, while engaging in a broader community of practice that disseminates promising and proven strategies to local educational agencies statewide.\nSEC. 2.\nArticle 10 (commencing with Section 33430) is added to Chapter 3 of Part 20 of Division 2 of Title 2 of the Education Code, to read:\nArticle  10.
