    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Campus Care and Counseling Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In a recent report, a startling 85 percent of college \n        counseling centers revealed an increase in the number of \n        students they see with psychological problems. Furthermore, the \n        American College Health Association found that 61 percent of \n        college students reported feeling hopeless, 45 percent said \n        they felt so depressed they could barely function, and 9 \n        percent felt suicidal.\n            (2) There is clear evidence of an increased incidence of \n        depression among college students. According to a survey \n        described in the Chronicle of Higher Education (February 1, \n        2002), depression among freshmen has nearly doubled (from 8.2 \n        percent to 16.3 percent). Without treatment, researchers \n        recently noted that ``depressed adolescents are at risk for \n        school failure, social isolation, promiscuity, self medication \n        with drugs and alcohol, and suicide--now the third leading \n        cause of death among 10-24 year olds.''.\n            (3) Researchers who conducted the study ``Changes in \n        Counseling Center Client Problems Across 13 Years'' (1989-2001) \n        at Kansas State University stated that ``students are \n        experiencing more stress, more anxiety, more depression than \n        they were a decade ago.'' (The Chronicle of Higher Education, \n        February 14, 2003).\n            (4) According to the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug \n        Abuse, 20 percent of full-time undergraduate college students \n        use illicit drugs.\n            (5) The 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also \n        reported that 18.4 percent of adults aged 18 to 24 are \n        dependent on or abusing illicit drugs or alcohol. In addition, \n        the study found that ``serious mental illness is highly \n        correlated with substance dependence or abuse. Among adults \n        with serious mental illness in 2001, 20.3 percent were \n        dependent on or abused alcohol or illicit drugs, while the rate \n        among adults without serious mental illness was only 6.3 \n        percent.''.\n            (6) A 2003 Gallagher's Survey of Counseling Center \n        Directors found that 81 percent were concerned about the \n        increasing number of students with more serious psychological \n        problems, 67 percent reported a need for more psychiatric \n        services, and 63 percent reported problems with growing demand \n        for services without an appropriate increase in resources.\n            (7) The International Association of Counseling Services \n        accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per 1,000 to \n        1,500 students. According to the 2003 Gallagher's Survey of \n        Counseling Center Directors, the ratio of counselors to \n        students is as high as 1 counselor per 2,400 students at \n        institutions of higher education with more than 15,000 \n        students.\n\nSEC. 3. MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ON CAMPUS.\n\n    Part B of title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n1011 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 120 the following:\n\n``SEC. 120A.
