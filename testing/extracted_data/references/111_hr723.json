    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Social Security and Medicare \nImproved Burn Injury Treatment Access Act of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Terrorist acts, such as the September 11, 2001, attacks \n        in New York and Washington, DC and attacks in countries \n        throughout the world, major accidental events, chemical plant \n        explosions, airplane crashes, and major industrial accidents, \n        result in a substantial number of burn-injured patients.\n            (2) In most major traumatic events, 25 percent to 30 \n        percent of the injured will require burn care treatment. About \n        one-third of those hospitalized in New York on September 11th \n        had severe burn injuries.\n            (3) According to the American Burn Association (ABA), which \n        is the national professional society representing hospitals \n        with burn centers, as well as burn surgeons, nurses, \n        therapists, and other members of the burn care team, there are \n        only 128 burn centers in the United States. The total burn-bed \n        capacity at all burn centers in the United States is 1,835 \n        beds. Burn centers in four States have closed, with a loss of \n        several beds, which further diminishes the Nation's ability to \n        handle the mass burn casualties that could result from a major \n        terrorist attack.\n            (4) Burn centers are a national resource that must be \n        preserved and strengthened as part of the Nation's preparedness \n        activities to deal with terrorist attacks or other disasters \n        that would likely lead to mass burn casualties.\n            (5) Based on a study of over 54,000 burn cases over a 20-\n        year period of time, the ABA in its 2002 National Burn \n        Repository Report indicates that 38 percent of burn-injured \n        patients treated in burn centers were uninsured. This high \n        level of uncompensated care threatens the survival of burn \n        centers, the continued existence of which is essential to the \n        emergency preparedness efforts of the United States.\n            (6) Burn injuries are among the most costly to treat and \n        require immediate medical attention.\n            (7) Because of the necessity of providing immediate care in \n        the case of burn injuries, the waiting periods established for \n        Medicare coverage for disabled burn patients should be waived \n        and it is essential for Medicare to reimburse the costs of such \n        burn treatment to ensure the financial survival of burn \n        centers.\n\nSEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF 5-MONTH SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY WAITING \n              PERIOD IN CASES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABLING BURN \n              INJURIES.\n\n    (a) Disability Insurance Benefits.--Section 223(a) of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 423(a)) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new paragraph:\n    ``(3)(A) In the case of any individual who has a disabling burn \ninjury and is not entitled to disability insurance benefits under this \nsection for any month solely by reason of the waiting period under \nclause (i) in the first sentence of paragraph (1), the Commissioner of \nSocial Security shall waive the application of the waiting period, and, \nnotwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) of the first sentence of paragraph \n(1), such individual shall be entitled to disability insurance benefits \nfor each month, beginning with the first month during all of which such \nindividual is under a disability and in which such individual would \nbecome so entitled to such insurance benefits under such sentence but \nfor such waiting period, and ending as provided in paragraph (1).\n    ``(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the process for determining \nunder paragraph (1) the month in which the disability ceases shall \nrequire that the status of the individual's disability be determined at \nleast once every 3 years.\n    ``(C) For purposes of subparagraph (A) and sections 202(e)(5)(C), \n202(f)(6)(C), and 216(i)(2)(A)(ii), an individual is considered to have \na `disabling burn injury' if the individual has a burn injury that \nsatisfies a finding of disability in accordance with the Social \nSecurity Administration's publication, `Disability Evaluation under \nSocial Security' (Blue Book, January 2005) for purposes of establishing \neligibility for benefits under this title.''.\n    (b) Widow's Insurance Benefits Based on Disability.--Section \n202(e)(5) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 402(e)(5)) is amended by adding at the \nend the following new subparagraph:\n    ``(C) In the case of any individual who has a disabling burn injury \n(as described in section 223(a)(3)(B)) and is not entitled to widow's \ninsurance benefits under this section for any month solely by reason of \nthe waiting period under paragraph (1)(F)(i), the Commissioner of \nSocial Security shall waive the application of the waiting period, and, \nnotwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1)(F), such \nindividual shall be entitled to widow's insurance benefits for each \nmonth, beginning with the first month during all of which she is under \na disability and in which she would become so entitled to such \ninsurance benefits under paragraph (1) but for such waiting period, and \nending as provided in paragraph (1).
