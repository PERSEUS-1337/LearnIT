FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) there exists a need for decent, safe, and affordable \n        housing throughout the United States for low-income families;\n            (2) affordable housing is critical to the physical and \n        emotional well-being of low-income families, especially \n        vulnerable populations such as the elderly and persons with \n        disabilities;\n            (3) an unprecedented number of contracts for section 8 \n        contracts are expiring over the next few years, including \n        contracts covering 2,384,000 units in fiscal year 2000 alone;\n            (4) a substantial number of housing units receiving \n        project-based assistance have rents that are lower than the \n        rents of comparable, unassisted rental units in the same \n        housing rental market;\n            (5) many of the residents in federally assisted housing are \n        elderly or persons with disabilities;\n            (6) the elderly are especially vulnerable to displacement \n        trauma, which can lead to emotional problems and death;\n            (7) due to the down sizing of the Department of Housing and \n        Urban Development and diminished administrative capacity, the \n        Department lacks the ability to effectively appraise the market \n        value of properties;\n            (8) during 1998 alone, some 219 properties with over 25,000 \n        units opted out of renewing their section 8 contracts, \n        resulting in the loss of this housing as affordable, low-income \n        housing;\n            (9) currently some 3,000 section 8 project-based units are \n        being lost each month as affordable housing because owners of \n        section 8 project-based housing choosing to prepay or opt-out \n        upon the expiration of their section 8 contracts;\n            (10) a significant number of these section 8 project-based \n        housing projects for which owners have elected to opt-out and \n        not renew their section 8 contracts are located in areas where \n        the availability of affordable housing is scarce;\n            (11) in many of the cases where residents have been \n        provided vouchers because the owners of section 8 project-based \n        housing elected not to renew their section 8 contracts, the \n        residents have not been able to adequately use their vouchers \n        to obtain housing because of the lack of available, affordable \n        housing;\n            (12) it is expected that--\n                    (A) if no changes in the terms and conditions of \n                the section 8 contracts for project-based assistance \n                are made before the contracts expire, more private \n                owners will elect to not renew their contracts; and\n                    (B) of those properties with respect to which the \n                owners do not renew their section 8 contracts, many of \n                the properties will no longer be affordable to its \n                current assisted residents due to significant rent \n                increases and, since many of the residents have little \n                or no means to pay the additional rent for these units \n                from personal income, these residents will be \n                effectively forced to move from their homes;\n            (13) the Department of Housing and Urban Development has \n        had the authority to renew expiring section 8 project-based \n        contracts up to comparable market rent levels since October 27, \n        1997, and has failed to implement any policy for renewing these \n        contracts, resulting in the unnecessary loss of many of these \n        housing units as affordable, low-income housing and the \n        displacement of many vulnerable low-income families, including \n        the elderly and persons with disabilities;\n            (14) the Department of Housing and Urban Development has \n        adequate funds in the Housing Certificate account to renew all \n        expiring section 8 project-based contracts at market rental \n        rates but has failed to make these funds available to preserve \n        this housing as affordable, low-income housing; and\n            (15) the Department of Housing and Urban Development should \n        use all appropriate means to preserve housing assisted with \n        section 8 project-based contracts as affordable, low-income \n        housing.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect vulnerable \nresidents of affordable housing, especially the elderly, persons with \ndisabilities, and those with large families--\n            (1) to the extent feasible and appropriate, by ensuring \n        that the Department of Housing and Urban Development renew \n        expiring section 8 project-based contracts, and allowing low-\n        income families to live in their homes without fear of \n        unreasonable displacement;\n            (2) by ensuring that the Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development has done everything in its power to ensure that \n        housing with expiring section 8 project-based contracts are \n        renewed, especially those in rural areas and in other areas \n        with low vacancy rates; and\n            (3) after the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n        has exhausted all means to ensure that housing with expiring \n        section 8 contracts are renewed, by providing flexible rental \nassistance, including enhanced vouchers, to ensure that vulnerable \npopulations are not forced to move from their homes when rent levels \nrise to unaffordable levels due to the opt-out of owners who elect to \nnot renew their expiring section 8 project-based contracts.\n\nSEC. 3.
