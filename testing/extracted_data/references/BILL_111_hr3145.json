FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Credit default swaps were conceived as insurance \n        instruments, used to diffuse risk and increase liquidity \n        throughout our lending system.\n            (2) The credit default swap market has grown over the past \n        decade to include contracts that are entered into by persons \n        with no economic interest in the contract's underlying \n        reference event, also known as naked credit default swaps.\n            (3) Certain parties wrote credit default swap contracts \n        without posting collateral, leaving them overexposed to certain \n        asset classes and creating a systemic risk.\n            (4) Unconnected and uncollateralized speculation creates an \n        unnecessary risk for our financial system.\n            (5) Credit default swaps have proved to be harmful \n        financial instruments and have caused significant wealth \n        destruction during our economic crisis.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to allow the Securities and Exchange Commission to have \n        oversight over all security-based swap agreements; and\n            (2) to prevent further damage to our economy by prohibiting \n        credit default swaps.\n\nSEC. 3.
