PURPOSE AND NEED FOR NORTHMET LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to further the public \ninterest by consummating the NorthMet Land Exchange as specifically set \nforth in this Act.\n    (b) Need.--According to the Final Record of Decision, the NorthMet \nLand Exchange is advisable and needed because the NorthMet Land \nExchange will--\n            (1) result in a 40-acre net gain in National Forest System \n        lands;\n            (2) improve the spatial arrangement of National Forest \n        System lands by reducing the amount of ownership boundaries to \n        be managed by 33 miles;\n            (3) improve management effectiveness by exchanging isolated \n        Federal lands with no public overland access for non-Federal \n        lands that will have public overland access and be accessible \n        and open to public use and enjoyment;\n            (4) result in Federal cost savings by eliminating certain \n        easements and their associated administration costs;\n            (5) meet several of the priorities identified in the land \n        and resource management plan for Superior National Forest to \n        protect and manage administratively or congressionally \n        designated, unique, proposed, or recommended areas, including \n        acquisition of 307 acres of land to the administratively \n        proposed candidate Research Natural Areas, which are managed by \n        preserving and maintaining areas for ecological research, \n        observation, genetic conservation, monitoring, and educational \n        activities;\n            (6) promote more effective land management that would meet \n        specific National Forest needs for management, including \n        acquisition of over 6,500 acres of land for new public access, \n        watershed protection, ecologically rare habitats, wetlands, \n        water frontage, and improved ownership patterns;\n            (7) convey Federal land generally not needed for other \n        Forest resource management objectives, because such land is \n        adjacent to intensively developed private land including \n        ferrous mining areas, where abundant mining infrastructure and \n        transportation are already in place, including--\n                    (A) a large, intensively developed open pit mine \n                lying directly to the north of the Federal land;\n                    (B) a private mine railroad, powerlines, and roads \n                lying directly to the south of the Federal land; and\n                    (C) already existing ore processing, milling, and \n                tailings facilities located approximately 5 miles to \n                the west of the Federal land; and\n            (8) provide a practical resolution to complex issues \n        pertaining to the development of private mineral rights \n        underlying the Federal land surface, and thereby avoid \n        potential litigation which could adversely impact the status \n        and management of the Federal land and other National Forest \n        System land acquired under the authority of section 6 of the \n        Act of March 1, 1911 (commonly known as the Weeks Law; 16 \n        U.S.C. 515).\n\nSEC. 3.
