FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Human cloning is unsafe, immoral, and unacceptable.\n            (2) Federal legislation should be enacted to prohibit \n        anyone from attempting to conduct human cloning, whether using \n        Federal or non-Federal funds.\n            (3) To deter human cloning, any attempt to create a human \n        clone should be a felony subject to severe punishment.\n            (4) The National Academies (including the National Academy \n        of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine) and the National \n        Bioethics Advisory Commission recommended that any legislative \n        action undertaken to ban human cloning should be careful not to \n        interfere with important areas of scientific research, such as \n        nuclear transplantation to produce stem cells.\n            (5) The National Academies found that there are significant \n        differences between human cloning and nuclear transplantation. \n        Specifically, the Academies determined that, unlike human \n        cloning, the creation of embryonic stem cells by nuclear \n        transplantation does not involve implantation of an embryo in a \n        uterus and thus cannot produce a complete, live-born animal \n        (that is, a ``clone'').\n            (6) The National Academies found that scientific and \n        medical considerations that justify a ban on human cloning are \n        not applicable to nuclear transplantation.\n            (7) The National Academies concluded that nuclear \n        transplantation has great potential to increase the \n        understanding and potential treatment of various diseases and \n        debilitating disorders, as well as our fundamental biological \n        knowledge. These diseases and disorders include Lou Gehrig's \n        disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal-cord \n        injury, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, rheumatoid \n        arthritis, and many others.\n            (8) The National Academies determined that nuclear \n        transplantation research could improve our ability to \n        transplant healthy tissue derived from stem cells into patients \n        with damaged or diseased organs. Such research could greatly \n        reduce the likelihood that a person's body would reject that \n        tissue and also help obviate the need for immunosuppressive \n        drugs, which often have severe and potentially life-threatening \n        side effects.\n            (9) Based on these expert conclusions and recommendations \n        and other evidence, nuclear transplantation is a valuable area \n        of research that could potentially save millions of lives and \n        relieve the suffering of countless others, and thus should not \n        be banned.\n            (10) The National Academies recommended that nuclear \n        transplantation experiments should be subject to close scrutiny \n        under the Federal procedures and rules concerning human-\n        subjects research.\n            (11) Given the need for additional oversight in this area, \n        strict ethical requirements for human subjects research, \n        including informed consent, safety and privacy protections, and \n        review by an ethics board, should be prescribed for all \n        research involving nuclear transplantation, whether using \n        Federal or non-Federal funds.\n            (12)(A) Biomedical research and clinical facilities engage \n        in and affect interstate commerce.\n            (B) The services provided by clinical facilities move in \n        interstate commerce.\n            (C) Patients travel regularly across State lines in order \n        to access clinical facilities.\n            (D) Biomedical research and clinical facilities engage \n        scientists, doctors, and others in an interstate market, and \n        contract for research and purchase medical and other supplies \n        in an interstate market.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to prohibit human cloning and to \nprotect important areas of medical research, including stem cell \nresearch.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON HUMAN CLONING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended by \ninserting after chapter 15, the following:\n\n               ``CHAPTER 16--PROHIBITION ON HUMAN CLONING\n\n``Sec.\n``301.
