FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Studies indicate that the majority of child protection \n        professionals, including child protection workers, child \n        protection attorneys, medical and mental health professionals, \n        law enforcement officers, forensic interviewers, and other \n        professionals who work directly with maltreated children, are \n        inadequately prepared through undergraduate and graduate \n        programs to recognize and respond to cases of child \n        maltreatment.\n            (2) Studies indicate that individuals mandated to report \n        child maltreatment often fail to recognize instances of \n        maltreatment, and that such failure to recognize maltreatment \n        is attributable, in part, to inadequate training in \n        undergraduate and graduate programs.\n            (3) Child protection professionals often find it difficult \n        to access quality training on investigating, or otherwise \n        responding to, cases of child maltreatment, and many programs, \n        such as forensic interview training programs, that require \n        intensive training and small class sizes could reach more \n        professionals if such programs were developed at the State, \n        rather than the national, level.\n            (4) Child protection professionals should be trained not \n        only to respond to cases of child maltreatment after such \n        maltreatment has occurred, but also to take a leadership role \n        in implementing evidence-based community prevention programs.\n            (5) The National Child Protection Training Center has taken \n        a leadership role in implementing model undergraduate and \n        graduate curricula on child abuse and neglect, in assisting \n        States in developing forensic interview training programs, and \n        in providing ongoing training, technical assistance, and \n        publications to child protection professionals. Specifically, \n        the National Child Protection Training Center has--\n                    (A) assisted the States of Arkansas, Connecticut, \n                Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, \n                Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Ohio, \n                South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia in \n                developing and sustaining forensic interview training \n                programs;\n                    (B) developed and implemented model undergraduate \n                and graduate curricula on child maltreatment in 13 \n                universities and colleges in 8 States and the District \n                of Columbia, and has worked with dozens of additional \n                universities to implement model curricula; and\n                    (C) provided training, technical assistance, and \n                other services to more than 40,000 child protection \n                professionals throughout the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
