FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Access to prescription drugs is important to all \n        Americans.\n            (2) Many low-income individuals cannot afford to purchase \n        the drugs prescribed by their doctors. Others skip doses or \n        split pills contrary to their doctor's orders because they \n        cannot afford to refill their prescriptions.\n            (3) Low-income individuals who use their limited financial \n        resources to obtain needed drugs may do so by foregoing other \n        expenditures important to their health and well-being.\n            (4) One of the objectives of the medicaid program set forth \n        in section 1901 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396) is \n        to enable each State, as far as practicable under the \n        conditions in such State, to provide medical assistance on \n        behalf of families with dependent children and of aged, blind, \n        or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are \n        insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.\n            (5) As part of carrying out this objective, every State has \n        elected the option of providing prescription drugs as a benefit \n        under the medicaid program, thereby providing an important \n        means of increasing the access of low-income individuals to \n        drugs prescribed by their doctors.\n            (6) Section 1115 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n        1315) provides the Secretary of Health and Human Services with \n        broad authority to--\n                    (A) approve any experimental, pilot, or \n                demonstration project which, in the judgment of the \n                Secretary, is likely to assist in promoting the \n                objectives of the medicaid program; and\n                    (B) waive compliance with any of the State plan \n                requirements of the medicaid program under section 1902 \n                of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a), including \n                paragraphs (14) (relating to limitations on cost \n                sharing under section 1916 of that Act (42 U.S.C. \n                1396o)) and (54) (relating to applicable requirements \n                of section 1927 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8)), in \n                order to conduct such a project.\n            (7) Medicaid demonstration projects help promote the \n        objectives of the medicaid program, including obtaining \n        information about options for increasing access to prescription \n        drugs for low-income individuals.\n            (8) Both Maine and Vermont have, with the approval of the \n        Secretary of Health and Human Resources, implemented \n        demonstration projects to expand access to prescription drugs \n        under the medicaid program. Thousands of individuals with no \n        other prescription drug insurance benefits are enrolled in \n        those programs.\n            (9) Terminating medicaid demonstration projects prior to \n        their planned expiration dates may result in a significant \n        waste of public funds and may be detrimental to those \n        individuals who have come to rely on such projects.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF SECRETARIAL AUTHORITY WITH RESPECT TO \n              TREATMENT OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS MADE IN AN APPROVED \n              DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1115 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1315) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to \nany experimental, pilot, or demonstration project conducted by a State \nthat was approved by the Secretary under subsection (a) prior to \nJanuary 31, 2001, and that waives compliance with, or makes \ninapplicable, certain requirements of section 1902 for the purposes of \nestablishing an outpatient prescription drug program for residents of \nthe State who are not otherwise eligible for medical assistance under \ntitle XIX--\n            ``(1) any expenditures, payments, or outlays by the State \n        for covered outpatient drugs under the project shall be treated \n        as payments made under the State plan under title XIX for \n        covered outpatient drugs defined in section 1927(k)(2) for \n        purposes of a rebate agreement under section 1927, regardless \n        of whether such expenditures, payments, or outlays of the State \n        are offset or reimbursed, in whole or in part, by rebates \n        received under such an agreement;\n            ``(2) any such expenditures, payments, or outlays by the \n        State are consistent with the objectives of the medicaid \n        program set forth in section 1901;\n            ``(3) any such expenditures, payments, or outlays by the \n        State shall be considered amounts expended for medical \n        assistance in the form of prescribed drugs, as defined in \n        section 1905(a)(12), under the State plan under title XIX; and\n            ``(4) the requirements of section 1916 shall not apply with \n        respect to any enrollment fees, premiums, deductions, \n        copayments, cost sharing, or similar charges imposed upon \n        individuals participating in such project.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) takes \neffect on the date of enactment of this Act and applies to State \nexpenditures, payments, or outlays under an experimental, pilot, or \ndemonstration project described in section 1115(g) of the Social \nSecurity Act (as added by subsection (a)) made before, on, or after \nsuch date."
