FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) inefficiency and ineffectiveness in Federal programs \n        undermines the confidence of the American people in the \n        Government and reduces the Federal Government's ability to \n        adequately address vital public needs;\n            (2) insufficient information on program performance \n        seriously disadvantages Federal managers in their efforts to \n        improve program efficiency and effectiveness;\n            (3) congressional policy making, spending decisions, and \n        program oversight are handicapped by insufficient attention to \n        program performance and results;\n            (4) programs performing similar or duplicative functions \n        that exist within a single agency or across multiple agencies \n        should be identified and their performance and results shared \n        among all such programs to improve their performance and \n        results;\n            (5) advocates of good government continue to seek ways to \n        improve accountability, focus on results, and integrate the \n        performance of programs with decisions about budgets;\n            (6) with the passage of the Government Performance and \n        Results Act of 1993, the Congress directed the executive branch \n        to seek improvements in the effectiveness, efficiency, and \n        accountability of Federal programs by having agencies focus on \n        program results; and\n            (7) the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n        provided a strong framework for the executive branch to monitor \n        the long-term goals and annual performance of its departments \n        and agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to improve the Government Performance and Results Act \n        of 1993 by implementing a program assessment and evaluation \n        process that attempts to determine the strengths and weaknesses \n        of Federal programs with a particular focus on the results \n        produced by individual programs;\n            (2) to use the information gathered in the assessment and \n        evaluation process to build on the groundwork laid in the \n        Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 to help the \n        executive branch make informed management decisions and \n        evidence-based funding requests aimed at achieving positive \n        results; and\n            (3) to provide congressional policy makers the information \n        needed to conduct more effective oversight, to make better-\n        informed authorization decisions, and to make more evidence-\n        based spending decisions that achieve positive results for the \n        American people.\n\nSEC. 4.
