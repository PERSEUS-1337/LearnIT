FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (``HHT'') is a \n        largely undiagnosed or misdiagnosed vascular genetic bleeding \n        disorder that causes abnormalities of the blood vessels. A \n        person with HHT has the tendency to form blood vessels that \n        lack the capillaries between an artery and vein. HHT can cause \n        spontaneous hemorrhage or stroke when brain or lung \n        arteriovenous malformations, which are tangled blood vessels, \n        rupture unexpectedly in all age groups. In addition to \n        hemorrhagic stroke, embolic stroke, and brain abscess occur in \n        approximately 30 percent of individuals with HHT caused by \n        artery-vein malformations in the lung (due to lack of \n        capillaries between the arterial and venous systems which \n        prevent or normally filter out clots and bacteria), causing \n        disability and sudden premature death.\n            (2) One in 5,000 American children and adults suffer from \n        HHT.\n            (3) Studies have found an increase in morbidity and \n        mortality rate for individuals who suffer from HHT.\n            (4) Due to the widespread lack of knowledge, accurate \n        diagnosis, and appropriate intervention, 90 percent of HHT-\n        affected families are at risk for preventable life-threatening \n        and disabling medical incidents such as stroke.\n            (5) Early detection, screening, and treatment can prevent \n        premature deaths, spontaneous hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, \n        embolic stroke, brain abscess, and other long-term health care \n        complications resulting from HHT.\n            (6) HHT is an important health condition with serious \n        health consequences which are amenable to early identification \n        and diagnosis with suitable tests, and acceptable and available \n        treatments in established treatment centers.\n            (7) Timely identification and management of HHT cases is an \n        important public health objective because it will save lives, \n        prevent disability, and reduce direct and indirect health care \n        costs expenditures.\n            (8) Without a new program for early detection, screening, \n        and treatment, 14,000 children and adults who suffer from HHT \n        in the population today will suffer premature death and \n        disability.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to create a federally led and financed \ninitiative for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of hereditary \nhemorrhagic telangiectasia that will result in the reduction of the \nsuffering of families, prevent premature death and disability, and \nlower health care costs through proven treatment interventions.\n\nSEC. 4.
