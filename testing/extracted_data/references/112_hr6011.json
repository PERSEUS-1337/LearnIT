In the case of such an initial \nsurvey of a renal dialysis facility, the Secretary may allow any State \nto waive the reimbursement for conducting the survey under this section \nif it requests such a waiver.\n    ``(2) In the case of a renal dialysis facility that has waited for \nmore than 6 months to receive the results of an initial survey under \nthis section, the Secretary shall establish a specific timetable for \ncompleting and reporting the results of the survey.''; and\n            (3) in subsection (f), as so redesignated--\n                    (A) by striking ``Notwithstanding any other \n                provision of law,'' and inserting ``(1) Notwithstanding \n                any other provision of law and except as provided in \n                paragraph (2)''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(2) The Secretary may assess and collect fees for the initial \nMedicare survey from a renal dialysis facility subject to the \nrequirements of section 1881(b) in an amount not to exceed a reasonable \nfee necessary to cover the costs of initial surveys conducted for \npurposes of determining the compliance of a renal dialysis facility \nwith the requirements of section 1881(b). Fees may be assessed and \ncollected under this paragraph only in such manner as would result in \nan aggregate amount of fees collected during any fiscal year being \nequal to the aggregate amount of costs for such fiscal year for initial \nsurveys of such facilities under this section. A renal dialysis \nfacility's liability for such fees shall be reasonably based on the \nproportion of the survey costs which relate to such facility. Any funds \ncollected under this paragraph shall be used only to conduct the \ninitial survey of the facilities providing the fees.\n    ``(3) Fees authorized under paragraph (2) shall be collected by the \nSecretary and available only to the extent and in the amount provided \nin advance in appropriations Acts and upon request of the Secretary, \nsubject to the amount and usage limitations of such paragraph.
