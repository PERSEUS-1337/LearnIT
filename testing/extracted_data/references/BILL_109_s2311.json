FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The population of the United States is aging in greater \n        numbers than ever before in the Nation's history.\n            (2) Dignified and sustainable mobility is essential for the \n        health, safety, and quality of life of older individuals, their \n        families, their communities, and the Nation.\n            (3) Older individuals who rely on the private automobile \n        for transportation need an acceptable alternative to driving so \n        they may safely transition from driving without unduly \n        compromising their independence, quality of life, and activity \n        in the community.\n            (4) Many older individuals have special, age-related \n        conditions, such as dementia and frailty, that special \n        transportation alternatives must effectively address.\n            (5) Many older individuals live in rural and suburban areas \n        that lack the density for traditional mass transit, and more \n        than half of all people age 65 or older live in communities \n        with no public transportation.\n            (6) The cost of addressing the transportation needs of \n        older individuals is outstripping the public resources \n        available, and that cost will only increase in the next 30 \n        years as the Nation's population ages.\n            (7) Programs that provide increased mobility for older \n        individuals will promote economic growth and development by \n        moderating health care expenses, supporting family caregivers, \n        promoting volunteerism, fostering civic engagement, and \n        enriching community well-being through the participation of the \n        Nation's most experienced citizens.\n            (8) Models exist by which private nonprofit organizations \n        can provide economically sustainable, consumer-oriented senior \n        transportation alternatives, that address the transportation \n        needs of older individuals.\n            (9) Those models can be used to supplement, but not \n        displace, public transportation, and can also be successfully \n        replicated in communities where public transportation is \n        unavailable.\n            (10) It is appropriate for the Federal Government to \n        accelerate the availability of transportation alternatives for \n        older individuals through those models, and to test the \n        viability of constructing a nationwide network based on them.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a demonstration project to \ndevelop a national network of economically sustainable transportation \nproviders and qualified transportation providers, to provide \ntransportation services to older individuals, and individuals who are \nblind, in urban, suburban, and rural settings.\n\nSEC. 4.
