FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) commercial and scientific uses of nuclear energy offer \n        the potential both to serve and to destroy mankind;\n            (2) the International Atomic Energy Agency has served the \n        world community for almost 35 years in implementing safeguards \n        against the military uses of civilian nuclear facilities;\n            (3) the IAEA has served and continues to serve important \n        United States interests in ensuring the peaceful uses of \n        nuclear energy and in reducing the risk of nuclear weapons \n        proliferation;\n            (4) IAEA safeguards remain essential elements of United \n        States domestic legislation and international treaty \n        commitments which are intended to halt the global spread of \n        nuclear weapons;\n            (5) the ability of the IAEA to secure the peaceful uses of \n        nuclear energy will depend upon its ability to adapt to \n        changing political and technological conditions;\n            (6) the ability of the IAEA to achieve its safeguards \n        objectives is jeopardized by nations that pursue nuclear \n        weapons options in violation of their nuclear nonproliferation \n        treaty commitments;\n            (7) the ability of the IAEA to achieve its safeguards \n        objectives is further challenged by the persistent efforts by \n        some nations to make large-scale commercial uses of weapons-\n        grade nuclear material;\n            (8) in recent years, the IAEA has taken on significant new \n        safeguards responsibilities, including inspection activities in \n        Iraq, North Korea, South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina and the \n        implementation of safeguards on bulk-scale reprocessing \n        facilities;\n            (9) these safeguards responsibilities are growing while the \n        IAEA's budget and manpower resources have remained virtually \n        constant and even declined in some years;\n            (10) Iraq's technological advancement toward developing a \n        nuclear weapons capability underscores the need for reforms in \n        the implementation of IAEA safeguards; and\n            (11) the United States and other member states of the IAEA \n        must give the IAEA adequate political, technical, and financial \n        support if it is to implement these reforms successfully.\n\nSEC. 3. PROGRAMS TO REFORM INTERNATIONAL NONPROLIFERATION SAFEGUARDS.\n\n    (a) Additional Assistance to IAEA.--Subject to the limitations and \nrequirements provided in this Act, the Secretary of State, under the \nguidance of the President, shall, during fiscal year 1994 and fiscal \nyear 1995, provide to the IAEA, in addition to the United States annual \nassessed contribution to the IAEA, assistance for the purposes set \nforth in subsection (b).\n    (b) Purposes of Assistance.--The purposes for which assistance \nunder subsection (a) shall be provided are limited to--\n            (1) the implementation by the IAEA of reforms to strengthen \n        the effectiveness of IAEA safeguards; and\n            (2) contributions to the Technical Assistance and \n        Cooperation Fund of the IAEA.\n    (c) Restrictions.--Assistance authorized by subsection (a) for the \npurpose set forth in subsection (b)(2) may be provided only if the \nPresident certifies to the Congress that the IAEA is taking steps to \nimplement reforms to improve the effectiveness of IAEA safeguards, \nincluding, but not limited to, those described in subsection (d).\n    (d) Reforms in IAEA Safeguards.--The President shall direct the \nUnited States representatives to the IAEA to work toward the early \nadoption of reforms in the implementation of the safeguards \nresponsibilities of the IAEA, including the following reforms:\n            (1) Improving the access of the IAEA within any non-\n        nuclear-weapon state to nuclear facilities, whether or not \n        declared by that state, that are capable of producing, \n        processing, or fabricating special fissionable material \n        suitable for use in a nuclear explosive device.\n            (2) Increasing the transparency of international nuclear \n        commerce.\n            (3) Examining the feasibility of increasing the scope of \n        safeguards to include all activities and facilities which could \n        significantly contribute to the acquisition or production of \n        nuclear explosive devices.\n            (4) Improving the access of the IAEA to information about \n        the nuclear activities of member states of the IAEA.\n            (5) Examining the practicality and advisability of the IAEA \n        conducting less frequent inspections at nuclear facilities in \n        member states which--\n                    (A) provide advance consent for the IAEA to conduct \n                unrestricted, short notice inspections of any facility, \n                whether or not declared by the state;\n                    (B) accept IAEA safeguards for the construction of \n                new facilities or the modification of existing \n                facilities which fall under the scope of IAEA \n                safeguards; and\n                    (C) accept any inspectors of the IAEA who are \n                approved by the Board of Governors of the IAEA, agree \n                not to limit the number of such inspectors, and waive \n                visa requirements for such inspectors.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF FUNDING.\n\n    In addition to amounts otherwise made available for the IAEA, there \nare authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and \n$10,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, to the Department of State to carry \nout section 3(a), of which not more than $5,000,000 in each such fiscal \nyear may be made available for the purpose set forth in section \n3(b)(2).\n\nSEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n    (a) Report to Congress.--The President shall, in the report \nrequired by section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of \n1978, describe--\n            (1) the steps he has taken and plans to take to implement \n        each of the objectives set forth in section 3(d);\n            (2) the progress that has been made and the obstacles that \n        have been encountered in seeking to meet the objectives set \n        forth in section 3(d);\n            (3) any other steps he has taken or plans to take to \n        strengthen the implementation of IAEA safeguards;\n            (4) the steps the IAEA has taken to implement each of the \n        objectives set forth in section 3(d); and\n            (5) any other steps the IAEA has taken to strengthen the \n        implementation of IAEA safeguards.\n    (b) Report on Funding.--Within one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the Congress a \nreport assessing what additional funds are required for the IAEA to \nimplement the objectives set forth in section 3(d) and what funds the \nUnited States plans to contribute to the IAEA over the next 5 fiscal \nyears.\n\nSEC. 6.
