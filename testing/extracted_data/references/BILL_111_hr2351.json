TEMPORARY CORPORATE CREDIT UNION STABILIZATION FUND.\n\n    ``(a) Establishment of Stabilization Fund.--There is hereby created \nin the Treasury of the United States a fund to be known as the \n`Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund' (and referred to \nhereafter in this section as the `Stabilization Fund') to be \nadministered by the Board as prescribed by section 209.\n    ``(b) Expenditures From Stabilization Fund.--Money in the \nStabilization Fund shall be available upon requisition by the Board, \nwithout fiscal year limitation, for making payments for the purposes \ndescribed in section 203(a), subject to the following additional \nlimitations:\n            ``(1) All payments other than administrative payments shall \n        be connected to the conservatorship, liquidation, or threatened \n        conservatorship or liquidation of a corporate credit union.\n            ``(2) Prior to authorizing each payment, the Board shall--\n                    ``(A) certify that, absent the existence of the \n                Stabilization Fund, the Board would have made the \n                identical payment out of the National Credit Union \n                Share Insurance Fund; and\n                    ``(B) report each such certification to the \n                Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the \n                Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the \n                House of Representatives.\n    ``(c) Authority To Borrow.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Stabilization Fund is authorized to \n        borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury from time-to-time as \n        deemed necessary by the Board. The maximum outstanding amount \n        of all borrowings from the Treasury by the Stabilization Fund \n        and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, combined, \n        is limited to the amount provided for in section 203(d)(1), \n        including any authorized increases in that amount.\n            ``(2) Repayment of advances.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The advances made under this \n                section shall be repaid by the Stabilization Fund, and \n                interest on such advances shall be paid, to the General \n                Fund of the Treasury.\n                    ``(B) Variable rate of interest.--The Secretary of \n                the Treasury shall make the first rate determination at \n                the time of the first advance under this section and \n                shall reset the rate again for all advances on each \n                anniversary of the first advance. The interest rate \n                shall be equal to the average market yield on \n                outstanding marketable obligations of the United States \n                with remaining periods to maturity equal to 12 months.\n            ``(3) Repayment schedule.--The Stabilization Fund shall \n        repay the advances on a first-in, first-out basis, with \n        interest on the amount repaid, at times and dates determined by \n        the Board at its discretion. All advances shall be repaid not \n        later than the date of the seventh anniversary of the first \n        advance to the Stabilization Fund, unless the Board extends \n        this final repayment date. The Board shall obtain the \n        concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury on any proposed \n        extension, including the terms and conditions of the extended \n        repayment.\n    ``(d) Assessment To Repay Advances.--At least 90 days prior to each \nrepayment described in subsection (c)(3), the Board shall set the \namount of the upcoming repayment and determine if the Stabilization \nFund will have sufficient funds to make the repayment. If the \nStabilization Fund might not have sufficient funds to make the \nrepayment, the Board shall assess each federally insured credit union a \nspecial premium due and payable within 60 days in an aggregate amount \ncalculated to ensure the Stabilization Fund is able to make the \nrepayment. The premium charge for each credit union shall be stated as \na percentage of its insured shares as represented on the credit union's \nprevious call report. The percentage shall be identical for each credit \nunion. Any credit union that fails to make timely payment of the \nspecial premium is subject to the procedures and penalties described \nunder subsections (d), (e), and (f) of section 202.\n    ``(e) Distributions From Insurance Fund.--At the end of any \ncalendar year in which the Stabilization Fund has an outstanding \nadvance from the Treasury, the Insurance Fund is prohibited from making \nthe distribution to insured credit unions described in section \n202(c)(3). In lieu of the distribution described in that section, the \nInsurance Fund shall make a distribution to the Stabilization Fund of \nthe maximum amount possible that does not reduce the Insurance Fund's \nequity ratio below the normal operating level and does not reduce the \nInsurance Fund's available assets ratio below 1.0 percent.\n    ``(f) Investment of Stabilization Fund Assets.--The Board may \nrequest the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the \nStabilization Fund as is not, in the Board's judgment, required to meet \nthe current needs of the Stabilization Fund. Such investments shall be \nmade by the Secretary of the Treasury in public debt securities, with \nmaturities suitable to the needs of the Stabilization Fund, as \ndetermined by the Board, and bearing interest at a rate determined by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current market \nyields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of \ncomparable maturity.\n    ``(g) Reports.--The Board shall submit an annual report to Congress \non the financial condition and the results of the operation of the \nStabilization Fund. The report is due to Congress within 30 days after \neach anniversary of the first advance made under subsection (c)(1). \nBecause the Stabilization Fund will use advances from the Treasury to \nmeet corporate stabilization costs with full repayment of borrowings to \nTreasury at the Board's discretion not due until 7 years from the \ninitial advance, to the extent operating expenses of the Stabilization \nFund exceed income, the financial condition of the Stabilization Fund \nmay reflect a deficit. With planned and required future repayments, the \nBoard shall resolve all deficits prior to termination of the \nStabilization Fund.\n    ``(h) Closing of the Stabilization Fund.--Within 90 days following \nthe seventh anniversary of the initial Stabilization Fund advance, or \nearlier at the Board's discretion, the Board shall distribute any \nfunds, property, or other assets remaining in the Stabilization Fund to \nthe Insurance Fund and shall close the Stabilization Fund. If the Board \nextends the final repayment date as permitted under subsection (c)(3), \nthe mandatory date for closing the Stabilization Fund shall be extended \nby the same number of days.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 202(c)(3)(A) of the Federal \nCredit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(c)(3)(A)) is amended by inserting ``, \nsubject to the requirements of section 217(e),'' after ``The Board \nshall''."
