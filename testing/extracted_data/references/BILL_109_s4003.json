FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is in the national interest to make greater use of \n        ethanol in transportation fuels;\n            (2) ethanol is a clean, renewable fuel that provides public \n        health benefits in the form of reduced emissions, including \n        reduced greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change;\n            (3) ethanol use provides economic gains to agricultural \n        producers, biofuels producers, and rural areas;\n            (4) ethanol use benefits the national security of the \n        United States by displacing the use of petroleum, much of which \n        is imported from foreign countries that are hostile to the \n        United States;\n            (5) ethanol can reduce prices at the pump for motoring \n        consumers by extending fuel supplies and due to the competitive \n        cost of ethanol relative to conventional gasoline;\n            (6) ethanol faces shipping challenges in pipelines that \n        transport other liquid transportation fuels;\n            (7) currently ethanol is efficiently shipped by rail tanker \n        cars, barges, and trucks, all of which could, as ethanol \n        production expands, encounter capacity limits due to competing \n        use demands for the rail tanker cars, barges, and trucks;\n            (8) as the United States ethanol market expands in the \n        coming years there is likely to be a need for dedicated ethanol \n        pipelines to transport ethanol from the Midwest, where ethanol \n        generally is produced, to the Eastern and Western United \n        States;\n            (9) as of the date of enactment of this Act, dedicated \n        ethanol pipelines do not exist in the United States and will be \n        challenging to construct, at least initially;\n            (10) Brazil has already shown that ethanol can be shipped \n        effectively via pipeline; and\n            (11) having an ethanol pipeline study completed in the very \n        near term is important because the construction of 1 or more \n        dedicated ethanol pipelines would take at least several years \n        to complete.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SECRETARY.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Energy.\n\nSEC. 4. FEASIBILITY STUDIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary \nof Agriculture and the Secretary of Transportation, shall spend up to \n$1,000,000 to fund feasibility studies for the construction of \ndedicated ethanol pipelines.\n    (b) Conduct of Studies.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall--\n                    (A) through a competitive solicitation process, \n                select 1 or more firms having capabilities in the \n                planning, development, and construction of dedicated \n                ethanol pipelines to carry out the feasibility studies \n                described in subsection (a); or\n                    (B) carry out the feasibility studies in \n                conjunction with such firms.\n            (2) Timing.--\n                    (A) In general.--If the Secretary elects to select \n                1 or more firms under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary \n                shall award funding under this section not later than \n                120 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                    (B) Studies.--As a condition of receiving funds \n                under this section, a recipient of funding shall agree \n                to submit to the Secretary a completed feasibility \n                study not later than 360 days after the date of \n                enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Study Factors.--Feasibility studies funded under this Act shall \ninclude consideration of--\n            (1) existing or potential barriers to dedicated ethanol \n        pipelines, including technical, siting, financing, and \n        regulatory barriers;\n            (2) market risk, including throughput risk, and ways of \n        mitigating the risk;\n            (3) regulatory, financing, and siting options that would \n        mitigate risk in these areas and help ensure the construction \n        of 1 or more dedicated ethanol pipelines;\n            (4) financial incentives that may be necessary for the \n        construction of dedicated ethanol pipelines, including the \n        return on equity that sponsors of the first dedicated ethanol \n        pipelines will require to invest in the pipelines;\n            (5) ethanol production of 20,000,000,000, 30,000,000,000, \n        and 40,000,000,000 gallons per year by 2020; and\n            (6) such other factors that the Secretary considers to be \n        appropriate.\n    (d) Confidentiality.--If a recipient of funding under this section \nrequests confidential treatment for critical energy infrastructure \ninformation or commercially-sensitive data contained in a feasibility \nstudy submitted by the recipient under subsection (b)(2)(B), the \nSecretary shall offer to enter into a confidentiality agreement with \nthe recipient to maintain the confidentiality of the submitted \ninformation.\n    (e) Review; Report.--The Secretary shall--\n            (1) review the feasibility studies submitted under \n        subsection (b)(2)(B) or carried out under subsection (b)(1)(B); \n        and\n            (2) not later than 15 months after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, submit to Congress a report that includes--\n                    (A) information about the potential benefits of \n                constructing 1 or more dedicated ethanol pipelines; and\n                    (B) recommendations for legislation that could help \n                provide for the construction of dedicated ethanol \n                pipelines.\n\nSEC. 5. FUNDING.\n\n    There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry \nout this Act $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, to remain available until \nexpended."
