FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has enhanced and accelerated its \n        efforts to resettle Iraqi refugees since 2007.\n            (2) Resettlement in the United States remains an important \n        option for Iraqi refugees, many of whom are living in Syria and \n        Jordan and lack legal status or access to health care.\n            (3) Many of these refugees are victims of torture and \n        persecution, or were forced to flee because of support they \n        gave to American military operations.\n            (4) Refugees are often a product of human rights atrocities \n        and war, making them likely to have suffered traumatic events \n        which require the United States to offer them protection and \n        meet their needs once they arrive here.\n            (5) In fiscal year 2008, 13,822 Iraqi refugees were \n        resettled in the United States, and nearly 17,000 were \n        resettled in fiscal year 2009.\n            (6) Upon arrival in the United States, there is authorized \n        36 months of cash and medical assistance available to refugees, \n        as well as access to social services, such as job placement, \n        from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, but in practice \n        refugees receive only 8 months of cash and medical assistance.\n            (7) When given adequate support through the resettlement \n        system, refugees can successfully become self-sufficient and \n        contribute positively to their communities.\n            (8) Like millions of Americans, refugees are negatively \n        impacted by the recession, and a recent report by the \n        Georgetown Law Center indicated that in some areas as few as 10 \n        percent of refugees have obtained employment at the end of the \n        8-month benefit period.\n            (9) State refugee offices and voluntary agencies lack the \n        resources and data to increase staffing levels to accommodate \n        the large number of refugees in need of services.\n            (10) ORR funding formulas are retroactive in nature, using \n        refugee admission data from the prior 3 years, so that large \n        increases in refugee admissions are not adequately reflected in \n        the amount of resources provided by ORR.\n            (11) The United States resettlement policy assumes refugees \n        will be able to quickly become self-sufficient, while \n        specifically offering resettlement to individuals who have \n        specific vulnerabilities that inhibit their ability to achieve \n        self-sufficiency and integrate into society.\n            (12) Some refugees will have mental health difficulties \n        associated with trauma or torture and this is one of the \n        significant barriers to self-sufficiency and integration into a \n        community when it is not addressed with adequate and \n        appropriate services.\n            (13) Secondary migration is not properly tracked, and \n        resources are not available for States and agencies \n        experiencing high levels of secondary migration.\n            (14) Refugee services are provided by national resettlement \n        agencies, community-based organizations, charities, and \n        nonprofits and coordinated locally by State refugee programs, \n        and all the organizations should be supported in their mission \n        to provide refugee services.\n\nSEC. 3.
