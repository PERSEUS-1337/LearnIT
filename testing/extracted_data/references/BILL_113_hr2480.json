SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse and Health \nCare Worker Protection Act of 2013''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2011, registered nurses ranked fifth among all \n        occupations for the number of cases of musculoskeletal \n        disorders resulting in days away from work, with 11,880 total \n        cases. In 2011, nursing assistants reported 25,010 cases--the \n        highest of all occupations. The leading cause of these health \n        care employees' injuries is patient lifting, transferring, and \n        repositioning injuries, which constitute a significant risk to \n        the health and welfare of those employees.\n            (2) The physical demands of the nursing profession lead \n        many nurses to leave the profession. Fifty-two percent of \n        nurses complain of chronic back pain and 38 percent suffer from \n        pain severe enough to require leave from work. Many nurses and \n        other health care workers suffering back injury do not return \n        to work. These consequences constitute a material impairment of \n        health for these employees.\n            (3) Patients are not at optimum levels of safety while \n        being lifted, transferred, or repositioned manually. Mechanical \n        and other appropriate lift programs can substantially reduce \n        skin tears and pressure ulcers suffered by patients and the \n        frequency of patients being dropped, thus allowing patients a \n        safer means to progress through their care.\n            (4) The development of assistive patient handling \n        technology, equipment, and devices has essentially rendered the \n        act of strict manual patient handling outdated and typically \n        unnecessary as a function of nursing care.\n            (5) A growing number of health care facilities that have \n        incorporated patient handling technology and practices have \n        reported positive results. Injuries among nursing staff and \n        health care workers have dramatically declined at health care \n        facilities implementing safe patient handling technology, \n        equipment, devices, and practices. As a result, the number of \n        lost work days due to injury and staff turnover has declined. \n        Studies have also shown that assistive patient handling \n        technology successfully reduces workers' compensation costs for \n        musculoskeletal disorders.\n            (6) A number of States have implemented safe patient \n        handling, mobility and injury prevention standards. The success \n        of these programs at the facility and State level demonstrates \n        the feasibility of such standards.\n            (7) Establishing a safe patient handling, mobility, and \n        injury prevention standard for direct-care registered nurses \n        and other health care workers is a critical component \n        reasonably necessary for protecting the health and safety of \n        nurses and other health care workers, addressing the nursing \n        shortage, and increasing patient safety.\n    (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; findings; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention \n                            standard.\nSec. 3.

Nonpreemption.\nSec. 5. Definitions.\n\nSEC. 2. SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION \n              STANDARD.\n\n    (a) Rulemaking.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, not \nlater than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary of Labor shall, pursuant to section 6 of the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655), promulgate an interim \nfinal standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury \nprevention (in this section such standard is referred to as the ``safe \npatient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard'') to \nprevent musculoskeletal disorders for direct-care registered nurses and \nall other health care workers handling patients. A final safe patient \nhandling, mobility, and injury prevention standard shall be promulgated \nnot later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Requirements.--The safe patient handling, mobility, and injury \nprevention standard shall require the use of engineering and safety \ncontrols to perform handling of patients and the elimination of \ninjuries from manual handling of patients by direct-care registered \nnurses and all other health care workers, through the development of a \ncomprehensive program, to include the use of mechanical technology and \ndevices to the greatest degree feasible. Where the use of mechanical \ntechnology and devices is not feasible, the standards shall require the \nuse of alternative controls and measures, including trained, designated \nlift teams, to minimize the risk of injury to nurses and health care \nworkers resulting from the manual handling of patients. The standard \nshall apply to all health care employers, shall generally align with \ninterprofessional national safe patient handling, mobility, and injury \nprevention standards, and shall include the following:\n            (1) Program development.--A requirement that each health \n        care employer shall develop and implement a safe patient \n        handling, mobility, and injury prevention program within 6 \n        months of the date of promulgation of the final standard, which \n        program shall include hazard identification, risk assessments, \n        and control measures in relation to patient care duties and \n        patient handling.\n            (2) Technology and equipment purchase and management.--A \n        requirement that, within 2 years of the date of promulgation of \n        the final standard, each health care employer shall purchase, \n        use, maintain, and make accessible to health care workers, such \n        safe patient handling equipment, technology, and accessories as \n        the Secretary determines appropriate.\n            (3) Health care worker participation.--A requirement that \n        each health care employer shall obtain input from health care \n        workers, to include direct care registered nurses, health care \n        workers, their representatives, and their collective bargaining \n        agents, in developing and implementing the safe patient \n        handling, mobility, and injury prevention program, including \n        the purchase of technology and equipment and necessary \n        accessories.\n            (4) Data tracking and review.--A requirement that each \n        health care employer shall establish a review program to \n        analyze data relevant to the implementation of the employers' \n        safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program, \n        and shall account for circumstances where safe patient handling \n        technology and equipment, or trained, designated lift teams, \n        were not utilized in accordance with the health care employers \n        safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention \n        standard. Each health care employer shall upon request, make \n        available their findings and data used in such review, to \n        health care workers, their representatives, their collective \n        bargaining agents, and the Secretary or other Federal agency.\n            (5) Incorporation of technology into facilities.--A \n        requirement that each health care employer shall consider the \n        feasibility of incorporating safe patient handling technology \n        as part of process of new facility design and construction, or \n        facility remodeling.\n            (6) Education and training.--A requirement that each health \n        care employer shall train health care workers on safe patient \n        handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, \n        equipment, and devices, initially, and on a continuing annual \n        basis, and as necessary. Such training shall prepare health \n        care workers, including designated lift teams, to identify, \n        assess, and control musculoskeletal hazards of a general \n        nature, and those specific to particular patient care areas, \n        and shall be conducted by an individual with knowledge in the \n        subject matter, and delivered, at least in part, in an \n        interactive simulated point-of-care training and hands-on \n        format that reflects the specific demands of a health care \n        workers' duties.\n            (7) Notice of safe patient handling and rights under this \n        act.--A requirement that each health care employer shall post a \n        uniform notice in a form specified by the Secretary that--\n                    (A) explains the safe patient handling, mobility, \n                and injury prevention standard;\n                    (B) includes information regarding safe patient \n                handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies and \n                training;\n                    (C) explains procedures to report patient handling-\n                related injuries; and\n                    (D) explains health care workers' rights under this \n                Act.\n            (8) Annual evaluation.--A requirement that each health care \n        employer shall conduct an annual written evaluation of the \n        implementation of the safe patient handling, mobility, and \n        injury prevention program, including handling procedures, \n        selection of technology, equipment, and engineering controls, \n        assessment of injuries, and new safe patient handling, \n        mobility, and injury prevention technology and devices that \n        have been developed. The evaluation shall be conducted with the \n        involvement of nurses, other health care workers, their \n        representatives, and their collective bargaining agents, and \n        their input shall be documented in the evaluation. Health care \n        employers shall take corrective action as recommended in the \n        written evaluation.\n            (9) Right to refuse unsafe assignment.--A requirement that \n        each health care employer shall provide procedures under which \n        a health care worker or employee may refuse to perform the \n        employee's duties if the employee has a reasonable apprehension \n        that performing such duties would violate the safe patient \n        handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard, and would \n        result in injury or impairment of health to the health care \n        worker, other health care workers, or patients. Where \n        practicable, the health care worker must have communicated the \n        health or safety concern to the health care employer and have \n        not been able to obtain a correction of the violation.\n    (c) Inspections.--The Secretary of Labor shall conduct unscheduled \ninspections under section 8 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act \nof 1970 (29 U.S.C. 657) to ensure implementation of and compliance with \nthe safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard.\n\nSEC. 3.
