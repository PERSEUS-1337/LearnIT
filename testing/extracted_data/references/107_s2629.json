PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION POLICIES OF FEDERAL AGENCIES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Privacy \nand Data Protection Policy Act of 2002''.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this Act, the term ``agency'' has the meaning \ngiven that term under section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code.\n    (c) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) in the wake of the attacks on the United States on \n        September 11, 2001, Federal agencies are collecting an \n        increasing amount of personal information from and on \n        individuals as part of the expanded war on terrorism;\n            (2) the worthwhile goals of those data collection \n        initiatives are to help ensure homeland security and protect \n        the people of the United States from future acts of terrorism;\n            (3) protecting homeland security and fighting terrorism \n        requires not only seeking to protect lives and property in the \n        United States, but also ensuring that individual rights and \n        essential liberties are safeguarded;\n            (4) in order to achieve these goals, it is essential that \n        agencies properly manage, maintain, and secure personal \n        information on people in the United States from inappropriate \n        use, disclosure, or dissemination to third parties;\n            (5) because of the leading role of the Federal Government \n        in the expanded war on terrorism, the Federal Government should \n        serve as a role model for State and local government, and the \n        private sector, by establishing effective safeguards and \n        procedures to protect personal data of people in the United \n        States;\n            (6) in order to ensure that people in the United States \n        understand and have confidence in the proper use and safety of \n        personal information, it is essential for agencies to implement \n        effective privacy policies and procedures and to state those \n        privacy policies, both online and offline; and\n            (7) an essential part of ensuring that the people in the \n        United States have full confidence in the privacy and security \n        of personal information is to--\n                    (A) have agencies confirm adherence by those \n                agencies to the stated policies; and\n                    (B) have independent, third party review, and \n                confirmation of adherence.\n    (d) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide a framework for \nensuring effective data and privacy management by Federal agencies to--\n            (1) ensure public confidence and trust in how agencies \n        collect, maintain, and use personal information;\n            (2) ensure continued adherence to data protection and \n        privacy policies and procedures;\n            (3) ensure that individual rights and essential liberties \n        are protected; and\n            (4) provide for effective oversight of the collection and \n        use of individual information.\n    (e) Privacy Manager.--\n            (1) In general.--Each agency shall designate an employee of \n        that agency as the agency privacy manager to--\n                    (A) be responsible for effective data protection \n                and management within that agency; and\n                    (B) ensure compliance with the privacy and data \n                security policies.\n            (2) Additional responsibilities.--Each privacy manager \n        shall be responsible for--\n                    (A) training and education for employees to promote \n                awareness of and compliance with the privacy and data \n                security policies; and\n                    (B) developing recommended practices and procedures \n                to ensure compliance with the privacy and data security \n                policies.\n    (f) Benchmark Assessment.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, each agency shall conduct a detailed \n        benchmark assessment of the privacy and data protection \n        policies and practices of that agency with regard to the \n        collection, use, sharing, disclosure, transfer, and security of \n        personally identifiable information relating to the agency \n        employees and the public.
