FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States and the People's Republic of China \n        are among the world's largest economies and are among the \n        world's largest producers and consumers of goods.\n            (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n        pursued an international trade policy that violates its \n        obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization and \n        other international organizations, which has resulted in a \n        perpetual, historically high trade imbalance with the United \n        States that threatens the stability of the global economy.\n            (3) As members of both the World Trade Organization and the \n        International Monetary Fund, the People's Republic of China has \n        assumed a series of international legal obligations to \n        eliminate all subsidies for exports and to facilitate \n        international trade. The People's Republic of China has failed \n        to do so.\n            (4) The Chinese Government continues to maintain control \n        over the decisions of Chinese enterprises through ownership, \n        board membership, and coercion.\n            (5) The Chinese Government, directly and indirectly, \n        facilitates unfair requirements for coproduction agreements \n        between United States companies and Chinese entities.\n            (6) Since 1994, the People's Republic of China has \n        repeatedly intervened in currency markets and taken measures \n        that have significantly misaligned the value of its currency \n        against the United States dollar and other currencies. This \n        policy by the People's Republic of China has resulted in \n        substantial undervaluation of the renminbi by up to 40 percent \n        or more.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) a persistent trade deficit with the People's Republic \n        of China is harmful to the long-term health of the United \n        States economy and must be corrected; and\n            (2) the President should begin immediate, expedited \n        negotiations with the People's Republic of China that are \n        designed to eliminate the trade deficit within 4 years.\n\nSEC. 4.
