    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests \nLand Exchange Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since 1967, the Sugar Loaf Fire Protection District, \n        located west of Boulder, Colorado, has owned and operated two \n        fire stations on National Forest System land pursuant to \n        special use permits issued by the Forest Service.\n            (2) The Sugar Loaf Fire Protection District seeks ownership \n        of the land on which the fire stations are situated so that the \n        District can establish an area for fire fighter training, \n        install bathroom facilities in the stations, and expand the \n        stations in the future.\n            (3) The National Forest System land containing the fire \n        stations consists of approximately 5.08 acres and are of \n        limited utility for public administration, recreation, or any \n        other use since the land has been occupied by the stations for \n        30 years.\n            (4) The Sugar Loaf Fire Protection District owns a parcel \n        of non-Federal land consisting of approximately 5.17 acres that \n        the District is willing to convey to the United States in \n        exchange for the National Forest System land containing the \n        fire stations.\n            (5) The non-Federal land offered by the Sugar Loaf Fire \n        Protection District, if conveyed to the United States, is \n        suitable for addition to the Arapaho-Roosevelt National \n        Forests, will eliminate an isolated inholding in the National \n        Forests, result in administrative cost savings to the United \n        States by reducing costs of forest boundary administration, and \n        provide the United States with environmental and public \n        recreational use benefits that greatly exceed the benefits of \n        the National Forest System land containing the fire stations.\n            (6) It is in the public interest to direct, expedite, and \n        facilitate completion of a land exchange involving these \n        Federal and non-Federal lands to enable the Sugar Loaf Fire \n        Protection District to better provide fire protection services \n        for residents of the District, residents of neighboring \n        districts and persons who travel through the District on \n        Colorado Highway 119, and National Forest System land within or \n        adjacent to the District.\n\nSEC. 3.
