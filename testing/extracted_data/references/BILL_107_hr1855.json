FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Research indicates that, regardless of economic, \n        ethnic, or cultural background, parental involvement in a \n        child's education is a major factor in determining success in \n        school.\n            (2) Parental involvement in a child's education contributes \n        to such positive outcomes as improved grades and test scores, \n        higher expectations for student achievement, better school \n        attendance, improved rates of homework completion and \n        graduation from secondary schools, decreased violence and \n        substance abuse, and higher rates of graduation from and \n        enrollment in postsecondary schools.\n            (3) According to the Department of Education study entitled \n        ``Strong Families, Strong Schools'', in elementary schools \n        where parents were actively involved, the average fourth grade \n        reading scores were 17 points above the national average.\n            (4) According to the National Commission on Children, more \n        than 70 percent of students ages 10 to 13, and more than 50 \n        percent of students ages 14 to 17, would like to talk to their \n        parents more about school and schoolwork.\n            (5) Ninety-five percent of parents strongly agree that \n        parental involvement is as important a factor as quality of \n        teachers in ensuring student success in school, and 69 percent \n        of parents believe that in order to improve public schools, \n        more opportunities for parental involvement are necessary.\n            (6) Of the 800 parents questioned under the National Parent \n        Teacher Association's 1998 survey of public school parents, \n        more than half stated that low levels of parental involvement \n        and the inability of schools to keep parents informed are \n        serious problems.\n            (7) Teachers rank strengthening parental roles in their \n        children's education as an important issue that should receive \n        the highest priority in the formulation of public education \n        policy over the next few years.\n\nSEC. 3.
