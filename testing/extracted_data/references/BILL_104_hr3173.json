FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal Government has discouraged the use of non-\n        animal acute toxicity tests through regulations that mandate or \n        encourage the use of animal acute toxicity tests, or by not \n        prescribing other, less costly, more accurate and humane \n        alternatives;\n            (2) nonanimal acute toxicity tests have been developed in \n        recent years that have shown a level of reliability sufficient \n        for the reduction or replacement of animal acute toxicity tests \n        such as the Draize test for many products regulated by the \n        Federal Government;\n            (3) many manufacturers have found nonanimal acute toxicity \n        tests to be adequate for evaluating the safety of products for \n        the purposes of complying with Federal regulations or \n        guidelines;\n            (4) many manufacturers are reluctant to use nonanimal tests \n        without encouragement from the Federal Government;\n            (5) private industry and the consumer will benefit from the \n        promotion of alternative methods of testing when these \n        alternatives are as accurate in predicting human safety and \n        more humane than animal tests; and\n            (6) over the long term, nonanimal acute toxicity testing \n        will produce better data, decrease costs, and reduce the time \n        industry and the regulatory agency spend in the approval \n        process.\n    (b) Policy.--Federal departments and agencies shall encourage the \ndevelopment and use of product testing procedures that accurately \nreflect the acute health effects on humans of certain products, \nincluding consumer products and products containing hazardous or toxic \nsubstances, but which do not rely upon animals.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL ACTION.\n\n    (a) Review of Regulations, Guidelines, or Recommendations \nConcerning the Draize Test and Other Animal Acute Toxicity Tests.--Not \nlater than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, each \nFederal department or agency head shall--\n            (1) review and evaluate any regulation, guideline, or \n        recommendation issued by that department or agency which \n        requires, recommends, or encourages the use of the Draize or \n        other animal acute toxicity test for the purpose of evaluation \n        of the safety of a regulated product;\n            (2) review and evaluate nonanimal alternatives with the \n        potential for partial or full replacement of the Draize or \n        other animal acute toxicity test for some or all of the \n        products regulated; and\n            (3) promulgate regulations, guidelines, or recommendations \n        that specify a nonanimal acute toxicity test or battery of \n        tests should be used instead of an animal acute toxicity test \n        unless that Federal department or agency head determines that \n        the nonanimal acute toxicity test or battery of such tests is \n        less likely to predict the acute health effects on humans of a \n        product than the animal acute toxicity test.\n    (b) Corporate Testing Policies.--Nothing in this Act shall be \ninterpreted to prohibit, recommend, or require any testing protocol or \nprocedure by a corporation, institution, or individual to determine the \nsafety of its products that is not required or recommended under this \nAct.\n    (c) Animal Acute Toxicity Tests.--Any Federal department or agency \nhead that finds that regulations requiring or recommending animal tests \nshould not be amended, shall publish in the Federal Register an \nexplanation of options considered and the justification for continuing \nthe animal acute toxicity test.\n    (d) Periodic Review of Animal Acute Toxicity Testing Regulations.--\nAt least every 2 years (beginning 3 years after the date of enactment \nof this Act), each Federal department or agency head, after considering \nthe most recent technological advances available, shall determine \nwhether continued use of any animal acute toxicity test is justified. \nIf a Federal department or agency head determines that such use is \njustified, then that Federal department or agency head shall publish an \nexplanation of such continued use in the Federal Register.\n\nSEC. 4. APPLICATION.\n\n    This Act shall not apply to regulations, guidelines, or \nrecommendations related to medical research.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Animal.--The term ``animal'' means any vertebrate.\n            (2) Animal acute toxicity test.--The term ``animal acute \n        toxicity test'' means an acute toxicity test on animals, \n        including (but not limited to) the Draize eye or skin irritancy \n        test, LD-50 test, approximate lethal dose test, and the limit \n        test.\n            (3) Federal department or agency head.--The term ``Federal \n        department or agency head'' means the head of a Federal \n        department or agency who--\n                    (A) has authority to promulgate regulations, \n                guidelines, and recommendations with respect to \n                procedures to be used in the safety testing by \n                manufacturers of products, including consumer products, \n                veterinary products, and products containing hazardous \n                or toxic substances; or\n                    (B) licenses or approves products, labeling \n                requirements or the transportation of products based on \n                the results of these tests.\n            (4) Medical research.--The term ``medical research'' means \n        research, including research performed using biotechnology, \n        related to the causes, diagnosis, treatment, or control of \n        physical or mental impairments of humans or animals. The term \n        does not include the testing of a product to determine its \n        toxicity for the purpose of complying with protocols, \n        recommendations, or guidelines for testing required, \n        recommended, or accepted by a Federal regulatory agency for a \n        product introduced in commerce.\n            (5) Nonanimal acute toxicity test.--The term ``nonanimal \n        acute toxicity test'' means an acute toxicity test not \n        conducted on animals. Such tests include (but are not limited \n        to) cell culture, computer modeling, protein alteration, and \n        chorioallantoic membrane techniques."
