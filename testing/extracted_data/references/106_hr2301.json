    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional Responsibility Act of \n1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to promote compliance with Article I of \nthe United States Constitution, which grants legislative powers solely \nto Congress. Article I ensures that Federal regulations will not take \neffect unless passed by a majority of the members of the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives and signed by the President, or that the \nmembers of the Senate and House of Representatives override the \nPresident's veto. This Act ends the practice whereby Congress delegates \nits responsibility for making laws to unelected, unaccountable \nofficials of the executive branch and requires that regulations \nproposed by agencies of the executive branch be affirmatively enacted \nby Congress before they become effective. The Act will result in a more \ndemocratic and accountable Congress and protect the public from \nregulations for which elected, accountable officials are unwilling to \ntake responsibility.\n\nSEC. 3. ENACTMENT OF AGENCY REGULATIONS.\n\n    (a)  Congressional Approval.--A regulation shall not take effect \nbefore the date of the enactment of a bill described in section 4(a) \ncomprised solely of the text of the regulation.\n    (b)  Agency Report.--Whenever an agency promulgates a regulation, \nthe agency shall submit to each House of Congress a report containing \nthe text of the proposed regulation and an explanation of the proposed \nregulation. The explanation shall consist of the concise general \nstatement of their basis and purpose required by section 553 of title \n5, United States Code and such explanatory documents as are mandated by \nother statutory requirements.\n\nSEC. 4. EXPEDITED CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURES FOR AGENCY REGULATIONS.\n\n    (a) Introduction.--Not later than 3 legislative days after the date \non which an agency submits a report under section 3(b), the Majority \nLeader of each House of Congress shall introduce (by request) a bill \ncomprised solely of the text of the regulation contained in the report. \nIf such a bill is not introduced in a House of Congress as provided in \nthe preceding sentence, then any Member of that House may introduce \nsuch a bill.\n    (b) Bill.--For purposes of this section, the term ``bill'' means a \nbill of the two Houses of Congress, the matter after the enacting \nclause of which is as follows: ``The following agency regulations are \nhereby approved and shall have the force and effect of law:'' (the text \nof the regulations being set forth after the semicolon).\n    (c) Referral and Consideration.--(1) A bill described in subsection \n(b) shall not be referred to a committee.\n    (2) It is in order for any Member of the respective House to move \nto proceed to the consideration of the bill.

The motion is highly privileged in the House \nof Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and is not \ndebatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, to a motion to \npostpone, or to a motion to proceed to the consideration of other \nbusiness. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed \nto or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the \nconsideration of the bill is agreed to, the respective House shall \nimmediately proceed to consideration of the bill without intervening \nmotion, order, or other business, and the bill shall remain the \nunfinished business of the respective House until disposed of.\n    (3) Debate on the bill, and on all debatable motions and appeals in \nconnection therewith, shall be limited to not more than one hour, which \nshall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the \nbill.

Upon the passage of such a motion, the bill shall be \nconsidered in the same manner as other bills.\n    (f) Treatment if the Other House Has Acted.--(1) If, before the \npassage by one House of a bill introduced in that House described in \nsubsection (b), that House receives from the other House a bill \ndescribed in subsection (b) comprised of the same text, then--\n            (A) the bill of the other House shall not be referred to a \n        committee and may not be considered in the House receiving it \n        except in the case of final passage as provided in subparagraph \n        (B)(ii); and\n            (B) with respect to a bill described in subsection (b) of \n        the House receiving the bill--\n                    (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same \n                as if no bill had been received from the other House; \n                but\n                    (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the bill \n                of the other House.\n    (2) Upon disposition of the bill received from the other House, it \nshall no longer be in order to consider the bill that originated in the \nreceiving House.\n\nSEC. 5.
