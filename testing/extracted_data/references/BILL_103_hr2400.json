FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Both the public and private sectors in the United \n        States would benefit from the collection, analysis, and \n        dissemination of reliable statistical information about the \n        independent states of the former Soviet Union and the Baltic \n        states.\n            (2) Statistical information about the independent states of \n        the former Soviet Union and the Baltic states can be used in \n        policy development on issues ranging from domestic and foreign \n        trade to international population growth, health, and the \n        environment. United States Government statistical agencies \n        could use data collected in the independent states and the \n        Baltic states to develop statistical comparisons between the \n        United States and the rest of the world.\n            (3) Reliable economic statistical information can also \n        assist United States businesses in identifying trade and \n        investment opportunities in the independent states of the \n        former Soviet Union and the Baltic states.\n            (4) Reliable information is needed about economic \n        performance at both the macro and micro-economic levels as the \n        independent states of the former Soviet Union and the Baltic \n        states make the transition from a centrally planned economy to \n        a free market economy.\n            (5) Reliable economic statistical information is especially \n        important in evaluating the effectiveness of assistance \n        provided to the independent states of the former Soviet Union \n        and the Baltic states by the United States Government, by \n        nongovernmental organizations, and by international financial \n        institutions.\n            (6) Such evaluations would be facilitated by annual \n        reports, prepared by the Secretary of Commerce with the \n        assistance of United States Government statistical agencies, \n        assessing the progress being made by the independent states of \n        the former Soviet Union and the Baltic states in establishing a \n        free market economy.\n            (7) United States Government statistical agencies (such as \n        the Bureau of the Census of the Department of Commerce, the \n        Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor, the \n        Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce, and \n        the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the Department \n        of Agriculture) have been involved in providing statistical \n        assistance to foreign countries for more than 40 years.\n            (8) United States Government statistical agencies have set \n        the standard for modern statistical methodology used throughout \n        the world.\n            (9) United States Government statistical agencies have the \n        personnel, facilities, expertise, and other resources to \n        provide training and other technical assistance to the \n        independent states of the former Soviet Union and the Baltic \n        states with respect to the collection, analysis, and \n        dissemination of economic statistical data. In addition, to the \n        extent that the independent states or Baltic states use non-\n        standard collection methods, United States Government \n        statistical agencies have the ablility to reconcile discrepant \n        data, thereby increasing its usefulness.\n\nSEC. 3.
