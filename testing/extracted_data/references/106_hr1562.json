    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Military Operations in the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia Limitation Act of 1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Consideration is being given to the introduction of \n        ground elements of the United States Armed Forces into the \n        Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as part of a North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization (NATO) operation to halt Serbian military \n        action in the Serbian province of Kosovo.\n            (2) Such a deployment, if it were to occur, would in all \n        likelihood represent a commitment to maintain United States \n        ground forces in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for an \n        indeterminate period and cost billions of dollars.\n            (3) The Secretary of Defense has previously opposed the \n        deployment of United States ground forces to Kosovo, a province \n        of Serbia, as reflected in his testimony before the Congress on \n        October 6, 1998.\n            (4) The deployment of United States ground forces to \n        participate in the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, which has \n        resulted in the expenditure of approximately $10,000,000,000 by \n        United States taxpayers to date, which has already been \n        extended past 2 previous withdrawal dates established by the \n        Administration, and which shows no sign of ending in the near \n        future, clearly argues that the costs and duration of a \n        deployment of United States ground forces to the Federal \n        Republic of Yugoslavia to halt the conflict and maintain the \n        peace in the province of Kosovo will be much heavier and much \n        longer than initially foreseen.\n            (5) The substantial drain on military readiness of a \n        deployment of United States ground forces to the Federal \n        Republic of Yugoslavia would be inconsistent with the need, \n        recently acknowledged by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to reverse \n        the trends which have already severely compromised the ability \n        of the United States Armed Forces to carry out the National \n        Military Strategy of the United States.\n            (6) Military operations by the United States Armed Forces \n        against the military forces and infrastructure of the Federal \n        Republic of Yugoslavia--\n                    (A) have resulted in a significant depletion of \n                inventories of conventional air-launched cruise \n                missiles, Tomahawk Block III cruise missiles, and other \n                mission-essential armaments;\n                    (B) have cost several hundred million dollars and \n                are projected by the Administration to cost more than \n                $5,000,000,000 by the end of fiscal year 1999;\n                    (C) have left the western Pacific region without a \n                United States aircraft carrier presence; and\n                    (D) have compromised the ability of the United \n                States to perform other critical national security \n                missions, including Operation Northern Watch in the \n                airspace over Iraq, due to a lack of available assets.\n            (7) The Congress has already indicated its considerable \n        concern about the possible deployment of United States ground \n        forces to the region, as evidenced by section 8115 of the \n        Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law 105-\n        262; 112 Stat. 2327), which sets forth among other matters a \n        requirement for the President to transmit to the Congress a \n        report detailing the anticipated costs, funding sources, \n        schedule and exit strategy for any additional United States \n        Armed Forces deployed to Yugoslavia, Albania, or Macedonia.\n            (8) The President, in his reports to the Congress in \n        response to section 8115 of the Department of Defense \n        Appropriations Act, 1999, has indicated that ``it is not \n        possible to determine how long NATO operations will need to \n        continue . . .'' and that the exit strategy for United States \n        Armed Forces ``will depend on the course of events, and in \n        particular, on Belgrade's reaction to NATO operations.''.\n            (9) The introduction of United States Armed Forces into \n        hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in \n        hostilities may occur, clearly indicates authorization by the \n        Congress when such action is not required for the defense of \n        the United States, its Armed Forces, or its nationals.\n            (10) United States national security interests in Kosovo do \n        not rise to a level that warrants the introduction of United \n        States ground forces in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for \n        peacemaking or peacekeeping purposes with respect to the \n        conflict in Kosovo.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FUNDS FOR \n              DEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES GROUND FORCES TO THE FEDERAL \n              REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA WITHOUT SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION BY \n              LAW.\n\n    (a) In General.--None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \navailable to the Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for \nthe deployment of ground elements of the United States Armed Forces in \nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia unless such deployment is \nspecifically authorized by a law enacted after the enactment of this \nAct.\n    (b) Rule of Construction.--The prohibition in subsection (a) shall \nnot apply with respect to the authority of the President under the \nConstitution to initiate missions specifically limited to rescuing \nUnited States military personnel or citizens in the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia."
