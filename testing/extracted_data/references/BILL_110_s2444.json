FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The environmental life-support systems vital to the \n        Nation's economic and social prosperity are increasingly at \n        risk.\n            (2) The Nation's institutions of higher education have a \n        unique role to play in fostering new knowledge, evaluating \n        policies, and discovering new technologies to address the \n        persistent and often linked environmental, social, and economic \n        problems that exist.\n            (3) Achieving more sustainable environmental, economic, and \n        social systems will require new research, education, and \n        technology development, and innovative policy approaches that \n        are flexible and use market mechanisms while engaging relevant \n        stakeholders from the private and public sectors.\n            (4) For the Nation to remain competitive in this global \n        world of increasingly limited natural resources, institutions \n        of higher education need to take immediate steps to create new \n        research, education, and technology development that reflect \n        the framework of sustainability.\n            (5) The Nation's institutions of higher education also are \n        uniquely positioned to prepare the future labor force for \n        addressing threats to, and seeking opportunities for economic, \n        environmental, and social sustainability.\n            (6) The Nation's institutions of higher education are \n        places where approaches that integrate the environmental, \n        social, and economic dimensions can be designed, tested, and \n        refined for application to real world settings in collaboration \n        with industry, government, and the nonprofit sector.\n            (7) The Nation's institutions of higher education are \n        uniquely situated to be models of sustainable management and \n        operations that can provide examples to industry and government \n        of operational strategies that integrate the basic principles \n        of environmental, economic, and social sustainability.\n            (8) Numerous State governors, including those of Oregon, \n        Washington, New Jersey, and California have issued executive \n        orders for the development of State sustainability plans.\n            (9) Hundreds of college campuses have already made \n        commitments to sustainable practices and lessening their carbon \n        footprint, but lack a cohesive plan.\n            (10) Additionally, many campuses now offer courses on \n        sustainability, but no comprehensive system exists to evaluate \n        and compare colleges and universities in terms of overall \n        sustainability related academic programs and practices.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide support to faculty, staff, and students at \n        institutions of higher education to establish administrative \n        and academic sustainability programs on campus and a means to \n        measure their effectiveness;\n            (2) to promote and enhance research by faculty and students \n        at institutions of higher education in sustainability practices \n        and innovations that assist and improve sustainability; and\n            (3) to provide support to institutions of higher education \n        to work with community partners from the business, government, \n        and nonprofit sectors to design and implement sustainability \n        programs for application in the community and workplace.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.\n\n    Title VII of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1133 et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n              ``PART F--UNIVERSITY SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMS\n\n              ``Subpart 1--Sustainability Planning Grants\n\n``SEC. 781.
