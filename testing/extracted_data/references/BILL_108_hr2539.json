FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) People under the age of 18 make up approximately 12 \n        percent of all crime victims known to police, including 71 \n        percent of all sex crime victims and 38 percent of all \n        kidnaping victims.\n            (2) People from the ages of 12 through 17 are over 2 times \n        more likely to be victims of violent crime than adults.\n            (3) It has been estimated that only 28 percent of crimes \n        against children are actually reported.\n            (4) Some 1,200 children die as a result of abuse each year, \n        and approximately 879,000 children are victims of abuse.\n            (5) Child abuse has long-lasting negative effects upon \n        children and families, including delayed development, \n        depression, substance abuse, and increased likelihood of \n        experiencing or perpetrating domestic violence as an adult.\n            (6) Most local agencies lack adequate resources to protect \n        and serve the needs of children and families that are brought \n        to their attention.\n            (7) Failure to pay child support is in itself a form of \n        neglect, as children who do not receive financial support are \n        more likely to live in poverty, and are therefore more likely \n        to suffer from inadequate education, a lack of quality health \n        care, and a lack of affordable housing.\n\n       TITLE I--ENHANCED FEDERAL ROLE IN CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN\n\nSEC. 101.
