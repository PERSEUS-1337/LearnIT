A committee to \n        which an implementation bill is referred under this paragraph \n        may report such bill to the respective House without amendment.\n            (3) Report or discharge.--If a committee to which an \n        implementation bill is referred has not reported such bill by \n        the end of the 15th calendar day after the date of the \n        introduction of such bill, such committee shall be immediately \n        discharged from further consideration of such bill, and upon \n        being reported or discharged from the committee, such bill \n        shall be placed on the appropriate calendar.\n    (b) Floor Consideration.--\n            (1) In general.--When the committee to which an \n        implementation bill is referred has reported, or has been \n        discharged under subsection (a)(3), it is at any time \n        thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same \n        effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective \n        House to move to proceed to the consideration of the \n        implementation bill, and all points of order against the \n        implementation bill (and against consideration of the \n        implementation bill) are waived. The motion is highly \n        privileged in the House of Representatives and is privileged in \n        the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to \n        amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n        proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n        reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n        disagreed to shall not be in order.

A motion further to limit debate is in order and \n        not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a \n        motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a \n        motion to recommit the implementation bill is not in order. A \n        motion to reconsider the vote by which the implementation bill \n        is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n            (4) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n        conclusion of the debate on an implementation bill, and a \n        single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested \n        in accordance with the rules of the appropriate House, the vote \n        on final passage of the implementation bill shall occur.\n            (5) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n        decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules \n        of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may \n        be, to the procedure relating to an implementation bill shall \n        be decided without debate.\n    (c) Coordination With Action by Other House.--If, before the \npassage by one House of an implementation bill of that House, that \nHouse receives from the other House an implementation bill, then the \nfollowing procedures shall apply:\n            (1) Nonreferral.--The implementation bill of the other \n        House shall not be referred to a committee.\n            (2) Vote on bill of other house.--With respect to an \n        implementation bill of the House receiving the implementation \n        bill--\n                    (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same \n                as if no implementation bill had been received from the \n                other House; but\n                    (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the \n                implementation bill of the other House.\n    (d) Rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives.--This \nsection is enacted by Congress--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n        and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it \n        is deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in \n        that House in the case of an implementation bill described in \n        subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n        extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n        House.\n\nSEC. 4.
