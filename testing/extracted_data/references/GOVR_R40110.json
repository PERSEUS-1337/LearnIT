    "content": "With recent high energy prices, the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-140 ), and the passage of the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ), there is ongoing congressional interest in promoting greater use of alternatives to petroleum fuels. Biofuels\u2014transportation fuels produced from plants and other organic materials\u2014are of particular interest. Ethanol and biodiesel, the two most widely used biofuels, received significant federal support in the form of tax incentives, loan and grant programs, and regulatory programs. However, many incentives for biofuels production and use expired at the end of 2011, while many farm-bill related programs will expire at the end of FY2012. The ongoing congressional debate over budget deficits and the national debt make the prospect of extending these incentives less likely. For example, six of the eight tax incentives listed in this report expired at the end of 2011 and the remaining two are set to expire at the end of 2012.  This report outlines 22 current, expired, or pending federal programs that provide direct or indirect incentives for biofuels. The programs are grouped below by administering agency. The incentives for biofuels are summarized in the Appendix . This information is compiled from authorizing statutes, committee reports, and Administration budget request documents. Administered by: EPA Established: 2005 by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \u00a71501 ( P.L. 109-58 ); expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, \u00a7202 ( P.L. 110-140 ) Scheduled termination: None Description: The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a renewable fuel standard (RFS) for automotive fuels. The RFS was expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS requires the use of renewable fuels (including ethanol and biodiesel) in transportation fuel. In 2011, fuel suppliers were required to include 13.95 billion gallons of renewable fuel in the national transportation fuel supply; this requirement increases annually to 36 billion gallons in 2022. The expanded RFS also specifically mandates the use of \"advanced biofuels\"\u2014fuels produced from non-corn feedstocks and with 50% lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum fuel\u2014starting in 2009. Of the 36 billion gallons required in 2022, at least 21 billion gallons must be advanced biofuel. There are also specific quotas for cellulosic biofuels and for biomass-based diesel fuel. On May 1, 2007, EPA issued a final rule on the original RFS program detailing compliance standards for fuel suppliers, as well as a system to trade renewable fuel credits between suppliers. On March 26, 2010, EPA issued final rules for the expanded program (RFS2), including lifecycle analysis methods necessary to categorize fuels as advanced biofuels, and new rules for credit verification and trading. While this program is not a direct subsidy for the construction of biofuels plants, the guaranteed market created by the renewable fuel standard is expected to stimulate growth of the biofuels industry and to raise prices above where they would have been in the absence of the mandate. For more information: EPA website, Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/index.htm Various tax credits and other incentives have been available for the production, blending, and/or sale of biofuels and biofuel blends. However, many of these incentives expired at the end of 2011. Tax credits vary by the type of fuel and the size of the producer.  Several key biofuels incentives had expired or were set to expire (e.g., a tariff on ethanol imported from most countries, as well as tax credits for biodiesel, renewable diesel, and ethanol) before the passage of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 ). The incentives included in that law were extended through the end of 2011, but support for extending these tax incentives beyond 2011 was limited.

The credit is valued at $1.00 per gallon. Before amendment by P.L. 110-343 , the credit was valued at $1.00 per gallon of \"agri-biodiesel\" (biodiesel produced from virgin agricultural products such as soybean oil or animal fats), or 50 cents per gallon of biodiesel produced from previously used agricultural products (e.g., recycled fryer grease). The tax credit had expired at the end of 2009 and was not extended until the passage of P.L. 111-312 , which retroactively applies the extension to fuel produced in 2010. Qualified applicant: Biodiesel producers and blenders For more information: IRS Publication 510, Chapter 2: Fuel Tax Credits and Refunds http://www.irs.gov/publications/p510/ch02.html Administered by: Internal Revenue Service Established: 2005 by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \u00a71345 ( P.L. 109-58 ); amended by the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-343 , Division B), \u00a7202-203; extended by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 ), \u00a7701 Scheduled termination: Expired December 31, 2011 Description: The small agri-biodiesel producer credit is valued at 10 cents per gallon of \"agri-biodiesel\" (see Biodiesel Tax Credit, above) produced. The credit may be claimed on the first 15 million gallons of ethanol produced by a small producer in a given year through the end of 2011. The tax credit had expired at the end of 2009 and was not extended until the passage of P.L. 111-312 , which retroactively applies the extension to fuel produced in 2010. Qualified applicant: Any agri-biodiesel producer with production capacity below 60 million gallons per year For more information: IRS Publication 510, Chapter 2: Fuel Tax Credits and Refunds http://www.irs.gov/publications/p510/ch02.html Administered by: Internal Revenue Service Established: 2005 by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \u00a71346 ( P.L. 109-58 ); amended by the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-343 , Division B), \u00a7202-203; extended by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 ), \u00a7701 Scheduled termination: Expired December 31, 2011 Description: Producers of biomass-based diesel fuel (or producers of diesel/renewable biodiesel blends) can claim $1.00 per gallon tax credit through the end of 2011. Renewable diesel is similar to biodiesel, but it is produced through different processes and thus is ineligible for the (above) biodiesel credits. The tax credit had expired at the end of 2009 and was not extended until the passage of P.L. 111-312 , which retroactively applies the extension to fuel produced in 2010. Qualified applicant: Renewable diesel producers and blenders For more information: IRS Publication 510, Chapter 2: Fuel Tax Credits and Refunds http://www.irs.gov/publications/p510/ch02.html Administered by: Internal Revenue Service Established: January 1, 2009, by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, \u00a715321 ( P.L. 110-246 ) Scheduled termination: December 31, 2012 Description: Producers of cellulosic biofuel can claim $1.01 per gallon tax credit. For producers of cellulosic ethanol, the value of the credit is reduced by the amount of the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit and the small ethanol producer credit (see above)\u2014currently, the value is 46 cents per gallon. The credit applies to fuel produced after December 31, 2008. Qualified applicant: Cellulosic biofuel producers Note: The credit for cellulosic ethanol varies with other ethanol credits such that the total combined value of all credits is $1.01 per gallon. As the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit and/or the small ethanol producer credits decrease, the per-gallon credit for cellulosic ethanol production increases by the same amount. Administered by: Internal Revenue Service Established: 2006 by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, \u00a7209 ( P.L. 109-432 ); amended by the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-343 , Division B), \u00a7201 Scheduled termination: December 31, 2012 Description: A taxpayer may take a depreciation deduction of 50% of the adjusted basis of a new cellulosic biofuel plant in the year it is put in service. Any portion of the cost financed through tax-exempt bonds is exempted from the depreciation allowance. Before amendment by P.L. 110-343 , the accelerated depreciation applied only to cellulosic ethanol plants that break down cellulose through enzymatic processes\u2014the amended provision applies to all cellulosic biofuel plants. Qualified applicant: Any cellulosic ethanol plant acquired after December 20, 2006, and placed in service before January 1, 2013. Any plant that had a binding contract for acquisition before December 20, 2006, does not qualify.
