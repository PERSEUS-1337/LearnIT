For each title of the regular FSGG appropriations bill, Table 1 lists the enacted amounts for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, as well as amounts requested by the President for FY2013. Title I of the FSGG appropriations bill provides funding for the Department of the Treasury and its bureaus, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The President requested $13.24 billion for the Treasury Department for FY2013, an increase of $1.03 billion above FY2012 enacted amounts. The President's request includes a proposal to create a new bureau, the Fiscal Service, which would result from the merger of the Financial Management Service and the Bureau of the Public Debt. According to the budget request, the new bureau would reduce duplicative functions. Table 2 lists the enacted amounts for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, as well as amounts requested by the President for FY2013.

As a co-equal branch of government, the judiciary presents its budget to the President, who transmits it to Congress unaltered. The President's FY2013 budget request for the judiciary is $7.19 billion, which is $219 million more than appropriated for FY2012. Table 4 lists the enacted amounts for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, as well as amounts requested by the President for FY2013.
