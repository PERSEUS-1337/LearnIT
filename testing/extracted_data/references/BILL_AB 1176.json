    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n(a) In submitting this act to the electors, the Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(1) The theft of firearms and receipt of stolen firearms pose dangers to public safety that are different in kind from other types of theft or the receipt of other types of stolen property.\n(2) Many handguns have a value of less than nine hundred fifty dollars ($950). The threat to public safety in regard to stolen firearms goes above and beyond the monetary value of the firearm.\n(3) Given the significant and particular threat to public safety in regard to stolen firearms, it is appropriate to restore the penalties that existed prior to the passage of the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act in regard to stolen firearms.\n(b) It is not the intent of the Legislature in submitting this act to the electors to undermine the voter\u2019s decision to decrease penalties for low-level theft and receiving stolen property, only to give the voters the opportunity to decide whether firearm thefts and the receipt of stolen firearms should be subject to the penalties that existed prior to the passage of the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 490.2 of the Penal Code is amended to read:\n490.2.\n(a) Notwithstanding Section 487 or any other law defining grand theft, except as provided in subdivision (c), obtaining property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real property, or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) is petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor, except that the person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 if that person has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 290.\n(b) This section does not apply to a theft that may be charged as an infraction pursuant to any other law.\n(c) If the property taken is a firearm, the theft is grand theft in all cases, as specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 487, and is punishable pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 489.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 496 of the Penal Code is amended to read:\n496.\n(a) (1) Every person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding any property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170. However, except as provided in subdivision (e), if the value of the property does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), the offense is a misdemeanor, punishable only by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, if the person has no prior convictions for an offense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 290.\n(2) A principal in the actual theft of the property may be convicted pursuant to this section. However, a person may not be convicted both pursuant to this section and of the theft of the same property.\n(b) (1) Every swap meet vendor, as defined in Section 21661 of the Business and Professions Code, and every person whose principal business is dealing in, or collecting, merchandise or personal property, and every agent, employee, or representative of that person, who buys or receives property of a value in excess of nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) that has been stolen or obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, under circumstances that should cause the person, agent, employee, or representative to make reasonable inquiry to ascertain that the person from whom the property was bought or received had the legal right to sell or deliver it, without making a reasonable inquiry, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170.\n(2) Every swap meet vendor, as defined in Section 21661 of the Business and Professions Code, and every person whose principal business is dealing in, or collecting, merchandise or personal property, and every agent, employee, or representative of that person, who buys or receives property of a value of nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) or less that has been stolen or obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, under circumstances that should cause the person, agent, employee, or representative to make reasonable inquiry to ascertain that the person from whom the property was bought or received had the legal right to sell or deliver it, without making a reasonable inquiry, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\n(c) A person who has been injured by a violation of subdivision (a) or (b) may bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\n(d) Notwithstanding Section 664, an attempt to commit any act prohibited by this section, except an offense specified in the accusatory pleading as a misdemeanor, is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170.\n(e) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a person who buys or receives a firearm that has been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding a firearm from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 29805 of the Penal Code is amended to read:\n29805.\nExcept as provided in Section 29855 or subdivision (a) of Section 29800, any person who has been convicted of a misdemeanor violation of Section 71, 76, 136.1, 136.5, or 140, subdivision (d) of Section 148, Section 171b, paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 171c, 171d, 186.28, 240, 241, 242, 243, 243.4, 244.5, 245, 245.5, 246.3, 247, 273.5, 273.6, 417, 417.6, 422, 490.2 if the property taken was a firearm, 496 if the property consists of a firearm, 626.9, 646.9, or 830.95, subdivision (a) of former Section 12100, as that section read at any time from when it was enacted by Section 3 of Chapter 1386 of the Statutes of 1988 to when it was repealed by Section 18 of Chapter 23 of the Statutes of 1994, Section 17500, 17510, 25300, 25800, 30315, or 32625, subdivision (b) or (d) of Section 26100, or Section 27510, or Section 8100, 8101, or 8103 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, any firearm-related offense pursuant to Sections 871.5 and 1001.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, or of the conduct punished in subdivision (c) of Section 27590, and who, within 10 years of the conviction, owns, purchases, receives, or has in possession or under custody or control, any firearm is guilty of a public offense, which shall be punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year or in the state prison, by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine. The court, on forms prescribed by the Department of Justice, shall notify the department of persons subject to this section.

The special election shall be consolidated with the statewide general election to be held on that date. The consolidated election shall be held and conducted in all respects as if there were only one election, and only one form of ballot shall be used.\n(c) Notwithstanding the requirements of Sections 9040, 9043, 9044, 9061, 9082, and 9094 of the Elections Code, or any other law, the Secretary of State shall submit Sections 2 and 3 of this act to the voters for their approval at the November 8, 2016, statewide general election.\nSEC. 7.\nThis act calls an election within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect."
