FINDINGS AND CONGRESSIONAL POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The President has made United Nations peace operations \n        a major component of the foreign and security policies of the \n        United States.\n            (2) The President has committed United States military \n        personnel under United Nations operational control to missions \n        in Haiti, Croatia, and Macedonia that could endanger those \n        personnel.\n            (3) The President has deployed over 22,000 United States \n        military personnel to the former Yugoslavia as peacekeepers \n        under NATO operational control to implement the Dayton Peace \n        Accord of December 1995.\n            (4) Although the President has insisted that he will retain \n        command of United States forces at all times, in the past this \n        has meant administrative control of United States forces only, \n        while operational control has been ceded to United Nations \n        commanders, some of whom were foreign nationals.\n            (5) The experience of United States forces participating in \n        combined United States-United Nations operations in Somalia, \n        and in combined United Nations-NATO operations in the former \n        Yugoslavia, demonstrate that prerequisites for effective \n        military operations such as unity of command and clarity of \n        mission have not been met by United Nations command and control \n        arrangements.\n            (6) Despite the many deficiencies in the conduct of United \n        Nations peace operations, there may be unique occasions when it \n        is in the national security interests of the United States to \n        participate in such operations.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the President should fully comply with all applicable \n        provisions of law governing the deployment of the Armed Forces \n        of the United States to United Nations peacekeeping operations;\n            (2) the President should consult closely with Congress \n        regarding any United Nations peace operation that could involve \n        United States combat forces and that such consultations should \n        continue throughout the duration of such activities;\n            (3) the President should consult with Congress before a \n        vote within the United Nations Security Council on any \n        resolution which would authorize, extend, or revise the mandate \n        for any such activity;\n            (4) in view of the complexity of United Nations peace \n        operations and the difficulty of achieving unity of command and \n        expeditious decisionmaking, the United States should \n        participate in such operations only when it is clearly in the \nnational security interest to do so;\n            (5) United States combat forces should be under the \n        operational control of qualified commanders and should have \n        clear and effective command and control arrangements and rules \n        of engagement (which do not restrict their self-defense in any \n        way) and clear and unambiguous mission statements; and\n            (6) none of the Armed Forces of the United States should be \n        under the operational control of foreign nationals in United \n        Nations peace enforcement operations except in the most \n        extraordinary circumstances.\n    (c) Definitions.--For purposes of subsections (a) and (b):\n            (1) The term ``United Nations peace enforcement \n        operations'' means any international peace enforcement or \n        similar activity that is authorized by the United Nations \n        Security Council under chapter VII of the Charter of the United \n        Nations.\n            (2) The term ``United Nations peace operations'' means any \n        international peacekeeping, peacemaking, peace enforcement, or \n        similar activity that is authorized by the United Nations \n        Security Council under chapter VI or VII of the Charter of the \n        United Nations.\n\nSEC. 3.
