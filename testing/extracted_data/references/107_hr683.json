    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Emergency Response Act of \n2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) high energy costs are causing hardship for families;\n            (2) restructured energy markets have increased the need for \n        a higher and more consistent level of funding for low income \n        energy assistance programs;\n            (3) conservation programs implemented by the States and the \n        low income weatherization program reduce costs and need for \n        additional energy supplies;\n            (4) energy conservation is a cornerstone of national energy \n        security policy;\n            (5) the Federal Government is the largest consumer of \n        energy in the economy of the United States; and\n            (6) many opportunities exist for significant energy cost \n        savings within the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide assistance \nto those individuals most affected by high energy prices and to promote \nand accelerate energy conservation investments in private and Federal \nfacilities.\n\nSEC. 3. INCREASED FUNDING FOR LIHEAP, WEATHERIZATION, AND STATE ENERGY \n              GRANTS.\n\n    (a) LIHEAP.--Section 2602(b) of the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) is amended by striking the \nfirst sentence and inserting the following: ``There are authorized to \nbe appropriated to carry out the provisions of this title (other than \nsection 2607A), $3,400,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2001 through \n2005.''.\n    (b) Weatherization Assistance.--Section 422 of the Energy \nConservation and Production Act (42 U.S.C. 6872) is amended by striking \n``for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 such sums as may be necessary and \ninserting ``$310,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2001 through 2005''.\n    (c) State Energy Conservation Grants.--Section 365(f) of the Energy \nPolicy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6325(f)) is amended by striking \n``for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 such sums as may be necessary'' \nand inserting ``$75,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2001 through \n2005''.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT REVIEWS.\n\n    Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 \nU.S.C. 8253) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(e) Priority Response Reviews.--Each agency shall--\n            ``(1) not later than October 1, 2001, undertake a \n        comprehensive review of all practicable measures for--\n                    ``(A) increasing energy and water conservation, and\n                    ``(B) using renewable energy sources; and\n            ``(2) not later than 180 days after completing the review, \n        implement measures to achieve not less than 50 percent of the \n        potential efficiency and renewable savings identified in the \n        review.''.\n\nSEC. 5. COST SAVINGS FROM REPLACEMENT FACILITIES.\n\n    Section 801(a) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 \nU.S.C. 8287(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(3)(A) In the case of an energy savings contract or energy \nsavings performance contract providing for energy savings through the \nconstruction and operation of one or more buildings or facilities to \nreplace one or more existing buildings or facilities, benefits \nancillary to the purpose of such contract under paragraph (1) may \ninclude savings resulting from reduced costs of operation and \nmaintenance at such replacement buildings or facilities when compared \nwith costs of operation and maintenance at the buildings or facilities \nbeing replaced.\n    ``(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(B), aggregate annual payments \nby an agency under an energy savings contract or energy savings \nperformance contract referred to in subparagraph (A) may take into \naccount (through the procedures developed pursuant to this section) \nsavings resulting from reduced costs of operation and maintenance as \ndescribed in subparagraph (A).''.\n\nSEC. 6. REPEAL OF ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACT SUNSET.\n\n    Section 801(c) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 \nU.S.C. 8287(c)) is repealed.\n\nSEC. 7. ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACT DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Energy Savings.--Section 804(2) of the National Energy \nConservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8287c(2)) is amended to read as \nfollows:\n            ``(2) The term ``energy savings'' means a reduction in the \n        cost of energy or water, from a base cost established through a \n        methodology set forth in the contract, used in either--\n                    ``(A) an existing federally owned building or \n                buildings or other federally owned facilities as a \n                result of--\n                            ``(i) the lease or purchase of operating \n                        equipment, improvements, altered operation and \n                        maintenance, or technical services;\n                            ``(ii) the increased efficient use of \n                        existing energy sources by cogeneration or heat \n                        recovery, excluding any cogeneration process \n                        for other than a federally owned building or \n                        buildings or other federally owned facilities; \n                        or\n                            ``(iii) the increased efficient use of \n                        existing water sources; or\n                    ``(B) a replacement facility under section \n                801(a)(3).''.\n    (b) Energy Savings Contract.--Section 804(3) of the National Energy \nConservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8287c(3)) is amended to read as \nfollows:\n            ``(3) The terms `energy savings contract' and `energy \n        savings performance contract' mean a contract which provides \n        for--\n                    ``(A) the performance of services for the design, \n                acquisition, installation, testing, operation, and, \n                where appropriate, maintenance and repair, of an \n                identified energy or water conservation measure or \n                series of measures at one or more locations; or\n                    ``(B) energy savings through the construction and \n                operation of one or more buildings or facilities to \n                replace one or more existing buildings or \n                facilities.''.\n    (c) Energy or Water Conservation Measure.--Section 804(4) of the \nNational Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8287c(4) is amended \nto read as follows:\n            ``(4) The term `energy or water conservation measure' \n        means--\n                    ``(A) an energy conservation measure, as defined in \n                section 551(4) (42 U.S.C. 8259(4)); or\n                    ``(B) a water conservation measure that improves \n                water efficiency, is life cycle cost effective, and \n                involves water conservation, water recycling or reuse, \n                improvements in operation or maintenance efficiencies, \n                retrofit activities or other related activities, not at \n                a Federal hydroelectric facility.''."
