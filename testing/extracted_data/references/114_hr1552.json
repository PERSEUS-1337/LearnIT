FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) All uses of antibiotics, including for food-producing \n        animals, have the potential to cause resistance and contribute \n        to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections \n        in people.\n            (2) In 1977, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n        concluded that feeding livestock low doses of antibiotics used \n        in human disease treatment could promote the development of \n        antibiotic resistance in bacteria. However, the Food and Drug \n        Administration did not act in response to these findings, \n        despite laws requiring the agency to do so.\n            (3) In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Guidance for \n        Industry #209 provided a summary of over 40 years of peer-\n        reviewed scientific literature regarding use of antimicrobial \n        drugs in livestock which reiterated that the use of antibiotics \n        in animals contributes to the resistance in human pathogens and \n        concludes that strategies for controlling antibiotic \n        resistance, including limiting medically important \n        antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals only to uses that \n        are considered necessary for assuring animal health are needed.\n            (4) The 2014 President's Council of Advisors on Science and \n        Technology Report to the President on Combating Antibiotic-\n        Resistant Bacteria also concludes that substantial evidence \n        exists that the use of antibiotics in food animals promotes the \n        development and spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria \n        that can spread to people and that it is clear that \n        agricultural use of antibiotics can affect human health.\n            (5) Recently published scientific studies have shown that \n        food-producing animals, and animal production facilities, are a \n        source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria which have infected \n        humans and present an increased risk of acquiring and \n        antibiotics resistant infection.\n            (6) Antibiotic resistance is a crisis which threatens \n        public health, the economy, and national security.\n            (7) In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        estimated that antibiotic-resistant infections cause at least 2 \n        million infections, 23,000 deaths, 8 million additional \n        hospital days, and $20 to $35 billion in excess direct health \n        care costs each year in the United States.\n            (8) The 2014 World Health Organization report, \n        ``Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance \n        2014'', concluded that antimicrobial resistance is a current \n        reality and the problem is so serious that it threatens the \n        achievements of modern medicine.\n            (9) Without effective antibiotics--\n                    (A) common infections could become untreatable--\n                even fatal; and\n                    (B) medical advances such as joint replacements, \n                Cesarean sections, organ transplants and chemotherapy \n                could become nonviable.\n            (10) Antibiotic resistance, resulting in a reduced number \n        of effective antibiotics, may significantly impair the ability \n        of the United States to respond to terrorist attacks involving \n        bacterial infections, such as anthrax and smallpox, or to an \n        event resulting in a large influx of hospitalized patients.\n            (11) In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration determined \n        that--\n                    (A) 13.5 million kilograms of antibacterial drugs \n                were sold for use on food animals in the United States \n                in 2010;\n                    (B) 3.3 million kilograms of antibacterial drugs \n                were used for human health in 2010; and\n                    (C) therefore, 80 percent of antibacterial drugs \n                disseminated in the United States in 2010 were sold for \n                use on food animals, rather than being used for human \n                health.\n            (12) The ``FDA Annual Summary Report on Antimicrobials Sold \n        or Distributed in 2012 for Use in Food-Producing Animals'' \n        showed that the use of medically important antibiotics in food-\n        producing animals increased 16 percent from 2009 to 2012.\n            (13)(A) In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration modified \n        the drug approval process for antibiotics to recognize the \n        development of resistant bacteria as an important aspect of \n        safety, but most antibiotics currently used in animal \n        production systems for nontherapeutic purposes were approved \n        before the Food and Drug Administration began considering \n        resistance during the drug-approval process.\n            (B) The Food and Drug Administration has not established a \n        schedule for reviewing those existing approvals.\n            (14) A stated goal of FDA Guidance documents 209 and 213 is \n        a reduction in the overall consumption of antibiotics. The FDA \n        policy continues to allow the use of antibiotics for routine \n        disease prevention without requiring evidence of the presence \n        of a specific disease or requiring the mitigation of conditions \n        which elevate disease risk.\n            (15) There is inadequate distinction between usage for \n        disease prevention and production purposes, such as growth \n        promotion, on FDA approved drug labels. A 2014 analysis of the \n        approved animal drugs affected by Guidance 213 by the Pew \n        Charitable Trusts found that numerous approved drug labels \n        contained overlapping indications for growth-promotion and \n        disease prevention.\n            (16) The European Union (EU) banned the use of antibiotics \n        for growth promotion in 2006, a full decade before the FDA's \n        voluntary approach will go into effect.\n            (17) Since the EU ban, antibiotic usage has decreased \n        without affecting livestock production.\n            (18) In 2010, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration \n        testified that the Danish ban of the nontherapeutic use of \n        antibiotics in food-animal production resulted in a marked \n        reduction in antimicrobial resistance in multiple bacterial \n        species, including Campylobacter and Enterococci.\n            (19) The experience in the Netherlands has shown that \n        during the phaseout use indications for growth promotion were \n        completely supplanted by disease prevention. Total antibiotic \n        consumption remained constant. After the implementation of \n        mandatory reduction targets and improved surveillance of usage \n        practices antibiotic consumption declined ahead of target \n        without impacting production levels.\n            (20) In 2009, the Congressional Research Service concluded \n        that without restrictions on the use of antimicrobial drugs in \n        the production of livestock, export markets for livestock and \n        poultry could be negatively impacted due to restrictions on the \n        use of antibiotics in other nations.\n            (21) The American Medical Association, the Infectious \n        Disease Society of America, the American Public Health \n        Association, the National Association of County and City Health \n        Officials, and the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition \n        are among the over 400 organizations representing health, \n        consumer, agricultural, environmental, humane, and other \n        interests that have supported enactment of legislation to \n        phaseout nontherapeutic use in farm animals of medically \n        important antimicrobials.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to preserve the effectiveness of \nmedically important antimicrobials used in the treatment of human and \nanimal diseases.\n\nSEC. 4.
