TREATMENT OF LAND SUBJECT TO A QUALIFIED CONSERVATION EASEMENT.\n\n    (a) Estate Tax With Respect to Land Subject to a Qualified \nConservation Easement.--Section 2031 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 (relating to the definition of gross estate) is amended by \nredesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d) and by inserting after \nsubsection (b) the following new subsection:\n    ``(c) Estate Tax With Respect to Land Subject to a Qualified \nConservation Easement.--\n            ``(1) In general.--If the executor makes the election \n        described in paragraph (3) of this subsection, then, except as \n        otherwise provided in this subsection, there shall be excluded \n        from the gross estate the value of land subject to a qualified \n        conservation easement (reduced by the amount of any \n        indebtedness to which such land is subject). For purposes of \n        this subsection, the term `land subject to a qualified \n        conservation easement' means land that is located in an area \n        which, on the date of the decedent's death, is a metropolitan \n        area (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget), and \n        which was owned by the decedent or a member of the decedent's \n        family at all times during the three-year period ending on the \n        date of the decedent's death, and with respect to which a \n        qualified conservation contribution of a qualified real \n        property interest (as defined in section 170(h)(1) and (2)(C)) \n        is or has been made by the decedent or a member of the \n        decedent's family. For purposes of this subsection, the term \n        `qualified real property interest' shall not include any \n        structure or building constituting a `certified historic \n        structure' (as defined in section 170(h)(4)(B)) or within the \n        definition of a `historically important land area' (as defined \n        in section 170(h)(4)(A)(iv)). For purposes of this subsection, \n        the term `member of the decedent's family' shall have the same \n        meaning as the term `member of the family' in section 2032A.\n            ``(2) Payment of tax upon certain disposition of land \n        subject to retained development right.--The exclusion described \n        in paragraph (1) shall not apply to the value of any \n        development right retained by the donor in the conveyance of \n        such qualified conservation easement. The tax imposed by \n        section 2001, if any, attributable to any development right so \n        retained shall be imposed only upon the disposition of such \n        property. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n        `disposition' shall not include any gift or devise. The tax so \n        imposed shall be due and payable by the person so disposing of \n        such property on the fifteenth day of the fourth month \n        following the calendar year in which such disposition occurs. \n        For purposes of this paragraph, the term `development right' \n        shall mean the right to establish or use, any structure and the \n        land immediately surrounding it for sale, or for rent or any \n        other commercial purpose which is not subordinate to and \n        directly supportive of the conservation purpose identified in \n        the easement, or the activity of farming, forestry, ranching, \n        horticulture, viticulture, or recreation, whether or not for \n        profit, conducted on land subject to the easement in which such \n        right is retained.\n            ``(3) Election with respect to land subject to qualified \n        conservation easement.--The election under this subsection \n        shall be made on the return of the tax imposed by section 2001 \n        and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations \n        prescribe. Such an election, once made, shall be irrevocable.\n            ``(4) Calculation and notice of potential estate tax due.--\n        An executor making the election described in paragraph (3) of \n        this subsection shall compute the amount of tax imposed by \n        section 2001 upon any development right (as defined in \n        paragraph (2) of this subsection) retained by the donor in the \n        conveyance of such qualified conservation easement and include \n        such computation with the return of the tax imposed by section \n        2001. The executor shall also file a `Notice of Potential \n        Estate Tax Due' in the place or places where deeds are put to \n        public record for the locality in which the land subject to \n        such qualified conservation easement is located. The report of \n        the computation of tax on any retained development right and \n        the filing of the notice prescribed in this paragraph shall be \n        done in such manner and on such forms as the Secretary shall \n        prescribe.''\n    (b) Carryover Basis.--Section 1014(a) of the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 (relating to basis of property acquired from a decedent) is \namended by striking the period at the end of paragraph (3), inserting \n``, or'' at the end thereof, and inserting the following new paragraph:\n            ``(4) to the extent of the applicability of the exclusion \n        described in section 2031(c), the basis in the hands of the \n        decedent.''\n    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \napply to gross estates including land on which qualified conservation \neasements were granted after December 31, 1994, in taxable years ending \nafter such date.\n\nSEC. 3.

For purposes of this \nsubsection, the term `land subject to a qualified conservation \neasement' shall have the same meaning as in section 2031(c), except \nthat references therein to `decedent' shall refer to the donor and \nreferences to `the date of the decedent's death' shall refer to the \ndate of the transfer by the donor.''\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \napply to gifts of land on which qualified conservation easements were \ngranted after December 31, 1994, in taxable years ending after such \ndate.\n\nSEC. 4.
