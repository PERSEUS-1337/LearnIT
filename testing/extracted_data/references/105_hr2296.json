    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1)(A) With increasing regional integration, the value of \n        Caribbean trade for the United States is well established.\n            (B) Collectively, it is estimated that the 24 countries of \n        the Caribbean Basin represent a market of more than 50,000,000 \n        people that has become the tenth largest destination for United \n        States goods and services.\n            (2) Although the expansion of democracy throughout most of \n        the Western Hemisphere has brought economic liberalization and \n        reform, assistance is still required to continue the reforms \n        and to diversify and stimulate investment in the Caribbean \n        Basin region.\n            (3) While progress has been made by many of the Caribbean \n        Basin countries in areas that coincide with the security, \n        economic, and humanitarian interests of the United States, much \n        more needs to be done.\n            (4)(A) The Castro regime in Cuba is not a democratically \n        elected government. It systemically violates the individual \n        civil liberties and human rights of its citizens, does not have \n        a market-oriented economy, and has made it abundantly clear \n        that it will not engage in any substantive reforms that would \n        lead to a democracy and market economy for Cuba.\n            (B) The totalitarian nature of the Castro regime has \n        deprived the Cuban people of any peaceful means to improve \n        their condition and has led thousands of Cuban citizens to risk \n        or lose their lives in dangerous attempts to escape from Cuba \n        to freedom.\n            (5) Since the beginning of the Castro regime, it has been \n        the policy of the United States to isolate and sanction this \n        totalitarian regime.\n    (b) Declaration of Policy.--The Congress declares the following:\n            (1) United States trade policy must be consistent with \n        United States foreign policy and recipients of foreign \n        assistance must be held accountable for decisions that run \n        contrary, or could endanger, United States interests and \n        objectives in the Western Hemisphere.\n            (2) Safeguard mechanisms must be established to ensure that \n        United States foreign assistance or United States trade \n        agreements with other countries are not used in any way to \n        benefit the Castro regime.\n\nSEC. 2. WITHHOLDING OF UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO CARIBBEAN BASIN \n              INITIATIVE COUNTRIES THAT OFFER SUPPORT FOR MEMBERSHIP \n              FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA INTO CARICOM OR CACM.\n\n    Beginning 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \nPresident shall withhold assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) (other than humanitarian assistance) to \nany Caribbean Basin Initiative country that uses its voice or vote in \nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) or the Central American Common Market \n(CACM) to support provisional, permanent, or any other form of \nmembership for the Government of Cuba into CARICOM or CACM.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON PROVISION OF CERTAIN TARIFF TREATMENT TO \n              CARIBBEAN BASIN INITIATIVE COUNTRIES THAT OFFER \n              MEMBERSHIP FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA INTO CARICOM OR \n              CACM OR THAT NEGOTIATE A FREE TRADE AREA AGREEMENT WITH \n              CUBA.\n\n    Beginning 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \nPresident shall deny temporary or permanent tariff treatment to \nproducts of a Caribbean Basin Initiative country that is equivalent to \ntreatment provided to products of a NAFTA country if such Caribbean \nBasin Initiative country--\n            (1) uses its voice or vote in CARICOM or CACM to support \n        provisional, permanent, or any other form of membership for the \n        Government of Cuba into CARICOM or CACM; or\n            (2) enters into negotiations with the Government of Cuba \n        toward a free trade area agreement with Cuba.\n\nSEC. 4.
