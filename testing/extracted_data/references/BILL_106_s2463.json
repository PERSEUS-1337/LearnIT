SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Death Penalty Moratorium \nAct of 2000''.\n\n                TITLE I--MORATORIUM ON THE DEATH PENALTY\n\nSEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Death sentences are disproportionately visited on the \n        poor:\n                    (A) About 90 percent of people facing capital \n                charges cannot afford their own attorney.\n                    (B) No State has met standards developed by the \n                American Bar Association (ABA) for appointment, \n                performance, and compensation of counsel for indigent \n                prisoners.\n            (2) There is ample evidence that the death penalty is \n        applied disproportionately to members of certain racial and \n        ethnic groups:\n                    (A) Although African-Americans constitute only 13 \n                percent of the American population, since 1976 African-\n                Americans account for 35 percent of those executed, 43 \n                percent of those who wait on death row nationwide, and \n                67 percent of those who wait on death row in the \n                Federal system. Although only 50 percent of murder \n                victims are white, fully 84 percent of the victims in \n                death penalty cases were white.\n                    (B) A study conducted by the House Judiciary \n                Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights in 1994 \n                concluded that 89 percent of defendants selected for \n                capital prosecution under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of \n                1988 have been either African-American or Hispanic \n                American.\n                    (C) In 1990, the General Accounting Office reported \n                ``a pattern of evidence indicating racial disparities \n                in charging, sentencing, and imposition of the death \n                penalty''.\n            (3) Prisoner appeals have been severely curtailed, \n        increasing the risk of imprisonment and execution of innocent \n        people:\n                    (A) In a series of rulings since 1976, the Supreme \n                Court has restricted the rights of death row prisoners \n                to appeal their convictions and death sentences in \n                Federal courts, even in cases where prisoners present \n                compelling evidence of innocence.\n                    (B) In 1996, new legislation limited Federal court \n                review of death penalty appeals and severely curtailed \n                public funding of legal aid services for death row \n                prisoners.\n\nSEC. 102. FEDERAL AND STATE DEATH PENALTY MORATORIUM.\n\n    Neither the Federal Government nor any State shall carry out the \ndeath penalty until Congress considers the final findings and \nrecommendations of the National Commission on the Death Penalty in the \nreport submitted under section 202(c)(2) and enacts legislation \nrepealing this section and implementing or rejecting the guidelines and \nprocedures recommended by the Commission.\n\n           TITLE II--NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE DEATH PENALTY\n\nSEC. 201.
