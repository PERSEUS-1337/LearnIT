FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is found \n        in air, water and soil. It is a bioaccumulative toxin that is \n        easily absorbed through skin and respiratory and \n        gastrointestinal tissues.\n            (2) Communities across the country have been victims of \n        accidental and intentional releases of elemental mercury in \n        schools and other public and private buildings, exposing \n        citizens to harmful mercury vapors and costing millions of \n        dollars in property damage and remediation costs.\n            (3) Mercury deposition is a significant public health \n        threat in many States throughout the United States.\n            (4) According to a report by the National Academy of \n        Sciences, over 60,000 children are born each year in the United \n        States at risk for adverse neurodevelopmental effects due to \n        exposure to methyl mercury in utero.\n            (5) Current Federal hazardous waste regulations allow land \n        disposal of certain highly contaminated mercury wastes without \n        treatment to remove the mercury, despite Environmental \n        Protection Agency-sponsored studies concluding that such \n        disposal practices are not sufficiently protective of human \n        health and the environment.\n            (6) According to the Government Accountability Office, in \n        2003 over 26,000,000 pounds of mercury wastes disposed of in \n        landfills were not required to meet treatment standards \n        promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency for the safe \n        mercury disposal.\n            (7) According to the Government Accountability Office, the \n        Environmental Protection Agency does not know how millions of \n        pounds of mercury wastes are treated prior to land disposal and \n        cannot be certain that businesses are properly managing their \n        mercury contaminated wastes.\n            (8) The Government Accountability Office determined that \n        many states and landfill operators are misidentifying highly \n        contaminated mercury wastes as ``debris'', which allows these \n        wastes to be landfilled without testing or mercury reclamation \n        as the law envisioned.\n            (9) Current Federal laws and regulations do not provide the \n        information necessary for regulators or the public to \n        accurately track mercury-containing items from generation to \n        disposal.\n            (10) Mercury is released to the environment when mercury-\n        containing products are discarded in landfills and broken in \n        the waste stream, polluting our water and threatening the \n        health of workers and others exposed to mercury vapors from \n        these releases.\n            (11) While mercury-containing wastes must be properly \n        managed and recycled whenever possible, the energy conservation \n        benefits of using mercury-based compact fluorescent lighting \n        are highly significant.\n            (12) Use of fluorescent lamps creates a net environmental \n        benefit, reducing mercury emissions by lowering energy demands \n        on power plants burning fossil fuels to generate electricity.\n            (13) Less than twenty-five percent of mercury-containing \n        lamps disposed of each year are recycled, leading to the \n        release of mercury from over one-half billion lamps broken in \n        solid waste without any mercury recovery.\n            (14) A study by a major retailer finds that changing 100 \n        million light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights would: save \n        $3 billion in energy costs, keep 45 billion pounds of \n        greenhouse gases from reaching the atmosphere, and would \n        eliminate the need for 1.3 coal-fired power plants.\n            (15) The Federal government should develop specific \n        programs to increase the collection and recycling of mercury-\n        containing lighting devices, particularly from consumers and \n        small businesses. By stimulating the nation's ability to \n        collect and recycle mercury-containing lighting devices, the \n        Federal government will achieve the dual goals of energy \n        conservation and environmental protection.\n            (16) Current Federal laws and regulations allow many \n        discarded mercury items to escape regulation due to inadequate \n        mercury testing methods and loopholes allowing significant \n        amounts of waste to be improperly disposed of as solid waste \n        without mercury recovery and other environmental protections.\n            (17) Improved tracking of mercury-containing wastes is \n        critical to ensure that mercury is reclaimed from mercury \n        wastes whenever feasible.\n\nSEC. 3. MERCURY WASTE PACKAGING, TRACKING AND STORAGE.\n\n    (a) Amendment of Solid Waste Disposal Act.--Subtitle D of the Solid \nWaste Disposal Act is amended by adding the following new section at \nthe end thereof:\n\n``SEC. 4011.
