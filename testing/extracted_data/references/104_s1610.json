    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Independent Contractor Tax \nSimplification Act of 1996''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) Simplifying the tax rules with respect to independent \n        contractors was the top vote-getter at the 1995 White House \n        Conference on Small Business. Conference delegates recommended \n        that Congress ``should recognize the legitimacy of an \n        independent contractor''. The Conference found that the current \n        common law is ``too subjective'' and called upon the Congress \n        to establish ``realistic and consistent guidelines''.\n            (2) It is in the best interests of taxpayers and the \n        Federal Government to have fair and objective rules for \n        determining who is an employee and who is an independent \n        contractor.\n\nSEC. 3.
