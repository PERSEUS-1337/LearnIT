    "content": "Congress faces two general issues in legislation to create or reauthorize programs for the sale or lease of federal lands and resources: the price or fee to be charged, and how the receipts should be used. At a time of heightened fiscal concerns, the sale or lease of lands and resources presents opportunities to increase federal receipts and/or to use receipts to reduce the federal deficit, and ultimately the burden on federal taxpayers. On the other hand, a significant portion of receipts historically has been paid to state and local governments. In authorizing land and resource sales and leases, Congress can choose how fees or prices are to be established. Some sales and leases are offered and bid competitively, and thus the price is a value determined by the market. Other leases and sales are made at prices either specified in law or set administratively within statutory guidelines. Some administered prices are intended to estimate a fair market value, such as the appraisals for federal land sales. Other administered prices reflect other factors; for instance, grazing fees are to reflect sale prices of beef cattle, among other factors. In some instances, there has been considerable debate over the factors to be considered in setting fees. Some have raised concerns that administered fees differ from the prices that would occur in a competitive market. BLM and USFS grazing fees, for example, have been noted to be below the fees charged by other landowners. Critics argue that the low fees are a substantial subsidy to the ranching industry; others contend that the fees reflect that public land ranching is an economically marginal operation, and that higher grazing fees would drive many ranchers out of business. Similarly, hardrock mining fees recover at least some administrative costs, but return none of the value of the minerals extracted from the federal land; however, free access to the minerals has promoted economic development in many areas.  Congress can also choose how to allocate receipts from any of the land and resource sale or lease programs it creates or amends. One issue is whether to provide mandatory spending authority for the receipts. Proponents of mandatory spending for particular programs generally are seeking greater financial stability, as compared to the vagaries of the annual appropriations process. Opponents argue that all taxpayers should benefit from the sale or lease of public assets, and often desire the more intense oversight that comes with annual appropriations. Mandatory spending also can affect federal spending levels and the budget deficit. Another issue is how the receipts should be used. Some advocate using the fees to reduce the fiscal burden on taxpayers generally. However, some fees are intended to recover administrative costs, while others are intended to fund activities to restore lands and resources to pre-sale conditions. Other receipts are \"reinvested\" in federal land or resource management in some way. In general, users may be more likely to tolerate higher fees or prices if they see that the additional federal receipts are to be used for management programs that they benefit from, at least in the long run, if not immediately. Generally, only the BLM is authorized to sell lands that it administers. Land sale authority is quite narrow for the USFS, and almost nonexistent for the National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service. Receipts are from the sale of public (i.e., BLM) lands under various authorities. BLM sale authorities include the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71701 et seq.); the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72301 et seq.); disposals under geographic-specific laws, perhaps most notably the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act (SNPLMA; P.L. 105-263 , as amended); patents under the General Mining Law (see \" Hardrock/Locatable Minerals ,\" below); transfers to other governmental units for public purposes; and other statutes. Prices under most authorities (e.g., FLPMA, FLTFA, and SNPLMA) are based on fair market value, as determined by an agency appraisal. Also, some land disposal authorities (e.g., the General Mining Law) have other pricing provisions.  Reclamation Fund \u201476% of receipts in Reclamation states under FLPMA and FLTFA are deposited in the fund; expenditures require an annual appropriation. Payments to States \u20144% of land sale receipts under FLPMA and FLTFA are permanently appropriated to the states. FLTFA \u201496% of land sale receipts under FLTFA are permanently appropriated to a designated account for the Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture to use to acquire inholdings and adjacent nonfederal lands (or interests therein) with exceptional resources in the state where the receipts were generated; not more than 20% can be used for administrative expenses related to land disposal. SNLPMA, Federal Funds \u201485% of SNLPMA land sale receipts are permanently appropriated to a designated account for the Secretary of the Interior to use for certain purposes in Nevada: federal acquisition of environmentally sensitive land; capital improvements at certain federal areas; development of parks, trails, and natural areas in particular counties; and other purposes. SNLPMA, Local Payments \u201410% of SNLPMA land sale receipts are permanently appropriated to the Southern Nevada Water Authority. SNLPMA, State Payments \u20145% of SNLPMA land sale receipts are permanently appropriated to the State of Nevada General Education Fund. General Treasury \u2014any remaining receipts (20% in Reclamation states and 96% in non-Reclamation states from FLPMA sales) are deposited in the Treasury. Recreation by the public is an authorized use of most federal lands. Recreational uses include a wide variety of activities, such as hiking, camping, bird watching, sightseeing, hunting, fishing, boating, and off-road driving. The agencies may restrict recreation in some areas to reduce conflicts that might occur, such as between off-road vehicle use and hiking. Fees are charged for recreation on federal lands and waters under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA; Title VIII of Division J of P.L. 108-447 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005). FLREA authorizes different fees for the four major federal land management agencies (and the Bureau of Reclamation), including entrance, standard amenity, expanded amenity, and special recreation permit fees. The law outlines criteria for establishing fees, and prohibits charging fees for certain activities and services. Fees are set administratively under the criteria, prohibitions, and other provisions of FLREA. The intent is, in general, to promote fair and consistent fees among agencies and locations, commensurate with the benefits and services provided. The Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture are required to consider comparable fees charged elsewhere, such as by nearby private providers of recreation services. To minimize confusion, burden, and overlap of fees, the Secretaries also are required to consider the aggregate effect of recreation fees on recreation users and providers. They are directed to establish the minimum number of fees and avoid collecting multiple or layered fees for similar purposes. In establishing new fees and fee sites, the Secretaries are required to obtain input from the public and from Recreation Resource Advisory Committees.  FLREA Accounts \u2014100% of receipts are deposited into a designated account for each agency in the Treasury, and are permanently appropriated to the Secretaries. In general, at least 80% of the receipts are directed to be used at the site where they were generated, for various purposes including visitor services and the operation, maintenance, and restoration of facilities. The remaining collections are available to be used at the discretion of the agency. The law contains other provisions for the distribution of certain collections, including from the sale of recreation passes authorized in the FLREA (e.g., the national recreation pass). The majority of timber from federal lands is sold by the USFS. In addition, the BLM sells timber: about 90% of BLM timber is sold from the Oregon and California (O&C) grant lands and the Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) grant lands in western Oregon. Both agencies determine the total amount of timber to be sold and the size and frequency of sales, generally based on land and resource management plans for the areas. Because the volume sold and the prices vary from year to year, annual receipts can fluctuate widely. Receipts are from the sale of stumpage , defined as the right to cut and remove specified trees or all trees in a specified area. Sales vary widely in size, from a few trees to hundreds of acres of trees (possibly thousands of trees), and purchasers typically have up to a few years to complete the sale contract. Prices are set by competitive bids at auctions, either oral auctions or written or sealed bids submitted by a specified date and time, by qualified bidders at not less than the appraised value of the timber as determined by agency employees. Some sales have only one bidder, who generally pays the appraised value for the timber, and under limited circumstances, timber can be sold in a negotiated sale at the appraised value. On \"scaled\" sales (common for USFS sales in the West), purchasers pay the rate competitively bid for each timber species, based on the scaled (measured) amount of timber that is removed. On \"lump-sum\" sales (BLM sales and USFS sales in the South and East), purchasers pay the total amount that is bid, regardless of the amount of timber that is actually removed. In either case, periodic payments must be made before the timber is cut. The disposition of timber receipts depends on various factors. The amount deposited in each account is determined by agency personnel on each sale, and up to 100% of the proceeds can be deposited into any one account. Because of the USFS's two-step process for allocations to accounts (deposits to the National Forest Fund are re-allocated to other accounts), and because these other accounts have mandatory spending authority that is not limited by the deposits to the National Forest Fund, the total allocation of USFS timber sale receipts can exceed 100% of the actual receipts\u2014up to 135%. (The additional funds needed for allocations above 100% can be drawn from the U.S. Treasury for the Payments to States.) The BLM can only allocate 100% of its proceeds to the various accounts. Brush Disposal (Act of August 11, 1916; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7490)\u2014timber purchasers make deposits to this account, above the stumpage price for the sale, that is permanently appropriated to the USFS for disposing of tree tops, limbs, and other woody debris from timber harvesting. The amount is determined for each sale. Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund , also called Sale Area Betterment, or SAB, Fund (Act of June 6, 1930; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7576)\u2014a portion of receipts from timber sales are deposited in a trust fund permanently appropriated to the USFS. The amount deposited to the K-V Fund is determined for each sale, can be up to 100% of receipts, leaving nothing for allocation to other accounts. K-V Funds can be used to reforest, improve the remaining timber stands, or mitigate or enhance other resource values within sale areas. Initially, use of K-V Funds was restricted to the national forest where the funds were collected, but now can be used on any forest within the USFS region where the funds were collected. Salvage Sale Fund (National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA); P.L. 94-588 , \u00a714(h))\u2014receipts from sales or portions of sales designated as salvage are deposited in this account permanently appropriated to the USFS. The total deposited in the K-V Fund and the Salvage Sale Fund cannot exceed 100% of sale receipts. Funds are used to prepare and administer additional salvage sales. Timber Sales Pipeline Restoration Fund (Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996; P.L. 104-134 , \u00a7327)\u2014receipts from certain canceled-but-reinstated timber sales and from additional sales prepared with the fund are permanently appropriated to the USFS. Three-quarters of the funds are to prepare additional timber sales and the other quarter is for recreation projects. National Forest Fund (NFF) \u2014all receipts from leases and sales of national forest resources, except those deposited directly into a particular account (listed above for timber) are deposited into this account. Numerous allocations are then made from the NFF, as identified below. Payments to States (Act of May 23, 1908; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7500)\u201425% of gross receipts are permanently appropriated to the states for use on roads and schools in the counties where the national forests are located. Since 2001, counties have been able to choose 25% of current receipts or payments based on historical payments under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS, P.L. 106-393 ). Because payments are based on more than deposits to the NFF, total allocations from any particular timber sale can exceed 100% of the sale's receipts. National Forest Roads and Trails Fund (Act of March 4, 1913; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7501)\u201410% of gross receipts (excluding deposits to special accounts) from all timber sales are permanently appropriated to the USFS. Initially, the account was intended to supplement annual appropriations for road and trail construction. In the 1980s, funds were returned to the Treasury to offset annual appropriations for road and trail construction under provisions in the annual Interior appropriations acts. From FY2000-FY2007, funds were made available to implement projects to improve forest health under provisions in the annual Interior appropriations acts. Since FY2008, funds have again been returned to the Treasury to offset appropriations for roads and for forest health projects under provisions in the annual Interior appropriations acts. Purchaser Elect Roads (NFMA; \u00a714(i))\u2014qualified purchasers who elect to have the USFS build the permanent roads required in the sale contract make deposits to a special account; funds are permanently appropriated to the USFS to build the required roads. General Treasury \u2014any remaining receipts are deposited in the Treasury. Because of the authorized payments to states under the SRS, no timber sale receipts have been deposited in the Treasury since FY2000. Payments to States (various statutes)\u20144% of receipts from timber sales on public domain lands are permanently appropriated to the states. Reclamation Fund ( Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7391)\u201476% of receipts from timber sales on public domain lands in Reclamation states are deposited in the fund; expenditures require an annual appropriation. O&C County Payments (O&C Act of August 28, 1937; 43 U.S.C. \u00a71181f)\u201450% of receipts from O&C timber sales are permanently appropriated to the counties. Note that payments have been based on historical payments, under the same SRS provisions as USFS Payments to States (described above). CBWR County Payments (Act of May 24, 1939; 43 U.S.C. \u00a71181f-1)\u2014up to 75% of receipts from CBWR timber sales, based on tax bills from the counties, are permanently appropriated to the counties. Note that payments have been based on historical payments, under the same SRS provisions as USFS Payments to States (described above). Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund (Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY1993; P.L. 102-391 )\u2014up to 100% of the federal share of receipts\u2014after payments to states and to O&C and CBWR counties\u2014from sales designated as salvage sales, as determined on each sale, are permanently appropriated to the BLM to prepare and administer additional salvage sales. Timber Sales Pipeline Restoration Fund (see \" Forest Service ,\" above)\u2014up to 100% of the federal share of receipts\u2014after payments to counties\u2014from certain canceled-but-reinstated O&C timber sales and from sales prepared with those funds are permanently appropriated to the BLM. Three-quarters of the funds are to prepare additional timber sales and the other quarter is for recreation projects. General Treasury \u2014any remaining receipts are deposited in the Treasury.  The BLM and USFS establish grazing allotments (areas of federal grazing), generally associated with a particular base ranch. The agencies issue permits or leases to ranchers for grazing private livestock on federal lands; the leases or permits are generally for 10 years, and can be (and usually are) renewed. The leases or permits are granted for specified numbers of private livestock, based on several factors, including the amount of vegetation available for livestock and wildlife. Fees are charged for grazing specified numbers of private livestock per month on BLM and USFS lands. The fee charged by the USFS and BLM is administratively set based on a formula established in the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 (PRIA, P.L. 95-514 ). The fee is intended to represent the fair market value of grazing, and is determined by formula with a base value of $1.23 per animal unit month (AUM, one month's use of the range by one animal unit (e.g., a cow with calf)). The formula is annually adjusted for lease rates for grazing on private lands, beef cattle prices, and the cost of livestock production. The current fee is the lowest that can be charged\u2014$1.35 per AUM\u2014for March 1, 2011, to February 28, 2012. The disposition of BLM grazing receipts depends on the lands being grazed. Section 3 of the Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 1934 (TGA; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7315i) authorized grazing districts and grazing permits for those lands, with an allocation of funds for receipts from those grazing permits. Section 15 of the TGA authorized leases for grazing allotments outside of the grazing districts, with a different allocation of receipts for those grazing leases. In both cases (\u00a73 lands and \u00a715 lands), allocations total 100% of receipts. Payments to States, Section 3 Lands (TGA, \u00a73; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7315i)\u201412.5% of receipts from TGA \u00a73 grazing lands are permanently appropriated to the states \"for the benefit of the county or counties in which the grazing district is situated.\" Payments to States, Section 15 Lands (TGA, \u00a715; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7315i)\u201450% of receipts from TGA \u00a715 grazing lands are permanently appropriated to the states \"for the benefit of the county or counties in which the grazing district is situated.\" Range Betterment Fund (Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA); P.L. 94-579 , 43 U.S.C. \u00a71751(b))\u201450% of grazing fees or $10 million, whichever is greater, is allocated to the fund; expenditures require an annual appropriation. By regulation, half of the fund is to be allocated by the Secretary on a priority basis, and the rest is to be spent in the state and district where it was derived. General Treasury \u201437.5% of receipts from TGA \u00a73 lands are deposited in the Treasury. Range Betterment Fund (FLPMA, 43 U.S.C. \u00a71751(b))\u201450% of grazing fees or $10 million, whichever is greater, is allocated to the fund; expenditures require an annual appropriation. National Forest Fund (NFF) \u2014all receipts from leases and sales of national forest resources, except those deposited directly into a particular account\u201450% for grazing\u2014are deposited into this account. Numerous allocations are then made from the NFF, as identified below. Payments to States \u201425% of gross receipts (50% of NFF deposits) are permanently appropriated to the states for use on roads and schools in the counties where the national forests are located. Note that payments may be based on historical payments, under the SRS Act. (See discussion under \" Timber ,\" above.) National Forest Roads and Trails Fund \u201410% of gross receipts (20% of NFF deposits) are permanently appropriated to the USFS, but with exceptions. (See discussion under \" Timber ,\" above.) General Treasury \u2014remaining receipts (15% of gross receipts (30% of NFF deposits)) are deposited in the Treasury. The General Mining Law of 1872 established a system of free access for individuals and corporations to prospect for hardrock (or locatable) minerals (e.g., gold, silver, copper) on open federal lands and to stake a claim on the deposit (30 U.S.C. Chapter 2). The minerals can then be extracted from sites with valid claims. The claim can be \"patented\" to transfer title to the relevant lands to the claimant, although patenting the land is not necessary to extract the minerals. Since FY1995, Congress had included a provision prohibiting land patents under the General Mining Law in the annual Interior appropriations acts. Receipts from hardrock/locatable minerals are generated from fees to locate the claim, an annual fee to maintain the claim, and a per-acre fee to patent the claim. The location fee is $34 per claim to locate and record the claim. The annual maintenance fee is $140 per claim. This fee replaces the previous annual requirement of $100 of development work to maintain each claim. Claimants with 10 claims or fewer may file to waive the annual maintenance fee and perform the annual work assessment instead. Fees are adjusted every five years for inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index. Patenting the claim (which has been prohibited under a provision in the annual Interior appropriations acts since FY1995) includes two fees: Patent application fee is $250, plus $50 per claim for each claim in the application. Land patent fee is $2.50 or $5.00 per acre, depending on the type of claim. Cost of Collections ( P.L. 111-8 , FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act at 123 Stat. 701)\u2014the BLM is authorized to retain a portion of the receipts based on BLM's cost of collections ($32.7 million in FY2007, $34.7 million in FY2008, and $34.7 million in FY2009). General Treasury \u2014any remaining receipts are deposited in the Treasury. Mineral leasing for \"coal, phosphate, sodium, potassium [potash], oil, oil shale, gilsonite (including all vein-type solid hydrocarbons), or gas\" under all federal lands is governed by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. \u00a7181) and the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands (31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7351 et seq.). Leasing auctions and implementing activities are administered by the BLM for all federal lands. Receipts from leasing are collected by the DOI Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE, formerly the Minerals Management Service). For oil and gas, areas identified as known geological structures are offered for lease competitively; for areas with bids less than the identified minimum or outside known geological structures, leases may be offered to applicants without competition for a $75 application fee (in lieu of a bonus bid). Bonus Bids \u2014competitive bonus bidding is used for lease sales, with leases awarded to the highest bidder. A minimum acceptable bonus bid is determined by BOEMRE for each tract offered. Successful bidders make an up-front cash payment, called a bonus bid, to secure the lease. Rents \u2014administratively determined annual payments are charged per acre leased until production commences or the lease is terminated or relinquished. Royalties \u2014payments of a share of production are made, generally set at 12.5% of the value of production. The Secretary may reduce or eliminate the royalty established by the lease to promote increased recovery. Permit Fees \u2014administratively determined fees are charged for filing applications for permits to drill. The fees are intended to recover administrative costs of permit processing Payments to States, except Alaska (Mineral Leasing Act of 1920; 30 U.S.C. \u00a7191)\u201450% of receipts is permanently appropriated to the states. Since FY2008, under language in the Interior appropriation bills, 2% of the states' share (1% of total receipts) is retained by the BLM to cover administrative costs of the leasing program. Reclamation Fund \u201440% of receipts, except in Alaska, are deposited in the Reclamation Fund; expenditures require an annual appropriation. Payments to Alaska (Mineral Leasing Act of 1920; 30 U.S.C. \u00a7191, as amended by P.L. 85-505) \u2014 90% of receipts from leases in Alaska is permanently appropriated to the state. Since FY2008, under language in the Interior appropriation bills, 2% of the state's share (1.8% of receipts from leases in Alaska) is retained by the BLM to cover administrative costs of the leasing program. Federal Administrative Costs \u20142% of the states' share (1% of receipts, except for 1.8% of receipts in Alaska) is retained and permanently appropriated to the BLM to cover administrative costs of the leasing program, under language in the Interior appropriation bills since FY2008. General Treasury \u2014the remaining 10% of receipts is deposited in the Treasury. Leasing minerals (primarily oil and gas) under the federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS, typically from 3 to 200 miles offshore) is governed by the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71301, et seq.). The DOI BOEMRE prepares five-year leasing plans and periodically offers leases at auction. Bonus Bids \u2014competitive sealed bonus bidding is used for lease sales, with leases awarded to the highest bidder. Successful bidders make an up-front cash payment, called a bonus bid, to secure the lease. A minimum acceptable bonus bid is determined by BOEMRE for each tract offered. In contrast to onshore oil and gas leasing, if no bids match or exceed the minimum, the lease is withheld, to be offered again at a later sale. Rents \u2014administratively determined annual payments are charged per acre leased for nonproducing active leases. Royalties \u2014payment of a share of production is made by the successful bidder. Royalty rates are generally set at 12.5%, 16.7%, or 18.75% of the value of production, with the highest rate used in recent offshore lease sales. The Secretary may reduce or eliminate the royalty established by the lease to promote increased recovery. Permit Fees \u2014administratively determined fees are charged for filing and maintaining permits. Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF, P.L. 88-578; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7460 l -4, et seq.) \u2014up to $900 million annually is allocated to the LWCF. It receives deposits from several sources, such as surplus federal property sales and federal motorboat fuel taxes, and then from OCS leasing to fulfill the $900 million annual authorization; expenditures require an annual appropriation. National Historic Preservation Fund (National Historic Preservation Act, P.L. 89-665;16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7470, et seq.)\u2014$150 million annually from OCS lease receipts is allocated to the fund; expenditures require an annual appropriation. Section 8(g) Payments to States (\u00a78(g) of the OCSLA Amendments of 1985, P.L. 99-272 )\u201427% of receipts from \u00a78(g) common pool lands is permanently appropriated to the states; \u00a78(g) common pool lands are defined as submerged acreage lying outside the three-nautical mile state-federal demarcation, typically extending to a total of six nautical miles offshore but including a pool of oil common to both federal and state jurisdiction. A 1978 OCSLA amendment provides for \"fair and equitable\" sharing of revenues from \u00a78(g) common pool lands. Section 8(p) Payments to States (Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) of 2006, P.L. 109-432 , amending OCSLA)\u201437.5% of receipts from specified federal oil and gas leases off the coasts of selected Gulf states is permanently appropriated to those states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas; no leasing occurs off the Florida coast). LWCF, Stateside Program (GOMESA)\u201412.5% of receipts from specified federal oil and gas leases off the coasts of selected Gulf states is permanently appropriated to the National Park Service to be used consistent with the stateside program under the LWCF Act. Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP, Energy Policy Act of 2005, P.L. 109-58 , \u00a7384)\u2014$250 million of annual spending for FY2007-FY2010 is permanently appropriated, 65% to coastal producing states (Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) and 35% to eligible political subdivisions, allocated among states by the formula in law (based on previous qualified OCS revenues). General Treasury \u2014any remaining funds are deposited in the Treasury. Receipts for geothermal leasing are collected by the DOI BOEMRE. Commercial Sales for Electricity Production \u2014Competitive lease sales are held at least every two years. If there are no competitive bids, then lands are made available for two years under a non-competitive process. Bids \u2014competitive bidding, roughly comparable to bonus bidding for other mineral leases, is used for lease sales, with leases awarded to the highest bidder. Royalties On electricity produced directly from geothermal resources, the royalty rate is 1%-2.5% of the gross proceeds from geothermal electricity sales in the first 10 years of production and 2%-5% of the gross proceeds from geothermal electricity sales each year after the 10-year period. For arms-length sales of geothermal heat to a third party for energy production or other purposes, the royalty rate is 10% of the gross proceeds from the sale. Rent For competitive leases, annual rents are $2 per acre for the first year, $3 per acre per year for the second through the tenth years, and $5 per acre annually thereafter. For non-competitive leases, annual rents are $1 per acre per year for the first through the tenth years, and $5 per acre annually thereafter. Direct Use for Heating \u2014fees are based on the quantity or thermal content, or both, of the resource, to encourage resource development and ensure a fair return to the United States. Payments to States (Geothermal Steam Leasing Act, P.L. 91-581;30 U.S.C. \u00a71019)\u201450% of receipts is permanently appropriated to the states where the receipts were generated. Payments to Counties (30 U.S.C. \u00a71019)\u201425% of receipts is permanently appropriated to the counties where the receipts were generated. General Treasury \u201425% of receipts is deposited in the Treasury. Each agency has an array of additional activities that also generate receipts. Many of these include permanent appropriations of receipts from specific sources for specific purposes. With a few exceptions (e.g., USFS recreation and special land use permits listed below), these permanent appropriations are fully dedicated to the specified purposes. Each agency's accounts with receipts of more than $10 million in FY2009 (other than those discussed above) are listed below in decreasing size. Park Concessions Franchise Fees , $58.2 million in FY2009\u2014administrative fees are collected from National Park System concessions to approximate fair market value. Collections are permanently appropriated; 80% are for use at the park unit where the funds were collected, and 20% are available to the Secretary for high priority management and operations throughout the National Park System. Donations , $31.2 million in FY2009\u2014contributions from the public are permanently appropriated for management and operations of the National Park System. Operation and Maintenance of Quarters , $20.0 million in FY2009\u2014salary deductions from employees living in NPS housing are permanently appropriated for the operations and maintenance of that housing. Concessions Improvement Accounts , $13.7 million in FY2009\u2014concessionaire deposits are permanently appropriated for facility improvements at the park units where the funds were collected. Transportation System , $11.0 million in FY2009\u2014fees collected for public transportation services to any National Park System unit, authorized by P.L. 105-391 (the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998) are permanently appropriated to the NPS. Recreation Fees (other than under FLREA), $50.2 million in FY2009\u2014receipts from ski area permits, cabin fees, and other permitted recreation activities. Fees are disposed to states (25% payments), to the roads and trails fund (10%), and to the General Treasury (65%).
