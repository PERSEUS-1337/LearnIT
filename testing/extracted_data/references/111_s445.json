    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Attorney-Client Privilege Protection \nAct of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Justice is served when all parties to litigation are \n        represented by experienced diligent counsel.\n            (2) Protecting attorney-client privileged communications \n        from compelled disclosure fosters voluntary compliance with the \n        law.\n            (3) To serve the purpose of the attorney-client privilege, \n        attorneys and clients must have a degree of confidence that \n        they will not be required to disclose privileged \n        communications.\n            (4) The ability of an organization to have effective \n        compliance programs and to conduct comprehensive internal \n        investigations is enhanced when there is clarity and \n        consistency regarding the attorney-client privilege.\n            (5) Prosecutors, investigators, enforcement officials, and \n        other officers or employees of Government agencies have been \n        able to, and can continue to, conduct their work while \n        respecting attorney-client and work product protections and the \n        rights of individuals, including seeking and discovering facts \n        crucial to the investigation and prosecution of organizations.\n            (6) Congress recognized that law enforcement can \n        effectively investigate without attorney-client privileged \n        information when it banned demands by the Attorney General for \n        privileged materials in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt \n        Organizations Act. See section 1968(c)(2) of title 18, United \n        States Code.\n            (7) Despite the existence of numerous investigative tools \n        that do not impact the attorney-client relationship, the \n        Department of Justice and other agencies have increasingly \n        created and implemented policies that tend to undermine the \n        adversarial system of justice, such as encouraging \n        organizations to waive attorney-client privilege and work \n        product protections to avoid indictment or other sanctions.\n            (8) An indictment can have devastating consequences on an \n        organization, potentially eliminating the ability of the \n        organization to survive post-indictment or to dispute the \n        charges against it at trial.\n            (9) Waiver demands and related policies of Government \n        agencies are encroaching on the constitutional rights and other \n        legal protections of employees.\n            (10) As recognized throughout the common law, and \n        specifically in the crime-fraud exception, the attorney-client \n        privilege, work product doctrine, and payment of counsel fees \n        cannot and shall not be used as devices to conceal wrongdoing \n        or to cloak advice on evading the law.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to place on each agency \nclear and practical limits designed to preserve the attorney-client \nprivilege and work product protections available to an organization and \npreserve the constitutional rights and other legal protections \navailable to employees of such an organization.\n\nSEC. 3.
