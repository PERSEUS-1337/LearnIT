FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) nuclear energy provides--\n                    (A) approximately 19 percent of the electricity of \n                the United States; and\n                    (B) approximately 70 percent of the carbon-dioxide \n                free electricity of the United States;\n            (2) nuclear energy has the lowest land-use requirements per \n        megawatt of any electricity generating source;\n            (3) the majority of the 104 operating reactors located in \n        the United States were constructed during a 20-year time period \n        beginning in 1970 and ending in 1990; and\n            (4) a broader deployment of nuclear energy (including novel \n        methods such as the development of small reactors and advanced \n        fuel cycles) would greatly improve the ability of the United \n        States--\n                    (A) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and\n                    (B) to maintain low electricity prices.\n\nSEC. 3.
