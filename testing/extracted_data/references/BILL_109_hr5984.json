If no such agreement is entered into during such \n        year, such agency or the chief executive of the State shall \n        have 6 months (beginning at the end of such 1-year period) to \n        enter into such an agreement with the Secretary. If, at the end \n        of such 6-month period, no agreement has been entered into, the \n        Secretary shall conduct owner location and claims processing \n        with respect to such State.\n            (2) Owner location and claims agreements.--Each owner \n        location and claims agreement shall be substantially the same \n        for each State and shall provide for the following with respect \n        to specified unredeemed savings bonds assigned for processing \n        to such State:\n                    (A) Provision of records to states.--The Secretary \n                shall provide the State or its representative such \n                records with respect to such bonds as the Secretary \n                determines are necessary or appropriate to carry out \n                the purposes of this section.\n                    (B) Written notification to bondholders of \n                record.--The State or its representative shall mail to \n                each owner of record of such a bond, with respect to \n                whom an address suitable for the delivery of mail is \n                determined under subsection (b), a written notification \n                regarding the existence of such bond and that such bond \n                is no longer earning interest.\n                    (C) Additional notification efforts; \n                restrictions.--The State or its representative shall \n                make such additional efforts to locate the owners of \n                such bonds as the Secretary may provide. The Secretary \n                may provide for such restrictions on efforts utilized \n                to locate such owners as the Secretary determines \n                appropriate, including any restrictions on the use of \n                commercial locator services.\n                    (D) Claims processing and verification.--The State \n                or its representative shall receive, process, and \n                verify claims for such bonds and shall transmit to the \n                Secretary verified claims.\n                    (E) Reunification payments to states.--Subject to \n                the limitation of subsection (c)(4)(B), the Secretary \n                shall direct the Federal depositary referred to in \n                subsection (c) to pay the State a fee each month equal \n                to 25 percent of the amount paid under subsection \n                (c)(3) during the preceding month with respect to bonds \n                verified by such State.

The aggregate amount paid to the State \n                under this subparagraph may not exceed 5 percent of the \n                aggregate amount which would be paid from the \n                redemption account if all the specified unredeemed \n                savings bonds assigned to the State were redeemed.\n    (b) Examination of Bond Records; Establishment of Database.--Not \nlater than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary shall enter into a cooperative agreement (within the meaning \nof section 6305 of title 31, United States Code) with the State \ncoordinator which provides for the following with respect to the \nspecified unredeemed savings bonds:\n            (1) Access to bond records.--The Secretary shall provide \n        the State coordinator with full access to records related to \n        such bonds.\n            (2) Compilation of information.--The State coordinator \n        shall compile relevant information with respect to such bonds \n        and make the results of such compilation available to the \n        Secretary for the Secretary's review and concurrence.\n            (3) Assignment of bonds to states for processing.--The \n        State coordinator shall make a recommendation to the Secretary \n        regarding to which State each bond should be assigned for \n        processing under subsection (a).

The Secretary shall make the final \n        determination regarding the State to which each bond is \n        assigned for processing after taking into account the \n        recommendation of the State coordinator. Such determination by \n        the Secretary shall be conclusive and shall not be subject to \n        judicial review.\n            (4) Searchable database.--After the Secretary concurs with \n        the information compiled under paragraph (2), the State \n        coordinator shall establish a searchable database which \n        includes such information with respect to each bond and the \n        State to which each bond is assigned for processing.
