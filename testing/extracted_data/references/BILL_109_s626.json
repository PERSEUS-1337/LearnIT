FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the top public \n        health threats facing our Nation today. More than 18,000,000 \n        Americans are currently living with diabetes and that number is \n        expected to double by the year 2050. Diabetes is the sixth \n        leading cause of death in the United States, causing more than \n        200,000 deaths each year.\n            (2) Diabetes occurs in two forms. Type 1 diabetes is caused \n        by the body's inability to produce insulin, a hormone that \n        allows glucose to enter and fuel cells. Type 2 diabetes occurs \n        when the body fails to make enough insulin or fails to properly \n        use it. Type 1 diabetes typically develops in childhood or \n        adolescence and accounts for only 5 to 10 percent of cases of \n        diabetes. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of \n        diabetes cases and most often appears among people older than \n        40. It is especially common in the medicare population, as 1 in \n        5 adults over age 65 has type 2 diabetes.\n            (3) Diabetes is a costly disease. In 2002, diabetes \n        accounted for $132,000,000,000 in direct and indirect health \n        care costs. It is especially costly for the medicare program. \n        Individuals with diabetes represent approximately 20 percent of \n        medicare beneficiaries but account for more than 30 percent of \n        fee-for-service medicare expenditures.\n            (4) People with type 1 diabetes are required to take daily \n        insulin injections to stay alive. While some people with type 2 \n        diabetes need daily insulin injections, others with type 2 \n        diabetes can control their diabetes through healthy meal plans, \n        exercise, and, for some, oral medications. Diabetes self \n        management training (in this section referred to as ``DSMT''), \n        also called diabetes education, provides knowledge and skills \n        training to patients with diabetes, helping them identify \n        barriers, facilitate problem solving, and develop coping skills \n        to effectively manage their diabetes. A certified diabetes \n        educator is a health care professional, often a nurse, \n        dietitian, or pharmacist, who specializes in helping people \n        with diabetes develop the self-management skills needed to stay \n        healthy and avoid costly acute complications and emergency \n        care, as well as debilitating secondary conditions caused by \n        diabetes.\n            (5) DSMT has been proven effective in helping to reduce the \n        risks and complications of diabetes. In 2002, the Diabetes \n        Prevention Program study found that participants (all of whom \n        were at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes) who made \n        lifestyle changes, such as those taught in DSMT programs, \n        reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. \n        Lifestyle intervention worked in all of the groups but it \n        worked particularly well in people aged 60 and older, reducing \n        the development of diabetes by 71 percent. Similarly, studies \n        have found that patients under the care of a certified diabetes \n        educator are better able to control their diabetes and report \n        improvement in their health status. Congress recognized the \n        value of DSMT by creating medicare coverage for this benefit \n        under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n            (6) There are currently more than 20,000 diabetes educators \n        in the United States, most of whom are certified diabetes \n        educators credentialed by the National Certification Board for \n        Diabetes Educators (NCBDE). Eligibility for certification as a \n        diabetes educator requires prerequisite qualifying professional \n        credentials in specified health care professions and \n        professional practice experience that includes a minimum number \n        of hours of experience in DSMT. Certified diabetes educators \n        must also pass a rigorous national examination and periodically \n        renew their credentials. Certified diabetes educators are \n        uniquely qualified to provide DSMT under the medicare program.\n\nSEC. 3.
