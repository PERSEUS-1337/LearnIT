    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``International Arbitration \nEnforcement Act of 1996''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Arbitration is an efficient and flexible dispute \n        resolution mechanism of great benefit to United States persons \n        doing business internationally.\n            (2) In some countries, particularly those with undeveloped \n        or inconsistent judicial systems, international arbitration may \n        be the only fair and reliable dispute resolution mechanism \n        available to United States persons.\n            (3) The usefulness of international arbitration depends in \n        large measure on the commitment of foreign states to enforce \n        foreign arbitral awards pursuant to their accession to, and \n        observance of, the Convention on the Recognition and \n        Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.\n            (4) United States persons are often without remedies when \n        foreign states violate the Convention by refusing to enforce \n        foreign arbitral awards or by otherwise impairing the ability \n        to collect the awards by improperly delaying their enforcement.\n            (5) It is in the interest of the United States to maintain \n        the reliability of international arbitration, to promote the \n        observance of the Convention, and to protect United States \n        persons from economic injury resulting from violations of the \n        Convention by foreign states.\n            (6) Similarly, it would be unjust to permit a foreign state \n        to be shielded from liability in the United States for the \n        damages suffered by a United States person abroad resulting \n        from a violation of the Convention by the foreign state.\n            (7) It is therefore in the national interest to create a \n        judicial remedy in favor of United States persons injured as a \n        result of a violation of the Convention by a foreign state and \n        to facilitate the execution of any judgment entered in such an \n        action.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to create a civil remedy against foreign \nstates whose violation of the Convention injures United States persons \nby prohibiting the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards entered in \nfavor of such United States persons or by impairing the ability of such \nUnited States persons to collect such awards.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act--\n            (1) Convention.--The term ``Convention'' means the \n        Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign \n        Arbitral Awards, done at New York on June 10, 1958.\n            (2) United states person.--The term ``United States \n        person'' means--\n                    (A) any United States citizen or alien admitted for \n                permanent residence into the United States; and\n                    (B) any corporation, trust, partnership, or other \n                judicial entity which is 50 percent or more \n                beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by \n                individuals described in subparagraph (A).\n            (3) Foreign arbitral award.--The term ``foreign arbitral \n        award'' means any arbitral award to which the Convention \n        applies.\n\nSEC. 5.
