REDUCTION OF AGENCY EMPLOYMENT LEVELS.\n\n    (a) Total full-time equivalent employment in each agency shall be \nreduced by one for each separation of an employee who receives a \nvoluntary separation incentive payment under this Act. The reduction \nwill be calculated by comparing the agency's full-time equivalent \nemployment for the fiscal year in which the voluntary separation \npayments are made with the actual full-time equivalent employment for \nthe prior fiscal year.\n    (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall monitor all agencies \nand take any action necessary to ensure that the requirements of this \nsection are met.\n    (c) The President shall take appropriate action to ensure that \nfunctions involving more than 10 full-time equivalent employees are not \nconverted to contracts by reason of the enactment of this Act, except \nin cases in which a cost comparison demonstrates such contracts would \nbe to the advantage of the Government.\n    (d) The provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section may \nbe waived upon a determination by the President that--\n            (1) the existence of a state of war or other national \n        emergency so requires; or\n            (2) the existence of an extraordinary emergency which \n        threatens life, health, safety, property, or the environment so \n        requires.\n\nSEC. 8.
