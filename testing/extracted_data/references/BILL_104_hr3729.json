FINDINGS AND DEFINITION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Although the United States possesses the technological \n        means to develop and deploy defensive systems that would be \n        highly effective in countering limited ballistic missile \n        threats to its territory, its ability to detect and intercept \n        weapons of mass destruction delivered by unconventional means \n        is limited.\n            (2) It is axiomatic that the incentive for the \n        unconventional delivery of weapons of mass destruction will \n        increase in direct proportion to the perceived effectiveness of \n        theater missile and other regular military defense systems.\n            (3) The target of weapons of mass destruction may not be \n        military in the usual sense of the term and, as such, the \n        threat that is posed to the citizens of the United States by \n        chemical and biological weapons delivered by nonconventional \n        means is significant and growing.\n            (4) Several countries that are hostile to the United \n        States, including Iraq, Libya, and Iran, have demonstrated an \n        interest in acquiring the technology necessary to manufacture \n        weapons of mass destruction.\n            (5) In addition, the acquisition or the development and use \n        of weapons of mass destruction is well within the capability of \n        many extremist and terrorist movements, acting independently or \n        as proxies, and states can transfer weapons to or otherwise aid \n        such movements indirectly and with plausible deniability.\n            (6) Covert or unconventional means of delivery, which may \n        be preferable to both States and non-State organizations, \n        include cargo ships, passenger aircraft, commercial and private \n        vehicles and vessels, or commercial cargo shipments routed \n        through multiple destinations.\n            (7) Traditional arms control efforts assume large state \n        efforts with detectable manufacturing and weaponization \n        programs in peacetime but are ineffective in monitoring and \n        controlling the development of a capability to manufacture \n        suddenly chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons with little \n        or no warning and with nothing but commercial supplies and \n        equipment. Such efforts are also incapable of predicting and \n        tracking transfers of capabilities relating to weapons of mass \n        destruction.\n            (8) Because of the dire consequences to the citizens of the \n        United States posed by weapons of mass destruction, and because \n        traditional arms control efforts are inadequate, it is prudent \n        to commence a coordinated effort among local, State, and \n        Federal emergency response organizations to develop \ntechnologies and capabilities to detect and intercept weapons of mass \ndestruction, to equip and protect those emergency response \norganizations who are first on the scene, and, where necessary, to \ndecontaminate areas where such weapons are manufactured or detonated.\n            (9) Congress has repeatedly expressed concern about the use \n        of weapons of mass destruction, stating in November 1993 (in \n        section 1704 of the National Defense Authorization Act For \n        Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 50 U.S.C. 1522 note)) \n        that ``the President should strengthen Federal interagency \n        emergency planning by the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n        and other appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies for \n        development of a capability for early detection and warning of \n        and response to--\n            ``(1) potential terrorist use of chemical or biological \n        agents or weapons; and\n            ``(2) emergencies or natural disasters involving industrial \n        chemicals or the widespread outbreak of disease.''.\n    (b) Weapons of Mass Destruction Defined.--For purposes of this Act, \nthe term ``weapons of mass destruction'' means chemical, biological, \nand nuclear weapons (whether militarized or improvised) that are \ndesigned to spread their contents through explosions or other \ndissemination means.\n\nSEC. 3.
