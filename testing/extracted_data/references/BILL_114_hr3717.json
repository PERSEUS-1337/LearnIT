FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the highest national security interests of the \n        United States to develop neuroscience-related research and \n        neurotechnology.\n            (2) The State of Israel is a steadfast ally of the United \n        States.\n            (3) The four existing bilateral research and development \n        (in this Act referred to as ``R&D'') foundations are successful \n        tools for implementation of diverse programmatic R&D \n        cooperation and include--\n                    (A) the United States-Israel Binational Industrial \n                Research and Development Foundation;\n                    (B) the United States-Israel Binational Science \n                Foundation;\n                    (C) the United States-Israel Binational \n                Agricultural Research and Development Foundation; and\n                    (D) the United States-Israel Science & Technology \n                Foundation.\n            (4) Given this proven success, it is in the economic \n        interest of the United States to develop closer research, high-\n        technology and innovation ties with Israel in strategic areas \n        of mutual interest.\n            (5) Both governments agreed to reach an umbrella Science & \n        Technology Agreement under which existing R&D and Innovation \n        funding programs can operate jointly on common priorities, in \n        order to intensify, further and deepen the science and \n        technology (in this Act referred to as ``S&T'') and innovation \n        links between the United States and Israel beyond the existing \n        bilateral foundations operations. The United States Department \n        of State is drafting this Agreement. Congress supports this \n        agreement and its implementation through Federal R&D and \n        innovation programs.\n            (6) The State of Israel has a centralized mechanism for \n        policy and funding industrial R&D within the Ministry of \n        Economy's Industrial R&D Administration, known as the Office of \n        the Chief Scientist (in this Act referred to as ``OCS''). The \n        OCS is the State of Israel's national authority in charge of \n        policy and budgeting of industrial R&D and innovation.\n            (7) The U.S.-Israel Joint Economic Development Group, a \n        binational economic dialogue between both governments (in this \n        Act referred to as ``JEDG'') to further enhance cooperation \n        between the United States and Israel, requested the United \n        States-Israel Science & Technology Foundation map and identify \n        mechanisms of research and development in neuroscience and \n        neurotechnology that can support further collaboration between \n        the countries.\n            (8) Israeli scientists and engineers are at the forefront \n        of research and development in the field of neuroscience.\n            (9) Israel Brain Technologies is a nonprofit organization \n        whose mission is to turn Israel into a global brain technology \n        and research leader by--\n                    (A) supporting applied brain research;\n                    (B) accelerating brain technology development;\n                    (C) creating and fostering a community around \n                neurotechnology; and\n                    (D) attracting key stakeholders to partner and \n                support brain technology in Israel.\n            (10) Enhanced cooperation between the United States and \n        Israel for the purpose of research and development of \n        neuroscience that would be in the national interests of both \n        countries.\n    (b) Bilateral Industrial R&D and Innovation Programs.--\n            (1) Congress supports the expansion of U.S.-Israel industry \n        driven R&D with Federal and State entities through innovation \n        linkages to promote economic growth and job creation.\n            (2) It is in the best interest of the United States to hold \n        a regular dialogue with Israel's OCS aiming to identify \n        potential synergies and coordinating bilateral cooperation \n        between R&D programs supported by the Federal Government and \n        the Government of Israel detailing pathways to partnership with \n        the OCS, and Israel's Ministry of Science, Technology, and \n        Space (in this Act referred to as ``MOST'').\n\nSEC. 3.
