FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A career guidance and counseling program develops an \n        individual's competencies in self-knowledge, educational and \n        occupational exploration, and career planning.\n            (2) Career guidance and counseling programs help \n        individuals acquire the knowledge, skills, and experience \n        necessary to identify options, explore alternatives, and \n        succeed in a 21st century society.\n            (3) The American School Counselor Association recommends a \n        student-to-counselor ratio of two-hundred fifty to one. Forty-\n        seven States do not meet this recommendation.\n            (4) School counselors design and implement comprehensive \n        school counseling programs that include educational and career \n        planning activities for all students that are designed to \n        assist students in reaching academic, career, and personal \n        goals.\n            (5) Students at schools with highly integrated, rigorous, \n        academic and career and technical education programs have \n        significantly higher achievement in reading, mathematics, and \n        science than do students at schools with less integrated \n        programs.\n\nSEC. 3.
