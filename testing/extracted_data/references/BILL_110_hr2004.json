FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Given the increased threat to American ideals in the \n        trying times in which we live, it is important to preserve and \n        defend our common heritage of freedom and civilization and to \n        ensure that future generations of Americans understand the \n        importance of traditional American history and the principles \n        of free government on which this Nation was founded in order to \n        provide the basic knowledge that is essential to full and \n        informed participation in civic life and to the larger vibrancy \n        of the American experiment in self-government, binding together \n        a diverse people into a single Nation with a common purpose.\n            (2) However, despite its importance, most of the Nation's \n        colleges and universities no longer require United States \n        history or systematic study of Western civilization and free \n        institutions as a prerequisite to graduation.\n            (3) In addition, too many of our Nation's elementary and \n        secondary school history teachers lack the training necessary \n        to effectively teach these subjects, due largely to the \n        inadequacy of their teacher preparation.\n            (4) Distinguished historians and intellectuals fear that \n        without a common civic memory and a common understanding of the \n        remarkable individuals, events, and ideals that have shaped our \n        Nation and its free institutions, the people in the United \n        States risk losing much of what it means to be an American, as \n        well as the ability to fulfill the fundamental responsibilities \n        of citizens in a democracy.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to promote and sustain \npostsecondary academic centers, institutes, and programs that offer \nundergraduate and graduate courses, support research, sponsor lectures, \nseminars, and conferences, and develop teaching materials, for the \npurpose of developing and imparting a knowledge of traditional American \nhistory, the American founding, and the history and nature of, and \nthreats to, free institutions, or of the nature, history and \nachievements of western civilization, particularly for--\n            (1) undergraduate students who are enrolled in teacher \n        education programs, who may consider becoming school teachers, \n        or who wish to enhance their civic competence;\n            (2) elementary, middle, and secondary school teachers in \n        need of additional training in order to effectively teach in \n        these subject areas; and\n            (3) graduate students and postsecondary faculty who wish to \n        teach about these subject areas with greater knowledge and \n        effectiveness.\n\nSEC. 3.
