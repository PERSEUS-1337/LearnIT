    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Competition in Foreign Commerce \nAct of 1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States makes substantial contributions and \n        provides significant funding for major international \n        development projects through international financial \n        institutions and bilateral nonhumanitarian assistance.\n            (2) These international development projects are often \n        plagued with fraud, corruption, waste, inefficiency, and misuse \n        of funding.\n            (3) Fraud, corruption, waste, inefficiency, misuse, and \n        abuse are major impediments to competition in foreign commerce \n        throughout the world.\n            (4) Identifying these impediments after they occur is \n        inadequate and meaningless.\n            (5) Detection of impediments before they occur helps to \n        ensure that valuable United States resources contributed to \n        important international development projects are used \n        appropriately.\n            (6) Independent third-party procurement monitoring is an \n        important tool for detecting and preventing such impediments.\n            (7) Third-party procurement monitoring includes evaluations \n        of each stage of the procurement process and assures the \n        openness and transparency of the process.\n            (8) Improving transparency and openness in the procurement \n        process helps to minimize fraud, corruption, waste, \n        inefficiency, and other misuse of funding, and promotes \n        competition, thereby strengthening international trade and \n        foreign commerce.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to build on the excellent \nprogress associated with the Organization on Economic Development and \nCooperation Agreement on Bribery and Corruption by promoting the use of \nindependent third-party procurement monitoring as part of United States \nparticipation in the international financial institutions and in the \ndisbursement by the United States of bilateral nonhumanitarian foreign \nassistance funds, so as to ensure open, efficient, and transparent \ngovernment procurement practices.\n\nSEC. 3.
