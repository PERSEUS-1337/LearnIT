FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Obesity in the United States has reached crisis \n        proportions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention (CDC), more than a third of all American adults are \n        now overweight. Of even greater concern, the percentage of \n        children and adolescents who are overweight leaped to 16 \n        percent in 2006, a percentage which has more than doubled since \n        1980.\n            (2) Overweight adolescents are likely to become overweight \n        adults, at risk of developing obesity-related, life-threatening \n        diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart \n        disease, arthritis, and breathing problems. They will join an \n        adult population struggling with a staggering 61 percent \n        overweight rate. Not only will the Nation's children face life-\n        threatening diseases at younger ages, they will face academic \n        challenges due to poor health behaviors--resulting in even \n        greater risk to their future health and earning and the \n        Nation's economic growth and worldwide competition.\n            (3) Obesity and insufficient physical activity are not \n        merely personal issues. Rather, these are public health \n        problems with wide-ranging implications for the Nation's \n        economy and quality of life. Research shows that a significant \n        community-based response can halt the rising tide, and a \n        comprehensive, multi tiered approach shows the greatest promise \n        of success and sustainability. A program thrives when it works \n        for change not only on the individual level, but also within \n        communities and across a broad spectrum of society. In \n        addition, it is vitally important to understand the cultural \n        context of each community and to partner with them in building \n        relevant and meaningful programs.\n            (4) State chronic disease programs have depended heavily \n        upon the CDC for funding to address obesity. The obesity \n        epidemic has outpaced Federal support, contributing to the \n        escalating rise of obesity in an increasingly younger \n        population. Clearly the obesity epidemic is also affecting the \n        preparedness of the United States. Health and fitness have \n        always been a critical concern to the Nation's military, \n        police, fire departments, and first responders.\n            (5) Military sources state that 80 percent of recruits who \n        exceed the military weight-for-height standards at entry leave \n        the military before they complete their first term of \n        enlistment. This in turn increases the cost of recruitment and \n        training. These issues threaten the long-term welfare and \n        readiness of United States military forces and associated \n        preparedness responders such as police, fire departments, and \n        first responders.\n            (6) Obesity and overweight are not just a public health \n        issue, but also a national security issue. If the Nation's \n        society is not physically fit, we will not be able to defend \n        ourselves and the Nation's common interests.\n            (7) This Act rises to the obesity challenge, with \n        innovative ways to help children and young adults be physically \n        active and eat more nutritiously.\n\nSEC. 3. COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAM TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND GOOD \n              NUTRITION AND PREVENT OBESITY AND CHRONIC DISEASE.\n\n    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 317S the following:\n\n``SEC. 317T.
