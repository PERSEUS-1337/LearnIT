FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One of the fundamental tenets of the World Trade \n        Organization (WTO) is reciprocal market access. This principle \n        is underscored in the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the \n        World Trade Organization which called for ``entering into \n        reciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements directed to \n        the substantial reduction of tariffs and other barriers to \n        trade and to the elimination of discriminatory treatment in \n        international trade relations''.\n            (2) The American people have a right to expect that the \n        promises that trade negotiators and policy makers offer in \n        terms of the market access opportunities that will be available \n        to United States businesses and their employees if trade \n        agreements are reached, will, in fact, be realized. A results-\n        oriented approach must form the basis of future trade \n        negotiations that includes verification procedures to ensure \n        that the promised market access is achieved and that reciprocal \n        trade benefits result.\n            (3) With each subsequent round of bilateral, regional, and \n        multilateral trade negotiations, tariffs have been \n        significantly reduced or eliminated for many manufactured \n        goods, leaving nontariff barriers as the most pervasive, \n        significant, and challenging barriers to United States exports \n        and market opportunities.\n            (4) The United States market is widely recognized as one of \n        the most open markets in the world. Average United States \n        tariff rates are very low and the United States has limited, if \n        any, nontariff barriers.\n            (5) Often the only leverage the United States has to obtain \n        the reduction or elimination of nontariff barriers imposed by \n        foreign countries is to negotiate the amount of tariffs the \n        United States imposes on imports from those foreign countries.\n            (6) Under the current negotiating process, negotiations to \n        reduce or eliminate tariff barriers and nontariff barriers are \n        separate and self-contained, meaning that tradeoffs are tariff-\n        for-tariff and nontariff-for-nontariff. As a result, a tariff \n        can be reduced or eliminated without securing elimination of \n        the real barrier or barriers that deny United States businesses \n        access to a foreign market.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require that United \nStates trade negotiations achieve measurable results for United States \nbusinesses by ensuring that trade agreements result in expanded market \naccess for United States exports and not solely the elimination of \ntariffs on goods imported into the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RATES OF DUTY \n              PURSUANT TO CERTAIN TRADE AGREEMENTS.\n\n    (a) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on or \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act, the President may not \nagree to a modification of an existing duty that would reduce or \neliminate the bound or applied rate of such duty on any product in \norder to carry out a trade agreement entered into between the United \nStates and a foreign country until the President transmits to Congress \na certification described in subsection (b).\n    (b) Certification.--A certification referred to in subsection (a) \nis a certification by the President that--\n            (1) the United States has obtained the reduction or \n        elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and \n        practices of the government of a foreign country described in \n        subsection (a) with respect to United States exports of any \n        product identified by United States domestic producers as \n        having the same physical characteristics and uses as the \n        product for which a modification of an existing duty is sought \n        by the President as described in subsection (a); and\n            (2) a violation of any provision of the trade agreement \n        described in subsection (a) relating to the matters described \n        in paragraph (1) is immediately enforceable in accordance with \n        the provisions of section 4.\n\nSEC. 4.
