FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the serious ground level ozone, noise, water pollution, \n        and solid waste disposal problems attendant to airport \n        operations require a thorough evaluation of all significant \n        sources of pollution;\n            (2) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.)--\n                    (A) requires each State to reduce emissions \n                contributing to ground level ozone problems and \n                maintain those reductions; and\n                    (B) requires the Administrator of the Environmental \n                Protection Agency to study, in addition to other \n                sources, the effects of sporadic, extreme noise (such \n                as jet noise near airports) on public health and \n                welfare;\n            (3) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 \n        et seq.) establishes a regulatory and enforcement program for \n        discharges of wastes into waters;\n            (4) the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) \n        establishes primary drinking water standards and a ground water \n        control program;\n            (5) the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.) \n        regulates management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste;\n            (6) a study of air pollution problems in California--\n                    (A) has determined that airports are significant \n                sources of air pollution; and\n                    (B) has led to the creation of an airport bubble \n                concept; and\n            (7) the airport bubble concept is an approach that--\n                    (A) treats an airport and the area within a \n                specific radius around the airport as a single source \n                of pollution that emits a range of pollutants, \n                including air, noise, water, and solid waste; and\n                    (B) seeks, by implementation of specific programs \n                or regulations, to reduce the pollution from each \n                source within the bubble and thereby reduce the overall \n                pollution in that area.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require the \nAdministrator to conduct--\n            (1) a feasibility study for applying airport bubbles to \n        airports as a method of assessing and reducing, where \n        appropriate, air, noise, water, and solid waste pollution in \n        and around the airports and improving overall environmental \n        quality; and\n            (2) a study of air pollutant emission standards established \n        by the Environmental Protection Agency for airplane engines to \n        determine whether it is feasible and desirable to strengthen \n        the standards.\n\nSEC. 3.
