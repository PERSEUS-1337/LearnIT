    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 23363.1 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:\n23363.1.\n(a) A distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s license or a craft distiller\u2019s license authorizes the licensee to conduct tastings of distilled spirits produced or bottled by, or produced or bottled for, the licensee, on or off the licensee\u2019s premises.\n(b) (1) Distilled spirits tastings may be conducted by the licensee off the licensee\u2019s premises only for an event sponsored by a nonprofit organization. A distilled spirits manufacturer shall not sell or solicit sales of distilled spirits at an event. The sponsoring organization shall first obtain a permit from the department.\n(2) For purposes of this subdivision, \u201cnonprofit organization\u201d does not include any community college or other institution of higher learning, as defined in the Education Code, nor does it include any officially recognized club, fraternity, or sorority, whether or not that entity is located on or off the institution\u2019s campus.\n(c) Tastings on the licensee\u2019s premises shall be subject to the following conditions:\n(1) The total volume of tastings of distilled spirits shall not exceed one and one-half ounces per individual per day.\n(2) Tastings shall only include the products that are authorized to be produced or bottled by or for the licensee.\n(3) A person under 21 years of age shall not serve tastes of distilled spirits.\n(d) Notwithstanding Section 25600, the licensee may provide distilled spirits without charge for any tastings conducted pursuant to this section. The licensee may charge for tastings conducted by the licensee on its licensed premises.\n(e) This section shall not relieve the holder of a distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s license of any civil or criminal liability arising out of a violation of Section 25602.\nSEC. 2.\nArticle 6 (commencing with Section 23500) is added to Chapter 3 of Division 9 of the Business and Professions Code, to read:\nArticle  6. Craft Distiller\u2019s Licenses\n23500.\nThis act shall be known, and may be referenced as, the Craft Distillers Act of 2015.\n23501.\nThe Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) The regulation and licensing of the sale of alcoholic beverages in this state has operated for over 80 years under what is commonly referred to as the \u201cthree-tier system,\u201d which generally prohibits vertical integration within the distilled spirits industry. This system has helped in protecting against undue marketing influences within the distilled spirits industry and assisted the goals of promoting temperance and reasonable regulation of the sale of distilled spirits within the state. In addition, this system has helped create thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic development within California.\n(b) Small craft distillers have begun to operate in this state, and these craft distillers have begun to increase employment and provide jobs and economic development in various locations within the state.\n(c) It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this act, to encourage the development of the craft distilling industry within the state by enacting various limited exemptions to the general provisions of the three-tier system, while also continuing to uphold and support the three-tier system as the appropriate mechanism for regulating and licensing the sale of distilled spirits in California.\n23502.\n(a) The department may issue a craft distiller\u2019s license to a person that has facilities and equipment for the purposes of, and is engaged in, the commercial manufacture of distilled spirits. The craft distiller\u2019s license authorizes the licensee to do all of the following:\n(1) Manufacture distilled spirits. A licensed craft distiller may manufacture up to 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per fiscal year (July 1 through June 30), excluding brandy the craft distiller manufactures or has manufactured for them pursuant to a brandy manufacturer license, as reported to the department in the manner prescribed by the department for the fiscal year prior to the date of submitting an application for the license.\n(2) Package, rectify, mix, flavor, color, label, and export only those distilled spirits manufactured by the licensee.\n(3) Only sell distilled spirits that are manufactured and packaged by the licensee solely to a wholesaler, manufacturer, winegrower, manufacturer\u2019s agent, or rectifier that holds a license authorizing the sale of distilled spirits or to persons that take delivery of those distilled spirits within this state for delivery or use without the state.\n(4) Deal in warehouse receipts.\n(b) A craft distiller\u2019s license shall not be issued to any person, any officer, director, employee, or agent of such person, or any person who is affiliated with, directly or indirectly, a person that manufactures or has manufactured for them more than 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per year within or without the state, excluding brandy it manufactures or has manufactured for them pursuant to a brandy manufacturer license, or to any person that is affiliated with, directly or indirectly, a wholesaler.\n(c) (1) The fee for an original craft distiller\u2019s license issued pursuant to this section shall be consistent with the distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s license and shall be adjusted pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 23320.\n(2) The annual license fee for a craft distiller\u2019s license shall be consistent with the distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s license and shall be adjusted pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 23320.\n(3) All moneys collected as fees pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund as provided in Section 25761.\n(d) A licensed craft distiller shall report to the department, at the time of renewal in the manner prescribed by the department, the amount of distilled spirits manufactured, excluding brandy manufactured by or for the licensee pursuant to a brandy manufacturer license, during the previous fiscal year.
