    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Health Care Trust Fund \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) war is inherently unpredictable, and the true cost of \n        health care related to conflicts is often not fully understood \n        until several decades later;\n            (2) an independent estimate from Harvard University found \n        that over the next 40-50 years, the costs related to health \n        care and disability compensation for the wars in Iraq and \n        Afghanistan will exceed $970 billion;\n            (3) this is evidenced by the growing treatment costs for \n        conditions related to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam \n        Veterans, Gulf War Syndrome in Gulf War Veterans, and \n        conditions related to burn pit exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan \n        Veterans; and\n            (4) taking steps to address these costs now ensures that \n        Congress fully accounts for these costs when considering the \n        use of military force and that our Nation is better postured to \n        address the long-term and unforeseen health care needs of its \n        veterans.\n\nSEC. 3.
