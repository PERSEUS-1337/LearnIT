FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) Federal officials do not have sufficient manpower or \n        resources to prevent criminals, terrorists, and foreign \n        nationals who have entered the United States illegally from \n        engaging in criminal activity. Local and State law enforcement \n        officials are being overwhelmed by growing lawlessness along \n        our southern international border.\n            (2) There is a rapidly growing number of armed and \n        dangerous criminals, violent gang members, drug smugglers, and \n        potential terrorists entering the United States illegally over \n        our southern international border. These criminals are becoming \n        increasingly well organized, trained and equipped, and in \n        recent months a trend is developing which indicates that the \n        level of violence and the volume of criminal activity along the \n        Rio Grande is rapidly escalating to the level of open warfare \n        between law enforcement officials and organized criminal narco-\n        terrorists.\n            (3) Federal and State law enforcement officials have \n        identified an alarming increase in the number of foreign \n        nationals from countries with known connections to terrorist \n        organizations who are hiding among an immense and rapidly \n        growing number of foreign nationals who are entering the United \n        States illegally.\n            (4) The United States is at war with terrorist criminal \n        organizations and with individuals from foreign nations who are \n        fanatically committed to the destruction of the United States, \n        who have repeatedly demonstrated their ability and willingness \n        to hide their true identities and their evil purposes, and who \n        may enter and move about the United States illegally and use \n        sneak attacks and any criminal means or method available to \n        them to cause the mass destruction of human life in the United \n        States.\n            (5) The peace, security, and well being of the people of \n        the United States are being placed at grave risk by the \n        inability or unwillingness of Federal officials to protect our \n        international borders and prevent individuals from entering and \n        remaining in the United States illegally during our war on \n        terrorists. The lawlessness along our southern international \n        border is unacceptable, and presents a clear and present danger \n        to the nation.\n\nSEC. 3. DESIGNATED COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Authority and Statements of Policy.--\n            (1) The Congress recognizes that elected State and local \n        law enforcement officials are directly accountable to State and \n        local voters. Therefore, by passage of this Act, Congress \n        reaffirms the residual full sovereign authority of the States \n        to protect the lives, safety, and property of the people within \n        their jurisdiction by preventing and punishing criminal \n        activity, subject only to judicial enforcement of minimum \n        Federal standards of due process and equal protection under the \n        14th Amendment.\n            (2) This Act authorizes the Sheriffs in designated counties \n        adjacent to the southern international border area, who are the \n        highest locally elected law enforcement authority in those \n        areas, to coordinate law enforcement operations in support of \n        personnel of United States Customs and Border Protection and \n        Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to conduct law enforcement \n        operations in the interior areas in their counties, including \n        the areas on and adjacent to the international border, to \n        ensure, as determined by Federal law enforcement officials, \n        that individuals detained or taken into custody by the Sheriff \n        are lawfully present in the United States, and to otherwise \n        authorize Sheriffs to assume full and final sovereign authority \n        to enforce criminal laws and to protect the peace, safety, and \n        security of all persons and property in their counties.\n            (3) The Congress finds that the rapidly escalating \n        lawlessness on our Nation's southern international border and \n        interior areas adjacent to the international border, and the \n        inability of Federal officials to control this lawlessness, \n        make the provisions of this Act reaffirming full sovereign \n        power to enforce criminal law in State and local officials \n        necessary ``to execute the Laws of the Union'' and ``to insure \n        domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense'' and to \n        ``promote the general Welfare''. Federal officials are directed \n        to implement, enforce, and carry out vigorously and promptly \n        the intent of Congress as expressed in this Act.\n    (b) Establishment of Program.--\n            (1) In general.--A Designated County Law Enforcement \n        Assistance program is hereby established jointly within the \n        Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security \n        in order to provide immediate and long term financial \n        assistance and authorization for the law enforcement operations \n        of Sheriffs in counties adjacent to the southern international \n        border of the United States.\n            (2) Designated counties adjacent to the southern border of \n        the united states defined.--In this Act, the term ``designated \n        counties adjacent to the southern international border of the \n        United States'' includes a county any part of which is within \n        25 miles of the southern international border of the United \n        States.\n    (c) Authority.--\n            (1) In general.--Any Sheriff or coalition or group of \n        Sheriffs from designated counties adjacent to the southern \n        international border of the United States is authorized to \n        perform the following duties or functions, and shall be \n        promptly paid for the costs of performing such duties or \n        functions by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland \n        Security for any local or State funds previously expended or \n        proposed to be spent by that Sheriff or coalition or group of \n        Sheriffs.\n                    (A) To conduct law enforcement operations in the \n                interior areas of their counties on and adjacent to the \n                southern international border of the United States in \n                order to enforce criminal laws, prevent and punish \n                criminal activity, and protect the lives, property, and \n                security of the people within the jurisdiction of the \n                Sheriff.\n                    (B) To transfer aliens detained or in the custody \n                of the Sheriff who are not lawfully present in the \n                United States to appropriate Federal law enforcement \n                officials.\n                    (C) To enforce State and Federal laws relating to \n                controlled substance trafficking and enforce other \n                State and Federal criminal laws (other than Federal \n                immigration laws, except as provided pursuant to a \n                written agreement entered into with the Secretary of \n                Homeland Security relating to the investigation, \n                apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United \n                States (including the transportation of such aliens \n                across State lines to detention centers) under section \n                287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n                1357(g))) in interior areas of their counties on and \n                adjacent to the southern international border of the \n                United States.\n            (2) Payment of costs.--Payment of costs under paragraph (1) \n        shall include payment--\n                    (A) for costs of equipping, training, and otherwise \n                controlling the operation and deployment of Sheriffs, \n                deputy Sheriffs, reserve deputy Sheriffs, officers, and \n                corrections officers, as well as the costs of paying \n                overtime to such officials engaged in duties relating \n                to activities authorized by this Act or necessary to \n                protect the lives, safety, and property of persons in \n                their counties;
