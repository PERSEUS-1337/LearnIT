FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Certain species of wild salmon and steelhead in the \n        Columbia and Snake River Basin are on the brink of extinction \n        as a consequence of various factors, including the construction \n        and operation of hydroelectric projects, harvest management \n        practices, habitat degradation, altered in-stream flow regimes, \n        and unsound hatchery practices.\n            (2) These salmon and steelhead have major economic, \n        ecological, educational, recreational, scientific, cultural, \n        and spiritual significance to the Nation and its people.\n            (3) Thirteen salmon and steelhead species in the Columbia \n        and Snake River Basin are listed for protection under the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n            (4) The Federal Government, including Bonneville Power \n        Administration's ratepayers in the Pacific Northwest, has spent \n        more than $8,000,000,000 on salmon recovery efforts in the \n        Columbia and Snake River Basin to date.\n            (5) Salmon and steelhead are symbols of the Pacific \n        Northwest, support thousands of jobs in coastal and inland \n        communities, and serve as an indicator of the health of \n        Northern California, Nevada, Alaska, and Pacific Northwest \n        river ecosystems.\n            (6) Salmon and steelhead of the Snake River are a vital \n        economic resource to communities in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, \n        Idaho, and California. Restoring Snake River salmon to healthy, \n        self-sustaining, harvestable levels will have significant \n        economic benefits for these communities as well as communities \n        in Nevada where these fish once returned.\n            (7) The original range of Snake River salmon included not \n        only their existing habitat in central Idaho, northeast Oregon, \n        southeast Washington, the mid- and lower Columbia River, and \n        the coastal waters of Alaska, California, Oregon, and \n        Washington, but also habitat in the upper Columbia River and \n        the upper Snake River Basin, including southern Idaho, \n        southeast Oregon, and northern Nevada.\n            (8) The United States Government has signed treaties with \n        Indian tribes in Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Idaho and \n        with the Government of Canada creating a legally enforceable \n        trust responsibility to restore salmon populations to \n        sustainable, harvestable levels.\n            (9) Since the construction of 4 Federal dams on the lower \n        Snake River in Washington, salmon and steelhead populations in \n        the Snake River have significantly declined, and all salmon and \n        steelhead populations in the Snake River are either already \n        extinct or listed as endangered species or threatened species \n        under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n        seq.).\n            (10) Recent studies indicate that the window of time to \n        protect and restore Snake River salmon and steelhead is short, \n        with scientists estimating that, if changes do not occur, \n        several of the remaining Snake River salmon populations could \n        be extinct within the next 20 years.\n            (11) A federally funded group of State, tribal, Federal, \n        and independent scientists found that removing the 4 lower \n        Snake River dams in Washington is the surest way to protect and \n        recover Snake River salmon and steelhead. Similar conclusions \n        have been reached in studies by the Army Corps of Engineers and \n        the Department of Commerce. At the same time, it is well \n        understood that removing these dams is not a ``silver bullet'' \n        for the recovery of all salmon and steelhead populations in the \n        Columbia and Snake River Basin and other actions are also \n        necessary to further protect and restore these fish.\n            (12) Removal of the 4 lower Snake River dams would affect \n        electricity generation, freight shipping, and water supply \n        systems, and these benefits must be replaced through other \n        means in order to protect local communities, farms, and the \n        regional energy supply system.\n            (13) The 4 lower Snake River dams currently produce \n        renewable electricity. Studies have found that the Northwest \n        has ample additional existing and potential clean renewable \n        energy sources to cost-effectively replace the power produced \n        by these dams in a manner that is compatible with broader \n        efforts to reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions.\n            (14) In the event that the 4 lower Snake River dams are \n        removed, their energy benefits should be replaced with cost-\n        effective, clean renewable sources, as well as energy \n        efficiency and conservation.\n            (15) The removal of the 4 lower Snake River dams would \n        bring opportunities to inland Northwest communities by opening \n        up 140 miles of free-flowing river, and providing needed \n        resources for more effective and efficient freight \n        transportation systems.\n            (16) A Federal court has found that the 4 lower Snake River \n        dams violate water quality standards under the Federal Water \n        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.).\n            (17) A significant amount of sediment has built up behind \n        Lower Granite Dam, posing a flood risk to the city of Lewiston, \n        Idaho, which now sits below the height of the lower Snake \n        River. A study by the Army Corps of Engineers found that nearly \n        $2,000,000,000 worth of buildings and infrastructure sit in the \n        Clarkston/Lewiston area floodplain where they face a growing \n        threat of major damage from levee breaching. The same Corps \n        study estimates that the costs of river-dredging and levee-\n        raising needed to protect these areas could cost taxpayers \n        hundreds of millions of dollars.\n            (18) Global warming is already having and will continue to \n        have detrimental effects on Pacific salmon populations. Snake \n        River salmon may be key to maintaining and rebuilding salmon \n        populations throughout the Columbia and Snake River Basin, as \n        their high-elevation spawning grounds are the most likely to \n        remain viable in the face of warming temperatures; thus, taking \n        action now to protect these salmon is vitally important.\n            (19) The Northwest Power and Conservation Council \n        commissioned a report in 2000 that concluded that removing the \n        4 lower Snake River dams is a more cost-effective way to \n        restore wild salmon and steelhead populations to the Columbia \n        and Snake River Basin than strategies that do not include dam \n        removal.\n            (20) Three of the last four biological opinions regarding \n        the Columbia and Snake River Federal hydrosystem have been \n        found illegal by Federal courts.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure the protection and recovery of wild Columbia \n        and Snake River salmon and steelhead to self-sustaining, \n        harvestable levels, while providing for reliable, reasonably \n        priced, and clean renewable energy in the Northwest, a reliable \n        and affordable freight transportation system, and an \n        economically sustainable salmon recovery program, and to \n        maximize the economic benefits from potential dam removal while \n        mitigating for its impacts; and\n            (2) to ensure that the Northwest and the Nation have \n        completed the necessary planning and evaluation to efficiently \n        manage salmon recovery by implementing biologically effective \n        measures and responding rapidly if and when major new actions \n        are determined to be necessary to protect and recover salmon \n        and steelhead in the Columbia and Snake River Basin.\n\nSEC. 3.

This \nanalysis shall include a review of cost increases, if any, of shipping \nrates and options for addressing any such cost increases so as to \nminimize the potential impact on shippers. This analysis shall \nincorporate input and feedback from farmers and other shippers, the \nWashington, Idaho, and Oregon State Departments of Transportation, and \nother relevant stakeholders in the agricultural, business, and public \ninterest communities, and any suggestions or decisions arrived at \nthrough consensus deliberations of the same or similar participants. \nThis analysis shall be completed and a report thereon submitted to \nCongress within 12 months after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. STUDY OF ENERGY REPLACEMENT.\n\n    The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the White House \nOffice of Energy and Climate Change, shall conduct a peer-reviewed \nanalysis of what energy replacement options exist to replace the power \ncurrently generated by the 4 lower Snake River dams in the event the \ndams are removed. The analysis shall include a review of existing, \nplanned, and potential clean renewable energy resources, in addition to \nenergy efficiency, energy conservation, and combined heat and power \nprojects. This analysis shall be completed and a report thereon \nsubmitted to Congress within 12 months after the date of enactment of \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 6. STUDY OF LOWER SNAKE RIVER RIVERFRONT REVITALIZATION.\n\n    The Army Corps of Engineers, in consultation with relevant State \nand local governments and interested parties, shall conduct an analysis \nof what riverfront revitalization and restoration opportunities would \nexist in the event of the removal of the 4 lower Snake River dams and \nwhat costs would be incurred to implement such revitalization and \nrestoration measures. This work shall focus on riverfront \nrevitalization for Lewiston, Idaho, and Clarkston, Washington, but may \ninclude other impacted communities along the 140 miles of the lower \nSnake River. This analysis shall be completed and a report thereon \nsubmitted to Congress within 12 months after the date of the enactment \nof this Act, shall include determination of engineering options and \ncosts, and shall be peer-reviewed generally in accordance with section \n2034 of Public Law 110-114 to determine the accuracy of the preferred \nengineering options and costs determined by the Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n\nSEC. 7. STUDY OF IRRIGATION PROTECTIONS.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of \nReclamation, shall conduct a peer-reviewed analysis of the options and \ncosts regarding any needed modifications to affected irrigation \nsystems, cooling systems, and private wells if the 4 lower Snake River \ndams were removed. This analysis shall be completed and a report \nthereon submitted to Congress within 12 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 8.
