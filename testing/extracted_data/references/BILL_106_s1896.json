FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that locating Federal facilities in \ncentral business areas--\n            (1) strengthens the economic base of cities, towns, and \n        rural communities of the United States and makes them \n        attractive places to live and work;\n            (2) enhances livability by limiting sprawl and providing \n        air quality and other environmental benefits; and\n            (3) supports historic development patterns.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure that Federal agencies recognize the \n        implications of the location of Federal facilities on the \n        character, environment, economic development patterns, and \n        infrastructure of communities;\n            (2) to ensure that the General Services Administration and \n        other Federal agencies that make independent location decisions \n        give first priority to locating Federal facilities in central \n        business areas;\n            (3) to encourage preservation of historic buildings and \n        stabilization of historic areas; and\n            (4) to direct the Administrator of General Services to \n        study the feasibility of establishing a system for meaningful \n        comparison of Federal facility procurement costs between \n        central business areas and areas outside central business \n        areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
