FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Innovation in health care technology is necessary to \n        improve health outcomes and depends in part on the ability of \n        medical technology developers, including scientists, \n        physicians, engineers, and patient advocates, to introduce \n        medical devices into the marketplace.\n            (2) Even after meeting requirements for marketing set by \n        the Food and Drug Administration, there may be uncertainties \n        about patient access through government health care programs, \n        causing significant delays in bringing innovative medical \n        devices to patients or causing medical technology developers to \n        abandon potential health care solutions.\n            (3) Patients covered by the Medicare program are often \n        willing to enter into self-pay arrangements with physicians and \n        other providers to purchase items or services, yet under \n        current laws restricting such freedom of choice, the self-pay \n        arrangements may be associated with regulatory impediments or a \n        risk of civil penalties.\n            (4) Enabling health care technology manufacturers to \n        designate products to be directly available to self-pay \n        patients and excluded from government health program payments \n        at an early stage of product development will promote \n        innovation and result in increased patient access to desired \n        products and services, save taxpayer dollars, and reduce \n        administrative burdens on physicians and the government.\n            (5) Enabling health care technology manufacturers to \n        designate their devices as available to self-pay patients would \n        permit a window of time during which additional data may be \n        obtained on outcomes, comparative clinical effectiveness or \n        other data elements for possible future coverage by the \n        Medicare program.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF MANUFACTURER OPT-OUT PROGRAM FOR MEDICAL \n              DEVICES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1862 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395y) is amended adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(p) Establishment of Accelerating Innovation in Medicine (AIM) \nList of Medical Devices Voluntarily Excluded From Coverage.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall develop \n        and maintain a listing (in this section referred to as the `AIM \n        list') of medical devices for which, because of their inclusion \n        in such listing, no insurance benefit and no payment may be \n        made for such a device (or for any items or services related to \n        furnishing such device) under this title either directly or on \n        a capitated basis such that no claim for payment may be \n        submitted under this title for such a device (or for any items \n        or services related to furnishing such device) and an \n        individual who consents to receive such a device is responsible \n        for payment for the device (and for any items and services \n        related to furnishing such device).\n            ``(2) Procedures for inclusion in aim list.--\n                    ``(A) Requirement for written consent of \n                manufacturer.--No medical device may be included in the \n                AIM list without the written consent of the \n                manufacturer of the device.\n                    ``(B) Submission process.--A manufacturer seeking \n                to have a medical device included in the AIM list shall \n                submit to the Secretary a request for inclusion of the \n                device in the AIM list.
