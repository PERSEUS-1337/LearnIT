FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The historic economic, political, cultural, and \n        geographic relationships among the countries of the Western \n        Hemisphere are unique and of continuing special significance to \n        the United States.\n            (2) The interests of the countries of the Western \n        Hemisphere are more interrelated today than ever before. \n        Consequently, sound economic, social, and democratic progress \n        in each of the countries continues to benefit other countries, \n        and lack of it in any country may have serious repercussions in \n        others.\n            (3) Following the historic Summits of the Americas--the \n        1994 Summit in Miami, the 1998 Summit in Santiago, Chile, and \n        the 2001 Summit in Quebec City, Canada--the heads of state of \n        the countries of the Western Hemisphere accepted the formidable \n        challenge of economic and social integration in and between \n        their respective countries.\n            (4) To make progress toward economic and social \n        integration, there is a compelling need to focus on the social \n        development of the people of the Americas which, in turn, will \n        promote the economic and political development of the region.\n            (5) Investment in social development in the Americas, \n        including investment in human and social capital, specifically \n        in education, health, housing, and labor markets with the goal \n        of combating social exclusion and social ills, will consolidate \n        political democracy and the rule of law and promote regional \n        economic integration and trade in the region.\n            (6) The challenge of achieving economic integration between \n        one of the world's most developed economies and some of the \n        poorest and most vulnerable countries requires a special effort \n        to promote social equality, develop skills, and modernize the \n        infrastructure in poorer countries that will enable the people \n        of these countries to maximize the amount of benefits accrued \n        from economic integration.\n            (7) The particular challenge facing social and economic \n        development in Latin America is the historic and persistent \n        highly unequal distribution of wealth. Latin America suffers \n        from the most unequal distribution of wealth in the world with \n        huge inequities in the distribution of assets including \n        education, land, and credit.\n            (8) Latin America also confronts the challenge of an \n        increasing number of poor people. As of today, approximately \n        one-third of the population lives in poverty and increasing \n        numbers live in extreme poverty. Poverty exists in all Latin \n        American countries but 70 percent of the region's poor live in \n        the five largest middle-income countries.\n            (9) Marginalized groups, including indigenous populations, \n        people of African descent, women, people with disabilities, and \n        rural populations, are socially excluded and suffer from \n        poverty, stigma, and discrimination.\n            (10) Democratic values are dominant throughout the \n        Americas, and nearly all governments in the region have come to \n        power through democratic elections.\n            (11) Nonetheless, existing democratic governments and their \n        constituent institutions remain fragile and face critical \n        challenges including effective democratic civilian authority \n        over these institutions, including the military, the \n        consolidation or establishment of independent judicial \n        institutions and the rule of law, and the elimination of \n        corruption.\n            (12) The prosperity, security, and well-being of the United \n        States is linked directly to peace, prosperity, and democracy \n        in the Americas. The entire region benefits by reducing \n        poverty, strengthening the middle class, and promoting the rule \n        of law which will also increase markets for United States goods \n        and create a better environment for regional investment by \n        United States businesses.\n            (13) Section 101 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n        U.S.C. 2151) establishes as a principal objective of United \n        States foreign assistance the ``encouragement and sustained \n        support of the people of developing countries in their efforts \n        to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development \n        and to build the economic, political, and social institutions \n        which will improve the quality of their lives''.\n            (14) It is in the national interests of the United States \n        to assist developing countries in the Western Hemisphere as \n        they implement the economic and political policies which are \n        necessary to achieve equitable economic growth.\n            (15) The Summit of the Americas has directly charged the \n        multilateral institutions of the Americas, including the \n        Organization of American States (OAS), the Inter-American \n        Development Bank (IADB), and the new Inter-American Agency for \n        Cooperation and Development with mobilizing private-public \n        sector partnerships among industry and civil society to help \n        achieve equitable development objectives.\n            (16) By supporting the purposes and objectives of \n        development and applying such purposes and objectives to the \n        Americas, a Social Investment and Economic Development Fund for \n        the Americas can advance the national interests of the United \n        States and can directly improve the lives of the poor and \n        marginalized groups, encourage broad-based economic growth \n        while protecting the environment, build human capital and \n        knowledge, support meaningful participation in democracy, and \n        promote peace and justice in the Americas.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is, therefore, the policy of the \nUnited States--\n            (1) to promote market-based principles, economic \n        integration, social development, and trade in and between \n        countries of the Americas by--\n                    (A) nurturing public-private partnerships and \n                microenterprise development;\n                    (B) improving the quality of life and investing in \n                human capital, specifically targeting education, health \n                and disease prevention, and housing;\n                    (C) strengthening the rule of law through improved \n                efficiency and transparency in government services; and\n                    (D) reducing poverty and eliminating the exclusion \n                of marginalized populations, including people of \n                African descent, indigenous groups, women, and people \n                with disabilities; and\n            (2) to establish an investment fund for the Western \n        Hemisphere to advance the national interests of the United \n        States, directly improve the lives of the poor and \n        marginalized, encourage broad-based economic growth while \n        protecting the environment, build human capital and knowledge, \n        support meaningful participation in democratic institutions and \n        processes, and promote peace and justice in the Americas.\n\nSEC. 3.
