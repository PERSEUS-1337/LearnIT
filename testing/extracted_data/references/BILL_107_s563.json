FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Social Security Advisory Board, the Technical Panel \n        on Assumptions and Methods of the Social Security Advisory \n        Board (in this Act referred to as the ``Panel''), and the \n        Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security \n        Administration should be commended for their professional, \n        nonpartisan work to project the future financial operations of \n        the social security program established under title II of the \n        Social Security Act.\n            (2) The Panel reported its recommendations in November \n        1999.\n            (3) The Panel recommended a series of changes to current \n        projections of the financial operations of the social security \n        program which would, if adopted, increase existing estimates of \n        the program's unfunded obligations.\n            (4) The Panel further recommended the use of standards of \n        comparison that emphasize program sustainability, such as \n        showing the program's projected annual income rates, cost \n        rates, and balances with an emphasis that is equal to 75-year \n        program solvency.\n            (5) The Panel further recommended that reform proposals be \n        evaluated using standards of comparison that include the \n        proposal's impact on the Federal unified budget, as well as a \n        recognition of the funding shortfalls present under current \n        law.\n            (6) The Panel made several other recommendations that are \n        worthy of consideration, involving issues that include \n        workforce participation, poverty rates among the elderly, and \n        assumptions regarding equity investment returns.\n            (7) Adoption of the Panel's recommendations would assist in \n        developing a fiscally responsible reform solution that avoids \n        passing hidden costs to future taxpayers.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPANSION OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT STATEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1143(a)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1320b-13(a)(2)) is amended by striking ``and'' at the end of \nsubparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (D) \nand inserting a semicolon, and by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(E) a statement providing information that--\n                    ``(i) while the old age, survivors, and disability \n                insurance program currently collects more in employer, \n                employee, and self-employment contributions than such \n                program pays out in retirement, disability, survivor, \n                and auxiliary benefits each year, such program will \n                begin to run cash flow deficits in 2015, thereafter \n                necessitating the allocation of general tax revenues in \n                order to finance promised benefits; and\n                    ``(ii) the trust funds for such program contain \n                claims on future Government resources sufficient to \n                cover the deficit through 2037, but after that date, \n                the trust funds would collect sufficient revenues to \n                pay 72 percent of benefits; and\n            ``(F) a statement explaining the nature of the Federal old \n        age, survivors, and disability insurance trust funds, including \n        the following: `Social Security Trust Fund balances are \n        available to finance future benefit payments and other Trust \n        Fund responsibilities only in a bookkeeping sense. They do not \n        consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the \n        future to fund benefits. Instead, such balances are claims on \n        the United States Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be \n        financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or \n        reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large \n        Social Security Trust Fund balances, therefore, does not, by \n        itself, have any impact on the Federal Government's ability to \n        pay benefits.'.\nFor purposes of subparagraph (E), the dates and percentages described \nin such subparagraph shall be adjusted annually based on the \nAlternative II (Intermediate) findings of the Office of the Chief \nActuary contained in the most recent report of the Board of \nTrustees.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall \napply with respect to statements provided after the date of enactment \nof this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. EXPANSION OF ANNUAL REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE SOCIAL \n              SECURITY TRUST FUNDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 201(c) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 401(c)) is amended by inserting before the penultimate sentence \nthe following: ``Based on the Alternative II (Intermediate) findings of \nthe Office of the Chief Actuary, such report, including the report's \nsummary and any items that accompany the release of such report, shall \ninclude in a clear and simple manner the information described in \nsubsection (n)(1).''.\n    (b) Additional Contents of Report.--Section 201 of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 401) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(n)(1) For purposes of subsection (c), the information described \nin this subsection is the following:\n                    ``(A) An estimate of the year in which annual \n                outlays from the Trust Funds is first projected, using \n                the Trustees' intermediate estimates, to exceed the \n                annual cash income of the Trust Funds. For purposes of \n                this paragraph, annual cash income of the Trust Funds \n                shall be determined by including payroll and benefit \n                tax revenues, but not intragovernmental transfers or \n                interest income.\n                    ``(B) The annual excess of such projected annual \n                outlays from the Trust Funds over the annual cash \n                income of the Trust Funds in each year, beginning with \n                the first year identified in subparagraph (A) and \n                extending through the year of projected program \n                insolvency.\n                    ``(C) The aggregate amount of the annual excesses \n                identified in subparagraph (B) for the 75-year \n                projection period included in the report and the change \n                in such amount from the previous year's report.\n                    ``(D) The amount of deficit or surplus that the \n                old-age, survivor, and disability insurance program \n                will run in the last year in the 75-year projection \n                period included in the report and the aggregate assets \n                and unfunded obligations contained in the Trust Funds \n                in that final projected year.\n                    ``(E) The amount that payroll taxes would have to \n                be raised or benefits be reduced (both in percentage \n                terms) in order to keep the old-age, survivor, and \n                disability insurance program in annual financial \n                balance after any cumulative balances in the Trust \n                Funds are exhausted.
