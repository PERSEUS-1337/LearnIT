FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress hereby finds the following:\n            (1) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, money is \n        principally created in the domestic economy by banks through \n        the process known as ``deposit expansion'' under which credit \n        is extended by banks to customers in exchange for the \n        assumption of an obligation by each customer to repay the \n        amount of any such credit with interest.\n            (2) The creation of money through the extension of credit \n        and creation of debt, a traditional banking function, preceded \n        the establishment by the Congress of, first, the national \n        banking system and, subsequently, the Federal Reserve System.\n            (3) The constitutional authority to create and regulate \n        money does not limit the Federal Government to creating money \n        through the production of coins or currency or the process of \n        debt creation but, except for a brief period during the \n        administration of President Lincoln, the Federal Government has \n        not exercised such authority more broadly.\n            (4) The creation of money by the banks in conjunction with \n        the Federal reserve banks does not limit the constitutional \n        authority of the Congress to create Government credit funds in \n        the form of noninterest bearing credit to fund a legislatively \n        approved program or prevent the Congress from creating such \n        funds.\n            (5) The creation of noninterest-bearing government credit \n        funds in measured or limited increments for the purpose of \n        funding capital and environmental projects in the public \n        interest--\n                    (A) will allow projects to be built for \\1/2\\ to \n                \\1/3\\ the normal cost; and\n                    (B) will allow more necessary projects to be built \n                at a lower cost to the taxpayers and at the same time \n                build additional wealth in the communities where such \n                projects are located.\n\nSEC. 3.
