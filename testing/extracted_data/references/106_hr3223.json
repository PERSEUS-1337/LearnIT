PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    Subpart 2 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n(20 U.S.C. 1132a et seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \nfollowing new chapter:\n\n ``CHAPTER 4--WILLIAM H. GRAY, III, COLLEGE COMPLETION CHALLENGE GRANT \n                                PROGRAM\n\n``SEC. 408A. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress makes the following findings:\n            ``(1) Students from low-income families are significantly \n        more likely to leave a 4-year institution of higher education \n        without a baccalaureate degree than are students with higher \n        incomes.\n            ``(2) Even among students with above average grades, low-\n        income students are still more likely to leave a 4-year \n        institution of higher education without a baccalaureate degree \n        than are students with higher incomes, especially low-income \n        students enrolled at private institutions.\n            ``(3) This lack of persistence to completion of a \n        baccalaureate degree continues to contribute to the gap in \n        educational attainment and ultimate income levels between \n        disadvantaged students and their more affluent classmates.\n            ``(4) While the focus of Federal student financial \n        assistance and higher education programs has traditionally been \n        to ensure access to postsecondary education, the Federal \n        Government should expand its role in student financial \n        assistance programs for postsecondary education to address this \n        lack of persistence to baccalaureate degree completion.\n            ``(5) The amount of grant assistance provided to \n        postsecondary students is critical to their persistence and \n        degree attainment.\n            ``(6) In addition to economic disadvantage, the following \n        factors significantly contribute to a student dropping out of a \n        4-year institution of higher education:\n                    ``(A) A delayed entry into postsecondary education \n                after graduating from high school.\n                    ``(B) A low grade point average.\n                    ``(C) Working full-time while enrolled.\n                    ``(D) Being a first-generation college student.\n                    ``(E) Being less engaged with an academic program.\n            ``(7) Most students who drop out of college, particularly \n        those at the greatest risk of leaving their programs of study \n        without a baccalaureate degree, do so during the first 2 years \n        of study.\n            ``(8) At-risk students who receive targeted academic \n        support services persist to degree completion at higher rates \n        than at-risk students who do not receive such services.\n            ``(9) Educators interested in student retention have long \n        viewed intensive academic summer programs for incoming first-\n        year students as very important in helping students from \n        disadvantaged backgrounds become acclimated to college life and \n        in improving retention.\n\n``SEC. 408B. PURPOSE AND PROGRAM AUTHORITY.\n\n    ``(a) Purpose.--The purpose of this program is to assist \ninstitutions of higher education to help students who are at risk of \nending their postsecondary education prior to obtaining baccalaureate \ndegrees, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged, to stay \nin school until they obtain those degrees.\n    ``(b) Program Authorized.--From funds appropriated pursuant to \nsection 408G for each fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized, in \naccordance with the requirements of this chapter, to award competitive \ngrants to eligible institutions to enable them to pay the Federal share \nof the costs of carrying out programs designed to meet the purpose of \nthis chapter.\n    ``(c) Duration of Grant.--A grant made under this chapter shall be \nawarded for a period of 3 years.\n\n``SEC. 408C.
