FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1999, 98,600,000 acres in the United States were \n        planted with genetically engineered crops, and more than \\1/3\\ \n        of the soybean crop, and \\1/4\\ of the corn crop, in the United \n        States was genetically engineered.\n            (2) The process of genetically engineering foods results in \n        the material change of such foods.\n            (3) The health and environmental effects of genetically \n        engineered foods are not yet known.\n            (4) Individuals in the United States have the right to know \n        whether food contains or has been produced with genetically \n        engineered material.\n            (5) Federal law gives individuals in the United States the \n        right to know whether food contains artificial colors and \n        flavors, chemical preservatives, and artificial sweeteners by \n        requiring the labeling of such food.\n            (6) Requirements that genetically engineered food be \n        labeled as genetically engineered would increase consumer \n        knowledge about, and consumer control over consumption of, \n        genetically engineered food.\n            (7) Genetically engineered material can be detected in food \n        at levels as low as 0.1 percent by reasonably available \n        technology.\n\nSEC. 3. LABELING REGARDING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MATERIAL; AMENDMENTS \n              TO FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing paragraph:\n    ``(t)(1) If it contains a genetically engineered material, or was \nproduced with a genetically engineered material, unless it bears a \nlabel (or labeling, in the case of a raw agricultural commodity) that \nprovides notices in accordance with each of the following requirements:\n            ``(A) The label or labeling bears the following notice: \n        `GENETICALLY ENGINEERED'.\n            ``(B) The label or labeling bears the following notice: \n        `THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MATERIAL, OR \n        WAS PRODUCED WITH A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MATERIAL'.\n            ``(C) The notice required in clause (A) immediately \n        precedes the notice required in clause (B) and the type for the \n        notice required in clause (A) is not less than twice the size \n        of the type for the notice required in clause (B).\n            ``(D) The notice required in clause (B) is the same size as \n        would be required if the notice provided nutrition information \n        that is required in paragraph (q)(1).\n            ``(E) The notices required in clauses (A) and (B) are \n        clearly legible and conspicuous.\n    ``(2) This paragraph does not apply to food that--\n            ``(A) is served in restaurants or other similar eating \n        establishments, such as cafeterias and carryouts;\n            ``(B) is a medical food as defined in section 5(b) of the \n        Orphan Drug Act;
