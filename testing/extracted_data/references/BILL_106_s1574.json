FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Home health care is a vital component of the medicare \n        program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.\n            (2) Home health services provided under the medicare \n        program enable medicare beneficiaries who are homebound and \n        greatly risk costly institutionalized care to continue to live \n        in their own homes and communities.\n            (3) Implementation of the interim payment system for home \n        health services has inadvertently exacerbated payment \n        disparities for home health services among regions, penalizing \n        efficient, low-cost providers in rural areas and providing \n        insufficient compensation for the care of medicare \n        beneficiaries with acute, medically complex conditions.\n            (4) The combination of insufficient payments and new \n        administrative changes has reduced the access of medicare \n        beneficiaries to home health services in many areas by forcing \n        home health agencies to provide fewer services, to shrink their \n        service areas, or to limit the types of conditions for which \n        they provide treatment.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To improve access to care for medicare beneficiaries \n        with high medical needs by establishing a process for home \n        health agencies to exclude services provided to medicare \n        beneficiaries with acute, medically complex conditions from \n        payment limits and to receive payment based on the reasonable \n        costs of providing such services through a process that is \n        feasible for the Health Care Financing Administration to \n        administer.\n            (2) To ensure that the 15 percent contingency reduction in \n        medicare payments for home health services established under \n        the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 does not occur under the \n        interim payment system for home health services.\n            (3) To reduce the scheduled 15 percent reduction in the \n        cost limits and per beneficiary limits to 10 percent and to \n        phase-in the additional 5 percent reduction in such limits \n        after the initial 3 years of the prospective payment system for \n        home health services.\n            (4) To address the unique challenges of serving medicare \n        beneficiaries in rural and underserved areas by increasing the \n        per visit cost limit under the interim payment system for home \n        health services.\n            (5) To refine the home health consolidated billing \n        provision to ensure that medicare beneficiaries requiring \n        durable medical equipment services do not experience a break in \n        the continuum of care during episodes of home health care.\n            (6) To eliminate the requirement that home health agencies \n        identify the length of time of a service visit in 15 minute \n        increments.\n            (7) To express the sense of the Senate that the Secretary \n        of Health and Human Services should establish a uniform process \n        for disseminating information to fiscal intermediaries to \n        ensure timely and accurate information to home health agencies \n        and beneficiaries.\n\nSEC. 3.
