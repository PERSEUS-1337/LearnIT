ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL CENTER ON VOLUNTEER AND PROVIDER \n              SCREENING.\n\n    The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (42 \nU.S.C. 5601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n    ``TITLE VI--NATIONAL CENTER ON VOLUNTEER AND PROVIDER SCREENING\n\n``SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    ``This title may be cited as the `National Child Protection \nImprovement Act'.\n\n``SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) More than 87,000,000 children are involved each year \n        in activities provided by child and youth organizations which \n        depend heavily on volunteers to deliver their services.\n            ``(2) Millions more adults, both the elderly and \n        individuals with disabilities, are served by public and private \n        voluntary organizations.\n            ``(3) The vast majority of activities provided to children, \n        the elderly, and individuals with disabilities by public and \n        private nonprofit agencies and organizations result in the \n        delivery of much needed services in safe environments that \n        could not be provided without the assistance of virtually \n        millions of volunteers, but abuses do occur.\n            ``(4) Estimates of the incidence of child sexual abuse in \n        child care settings, foster care homes, and schools, range from \n        1 to 7 percent.\n            ``(5) Abuse traumatizes the victims and shakes public trust \n        in care providers and organizations serving vulnerable \n        populations.\n            ``(6) Congress has acted to address concerns about this \n        type of abuse through the National Child Protection Act of 1993 \n        and the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994 to set forth a \n        framework for screening through criminal record checks of care \n        providers, including volunteers who work with children, the \n        elderly, and individuals with disabilities. Unfortunately, \n        problems regarding the safety of these vulnerable groups still \n        remain.\n            ``(7) While State screening is sometimes adequate to \n        conduct volunteer background checks, more extensive national \n        criminal history checks using fingerprints or other means of \n        positive identification are often advisable, as a prospective \n        volunteer or nonvolunteer provider may have lived in more than \n        one State.\n            ``(8) The high cost of fingerprint background checks is \n        unaffordable for organizations that use a large number of \n        volunteers and, if passed on to volunteers, often discourages \n        their participation.\n            ``(9) The current system of retrieving national criminal \n        background information on volunteers through an authorized \n        agency of the State is cumbersome and often requires months \n        before vital results are returned.\n            ``(10) In order to protect children, volunteer agencies \n        must currently depend on a convoluted, disconnected, and \n        sometimes duplicative series of checks that leave children at \n        risk.\n            ``(11) A national volunteer and provider screening center \n        is needed to protect vulnerable groups by providing effective, \n        efficient national criminal history background checks of \n        volunteer providers at no-cost, and at minimal-cost for \n        employed care providers.\n\n``SEC. 603. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    ``In this Act--\n            ``(1) the term `qualified entity' means a business or \n        organization, whether public, private, for-profit, not-for-\n        profit, or voluntary, that provides care or care placement \n        services, including a business or organization that licenses or \n        certifies others to provide care or care placement services \n        designated by the National Task Force;\n            ``(2) the term `volunteer provider' means a person who \n        volunteers or seeks to volunteer with a qualified entity;\n            ``(3) the term `provider' means a person who is employed by \n        or volunteers or who seeks to be employed by or volunteer with \n        a qualified entity, who owns or operates a qualified entity, or \n        who has or may have unsupervised access to a child to whom the \n        qualified entity provides care;\n            ``(4) the term `national criminal background check system' \n        means the criminal history record system maintained by the \n        Federal Bureau of Investigation based on fingerprint \n        identification or any other method of positive identification;\n            ``(5) the term `child' means a person who is under the age \n        of 18;\n            ``(6) the term `individuals with disabilities' has the same \n        meaning as that provided in section 5(7) of the National Child \n        Protection Act of 1993;\n            ``(7) the term `State' has the same meaning as that \n        provided in section 5(11) of the National Child Protection Act \n        of 1993; and\n            ``(8) the term `care' means the provision of care, \n        treatment, education, training, instruction, supervision, or \n        recreation to children, the elderly, or individuals with \n        disabilities.\n\n``SEC. 604.
