CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal National Mortgage Association (known as \n        Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \n        (known as Freddie Mac), which are both privately owned but \n        publicly chartered Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), \n        were at the center of the mortgage market meltdown that caused \n        the financial crisis that commenced in 2008;\n            (2) the failures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac helped \n        precipitate the deepest economic decline since World War II;\n            (3) in September 2008, the Bush Administration, Federal \n        Reserve Board, and Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \n        exercised authority granted by the Congress to place the two \n        GSEs in conservatorship, a form of nationalization that puts \n        the regulators firmly in control of the GSEs' daily operations;\n            (4) in September 2008, the Bush Administration established \n        a $200 billion facility to purchase senior preferred stock in \n        the enterprises to backstop their losses;\n            (5) in February 2009, the Obama Administration raised the \n        senior preferred stock purchase commitment to $400 billion;\n            (6) on Christmas Eve 2009, the Obama Administration removed \n        any limits on the use of Federal funds to cover losses at the \n        enterprises, significantly expanding a commitment that has \n        resulted in the expenditure of so far nearly $175 billion in \n        taxpayer funds to purchase senior preferred stock in the two \n        enterprises;\n            (7) as a result of the Government's actions, the taxpayers \n        of the United States now own nearly 80 percent of the two GSEs;\n            (8) the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that \n        Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have effectively become Government \n        entities whose operations should be included in the Federal \n        budget;\n            (9) the GSEs are expected to be a long-term drain on the \n        taxpayers as a result of market conditions and the political \n        and public policy mandates imposed on them by the \n        Administration and the Congress;\n            (10) in spite of these liabilities, the Treasury Department \n        and FHFA approved compensation packages for the chief executive \n        officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2009, 2010, and 2011 \n        that were nearly 15 times greater than the annual compensation \n        of the President of the United States and 30 times greater than \n        the annual compensation of a Cabinet Secretary;\n            (11) the Treasury Department and the FHFA also approved \n        multi-million dollar compensation packages for a number of the \n        GSEs' top executives, payable in cash rather than in the type \n        of stock options that have characterized compensation \n        arrangements at other large financial institutions that have \n        received extraordinary government assistance;\n            (12) on September 17, 2008, FHFA determined that no \n        executive officer of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac would be \n        entitled to receive a cash bonus or long-term incentive awards \n        for 2008;\n            (13) FHFA's five-year Strategic Plan for Fannie Mae and \n        Freddie Mac includes a commitment that the GSEs will operate in \n        a safe and sound manner; and\n            (14) section 1318(c) of the Federal Housing Enterprises \n        Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4518(c), \n        as added by section 1113(a)(4) of the Housing and Economic \n        Recovery Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-289; 122 Stat. 2678)), \n        permits the Director of FHFA to withhold any payment, transfer, \n        or disbursement of compensation to an executive officer, or to \n        place such compensation in an escrow account, during the review \n        of the reasonableness and comparability of compensation.\n\nSEC. 3.
