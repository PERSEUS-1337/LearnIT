FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) While police body worn cameras are not a panacea, they \n        do contribute to keeping both law enforcement officers and \n        citizens safer.\n            (2) Increasing the use of body worn cameras by law \n        enforcement officers has been shown by multiple studies to \n        significantly reduce the number of use of force incidents and \n        the number of citizen complaints.\n            (3) Increased accountability and transparency in policing \n        activities will benefit all our citizens, including our law \n        enforcement officers.\n\nSEC. 3.

OFFSET.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Office of Personnel Management allows for \n        administrative leave as an administratively authorized absence \n        from duty without loss of pay or charge to leave, but \n        recognizes that administrative leave is not an entitlement, and \n        agencies are not required to grant it.\n            (2) Administrative leave does not include annual leave, \n        maternity leave, sick leave, leave taken in accordance with the \n        Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2611 et seq.), \n        or military leave.\n            (3) A Government Accountability Office report on Federal \n        paid administrative leave detailed data from the Office of \n        Personnel Management that showed that from fiscal year 2011 \n        through fiscal year 2013, about 97 percent of Federal employees \n        charged 20 days or less of paid administrative leave, although \n        some Federal employees charged between 1 and 3 years of paid \n        administrative leave. Further, Agency officials stated that the \n        most common reason for which selected employees charged amounts \n        relatively higher than the agency average was for personnel \n        matters, such as investigations into alleged misconduct.\n    (b) Requirement.--\n            (1) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n                    (A) the term ``administrative leave'' means leave \n                without loss of or reduction in--\n                            (i) pay;\n                            (ii) leave to which an employee is \n                        otherwise entitled; or\n                            (iii) credit for time or service; and\n                    (B) the term ``agency'' has the meaning given the \n                term ``executive agency'' under section 105 of title 5, \n                United States Code.\n            (2) Regulations.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act--\n                    (A) the Office of Personnel Management shall issue \n                regulations limiting administrative leave for an \n                employee of any agency to not more than 20 days per \n                year, unless approved individually by the head of the \n                agency; and\n                    (B) the Office of Management and Budget shall \n                ensure each agency adjusts the number of employees \n                (determined on a full-time equivalent basis) authorized \n                to be employed by the agency, and each component of the \n                agency, to reflect lower personnel requirements due to \n                increased available work hours per employee."
