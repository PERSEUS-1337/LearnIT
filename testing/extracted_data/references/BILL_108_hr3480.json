CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is a long history of noncitizens serving in the \n        Armed Forces of the United States of America.\n            (2) Noncitizens have been engaged in American battles since \n        the Colonial period, both as volunteers and conscripts.\n            (3) George Washington, a British subject, led our American \n        Revolution and the Marquis de Lafayette, a citizen of France, \n        and hundreds of other noncitizens helped win our independence.\n            (4) In the War of 1812, some Irish nationals helped the \n        United States fight British invaders.\n            (5) Thousands of noncitizens fought for the Union Army in \n        the Civil War.\n            (6) Roughly one in five wartime draftees during World War I \n        was foreign-born, and approximately 9 percent were noncitizens.\n            (7) According to one recent study, more than 20 percent of \n        the 3,400 members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the \n        Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest military honor, were \n        immigrants, though the precise number of noncitizens who \n        received this award is not known.\n            (8) Today, 36,177 members of the Armed Forces are \n        noncitizens, making up about 5 percent of active duty members, \n        and 12,132 members of the Selected Reserve are noncitizens.\n            (9) About a third of today's noncitizen members of the \n        Armed Forces come from Mexico and other Spanish-speaking \n        countries and the rest are from the Philippines, China, \n        Vietnam, Canada, Korea, India, and other countries.\n            (10) These men and women in uniform, born in other \n        countries, now spend each day in honorable service to their \n        adopted land.\n            (11) These men and women love the United States and show it \n        in their daily devotion to duty.\n            (12) The role of noncitizen members of the Armed Forces \n        recently received widespread attention when a noncitizen from \n        Guatemala became the second American member of the Armed Forces \n        to die in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n            (13) Noncitizen members of the Armed Forces from Mexico, \n        Colombia, the Republic of the Philippines, Scotland, Guyana, \n        the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Poland have \n        also given their lives in the line of duty in Iraq.\n            (14) The sacrifice that these and other noncitizens have \n        made for their adopted country deserves special recognition and \n        appreciation.\n            (15) Among the special recognitions a grateful nation can \n        confer is establishment of a memorial to those noncitizens \n        killed in the line of duty while serving in the Armed Forces of \n        the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
