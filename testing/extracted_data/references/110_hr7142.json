    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Offshore Renewable Energy \nDevelopment Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States needs additional sources of renewable \n        energy in order to address the problems of climate change, meet \n        renewable energy portfolio standards, diversify our energy mix, \n        and become more energy independent. The development of a \n        diverse supply of energy and additional alternatives to foreign \n        fuels is important for our national security.\n            (2) The coastal waters of the United States possess \n        significant offshore wave, tidal, and wind energy resources. \n        The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has stated that these \n        wind, wave and tide, and ocean-based sources of energy possess \n        over 50 percent of America's total renewable energy potential.\n            (3) The Department of Energy estimates that more than \n        900,000 megawatts (MW) of potential renewable energy exists off \n        the coasts of the United States. This amount of energy is \n        roughly the total current United States-installed electrical \n        capacity of the entire country, and most of this energy is \n        located near major population centers, where energy costs are \n        high. 900,000 megawatts of offshore wind generation capacity \n        would produce about 3,547,800,000 megawatt hours of electricity \n        each year. This is the same amount of energy as is contained in \n        1,927,042,446 barrels of oil, or about 25 percent of total oil \n        consumption in the United States each year.\n            (4) Offshore wind energy alone has the potential to produce \n        about 3,548 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, \n        which is 87 percent of the electricity generated in the United \n        States in 2006. Slightly more than half of the country's \n        identified offshore renewable energy is located off the New \n        England and Mid-Atlantic Coasts.\n            (5) Approximately 90 percent of the 900,000 MW of potential \n        offshore wind energy is located in Federal waters, beyond 5 \n        nautical miles from shore. Approximately 10 percent (98,000 MW) \n        is estimated to be near shore in waters less than 30 meters \n        deep.\n            (6) In Europe, governments have recognized the enormous \n        potential for offshore renewable energy, have identified sites \n        for offshore energy, and have developed ambitious policy goals \n        based on harnessing this resource. Germany and the other States \n        of the European Union have been working towards a target of 12 \n        percent renewable energy by 2010. Because this target was \n        surpassed in 2007. On April 26, 2008, Germany announced that \n        this target would rise to 27 percent by 2020.\n            (7) With regard to wind energy, most of these European \n        sites are in deeper waters where cutting-edge technology is \n        being developed to harness these offshore wind energy \n        resources. The current depth of existing technology is 120 \n        feet, but newer technologies are being pilot tested for even \n        deeper waters.\n            (8) Offshore ocean energy development can generate hundreds \n        of thousands of jobs. According to the Renewable Energy Policy \n        Project, 74,000 MW of renewables, primarily from wind energy in \n        the United States would require 380,000 new manufacturing jobs \n        for component parts; 36,000 U.S. firms already produce similar \n        products that could serve the growing market\n            (9) The United States also possesses the scientific and \n        technical capacity to generate renewable energy from the ocean, \n        including from wave, wind, and tidal sources. Scientists and \n        other industry experts believe that, at a minimum, the United \n        States Government should provide a policy framework to guide \n        the appropriate development of these resources. Such a \n        framework is imperative for the identification of offshore \n        sites and the rapid development of these resources in general.\n\nSEC. 3.

For \n        such purpose, such obligations may be acquired on original \n        issue at the issue price or by purchase of outstanding \n        obligations at the market price. Any obligation acquired by the \n        Fund may be sold by the Secretary of the Treasury at the market \n        price.\n            (2) Interest and proceeds.--The interest on, and the \n        proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held \n        in the Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Fund.\n    (d) Availability of Amounts From Fund.--From amounts available in \nthe Fund (including any amounts not obligated in previous fiscal \nyears), the Secretary of Energy is authorized to provide grants to \nprivate and public entities (or public-private partnerships) in the \nUnited States to stimulate the development of offshore renewable \nelectric energy generation.
