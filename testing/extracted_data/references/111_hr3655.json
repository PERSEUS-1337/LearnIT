    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bereaved Consumer's Bill of Rights \nAct of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there have been shocking consumer abuses in the funeral \n        industry, including scandals at Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, \n        Illinois, Menorah Gardens Cemetery in Palm Beach, Florida, and \n        the Tri State Crematory in Noble, Georgia;\n            (2) funeral arrangements are a major expense for most \n        American households and families;\n            (3) some consumers seek to ease the burdens on their \n        families by arranging and paying for pre-need funeral and \n        cemetery arrangements;\n            (4) most funerals are planned by grieving family members at \n        a time when they are especially vulnerable and unlikely to \n        focus on cost comparison;\n            (5) the Federal Trade Commission's Funeral Industry \n        Practices Trade Regulation Rule (known as the Funeral Rule) \n        dictates consumer protections in the funeral home, but does not \n        cover the practices of cemeteries, crematoria, or sellers of \n        monuments, urns, or caskets;\n            (6) State laws are inconsistent and frequently too weak to \n        provide adequate consumer protections, creating a need for \n        minimum federal standards in this area;\n            (7) consumers have the right to receive clear and accurate \n        information about all funeral goods and services offered for \n        sale;\n            (8) consumers need effective protection from fraud and \n        abusive practices by all providers of funeral goods and \n        services and at all stages of the funeral planning process; and\n            (9) a new Federal law that provides adequate protections to \n        grieving families is warranted.\n\nSEC. 3. FTC RULEMAKING RELATING TO UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS OR \n              PRACTICES IN THE PROVISION OF FUNERAL GOODS OR SERVICES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Federal Trade Commission shall prescribe rules \nprohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the provision of \nfuneral goods or services. Such rules shall include the following:\n            (1) A requirement that providers of funeral goods or \n        funeral services furnish accurate price information disclosing \n        clearly and conspicuously the cost to the purchaser for each of \n        the specific funeral goods or funeral services provided or \n        offered for sale.\n            (2) A prohibition on misrepresentations by such providers, \n        including misrepresentations of the requirements of Federal, \n        State, or local law.\n            (3) A prohibition on conditioning the provision of any \n        funeral good or funeral service upon the purchase of any other \n        funeral good or funeral service from that provider, except as \n        required by law.\n            (4) A requirement that any presale disclosures and \n        contracts for funeral services or funeral goods be written \n        clearly, stating the merchandise and services that purchasers \n        are buying and their prices.\n            (5) In the case of contracts for funeral services or \n        funeral goods that are pre-paid in whole or in part, a \n        requirement for clear and conspicuous presale and contractual \n        disclosure regarding any penalties incurred if the consumer \n        decides to cancel or transfer the contract to another provider \n        of funeral services or funeral goods.\n            (6) A requirement that contracts for funeral services or \n        funeral goods disclose clearly and conspicuously all fees and \n        costs to be incurred in the future or at the time that the \n        funeral services or funeral goods are provided.\n            (7) A requirement that cemeteries provide to consumers, in \n        a timely manner, all written rules and regulations of the \n        cemetery, and a clear explanation in writing of the interment, \n        inurnment, or entombment right that has been purchased, and any \n        material terms and conditions of that purchase, including any \n        repurchase option by the cemetery or resale rights available to \n        the consumer.\n            (8) A requirement that cemeteries--\n                    (A) retain all records in existence on the date of \n                enactment of this Act, including maps or other systems \n                indicating the location and date of each interment, \n                inurnment, or entombment;\n                    (B) accurately record and retain records of all \n                interments, inurnments, or entombments occurring, as \n                well as any internment, inurnment, or entombment rights \n                sold, after the effective date of the regulations \n                issued under this subsection, in such manner and form \n                as the Commission may prescribe in such regulations; \n                and\n                    (C) make such records available to Federal, State, \n                and local governments, as appropriate.\n    (b) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall prescribe the rules under \nsubsection (a) within 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act. \nSuch rules, and any future rules or revision of rules prescribed by the \nCommission prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the \nprovision of funeral goods or services, shall be prescribed in \naccordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code.\n    (c) Application of Rules to Tax Exempt Organizations and States.--\nNotwithstanding the definition of corporation in section 4 of the \nFederal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44), the rules prescribed under \nsubsection (a), and any future rules or revision of rules prescribed by \nthe Commission prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the \nprovision of funeral goods or funeral services, shall also apply to \ncemeteries organized or operated by--\n            (1) organizations described in section 501(c) of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that are exempt from taxation \n        under section 501(a) of such Code, except for cemeteries \n        organized, operated, managed, and owned by a religious \n        denomination, middle judicatory, house of worship, or similar \n        religious organization, and that are not organized, operated, \n        managed, or owned by contract or affiliation with a for-profit \n        provider of funeral goods or services that offers those goods \n        and services for sale to the public; and\n            (2) States or any political subdivision of a State.\n    (d) Enforcement.--Any violation of any rule prescribed under this \nsection shall be treated as a violation of a regulation prescribed \nunder section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 \nU.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)) regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices. \nThe Federal Trade Commission shall enforce this Act in the same manner, \nby the same means, and with the same jurisdiction as though all \napplicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act \nwere incorporated into and made a part of this Act. Any person who \nviolates the regulations prescribed under this Act shall be subject to \nthe penalties and entitled to the privileges and immunities provided in \nthat Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
