FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States needs to enhance activities to \n        improve homeland security for its citizens and territory in \n        providing protection from the threat of terrorist or strategic \n        attacks, including cyber attacks and attacks involving the use \n        of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons.\n            (2) The two key aspects of homeland security are--\n                    (A) antiterrorism activities, including activities \n                relating to force protection, prevention and detection \n                of attack, law enforcement, public health, reporting, \n                and other activities that precede a domestic attack \n                against the United States; and\n                    (B) consequence management, including activities \n                carried out by government entities that are designed to \n                respond to and mitigate the effects of a domestic \n                attack against the United States.\n            (3) There is currently no well-publicized, widely \n        understood, comprehensive, governmentwide strategy concerning \n        the role of the United States Government in homeland security \n        crisis and consequence management.\n            (4) Development and implementation of a homeland security \n        strategy will necessarily involve several executive departments \n        and agencies and will only succeed if the heads of those \n        departments and agencies agree to fully support implementation \n        of the strategy within and across those departments and \n        agencies, including implementation of all aspects of the \n        strategy relating to resourcing and funding of personnel and \n        equipment.\n            (5) The United States Government does not currently have an \n        adequate strategic sense of the unconventional threats to the \n        United States. Due to the significant conventional military \n        superiority of the United States, future adversaries are \n        unlikely to risk a direct head-to-head military confrontation \n        with the United States, but rather are likely to seek to \n        exploit weaknesses in the domestic preparedness and \n        counterterrorism preparedness of the United States.\n            (6) A United States homeland security strategy should \n        reflect a layered approach to homeland security that provides \n        for activities relating to each of the following: prevention of \n        an attack, protection from an attack, and response to an \n        attack.\n            (7) The Department of Defense has assets that could be used \n        to provide and enhance homeland security, but those assets \n        should only be used for that purpose in appropriate \n        circumstances.\n\nSEC. 3.
