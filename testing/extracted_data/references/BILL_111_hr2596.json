FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The influenza is a contagious respiratory illness \n        caused by influenza viruses. The best way to prevent the \n        influenza is by getting a influenza vaccination each year.\n            (2) Every year in the United States, on average, more than \n        200,000 people are hospitalized from influenza-related \n        complications, and about 36,000 people die from influenza-\n        related causes.\n            (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \n        Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine \n        influenza vaccination for all children aged 6 months through 18 \n        years with influenza vaccine, effective July 1, 2008.\n            (4) Children 2 to 17 years of age are twice as likely to \n        get influenza as adults, including the elderly.\n            (5) School-aged children are the population group most \n        responsible for transmission of contagious respiratory viruses, \n        including influenza.\n            (6) The elderly and young children are the most vulnerable \n        population to severe illness from influenza due to weaker \n        immune response to vaccination. Experts have recognized that \n        the best way to protect the elderly from influenza may be to \n        vaccinate children.\n            (7) School-based vaccination programs are effective and \n        cost-saving ways to vaccinate children while reducing \n        transmission and infection rates to the larger community and at \n        the same time reducing rates of school absenteeism due to \n        influenza.\n            (8) Increased focus on providing influenza vaccine to \n        children targeted for immunization will also help efforts to \n        build a sound foundation for future vaccination efforts.\n            (9) School-based vaccination programs also potentially \n        represent the most feasible mechanism for community-based \n        pandemic vaccination.\n            (10) Increased participation in annual influenza \n        vaccination programs builds the infrastructure necessary for \n        pandemic vaccination.\n            (11) School-based programs will investigate the feasibility \n        of conducting mass immunization clinics and build partnerships \n        with local public health teams, in the event of a public health \n        emergency.\n\nSEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM USING ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS AS \n              INFLUENZA VACCINATION CENTERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of \nLabor, shall carry out a multistate demonstration program designed to \ntest the feasibility of using the Nation's elementary schools and \nsecondary schools as influenza vaccination centers in coordination with \nschool nurses, school health care programs, local health departments, \ncommunity health care providers, State insurance agencies, and private \ninsurers.\n    (b) Program Description.--\n            (1) Vaccination.--\n                    (A) Children covered by other federal programs.--\n                For children who are eligible under other federally \n                funded programs for payment of the costs of purchasing \n                and administering the influenza vaccine, the Secretary \n                shall not use the demonstration program under this \n                section to supplant payment of such costs.\n                    (B) Children covered by private health insurance.--\n                For children who have private insurance, the Secretary \n                shall work with the Secretary of Labor, State insurance \n                agencies, and private insurers to ensure that such \n                children have coverage for all reasonable and customary \n                expenses, including the costs of purchasing and \n                administering the vaccine, incurred when influenza \n                vaccine is administered outside of the physician's \n                office in a school or other related setting.\n                    (C) Other children.--To the extent to which payment \n                of the costs of purchasing and administering the \n                influenza vaccine for children is not covered through \n                other federally funded programs or through private \n                insurance, the Secretary may pay such costs through the \n                demonstration program under this section.\n            (2) ACIP recommendations.--The demonstration program shall \n        be designed to administer vaccines consistent with the \n        recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization \n        Practices for the annual vaccination of all children aged 5 \n        years through 19 years.\n            (3) Locations.--\n                    (A) Selection.--The Secretary, in consultation with \n                the Secretary of Education, shall select the elementary \n                schools and secondary schools to participate in the \n                demonstration program.\n                    (B) Selection criteria.--The schools selected under \n                subparagraph (A) shall include elementary schools and \n                secondary schools--\n                            (i) located in at least 10 metropolitan \n                        regions in at least 10 States and serving \n                        primarily low-income public school student \n                        populations; and\n                            (ii) located in at least 5 major areas in \n                        at least 5 States served by rural school \n                        districts.\n            (4) Voluntary participation.--Participation in the \n        demonstration program by a school or an individual shall be \n        voluntary.\n            (5) Duration.--The demonstration program shall be conducted \n        for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 influenza seasons.\n            (6) Choice of vaccine.--The demonstration program shall not \n        restrict the discretion of a health care provider to administer \n        any influenza vaccine approved by the Food and Drug \n        Administration for use in pediatric populations.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days following the completion of the \ndemonstration program under this section, the Secretary shall submit to \nthe Committees on Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and \nAppropriations of the House of Representatives and to the Committees on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions and Appropriations of the Senate \na report on the results of the program.
