FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since its launch in 1995, the Web site THOMAS has been \n        an important source of free public information on Federal \n        legislation.\n            (2) In the years since the introduction of THOMAS, the \n        Internet has evolved into what is commonly referred to as Web \n        2.0, which encourages the reuse of open source information \n        though collaboration, interactivity, and data standardization.\n            (3) Allowing the public to download the THOMAS Web site's \n        bulk legislative summary and status data will enable \n        independent Web sites and outside watchdog groups to use the \n        data in new and innovative ways that make the proceedings of \n        Congress easier to follow and government more transparent.\n            (4) In its 2007 report on Congressional Information and the \n        Internet, the Open House Project recommended that Congress \n        ``make available to the public a well-supported database of all \n        bill status and summary information currently accessible \n        through the Library of Congress.''\n            (5) The Open House Project also noted that ``Six states \n        already publish the status of their state legislation in a \n        structured data format: Connecticut, Illinois . . . Minnesota, \n        Oregon, Texas and Virginia.''\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nLibrary of Congress should work toward improving public access to all \nTHOMAS data, including the text of legislation, in bulk.\n\nSEC. 3.
