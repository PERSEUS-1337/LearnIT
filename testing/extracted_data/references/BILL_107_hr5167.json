REFORM OF PAYMENT FOR DRUGS AND BIOLOGICALS UNDER THE MEDICARE \n              PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Payment Reform.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 1842(o) of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1395u(o)) is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(o) Payment for Drugs and Biologicals.--\n            ``(1) General rule.--If a physician's, supplier's, or any \n        other person's bill or request for payment for services \n        includes a charge for a drug or biological for which payment \n        may be made under this part and the drug or biological is not \n        paid on a cost or prospective payment basis as otherwise \n        provided in this part, the amount payable for the drug or \n        biological shall be based on the following:\n                    ``(A) Multi-source (generic) drugs.--In the case of \n                a drug or biological that meets the requirements for a \n                multi-source drug under subclauses (I) and (II) of \n                section 1927(k)(7)(A)(i), 105 percent of the volume-\n                weighted median average acquisition price for any drug \n                or biological covered under the same medicare HCPCS \n                code.\n                    ``(B) Single source (brand) drugs and \n                biologicals.--In the case of a drug or biological that \n                meets the requirements for a single source drug under \n                section 1927(k)(7)(A)(iv), 105 percent of the average \n                acquisition price for the drug or biological.\n                    ``(C) Access exception.--The Secretary may modify \n                the rate otherwise applicable in order to assure access \n                to necessary drugs and biologicals in the case of sole \n                community providers in rural and other areas where the \n                providers are not reasonably able to obtain the drugs \n                and biologicals at the payment rates otherwise \n                applicable. Such modification shall not result in a \n                change of more than 15 percent of the rate otherwise \n                applicable.\n                    ``(D) Data-related exception.--If the Secretary \n                determines that there is insufficient data available \n                with respect to compute an average acquisition price \n                for a drug or biological for a quarter or that, because \n                of a significant change in price from quarter-to-\n                quarter, the available data on the average acquisition \n                price does not accurately reflect the actual, current \n                acquisition cost for the drug or biological, the \n                Secretary may substitute for the quarters involved an \n                appropriate payment for the drug or biological for such \n                average acquisition price.\n                    ``(E) Application of ndc codes.--If the Secretary \n                determines that it is appropriate to provide for \n                payment under this subsection using national drug code \n                (NDC) instead of HCPCS codes, in applying subparagraph \n                (A) the reference to the same HCPCS code shall be \n                deemed a reference to the appropriate national drug \n                codes for those drugs or biologicals that are \n                therapeutically and pharmaceutically equivalent and \n                bioequivalent (as defined for purposes of section \n                1927(k)(7)(A)).\n            ``(2) Definition of average acquisition price.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--For purposes of this subsection, \n                the term `average acquisition price' means, with \n                respect to a drug or
