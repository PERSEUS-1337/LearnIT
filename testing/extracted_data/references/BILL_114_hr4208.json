FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The terrorist organization that has referred to itself \n        as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and various other \n        names (in this resolution referred to as ``ISIL'') poses a \n        grave threat to the people and territorial integrity of Iraq \n        and Syria, regional stability, and the national security \n        interests of the United States and its allies and partners.\n            (2) ISIL holds significant territory in Iraq and Syria and \n        has stated its intention to seize more territory and \n        demonstrated the capability to do so.\n            (3) ISIL leaders have stated that they intend to conduct \n        terrorist attacks internationally, including against the United \n        States, its citizens, and interests.\n            (4) ISIL has committed despicable acts of violence and mass \n        executions against Muslims, regardless of sect, who do not \n        subscribe to ISIL's depraved, violent, and oppressive ideology.\n            (5) ISIL has threatened genocide and committed vicious acts \n        of violence against religious and ethnic minority groups, \n        including Iraqi Christian, Yezidi, and Turkmen populations.\n            (6) ISIL has targeted innocent women and girls with \n        horrific acts of violence, including abduction, enslavement, \n        torture, rape, and forced marriage.\n            (7) ISIL is responsible for the deaths of innocent United \n        States citizens, including James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Abdul-\n        Rahman Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller.\n            (8) The United States is working with regional and global \n        allies and partners to degrade and defeat ISIL, to cut off its \n        funding, to stop the flow of foreign fighters to its ranks, and \n        to support local communities as they reject ISIL.\n            (9) The announcement of the anti-ISIL Coalition on \n        September 5, 2014, during the NATO Summit in Wales, stated that \n        ISIL poses a serious threat and should be countered by a broad \n        international coalition.\n            (10) The United States calls on its allies and partners, \n        particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, to join the \n        anti-ISIL Coalition and defeat this terrorist threat.\n            (11) President Barack Obama, United States military \n        leaders, and United States allies in the region have made clear \n        that it is more effective to use the unique capabilities of the \n        United States Government to support regional partners instead \n        of large-scale deployments of United States ground forces in \n        this mission.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n    (a) Authorization.--The President is authorized to use the Armed \nForces of the United States as the President determines necessary and \nappropriate against ISIL or associated persons or forces as defined in \nsection 6.\n    (b) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--\n            (1) Specific statutory authorization.--Consistent with \n        section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. \n        1547(a)(1)), Congress declares that this section is intended to \n        constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning \n        of section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. \n        1544(b)).\n            (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this \n        Act supersedes any requirements of the War Powers Resolution \n        (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.).\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this authorization is to protect the \nlives of United States citizens and to provide military support to \nregional partners in their battle to defeat ISIL. The use of \nsignificant United States ground troops in combat against ISIL, except \nto protect the lives of United States citizens from imminent threat, is \nnot consistent with such purpose.\n\nSEC. 4. DURATION OF AUTHORIZATION.\n\n    The authorization for the use of military force under this Act \nshall terminate three years after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, unless reauthorized.\n\nSEC. 5.

ASSOCIATED PERSONS OR FORCES DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``associated persons or forces''--\n            (1) means individuals and organizations fighting for, on \n        behalf of, or alongside ISIL or any closely related successor \n        entity in hostilities against the United States or its \n        coalition partners; and\n            (2) refers to any individual or organization that presents \n        a direct threat to members of the United States Armed Forces, \n        coalition partner forces, or forces trained by the coalition, \n        in their fight against ISIL.\n\nSEC. 7. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST IRAQ.\n\n    The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution \nof 2002 (Public Law 107-243; 116 Stat. 1498; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is \nhereby repealed.\n\nSEC. 8. SOLE STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR MILITARY ACTION AGAINST ISIL.\n\n    This authorization shall constitute the sole statutory authority \nfor United States military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and \nthe Levant and associated persons or forces, and supersedes any prior \nauthorization for the use of military force involving action against \nISIL."
