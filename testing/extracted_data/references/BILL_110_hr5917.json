FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Congress enacted legislation to dramatically increase \n        Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards (hereafter in this \n        section referred to as ``CAFE standards''), mandating a fleet-\n        wide fuel economy of 35 miles per gallon by 2020.\n            (2) The new CAFE standards represent a 27 percent increase \n        over current CAFE standards.\n            (3) The new CAFE standards require Chrysler, Ford, and \n        General Motors to increase their research and development \n        investments at an estimated cost of $85,000,000,000.\n            (4) Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors currently invest a \n        total of approximately $16,000,000,000 each year to research \n        and develop safer, more efficient, and alternatively fueled \n        automobiles.\n            (5) Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors employ more than \n        65,000 Americans to research and develop new technologies.\n            (6) These required investments will place a large cost \n        burden on an already struggling industry, representing an \n        estimated additional $7,000,000,000 per year above current \n        research and development investments.\n            (7) Investments of finite funds in new energy efficiency \n        initiatives should not detract from current investments in \n        improved vehicle safety technology.\n            (8) Energy availability is a national security issue of the \n        utmost importance.\n            (9) A significant portion of United States energy use comes \n        from imported petroleum products from unstable regions.\n            (10) Clean diesel technology is a more efficient way to \n        utilize petroleum products to reduce emissions in the short-\n        term while alternative energy sources are developed.\n            (11) Harmonization of biodiesel composition standards will \n        enable more widespread use of clean diesel technology \n        throughout the country.\n            (12) Electric vehicle propulsion can help reduce dependence \n        on petroleum-based energy.\n            (13) Energy storage is critical in making electric vehicles \n        commercially viable.\n            (14) Technical challenges remain before adequate energy \n        storage for electric vehicles becomes a reality.\n            (15) There is no current domestic production of advanced \n        battery technology applicable to hybrid or electric vehicles.\n            (16) Domestic research, development, demonstration, and \n        production of advanced battery and electric vehicle technology \n        will create many high-paying jobs.\n            (17) Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles represent the long-term \n        goal of nearly emission-free transportation.\n            (18) Increased availability of hydrogen fuel is crucial to \n        increase the viability of leap-ahead hydrogen vehicle \n        technology.\n            (19) The United States Government currently invests Federal \n        funds across numerous agencies into research and development of \n        advanced fuel and efficiency enhancing technology, spending \n        approximately $400,000,000 in fiscal year 2007 and \n        approximately $1,100,000,000 in fiscal year 2008.\n            (20) Expanding and coordinating these currently disparate \n        efforts would yield greater gains in the development of viable \n        efficient alternative fuel technologies.\n            (21) The Federal Government can and should concert its \n        efforts in order to adequately provide relief from the large \n        cost burden placed on the auto industry by requiring extensive \n        research and development of advanced technology.\n\nSEC. 3.
