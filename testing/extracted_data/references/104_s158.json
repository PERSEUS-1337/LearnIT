AMENDMENTS TO THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LANDS ACT.\n\n    Section 8(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, (43 U.S.C. \n1337 (a)(3)), is amended by striking paragraph (3) in its entirety and \ninserting the following:\n            ``(3)(A) The Secretary may, in order to--\n                    ``(i) promote development or increased production \n                on producing or non-producing leases; or\n                    ``(ii) encourage production of marginal resources \n                on producing or non-producing leases;\n        through primary, secondary, or tertiary recovery means, reduce \n        or eliminate any royalty or net profit share set forth in the \n        lease(s). With the lessee's consent, the Secretary may make \n        other modifications to the royalty or net profit share terms of \n        the lease in order to achieve these purposes.\n            ``(B)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act other \n        than this subparagraph, with respect to any lease or unit in \n        existence on the date of enactment of the Outer Continental \n        Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act meeting the requirements of \n        this subparagraph, no royalty payments shall be due on new \n        production, as defined in clause (iv) of this subparagraph, \n        from any lease or unit located in water depths of 200 meters or \n        greater in the Western and Central Planning Areas of the Gulf \n        of Mexico, including that portion of the Eastern Planning Area \n        of the Gulf of Mexico encompassing whole lease blocks lying \n        west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, until such \n        volume of production as determined pursuant to clause (ii) has \n        been produced by the lessee.\n            (ii) Upon submission of a complete application by the \n        lessee, the Secretary shall determine within 180 days of such \n        application whether new production from such lease or unit \n        would be economic in the absence of the relief from the \n        requirement to pay royalties provided for by clause (i) of this \n        subparagraph. In making such determination, the Secretary shall \n        consider the increase technological and financial risk of deep \n        water development and all costs associated with exploring, \n        developing, and producing from the lease. The lessee shall \n        provide information required for a complete application to the \n        Secretary prior to such determination. The Secretary shall \n        clearly define the information required for a complete \n        application under this section. Such application may be made on \n        the basis of an individual lease or unit. If the Secretary \n        determines that such new production would be economic in the \n        absence of the relief from the requirement to pay royalties \n        provided for by clause (i) of this subparagraph, the provisions \n        of clause (i) shall not apply to such production. If the \n        Secretary determines that such new production would not be \n        economic in the absence of the relief from the requirement to \n        pay royalties provided for by clause (i), the Secretary must \n        determine the volume of production from the lease or unit on \n        which no royalties would be due in order to make such new \n        production economically viable; except that for new production \n        as defined in clause (iv)(I), in no case will that volume be \n        less than 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in water \n        depths of 200 to 400 meters, 52.5 million barrels of oil \n        equivalent in 400-800 meters of water, and 87.5 million barrels \n        of oil equivalent in water depths greater than 800 meters. \n        Redetermination of the applicability of clause (i) shall be \n        undertaken by the Secretary when requested by the lessee prior \n        to the commencement of the new production and upon significant \n        change in the factors upon which the original determination was \n        made. The Secretary shall make such redetermination within 120 \ndays of submission of a complete application. The Secretary may extend \nthe time period for making any determination or redetermination under \nthis clause for 30 days, or longer if agreed to by the applicant, if \ncircumstances so warrant. The lessee shall be notified in writing of \nany determination or redetermination and the reasons for and \nassumptions used for such determination. Any determination or \nredetermination under this clause shall be a final agency action. The \nSecretary's determination or redetermination shall be judicially \nreviewable under section 10(a) of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 \nU.S.C. 702), only for actions filed within 30 days of the Secretary's \ndetermination or redetermination.\n            ``(iii) In the event that the Secretary fails to make the \n        determination or redetermination called for in clause (ii) upon \n        application by the lessee within the time period, together with \n        any extension thereof, provided for by clause (ii), no royalty \n        payments shall be due on new production as follows:\n                    ``(I) For new production, as defined in clause \n                (iv)(I) of this subparagraph, no royalty shall be due \n                on such production according to the schedule of minimum \n                volumes specified in clause (ii) of this subparagraph.\n                    ``(II) For new production, as defined in clause \n                (iv)(II) of this subparagraph, no royalty shall be due \n                on such production for one year following the start of \n                such production.\n            ``(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `new \n        production' is--\n                    (I) any production from a lease from which no \n                royalties are due on production, other than test \n                production, prior to the date of enactment of the Outer \n                Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act; or\n                    (II) any production resulting from lease \n                development activities pursuant to a Development \n                Operations Coordination Document, or supplement thereto \n                that would expand production significantly beyond the \n                level anticipated in the Development Operations \n                Coordination Document, approved by the Secretary after \n                the date of enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf \n                Deep Water Royalty Relief Act.\n            ``(v) During the production of volumes determined pursuant \n        to clauses (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, in any year \n        during which the arithmetic average of the closing prices on \n        the New York Mercantile Exchange for light sweet crude oil \n        exceeds $28 per barrel, any production of oil will be subject \n        to royalties at the lease stipulated royalty rate. Any \n        production subject to this clause shall be counted toward the \n        production volume determined pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii). \n        Estimated royalty payments will be made if such average of the \n        closing prices for the previous year exceeds $28. After the end \n        of the calendar year, when the new average price can be \n        calculated, lessees will pay any royalties due, with interest \nbut without penalty, or can apply for a refund, with interest, of any \noverpayment.\n            ``(vi) During the production of volumes determined pursuant \n        to clause (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, in any year \n        during which the arithmetic average of the closing prices on \n        the New York Mercantile Exchange for natural gas exceeds $3.50 \n        per million British thermal units, any production of natural \n        gas will be subject to royalties at the lease stipulated \n        royalty rate. Any production subject to this clause shall be \n        counted toward the production volume determined pursuant to \n        clauses (ii) or (iii). Estimated royalty payments will be made \n        if such average of the closing prices for the previous year \n        exceeds $3.50. After the end of the calendar year, when the new \n        average price can be calculated, lessees will pay any royalties \n        due, with interest but without penalty, or can apply for a \n        refund, with interest, of any overpayment.\n            ``(vii) The prices referred to in clauses (v) and (vi) of \n        this subparagraph shall be changed during any calendar year \n        after 1994 by the percentage, if any, by which the implicit \n        price deflator for the gross domestic product changed during \n        the preceding calendar year.''.\n\nSEC. 3. NEW LEASES.\n\n    (a) Section 8(a)(1) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as \namended (43 U.S.C. 1337 (a)(1)), is amended as follows:\n            (1) Redesignate section 8(a)(1)(H) as section 8(a)(1)(I);\n            (2) Add a new section 8(a)(1)(H) as follows:\n                    ``(H) cash bonus bid with royalty at no less than \n                12\\1/2\\ per centum fixed by the Secretary in amount or \n                value of production saved, removed, or sold, and with \n                suspension of royalties for a period, volume, or value \n                of production determined by the Secretary. Such \n                suspensions may vary based on the price of production \n                from the lease.''.\n    (b) For all tracts located in water depths of 200 meters or greater \nin the Western and Central Planning Areas of the Gulf of Mexico \nincluding that portion of the Eastern Planning Area of the Gulf of \nMexico encompassing whole lease blocks lying west of 87 degrees, 30 \nminutes West longitude, any lease sale within five years of the date of \nenactment of this Act, shall use the bidding system authorized in \nsection 8(a)(1)(H) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended \nby this Act, except that the suspension of royalties shall be set at a \nvolume of not less than the following:\n            (1) 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent for leases in \n        water depths of 200 to 400 meters;\n            (2) 52.5 million barrels of oil equivalent for leases in \n        400 to 800 meters of water; and\n            (3) 87.5 million barrels of oil equivalent for leases in \n        water depths greater than 800 meters.\n\nSEC. 4.
