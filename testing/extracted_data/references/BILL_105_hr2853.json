DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The term ``National Park Capital Improvement Fund'' \n        means the fund established under this Act containing the \n        revenues collected by the National Park Service from all park \n        units in the National Park System and held in trust by the \n        Department of the Treasury for the purpose of paying the debt \n        service on the National Park Capital Improvement bonds.\n            (2) The term ``National Park Capital Improvement bonds'' \n        means bonds sold by the Department of the Treasury under this \n        Act to generate capital to make appropriate capital \n        improvements of National Park units as specified in this Act.\n            (3) The term ``capital improvements'' means more than \n        physical construction projects such as roads, visitor centers, \n        and other infrastructure projects. The term includes one-time \n        and periodic projects such as resource inventories, monitoring \n        activities, and educational and interpretive programs, as well \n        as transportation systems. The term also includes data \n        gathering and planning needed to design projects aimed at \n        protecting park resources.\n            (4) The term ``National Park System'' has the meaning \n        provided in section 2(a) of the Act of August 8, 1953 (16 \n        U.S.C. 1c(a)).\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Our Nation's parks are among our Nation's greatest \n        treasure and an integral part of our national heritage. We have \n        an obligation to protect them for future generations to enjoy, \n        learn from, and experience.\n            (2) Unfortunately, in recent years we have failed to take \n        proper care of our parks. In particular, more and more people \n        are visiting our parks and fewer and fewer real dollars are \n        being spent to protect the resources for which they were set \n        aside--their spectacular vistas, clean and clear water, \n        significant wildlife habitats, historic buildings, etc.\n            (3) While it is incumbent upon Congress to appropriate \n        adequate funds for the operation of our national parks, the \n        backlog of natural and cultural resource protection needs \n        together with other needs for transportation improvements, \n        building repairs, etc., is now so great that a new source of \n        funding to meet these needs must be found.\n            (4) All park needs, however, are not equal. Of utmost \n        importance and urgency is the need to protect the cultural, \n        historic, and natural resources for which our parks were set \n        aside to protect. These resources are our parks' capital. \n        Unless we preserve them, there will be little reason for \n        Americans and visitors from other countries to visit our parks. \n        Projects that are needed to prevent ongoing or threatened harm \n        to the resources of our parks must be given the highest \n        priority when funding priorities are set. Similarly, projects \n        designed to rehabilitate damage done in the past to park \n        resources should be given the next highest priority.\n            (5) In considering the needs of our parks, care must be \n        taken to avoid exacerbating problems, particularly those \n        involving visitors. Emphasis must be placed now, and into the \n        future, on designing and implementing transportation systems \n        which will minimize use of private cars and resultant traffic \n        problems within the parks, while providing safe, reliable, and \n        flexible alternatives.\n            (6) In considering the needs of our parks, activities which \n        do not require on the ground construction must not be slighted. \n        In particular, educational and interpretive programs are \n        central to the mission of our parks. Similarly, reliable and \n        sound information is central to the solution of the problems \n        facing them. Accordingly, these kinds of projects should be \n        recognized as essential investments in our parks.\n\nSEC. 4.
