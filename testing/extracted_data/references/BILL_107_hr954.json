NET METERING.\n\n    Part II of the Federal Power Act is amended by adding the following \nnew section at the end thereof:\n\n``SEC. 215. NET METERING.\n\n    ``(a) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n            ``(1) The term `customer-generator' means the owner or \n        operator of an electric generation unit qualified for net \n        metering under this section.\n            ``(2) The term `net metering' means measuring the \n        difference between the electricity supplied to a customer-\n        generator and the electricity generated by a customer-generator \n        that is delivered to a local distribution section system at the \n        same point of interconnection during an applicable billing \n        period.\n            ``(3) The terms `electric generation unit qualified for net \n        metering' and `qualified generation unit' mean an electric \n        energy generation unit that meets the requirements of paragraph \n        (5) and each of the following requirements:\n                    ``(A) The unit is a fuel cell or uses as its energy \n                source either solar, wind, or biomass.\n                    ``(B) The unit has a generating capacity of not \n                more than 100 kilowatts.\n                    ``(C) The unit is located on premises that are \n                owned, operated, leased, or otherwise controlled by the \n                customer-generator.\n                    ``(D) The unit operates in parallel with the retail \n                electric supplier.\n                    ``(E) The unit is intended primarily to offset part \n                or all of the customer-generator's requirements for \n                electric energy.\n            ``(4) The term `retail electric supplier' means any person \n        that sells electric energy to the ultimate consumer thereof.\n            ``(5) The term `local distribution system' means any system \n        for the distribution section of electric energy to the ultimate \n        consumer thereof, whether or not the owner or operator of such \n        system is also a retail electric supplier.\n    ``(b) Adoption.--Not later than one year after the enactment of \nthis section, each retail electric supplier shall comply with each of \nthe following requirements and notify all of its retail customers of \nsuch requirements not less frequently than quarterly:\n            ``(1) The supplier shall offer to arrange (either directly \n        or through a local distribution company or other third party) \n        to make available, on a first-come-first-served basis, to each \n        of its retail customers that has installed an energy generation \n        unit that is intended for net metering and that notifies the \n        supplier of its generating capacity an electric energy meter \n        that is capable of net metering if the customer-generator's \n        existing electrical meter cannot perform that function.\n            ``(2) Rates and charges and contract terms and conditions \n        for the sale of electric energy to customer-generators shall be \n        the same as the rates and charges and contract terms and \n        conditions that would be applicable if the customer-generator \n        did not own or operate a qualified generation unit and use a \n        net metering system.\nAny retail electric supplier or local distribution company may, at its \nown expense, install one or more additional electric energy meters to \nmonitor the flow of electricity in either direction or to reflect the \ntime of generation or both. Whenever a customer-generator with a net \nmetering system uses any energy generation system entitled to credits \nunder a Federal minimum renewable energy generation requirement, the \ntotal amount of energy generated by that system shall be treated as \ngenerated by the retail electric supplier for purposes of such \nrequirement.\n    ``(c) Net Energy Measurement and Billing.--Each retail electric \nsupplier subject to subsection (b) shall calculate the net energy \nmeasurement for a customer using a net metering system in the following \nmanner:\n            ``(1) The retail electric supplier shall measure the net \n        electricity produced or consumed during the billing period \n        using the metering referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) of \n        subsection (b).\n            ``(2) If the electricity supplied by the retail electric \n        supplier exceeds the electricity generated by the customer-\n        generator during the billing period, the customer-generator \n        shall be billed for the net electricity supplied by the retail \n        electric supplier in accordance with normal metering practices.\n            ``(3) If electricity generated by the customer-generator \n        exceeds the electricity supplied by the retail electric \n        supplier, the customer-generator--\n                    ``(A) shall be billed for the appropriate customer \n                charges for that billing period;\n                    ``(B) shall be credited for the excess electric \n                energy generated during the billing period, with this \n                credit appearing on the bill for the following billing \n                period (except for a billing period that ends in the \n                next calendar year); and\n                    ``(C) shall not be charged for transmission losses.\n        If the customer-generator is using a meter that reflects the \n        time of generation (a `real time meter'), the credit shall be \n        based on the retail rates for sale by the retail electric \n        supplier at the time of such generation. At the beginning of \n        each calendar year, any remaining unused kilowatt-hour credit \n        accumulated by a customer-generator during the previous year \n        may be sold by the customer-generator to any electric supplier \n        that agrees to purchase such credit. In the absence of any such \n        purchase, the credit shall be assigned (at no cost) to the \n        retail electric supplier that supplied electric energy to such \n        customer-generator at the end of the previous year.\n    ``(d) Percent Limitations.--\n            ``(1) Two percent limitation.--A local distribution company \n        retail electric supplier shall not be required to provide local \n        distribution service with respect to additional customer-\n        generators after the date during any calendar year on which the \n        total generating capacity of all customer-generators with \n        qualified generation facilities and net metering systems served \n        by that local distribution company is equal to or in excess of \n        2 percent of the capacity necessary to meet the company's \n        average forecasted aggregate customer peak demand for that \n        calendar year.\n            ``(2) One percent limitation.--A local distribution company \n        retail electric supplier shall not be required to provide local \n        distribution service with respect to additional customer-\n        generators using a single type of qualified energy generation \n        system after the date during any calendar year on which the \n        total generating capacity of all customer-generators with \n        qualified generation facilities of that type and net metering \n        systems served by that local distribution company is equal to \n        or in excess of 1 percent of the capacity necessary to meet the \n        company's average forecasted aggregate customer peak demand for \n        that calendar year.\n            ``(3) Records and notice.--Each retail electric supplier \n        shall maintain, and make available to the public, records of \n        the total generating capacity of customer-generators of such \n        system that are using net metering, the type of generating \n        systems and energy source used by the electric generating \n        systems used by such customer-generators. Each such retail \n        electric supplier shall notify the Commission when the total \n        generating capacity of such customer-generators is equal to or \n        in excess of 2 percent of the capacity necessary to meet the \n        supplier's aggregate customer peak demand during the previous \n        calendar year and when the total generating capacity of such \n        customer-generators using a single type of qualified generation \n        is equal to or in excess of 1 percent of such capacity.\n    ``(e) Safety and Performance Standards.--(1) A qualified generation \nunit and net metering system used by a customer-generator shall meet \nall applicable safety and performance and reliability standards \nestablished by the national electrical code, the Institute of \nElectrical and Electronics Engineers, Underwriters Laboratories, or the \nAmerican National Standards Institute.\n    ``(2) The Commission, after consultation with State regulatory \nauthorities and nonregulated local distribution systems and after \nnotice and opportunity for comment, may adopt by regulation additional \ncontrol and testing requirements for customer-generators that the \nCommission determines are necessary to protect public safety and system \nreliability.\n    ``(3) The Commission shall, after consultation with State \nregulatory authorities and nonregulated local distribution systems and \nafter notice and opportunity for comment, prohibit by regulation the \nimposition of additional charges by electric suppliers and local \ndistribution systems for equipment or services for safety or \nperformance that are additional to those necessary to meet the \nstandards referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B).\n    ``(f) State Authority.--Nothing in this section shall preclude a \nState from establishing or imposing additional incentives or \nrequirements to encourage qualified generation and net metering \nadditional to that required under this section.''.\n    ``(g) Interconnection Standards.--(1) Within one year after the \nenactment of this section the Commission shall publish model standards \nfor the physical connection between local distribution systems and \nqualified generation units and electric generation units that would be \nqualified generation units but for the fact that the unit has a \ngenerating capacity of more than 100 kilowatts (but not more than 250 \nkilowatts). Such model standards shall be designed to encourage the use \nof qualified generation units and to insure the safety and reliability \nof such units and the local distribution systems interconnected with \nsuch units. Within 2 years after the enactment of this section, each \nState shall adopt such model standards, with or without modification, \nand submit such standards to the Commission for approval. The \nCommission shall approve a modification of the model standards only if \nthe Commission determines that such modification is consistent with the \npurpose of such standards and is required by reason of local \nconditions. If standards have not been approved under this paragraph by \nthe Commission for any State within 2 years after the enactment of this \nsection, the Commission shall, by rule or order, enforce the \nCommission's model standards in such State until such time as State \nstandards are approved by the Commission.\n    ``(2) The standards under this section shall establish such \nmeasures for the safety and reliability of the affected equipment and \nlocal distribution systems as may be appropriate. Such standards shall \nbe consistent with all applicable safety and performance standards \nestablished by the national electrical code, the Institute of \nElectrical and Electronics Engineers, Underwriters Laboratories, or the \nAmerican National Standards Institute and with such additional safety \nand reliability standards as the Commission shall, by rule, prescribe. \nSuch standards shall ensure that generation units will automatically \nisolate themselves from the electrical system in the event of an \nelectrical power outage. Such standards shall permit the owner or \noperator of the local distribution system to interrupt or reduce \ndeliveries of available energy from the generation unit to the system \nwhen necessary in order to construct, install, maintain, repair, \nreplace, remove, investigate, or inspect any of its equipment or part \nof its system; or if it determines that curtailment, interruption, or \nreduction is necessary because of emergencies, forced outages, force \nmajeure, or compliance with prudent electrical practices.\n    ``(3) The model standards under this subsection prohibit the \nimposition of additional charges by local distribution systems for \nequipment or services for interconnection that are additional to those \nnecessary to meet such standards.\n    ``(h) Interconnection.--At the election of the owner or operator of \nthe generation unit concerned, connections meeting the standards \napplicable under subsection (g) may be made--\n            ``(1) by such owner or operator at such owner's or \n        operator's expense, or\n            ``(2) by the owner or operator of the local distribution \n        system upon the request of the owner or operator of the \n        generating unit and pursuant to an offer by the owner or \n        operator of the generating unit to reimburse the local \n        distribution system in an amount equal to the minimum cost of \n        such connection, consistent with the procurement procedures of \n        the State in which the unit is located, except that the work on \n        all such connections shall be performed by qualified electrical \n        personnel certified by a resposible body or licensed by a State \n        or local government authority.\n    ``(i) Consumer Friendly Contracts.--The Commission shall promulgate \nregulations insuring that simplified contracts will be used for the \ninterconnection of electric energy by electric energy transmission or \ndistribution systems and generating facilities that have a power \nproduction capacity not greater than 250 kilowatts.''"
