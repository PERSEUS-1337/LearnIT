    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Indian Education \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that Federal funding is \nprovided to support and sustain the longstanding Federal mandate \nrequiring colleges and States to waive, in certain circumstances, \ntuition charges for Native American Indian students they admit to an \nundergraduate college program, including the waiver of tuition charges \nfor Native American Indian students who are not residents of the State \nin which the college is located.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Native American-serving nontribal college institutions \n        have a valuable supplemental role to that provided by tribally \n        controlled community colleges in making available educational \n        opportunities to Native American Indian students.\n            (2) Some 4-year Native American-serving nontribal college \n        institutions provide tuition-free education, with the support \n        of the State in which they are located, as mandated by Federal \n        statute, to hundreds of Native American Indian students in \n        fulfillment of a condition under which the United States \n        provided land and facilities for such colleges to a State or \n        college.\n            (3) The value of the Native student tuition waiver benefits \n        contributed by these colleges and the States which support them \n        today far exceeds the value of the original grant of land and \n        facilities.\n            (4) The ongoing financial burden of meeting this Federal \n        mandate to provide tuition-free education to Native American \n        Indian students is no longer equitably shared among the States \n        and colleges because the mandate does not distinguish between \n        such students who are residents of the State or who are \n        residents of another State.\n            (5) Native student tuition waiver benefits are now at risk \n        of being terminated by severe budget constraints being \n        experienced by these colleges and the States which support \n        them.\n\nSEC. 4. STATE RELIEF FROM FEDERAL HIGHER EDUCATION MANDATE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Part A of title III of the Higher Education Act of \n1965 (20 U.S.C. 1057 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 319 \nthe following:\n\n``SEC. 319A.
