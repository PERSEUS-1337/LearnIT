matter that cannot be commercialized\n         without a significant investment of time, money, and effort, a \nperson shall be deemed to have commercially used the subject matter \nif--\n

          portion of the total investment necessary to \n                commercially use the subject matter, and made a \n                commercial transaction in the United States in \n

remainder of the \n                activities and investments necessary to commercially \n                use the subject matter, and promptly began commercial \n                use of the subject matter.\n            ``(3) Burden of proof.--A person asserting the defense \n        under this section shall have the burden of establishing the \n        defense.\n            ``(4) Abandonment of

or assigned or transferred to another person except in \n        connection with the good faith assignment or transfer of the \n        entire enterprise or line of business to which the defense \n        relates.\n            ``(6) One year limitation.--A person may not assert a \n        defense under this section unless the subject matter on which \n        the defense is based had been

with that person.\n            ``(7) Derivation.--A person may not assert the defense \n        under this section if the subject matter on which the defense \n        is based was derived from the
