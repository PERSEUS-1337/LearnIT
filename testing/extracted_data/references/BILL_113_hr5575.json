RAILWAY NOISE STUDY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation shall enter into \nan agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study \non railway noise in the United States.\n    (b) Contents of Study.--In conducting the study, the National \nAcademy of Sciences shall examine--\n            (1) the threshold of railway noise at which health begins \n        to be affected;\n            (2) the effectiveness of noise abatement programs for \n        railway noise on the property of a school;\n            (3) the impacts of railway noise on schools; and\n            (4) the noise assessment practices of the Department of \n        Transportation and whether such practices fairly and accurately \n        reflect the burden of noise on communities.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the date of the \nagreement entered into under subsection (a), the National Academy of \nSciences shall transmit to the Secretary a report on the results of the \nstudy. Upon receipt of the report, the Secretary shall transmit a copy \nof the report to the appropriate committees of Congress.\n\nSEC. 4. NOISE MEASUREMENT AND EXPOSURE SYSTEMS.\n\n    Not later than 12 months after the date of submission of the report \nunder section 3, in consultation with the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and Government, State, and interstate \nagencies that the Secretary of Transportation considers appropriate, \nthe Secretary shall by regulation--\n            (1) establish a single system of measuring railway noise \n        that--\n                    (A) has a highly reliable relationship between \n                projected railway noise exposure and surveyed reactions \n                of individuals to noise; and\n                    (B) is applied uniformly in measuring railway noise \n                near urbanized areas;\n            (2) establish a single system for determining the exposure \n        of individuals to railway noise in urbanized areas, including \n        noise intensity, duration, frequency, and time of occurrence; \n        and\n            (3) based on the findings of the report required under \n        section 3, determine minimum standards for railway noise levels \n        on the property of a school located in an urbanized area.\n\nSEC. 5. NOISE EXPOSURE MAPS.\n\n    (a) Submission and Preparation.--Not later than 12 months after the \ndate of issuance of regulations under section 4, each rail operator \nshall submit to the Secretary of Transportation a noise exposure map \nshowing any areas of nonconforming railway noise levels (based on the \nstandards developed under section 4) that--\n            (1) adversely impact a school located in an urbanized area; \n        and\n            (2) are caused by operations of the rail operator.\n    (b) Revised Maps.--If a change in the rail operations of a rail \noperator described in subsection (a) establishes a substantial new \nnonconforming noise level on the property of a school located in an \nurbanized area, or significantly reduces nonconforming noise levels on \nthe property of such a school, that is not reflected in the noise \nexposure map, the rail operator shall submit a revised noise exposure \nmap to the Secretary showing the new nonconforming noise levels or \nnoise level reduction.\n\nSEC. 6. NOISE COMPATIBILITY PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Program Submission.--A rail operator that submitted a noise \nexposure map under section 5 may submit a noise compatibility program \nto the Secretary of Transportation after--\n            (1) consulting with public agencies and planning \n        authorities in the area covered by the map; and\n            (2) notice and an opportunity for a public hearing.\n    (b) Contents of Program.--A program submitted under subsection (a) \nshall state the measures the rail operator has taken or proposes to \ntake to reduce existing nonconforming noise levels on the property of a \nschool and prevent creating additional nonconforming noise levels in \nthe area covered by the map. The measures may include constructing \nbarriers or acoustical shielding and soundproofing of schools subject \nto a nonconforming noise level.\n    (c) Approvals.--The Secretary shall approve or disapprove a program \nsubmitted under subsection (a) of this section not later than 180 days \nafter receiving it. The Secretary shall approve the program if the \nprogram--\n            (1) is reasonably consistent with achieving the goal of \n        reducing nonconforming noise levels on the property of a school \n        and preventing the introduction of additional nonconforming \n        noise levels on the property of a school; and\n            (2) provides for necessary revisions because of a revised \n        map submitted under section 5.\n    (d) Grants.--The Secretary may incur obligations to make grants \nfrom amounts available under section 8 to carry out a project under a \npart of a noise compatibility program approved under subsection (c). A \ngrant may be made to a rail operator submitting the program to carry \nout the program directly or in cooperation with--\n            (1) a local educational agency of a school that is subject \n        to nonconforming noise levels; or\n            (2) a unit of local government in the area surrounding the \n        school that has nonconforming noise levels.\n    (e) Federal Share.--The Federal share of a project for which a \ngrant is made under subsection (d) is 80 percent of the cost of the \nproject.\n\nSEC. 7. NONADMISSIBILITY OF NOISE EXPOSURE MAP AND RELATED INFORMATION \n              AS EVIDENCE.\n\n    No part of a noise exposure map or related information described in \nsection 5 that is submitted to, or prepared by, the Secretary of \nTransportation and no part of a list of land uses the Secretary \nidentifies as normally compatible with various exposures of individuals \nto noise may be admitted into evidence or used for any other purpose in \na civil action asking for relief for noise resulting from the operation \nof a fixed rail public transportation facility.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated from the Mass Transit \nAccount of the Highway Trust Fund under section 5338 of title 49, \nUnited States Code, such funds as may be necessary to carry out this \nAct."
