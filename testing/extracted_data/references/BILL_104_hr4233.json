FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 was enacted in order \n        to set forth the policy of the United States to convert to the \n        metric system. Section 3 of that Act requires that each Federal \n        agency use the metric system of measurements in its \n        procurement, grants, and other business-related activities, \n        unless that use is likely to cause significant cost or loss of \n        markets to United States firms, such as when foreign \n        competitors are producing competing products in non-metric \n        units.\n            (2) In accordance with that Act and Executive Order 12770, \n        of July 25, 1991, Federal agencies increasingly construct new \n        Federal buildings in round metric dimensions. As a result, \n        companies that wish to bid on Federal construction projects \n        increasingly are asked to supply materials or products in round \n        metric dimensions.\n            (3) While the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 currently \n        provides an exemption to metric usage when impractical or when \n        such usage will cause economic inefficiencies, amendments are \n        warranted to ensure that the use of specific metric components \n        in metric construction projects do not increase the cost of \n        Federal buildings to the taxpayers.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 4 of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. 205c) is \namended--\n            (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n            (2) by striking ``Commerce.'' in paragraph (4) and \n        inserting ``Commerce;''; and\n            (3) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:\n            ``(5) `full and open competition' has the same meaning as \n        defined in section 403(6) of title 41, United States Code;\n            ``(6) `total installed price' means the price of purchasing \n        a product or material, trimming or otherwise altering some or \n        all of that product or material, if necessary to fit with other \n        building components, and then installing that product or \n        material into a Federal facility;\n            ``(7) `hard-metric' means measurement, design, and \n        manufacture using the metric system of measurement, but does \n        not include measurement, design, and manufacture using English \n        system measurement units which are subsequently reexpressed in \n        the metric system of measurement;\n            ``(8) `cost or pricing data or price analysis' has the \n        meaning given such terms in section 304A of the Federal \n        Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. \n        254b); and\n            ``(9) `Federal facility' means any public building (as \n        defined under section 13 of the Public Buildings Act of 1959 \n        (40 U.S.C. 612) and shall include any Federal building or \n        construction project--\n                    ``(A) on lands in the public domain;\n                    ``(B) on lands used in connection with Federal \n                programs for agriculture research, recreation, and \n                conservation programs;\n                    ``(C) on or used in connection with river, harbor, \n                flood control, reclamation, or power projects;\n                    ``(D) on or used in connection with housing and \n                residential projects;\n                    ``(E) on military installations (including any \n                fort, camp, post, naval training station, airfield, \n                proving ground, military supply depot, military school, \n                or any similar facility of the Department of Defense);\n                    ``(F) on installations of the Department of Veteran \n                Affairs used for hospital or domiciliary purposes; or\n                    ``(G) on lands used in connection with Federal \n                prisons,\n        but does not include (i) any Federal Building or construction \n        project the exclusion of which the President deems to be \n        justified in the public interest, or (ii) any construction \n        project or building owned or controlled by a State government, \n        local government, Indian tribe, or any private entity.''.\n\nSEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION IN ACQUISITION OF FEDERAL FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. 205 et sec.) is \namended by inserting after section 13 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 14. IMPLEMENTATION IN ACQUISITION OF CONSTRUCTION SERVICES AND \n              MATERIALS FOR FEDERAL FACILITIES.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Construction services and materials for Federal \nfacilities shall be procured in accordance with the policies and \nprocedures set forth in chapter 137 of title 10, United States Code, \nsection 2377 of title 10, United States Code, title III of the Federal \nProperty and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et \nseq.), and section 3(2) of this Act. Determination of a design method \nshall be based upon preliminary market research as required under \nsection 2377(c) of title 10, United States Code, and section 314B(c) of \nthe Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. \n264b(c)). If the requirements of this Act conflict with the provisions \nof section 2377 of title 10, United States Code, or section 314B of the \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, then the \nprovisions of 2377 or 314B shall take precedence.\n    ``(b) Concrete Masonry Units.--In carrying out the policy set forth \nin section 3 (with particular emphasis on the policy set forth in \nparagraph (2) of that section) a Federal agency may require that \nspecifications for the acquisition of structures or systems of concrete \nmasonry be expressed under the metric system of measurement, but may \nnot incorporate specifications, that can only be satisfied by hard-\nmetric versions of concrete masonry units, in a solicitation for design \nor construction of a Federal facility within the United States or its \nterritories, or a portion of said Federal facility, unless the head of \nthe agency determines in writing that--\n            ``(1) hard-metric specifications are necessary in a \n        contract for the repair or replacement of parts of Federal \n        facilities in existence or under construction upon the \n        effective date of the Savings in Construction Act of 1996; or\n            ``(2) the following 2 criteria are met:\n                    ``(A) the application requires hard-metric concrete \n                masonry units to coordinate dimensionally into 100 \n                millimeter building modules; and\n                    ``(B) the total installed price of hard-metric \n                concrete masonry units is estimated to be equal to or \n                less than the total installed price of using non-hard-\n                metric concrete masonry units.

OMBUDSMAN.\n\n    Section 14 of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as added by \nsection 4 of this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new subsection:\n    ``(f) Agency Ombudsman.--(1) The head of each executive agency that \nawards construction contracts within the United States and its \nterritories shall designate a senior agency official to serve as a \nconstruction metrication ombudsman who shall be responsible for \nreviewing and responding to complaints from prospective bidders, \nsubcontractors, suppliers, or their designated representatives related \nto--\n            ``(A) guidance or regulations issued by the agency on the \n        use of the metric system of measurement in contracts for the \n        construction of Federal buildings; and\n            ``(B) the use of the metric system of measurement for \n        services and materials required for incorporation in individual \n        projects to construct Federal buildings.\nThe construction metrication ombudsman shall be independent of the \ncontracting officer for construction contracts.\n    ``(2) The ombudsman shall be responsible for ensuring that the \nagency is not implementing the metric system of measurement in a manner \nthat is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or \nloss of markets to United States firms in violation of the policy \nstated in section 3(2), or is otherwise inconsistent with guidance \nissued by the Secretary of Commerce in consultation with the \nInteragency Council on Metric Policy while ensuring that the goals of \nthe Metric Conversion Act of 1975 are observed.\n    ``(3) The ombudsman shall respond to each complaint in writing \nwithin 60 days and make a recommendation to the head of the executive \nagency for an appropriate resolution thereto.
