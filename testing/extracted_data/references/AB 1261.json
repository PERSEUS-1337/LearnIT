    "title": "An act to add Article 7 (commencing with Section 14590.10) to Chapter 8.7 of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to adult day health care.",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) California supports the dignity, independence, and choice of seniors and persons with disabilities to live in the most integrated setting appropriate, in their own home or a community-based setting, and to be free from unnecessary institutionalization.\n(b) The American population is swiftly aging. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2007 individuals 65 years of age and over represented 12.6 percent of the American population; by 2030 it is estimated the older adult population will reach 20 percent of the whole, with 70 million adults over 65 years of age. Many of these adults will experience disability and chronic conditions. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association reports that over five million Americans are living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and that number will grow to 16 million by 2050, with the cost of caring for those individuals growing from $203 billion in 2013 to $1.2 trillion by mid-century.\n(c) According to the United States Census, California\u2019s older adult population is the country\u2019s largest, with over four million seniors currently residing in the state. The California Department of Aging reports that one in every five Californians is now 60 years of age or older and 40 percent of those individuals have a disability. The state\u2019s population is also diverse: just under one-half million older adults in the state identify as Latino or Hispanic, 354,000 identify as Asian, over 182,000 as African American, and over 100,000 people as Native American, Pacific Islander, or multiracial.\n(d) Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) was established in California in 1974 as a service designed to meet the needs of older adults and adults with disabilities in community settings rather than in institutional care. ADHC centers are licensed daytime health facilities that provide integrated services from a multidisciplinary team including nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, and other professionals.\n(e) ADHC centers serve frail elders and other adults with disabilities, chronic conditions, and complex care needs, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other dementia, diabetes, high blood pressure, mental health diagnoses, traumatic brain injury, and people who have had a stroke or breathing problems or who cannot take medications properly.\n(f) ADHC centers also offer caregiver support, addressing research findings that identify caregiver stress as a leading cause of placement in a nursing facility, as well as putting the aging or disabled adult at increased risk for abuse or neglect.\n(g) ADHC services include health, therapeutic, and social services including transportation; skilled nursing care; physical, occupational, and speech therapy; medical social work services; therapeutic exercise activities; protective supervision; activities of daily living; brain-stimulating activities; and a nutritionally balanced hot meal. Services are provided in accordance with a person-centered care plan designed after a three-day interdisciplinary team assessment that includes a home visit and communication with the participant\u2019s primary care physician.\n(h) ADHC participants, who are at risk of institutionalization, receive services in the center and return to their own homes at night. According to a 2012 study by the California Medicaid Research Institute, the statewide weighted average annual per person nursing home cost for Medi-Cal/Medicare recipients in California is $83,364, while the average annual expenditure per person for ADHC for this population is $9,312.\n(i) ADHC centers are licensed by the State Department of Public Health and overseen by the California Department of Aging and the State Department of Health Care Services.\n(j) In 1977, Senator Henry Mello issued a report that identified the need for 600 ADHC centers statewide to meet the needs of California\u2019s elder population. At its peak in 2004, approximately 360 ADHC centers provided care to over 40,000 medically fragile Californians. In December 2013, there were a total of 270 open ADHC centers in California, including 245 serving the Medi-Cal population, two centers serving private-pay clients, and 23 centers associated with Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly. Medi-Cal recipients receiving services at ADHC centers totaled 28,777 persons.\n(k) In 2015, 32 California counties do not have an adult day health center, including Alpine, Amador, Calaveras, Colusa, Del Norte, El Dorado, Glenn, Inyo, Kings, Lake, Lassen, Madera, Mariposa, Mendocino, Modoc, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, San Benito, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, Sierra, Siskiyou, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Tulare, Tuolumne, and Yuba.\n(l) For many years, ADHC was a state plan optional benefit of the Medi-Cal program, offering an integrated medical and social services model of care that helped individuals continue to live outside of nursing homes or other institutions.\n(m) California\u2019s adult day services have experienced significant instability in recent years due to California\u2019s fiscal crisis and subsequent budget reductions. The Budget Act of 2011 and the related trailer bill, Chapter 3 of the Statutes of 2011, eliminated ADHC as a Medi-Cal optional state plan benefit.\n(n) A class action lawsuit, Esther Darling, et al. v. Toby Douglas, et al., challenged the elimination of ADHC as a violation of the Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C. The state settled the lawsuit, agreeing to replace ADHC services with a new program called Community-Based Adult Services (CBAS), effective April 1, 2012, to provide necessary medical and social services to individuals with intensive health care needs. CBAS is a managed care benefit, administered through California\u2019s Medi-Cal Managed Care Organizations. For CBAS-eligible individuals who do not qualify for managed care enrollment and who have an approved medical exemption or who reside in a county where managed care is currently not available, CBAS services are provided as a Medi-Cal fee-for-service benefit.\n(o) The State Department of Health Care Services amended the \u201cCalifornia Bridge to Reform\u201d Section 1115 Waiver to include the new CBAS program, which was approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on March 30, 2012, and renewed on November 28, 2014. CBAS is operational under the Section 1115 Bridge to Reform Waiver through October 31, 2015.\n(p) Adult day services and CBAS programs remain a source of necessary skilled nursing, therapeutic services, personal care, supervision, health monitoring, and caregiver support. The state\u2019s demographic forecast projects the continued growth of the aging population at least through the year 2050, thereby increasing the need and demand for integrated, community-based services.\n(q) Continuation of a well-defined and well-regulated system of CBAS programs is essential in order to meet the rapidly changing needs of California\u2019s diverse and aging population and the state\u2019s goals for the Coordinated Care Initiative.\n(r) Ensuring that the key elements of the CBAS program are codified in state law stabilizes the program\u2019s structure and eligibility framework in order to enable thousands of disabled and frail Californians who rely upon adult day health programs today, and those who will need this service in the future, to be able to continue to receive services that support them in remaining independent and free of institutionalization for as long as possible.\nSEC. 2.\nArticle 7 (commencing with Section 14590.10) is added to Chapter 8.7 of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:\nArticle  7.
