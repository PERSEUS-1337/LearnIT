FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) section 3(b)(1)(D) of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste \n        Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 2021c(b)(1)(D)) requires the Secretary of \n        Energy to safely dispose of all greater-than-Class C low-level \n        radioactive waste (as defined in section 61.55 of title 10, \n        Code of Federal Regulations);\n            (2) the Offsite Source Recovery Program, established by the \n        Department of Energy to recover and store sources of such \n        waste, is scheduled to cease operation by September 30, 2010;\n            (3) the Department of Energy estimates that about 14,000 \n        sealed sources of such waste will become unwanted and will have \n        to be disposed of through the Offsite Source Recovery Program \n        by that date;\n            (4)(A) in February 1987 the Secretary of Energy submitted \n        to Congress a comprehensive report making recommendations for \n        ensuring the safe disposal of all greater-than-Class C low-\n        level radioactive waste; and\n            (B) 16 years later, it is likely that the information \n        contained in the report is no longer current and does not \n        reflect the new security threat environment;\n            (5) the Department of Energy--\n                    (A) does not have the resources or storage facility \n                to recover and store all unwanted sources of greater-\n                than-Class C low-level radioactive waste; and\n                    (B) has not identified a permanent disposal \n                facility;\n            (6) it is unlikely that a permanent disposal facility will \n        be operational by the time that the Offsite Source Recovery \n        Program ceases operation;\n            (7) the initial steps in developing a disposal facility \n        (including preparation of an environmental impact statement and \n        issuance of a record of decision) could take several years and \n        will require dedicated funding to complete; and\n            (8) before a final decision on the disposal alternative to \n        be implemented is made, Congress must have an opportunity to \n        review the alternatives under consideration and provide input.\n\nSEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n    (a) Designation of Responsibility.--The Secretary of Energy shall \ndesignate an entity within the Department of Energy to have the \nresponsibility of completing activities needed to develop a facility \nfor safely disposing of all greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive \nwaste.\n    (b) Consultation With Congress.--In developing a plan for a \npermanent disposal facility for greater-than-Class C low-level \nradioactive waste (including preparation of an environmental impact \nstatement and issuance of a record of decision), the Secretary of \nEnergy shall consult with Congress.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORTS.\n\n    (a) Update of 1987 Report.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to \n        Congress an update of the report referred to in section 2(4).\n            (2) Contents.--The update shall contain--\n                    (A) an identification of the radioactive waste that \n                is to be disposed of (including the source of the waste \n                and the volume, concentration, and other relevant \n                characteristics of the waste);\n                    (B) an identification of the Federal and non-\n                Federal options for disposal of the waste;\n                    (C) a description of the actions proposed to ensure \n                the safe disposal of the waste;\n                    (D) an estimate of the costs of the proposed \n                actions;\n                    (E) an identification of the options for ensuring \n                that the beneficiaries of the activities resulting in \n                the generation of the radioactive waste bear all \n                reasonable costs of disposing of the waste;\n                    (F) an identification of any statutory authority \n                required for disposal of the waste; and\n                    (G) in coordination with the Environmental \n                Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory \n                Commission, an identification of any regulatory \n                guidance needed for the disposal of the waste.\n    (b) Report on Permanent Disposal Facility.--\n            (1) Report on cost and schedule for completion of eis and \n        rod.--Not later than 180 days after the date of submission of \n        the update under subsection (a), the Secretary of Energy shall \n        submit to Congress a report containing an estimate of the cost \n        and schedule to complete an environmental impact statement and \n        record of decision for a permanent disposal facility for \n        greater-than-Class C radioactive waste.\n            (2) Report on alternatives.--Before the Secretary of Energy \n        makes a final decision on the disposal alternative to be \n        implemented, the Secretary of Energy shall--\n                    (A) submit to Congress a report that describes all \n                alternatives under consideration; and\n                    (B) await action by Congress.\n    (c) Report on Short-Term Plan.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2003, the \n        Secretary of Energy shall submit to Congress a plan to ensure \n        the continued recovery and storage of greater-than-Class C low-\n        level radioactive waste until a permanent disposal facility is \n        available.\n            (2) Contents.--The plan shall contain estimated cost, \n        resource, and facility needs."
