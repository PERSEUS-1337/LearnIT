FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the \n        need for interoperable communications for public safety became \n        even more apparent, and critical to address.\n            (2) The inability of many firefighters and police to \n        communicate with each other in the World Trade Centers led to \n        some loss of lives that perhaps could have been prevented.\n            (3) As demonstrated by a hearing by the Committee on Energy \n        and Commerce of the House of Representatives, Subcommittee on \n        Telecommunications and the Internet, on June 11, 2003, \n        interoperability problems and spectrum and equipment shortages \n        continue to plague our nation's first responders, and without \n        additional funding these problems will continue.\n            (4) Action is critical to address these shortages not only \n        to ensure readiness in the event of another terrorist attack, \n        but also to address daily communications needs that are \n        essential.\n            (5) Each day this Nation's public safety officers put their \n        lives on the line to serve this country and immediate increases \n        in funding are essential.\n            (6) According to the report by the Council on Foreign \n        Relations, the United States is drastically underfunding local \n        emergency responders, and remains dangerously unprepared to \n        handle a catastrophic attack on American soil.\n\nSEC. 3. PUBLIC SAFETY TRUST FUND.\n\n    Part A of the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is amended by \nadding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 106.
