    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Product Safety Notification and \nRecall Effectiveness Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Consumer Product Safety Commission conducts \n        approximately 300 recalls of hazardous, dangerous, and \n        defective consumer products each year.\n            (2) In developing comprehensive corrective action plans \n        with recalling companies, the Consumer Product Safety \n        Commission staff greatly relies upon the media and retailers to \n        alert consumers to the dangers of unsafe consumer products, \n        because the manufacturers do not generally possess contact \n        information regarding the purchasing consumers. Based upon \n        information received from companies maintaining customer \n        registration lists, such contact information is known for \n        generally less than 7 percent of the total consumer products \n        produced and distributed.\n            (3) The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has found \n        that most consumers do not return purchaser identification \n        cards because of requests for marketing and personal \n        information on the cards, and the likelihood of receiving \n        unsolicited marketing materials.\n            (4) The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has \n        conducted research demonstrating that direct consumer contact \n        is one of the most effective ways of motivating consumer \n        response to a consumer product recall.\n            (5) Companies that maintain consumer product purchase data, \n        such as product registration cards, warranty cards, and rebate \n        cards, are able to effectively notify consumers of a consumer \n        product recall.\n            (6) The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has found \n        that a consumer product safety owner card, without marketing \n        questions or requests for personal information, that \n        accompanied products such as small household appliances and \n        juvenile products would increase consumer participation and \n        information necessary for direct notification in consumer \n        product recalls.\n            (7) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has, \n        since March 1993, required similar simplified, marketing-free \n        product registration cards on child safety seats used in motor \n        vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n        has found this requirement has increased recall compliance \n        rates.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reduce the number of \ndeaths and injuries from defective and hazardous consumer products \nthrough improved recall effectiveness, by--\n            (1) requiring the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \n        promulgate a rule to require manufacturers of juvenile \n        products, small household appliances, and certain other \n        consumer products, to include a simplified product safety owner \n        card with those consumer products at the time of original \n        purchase by consumers, or develop effective electronic \n        registration of the first purchasers of such products, to \n        develop a customer database for the purpose of notifying \n        consumers about recalls of those products; and\n            (2) encouraging manufacturers, private labelers, retailers, \n        and others to use creativity and innovation to create and \n        maintain effective methods of notifying consumers in the event \n        of a consumer product recall.\n\nSEC. 3.
