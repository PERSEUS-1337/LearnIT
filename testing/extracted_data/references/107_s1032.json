DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) AIDS.--The term ``AIDS'' means the acquired immune \n        deficiency syndrome.\n            (2) Executive agency.--The term ``Executive agency'' has \n        the meaning given the term in section 105 of title 5, United \n        States Code.\n            (3) Global fund.--The term ``global fund'' means the global \n        fund to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis established \n        consistent with section 4.\n            (4) HIV.--The term ``HIV'' means the human immunodeficiency \n        virus, the pathogen that causes AIDS.\n            (5) HIV/AIDS.--The term ``HIV/AIDS'' means, with respect to \n        an individual, an individual who is infected with HIV or living \n        with AIDS.\n            (6) Secretary general.--The term ``Secretary General'' \n        means the Secretary General of the United Nations.\n            (7) World bank.--The term ``World Bank'' means the \n        International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n\nSEC. ____03. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria disproportionately \n        affect the world's poorest countries and together will cost the \n        lives of 6,000,000 people this year alone.\n            (2) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/\n        AIDS (UNAIDS), more than 58,000,000 people worldwide have \n        already been infected with HIV/AIDS, a fatal disease that is \n        devastating the health, economies, and social structures in \n        dozens of countries in Africa, and increasingly in Asia, the \n        Caribbean, and Eastern Europe.\n            (3) AIDS has wiped out decades of progress in improving the \n        lives of families in the developing world. As the leading cause \n        of death in Africa, AIDS has killed 17,000,000 and will claim \n        the lives of one quarter of the population, mostly productive \n        adults, in the next decade. In addition, 13,000,000 children \n        have been orphaned by AIDS--a number that will rise to \n        40,000,000 by 2010.\n            (4) The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that \n        8,000,000 people each year become sick with tuberculosis, one \n        of the most dangerous contagious diseases, easily transmitted \n        through the air from those infected. Globally, tuberculosis \n        kills at least 2,000,000 each year, is the leading killer of \n        women between 15 and 44 years old, and is the most common cause \n        of death in Africa in those with HIV/AIDS.\n            (5) More than 40 percent of tuberculosis cases in the \n        United States result from importation of tuberculosis from \n        foreign-borne persons. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis spreads \n        because of inadequate control programs and inappropriate use of \n        anti-tuberculosis drugs--mostly in the developing world. \n        Without a concerted international effort to increase the \n        implementation of WHO-approved control strategies, the United \n        States risks importation of this particularly dangerous form of \n        tuberculosis.\n            (6) Malaria is a third disease that saps the social and \n        economic strength tropical developing countries. Malaria \n        affects more than 500,000,000 people each year and undermines \n        not only the health and productivity of the world's poorest \n        countries; malaria kills at least 1,000,000 each year, about \n        3,000 each day. In Africa, malaria kills a child every 40 \n        seconds.\n            (7) Beyond the human toll, the economic impact of AIDS, \n        malaria, and tuberculosis on regional economies is severe. \n        According to UNAIDS, HIV/AIDS alone will reduce gross domestic \n        product (GDP) of South Africa by 17 percent, or $22,000,000,000 \n        over the next 10 years, and WHO estimates that sub-Saharan \n        Africa's GDP would be 32 percent, or $100,000,000,000 higher \n        now if malaria had been conquered 35 years ago. The current \n        short term economic loss and direct cost of malaria is \n        estimated to be up to $12,000,000,000 each year.\n            (8) The UNAIDS program estimates it will cost \n        $3,000,000,000 for basic AIDS prevention and care services in \n        sub-Saharan Africa alone, and at least $2,000,000,000 more if \n        anti-retroviral drugs are provided widely. But in Africa, only \n        $500,000,000 is currently available from all donors, lending \n        agencies, and African governments themselves.\n            (9) For tuberculosis control, WHO estimates that a total of \n        $1,000,000,000 per year will be necessary to effectively fight \n        the tuberculosis epidemic, which will be spent to identify at \n        least 70 percent of the cases and curing 85 percent of them. \n        WHO indicates that an increase of $400,000,000 per year could \n        make this goal a reality.\n            (10) The Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi \n        Annan, has called for a global fund to halt and reverse the \n        spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The Secretary \n        General proposed a multibillion dollar ``war chest'' financed \n        jointly by donor governments and private contributors and, \n        equally important, called on leaders from developing nations to \ngive a much higher priority in their budgets to development of \ncomprehensive health systems.\n            (11) The Secretary General has outlined the following five \n        objectives for the fight against AIDS:\n                    (A) To ensure that people everywhere know what to \n                do to prevent infection.\n                    (B) To prevent the transmission from mother to \n                child.\n                    (C) To provide care and treatment to those \n                infected.\n                    (D) To provide care to those affected by AIDS, \n                especially orphans.\n                    (E) To deliver scientific breakthroughs, especially \n                vaccines.\n            (12) Prevention of new infections is key, although \n        treatment and care for those infected by HIV/AIDS is an \n        increasingly critical component of the global response. \n        Improving health systems, providing home-based care, treating \n        AIDS-associated diseases like tuberculosis, providing for \n        family support and orphan care, and making anti-retroviral \n        drugs against HIV available will reduce social and economic \n        damage to families and communities.\n            (13) Responding to the call from the Secretary General, the \n        African heads of state meeting at the African Summit on HIV/\n        AIDS, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in Abuja, \n        Nigeria, April 25-27, committed to increasing to at least 15 \n        percent the proportion of their budgets allocated to the health \n        sector.\n            (14) Expanded United States financial support for new broad \n        based international partnerships to control HIV/AIDS, malaria, \n        and tuberculosis can help leverage substantial increases in \n        global commitments to narrow the gap between need and currently \n        available resources.\n            (15) The World Bank and WHO have demonstrated that \n        investment in global public health activities to reduce HIV/\n        AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis not only is a humanitarian \n        imperative, it also helps bolster the economic and social \n        development necessary to build political and trade alliances. \n        Further, containment of international disease threats has \n        beneficial ramifications for Americans who are increasingly \n        susceptible to global infectious disease threats.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to provide for United States \nparticipation in a global effort to--\n            (1) mitigate the effects, and control the spread, of HIV/\n        AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis by supporting programs for the \n        prevention of new infections and for the care and treatment of \n        individuals infected with those diseases in countries seriously \n        affected, especially programs that provide care for children \n        orphaned by the HIV/AIDS epidemic; and\n            (2) provide the resources and leadership to control AIDS, \n        malaria, and tuberculosis through support of programs that \n        emphasize--\n                    (A) a science-based integrated approach that \n                includes prevention of new infections and the treatment \n                and care of infected individuals;\n                    (B) public-private partnerships; and\n                    (C) good governance.\n\nSEC. 5.
