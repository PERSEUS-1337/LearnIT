    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Those Who Serve Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Increasing numbers of members of the Armed Forces \n        serving in Afghanistan and Iraq are suffering from the \n        significant injuries of the current conflict: post traumatic \n        stress disorder and traumatic brain injury (hereafter in this \n        Act referred to as ``PTSD'' and ``TBI'', respectively) .\n            (2) A recent report by the RAND Corporation estimated that \n        of the 1.64 million individuals who have been deployed to \n        Afghanistan and Iraq, approximately 300,000 individuals \n        currently suffer from PTSD or major depression and that 320,000 \n        report having a probable TBI during deployment.\n            (3) The need for mental health services is likely to \n        increase because deployment lengths have increased in the last \n        year, the number of troops who have served in multiple \n        deployments is increasing, and the breaks between deployments \n        have been infrequent.\n            (4) Several experts have noted the difficulties faced by \n        members of the Armed Forces in getting screened, diagnosed, and \n        treated for PTSD and TBI. The RAND report found that, of those \n        who met diagnostic criteria for PTSD or major depression, only \n        53 percent had seen a physician or mental health provider to \n        seek help for a mental health problem in the past 12 months.\n            (5) Stigma remains a critical barrier to members of the \n        Armed Forces who may be in need of psychological care, \n        especially fears that seeking mental health care will lower the \n        confidence of others in their abilities, threaten career \n        advancement and security clearances, and possibly cause removal \n        from their unit.\n            (6) Stigma may be greatest among those individuals with the \n        greatest need for mental health services.\n            (7) To combat stigma, the Mental Health Task Force of the \n        Department of Defense and others have noted the need for the \n        Department to reexamine its policies, including those policies \n        related to command notification or self-disclosure of \n        psychological health issues that contribute to fears that \n        seeking mental health care will negatively affect career \n        opportunities or advancement.\n            (8) The Mental Health Task Force stated that this \n        ``widespread perception that seeking psychological health \n        services is costly to an individual's career . . . must be \n        challenged through thoughtful refinements in command \n        notification policies, including redefining the balance between \n        the need to encourage those in need to seek help and the need \n        for commanders to know in order to maintain force readiness''.\n            (9) Congress recognizes that much change is under way to \n        implement numerous recommendations to address concerns that \n        soldiers in need of mental health services for PTSD and other \n        conditions are not receiving, including efforts led by the \n        Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n            (10) However, without addressing stigma at all levels, \n        including structurally, these laudable efforts may not \n        accomplish their goals.\n            (11) In its July 2007 report, the Mental Health Task Force \n        called for ending overly conservative policies that have the \n        unintentional consequence of fueling erroneous beliefs that \n        seeking psychological health care invariably results in \n        permanent damage to one's military career. For example, the \n        Task Force called for allowing, in the case of alcohol use by a \n        member of the Armed Forces, for the member to receive \n        appropriate and non-prejudicial education and preventive \n        services, without a requirement for command notification, when, \n        in a clinician's judgment, the alcohol use does not warrant a \n        diagnosis of substance abuse or dependency or does not require \n        entry into a formal treatment program.\n            (12) In May, responding to some of these concerns, \n        Secretary of Defense Robert Gates reportedly approved a change \n        in the Department's security clearance process to help remove \n        the stigma associated with seeking mental health care. Under \n        the change, members of the Armed Forces and employees of the \n        Department of Defense who have received mental health care will \n        no longer have to acknowledge that when they fill out standard \n        security clearance forms, unless the treatment was court-\n        ordered or involved violence.\n            (13) Congress encourages the Department to explore further \n        changes to notification and other policies to further reduce \n        stigma among members of the Armed Forces, especially as it \n        relates to career opportunities.\n\nSEC. 3. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACCESS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n    (a) Demonstration Project Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall \nconduct a demonstration project designed to develop and test options \nfor the following:\n            (1) Increasing access of members of the Armed Forces \n        returning from deployment abroad, and family members of such \n        members, to accessible, safe, and confidential mental health \n        counseling.\n            (2) Reducing stigma and perceived career repercussions \n        associated with such members seeking such services.\n            (3) Making high quality mental health services more user \n        friendly and accessible for members of the Armed Forces and \n        their family members, including making services available \n        outside standard working hours.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the demonstration project is to \nprovide high-quality treatment, using (to the extent practicable) \nevidence-based treatment, for a broad range of mental health \nconditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, \nwith the goal of early intervention to promote effective coping and \nresilience.\n    (c) Duration of Project.--The demonstration project authorized by \nthis section shall be implemented for a period of three years beginning \nnot later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
