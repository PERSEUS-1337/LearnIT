FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In Executive Proclamation 5928, issued on December 27, \n        1988, the President extended the boundaries of the territorial \n        sea of the United States from 3 nautical miles to 12 nautical \n        miles in accordance with international law. However, the \n        Proclamation did not adequately address the effect of the \n        extension on the territorial jurisdiction of the States.\n            (2) The coastal States have, with few exceptions, \n        jurisdiction over the land, air, water, and resources within \n        their boundaries, which in most cases extend out into the \n        oceans 3 nautical miles.\n            (3) The Great Lake States have jurisdiction over the land, \n        air, water, and resources of their offshore areas up to the \n        border with Canada, which can range from 11 to 80 nautical \n        miles from the coast line.\n            (4) Some Gulf of Mexico States have jurisdiction over the \n        land, air, water, and resources of their offshore areas out to \n        10.4 nautical miles from their coast line.\n            (5) The coastal States--\n                    (A) have consistently demonstrated an ability to \n                manage ocean resources within their jurisdiction in a \n                manner consistent with the interests of both the Nation \n                and the coastal States;\n                    (B) have demonstrated both experience and skill at \n                balancing protection, conservation, and utilization of \n                the living and nonliving resources of the ocean; and\n                    (C) are better equipped than the Federal \n                Government, in terms of fiscal resources and \n                administrative abilities, to manage oil and natural gas \n                resources within 12 nautical miles of their coast line.\n\nSEC. 3. EXTENSION OF STATE JURISDICTION OVER SUBMERGED LANDS.\n\n    The Submerged Lands Act is amended--\n            (1) in section 2(a)(2) (43 U.S.C. 1301(a)(2)) by striking \n        out ``three geographical miles'' the first place it appears and \n        all that follows through ``beyond three geographical miles,'' \n        and inserting ``12 nautical miles distant from the coast line \n        of each such State;'';\n            (2) in section 2(b) (43 U.S.C. 1301(b))--\n                    (A) by striking out ``they existed'' and all that \n                follows through ``extended or'' and inserting in lieu \n                thereof ``approved and''; and\n                    (B) by striking out ``three geographical'' and all \n                that follows through ``Mexico'' and inserting ``12 \n                nautical miles or, in the case of the Great Lakes, \n                farther than to the international boundary''; and\n            (3) in section 4 (43 U.S.C. 1312)--\n                    (A) in the first sentence--\n                            (i) by striking out ``original coastal \n                        State'' and inserting ``coastal State admitted \n                        to the Union before the date of enactment of \n                        the Coastal States Extension Act of 2013''; and\n                            (ii) by striking out ``three geographical'' \n                        and inserting ``12 nautical''; and\n                    (B) in the second sentence by striking \n                ``formation'' and all that follows through the end of \n                the section and inserting ``date of enactment of the \n                Coastal States Extension Act of 2013 may assert its \n                seaward boundaries to a line 12 nautical miles distant \n                from its coast line.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
