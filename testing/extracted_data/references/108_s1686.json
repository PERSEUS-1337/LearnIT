    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Adoption Promotion Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1997, the Congress passed the Adoption and Safe \n        Families Act of 1997 to promote comprehensive child welfare \n        reform to ensure that consideration of children's safety is \n        paramount in child welfare decisions, and to provide a greater \n        sense of urgency to find every child a safe, permanent home.\n            (2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 also created \n        the Adoption Incentives program, which authorizes incentive \n        payments to States to promote adoptions, with additional \n        incentives provided for the adoption of foster children with \n        special needs.\n            (3) Since 1997, all States, the District of Columbia, and \n        Puerto Rico have qualified for incentive payments for their \n        work in promoting adoption of foster children.\n            (4) Between 1997 and 2002, adoptions increased by 64 \n        percent, and adoptions of children with special needs increased \n        by 63 percent; however, 542,000 children remain in foster care, \n        and 126,000 are eligible for adoption.\n            (5) Although substantial progress has been made to promote \n        adoptions, attention should be focused on promoting adoption of \n        older children. Recent data suggest that half of the children \n        waiting to be adopted are age 9 or older.\n\nSEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF ADOPTION INCENTIVE PAYMENTS PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 473A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n673b) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (b)--\n                    (A) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the \n                following:\n            ``(2)(A) the number of foster child adoptions in the State \n        during the fiscal year exceeds the base number of foster child \n        adoptions for the State for the fiscal year;
