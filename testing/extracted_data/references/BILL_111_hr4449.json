SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Responsible Online \nVoter Empowerment Registration Act of 2010''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Most States continue to rely upon paper forms for voter \n        registration.\n            (2) Paper voter registration forms are subject to delays in \n        postal delivery or in submission to election officials for \n        processing, and may be subject to errors when data is entered \n        into registration systems.\n            (3) Online voter registration systems can solve the \n        problems identified with paper forms, and with proper security \n        measures can do so without increasing fraud.\n            (4) Online voter registration can increase the accuracy of \n        registration records and reduce costs by eliminating the need \n        for data entry of paper forms.\n            (5) States that offer online voter registration have \n        experienced rapid and widespread adoption by individuals \n        registering to vote.\n            (6) To ensure that online voter registrations are secure it \n        is vital to validate them against an existing database with \n        suitable information for voter registration.\n            (7) Voter registration records must include the voter's \n        signature in order to validate absentee ballots and signatures \n        on petitions, initiatives, and referenda.\n\nSEC. 2.
