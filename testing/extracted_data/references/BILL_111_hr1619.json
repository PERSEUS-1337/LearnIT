FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Bureau of the Census, 8,100,000 \n        children and young adults are uninsured at some point during \n        the year. Young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 years old \n        make up 21 percent of the total uninsured population.\n            (2) According to a recent study, approximately 20 percent \n        of school-aged children suffer from a chronic illness.\n            (3) Thirteen States have passed legislation that increased \n        the age of dependency for young adults for purposes of private \n        insurance coverage to age 25.\n            (4) When a child or young adult has a 63-day gap in \n        insurance coverage, pre-existing condition exclusions, such as \n        coverage limits or waiting periods, can be applied when the \n        child or young adult becomes insured under a new health \n        insurance policy.\n            (5) Eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions for \n        children is a vital safeguard to ensure all children have \n        access to health care when in need.\n            (6) High-risk pools were created to help individuals with \n        pre-existing conditions purchase insurance with the assistance \n        of government subsidies. However, State high-risk pools are \n        often underfunded, unaffordable for patients, have long waiting \n        lists and impose pre-existing condition waiting periods once \n        enrolled.\n            (7) Pre-existing condition limitation periods for children \n        in the private market discourage families from moving off \n        Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITION EXCLUSIONS FOR CHILDREN \n              UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS.\n\n    (a) Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n1974.--Section 701(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n1974 (29 U.S.C. 1181(d)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\n            ``(1) Exclusion not applicable to children.--A group health \n        plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health \n        insurance coverage, may not impose any pre-existing condition \n        exclusion in the case of an individual who has not attained 25 \n        years of age.'';\n            (2) by striking paragraphs (2) and (4); and\n            (3) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (2).\n    (b) Amendments to the Public Health Service Act.--Section 2701(d) \nof the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg(d)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\n            ``(1) Exclusion not applicable to children.--A group health \n        plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health \n        insurance coverage, may not impose any pre-existing condition \n        exclusion in the case of an individual who has not attained 25 \n        years of age.'';\n            (2) by striking paragraphs (2) and (4); and\n            (3) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (2).\n    (c) Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.--Subsection \n(d) of section 9801 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \nexceptions) is amended--\n            (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\n            ``(1) Exclusion not applicable to children.--A group health \n        plan may not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion in the \n        case of an individual who has not attained 25 years of age.'';\n            (2) by striking paragraphs (2) and (4); and\n            (3) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (2).\n    (d) Effective Date.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n        amendments made by this section shall apply with respect to \n        group health plans for plan years beginning after the end of \n        the 12th calendar month following the date of the enactment of \n        this Act.\n            (2) Special rule for collective bargaining agreements.--In \n        the case of a group health plan maintained pursuant to one or \n        more collective bargaining agreements between employee \n        representatives and one or more employers ratified before the \n        date of the enactment of this Act, the amendments made by this \n        section shall not apply to plan years beginning before the \n        later of--\n                    (A) the date on which the last of the collective \n                bargaining agreements relating to the plan terminates \n                (determined without regard to any extension thereof \n                agreed to after the date of the enactment of this Act); \n                or\n                    (B) the date that is after the end of the 12th \n                calendar month following the date of enactment of this \n                Act.\n        For purposes of subparagraph (A), any plan amendment made \n        pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement relating to the \n        plan which amends the plan solely to conform to any requirement \n        added by the amendments made by this section shall not be \n        treated as a termination of such collective bargaining \n        agreement.\n\nSEC. 4.
