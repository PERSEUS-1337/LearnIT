If a request is determined not to be complete, the executive officer shall immediately transmit that determination to the requester, specifying those parts of the request that are incomplete and the manner in which they can be made complete. When the request is deemed complete, the executive officer shall place the request on the agenda of the next commission meeting for which adequate notice can be given but not more than 90 days from the date that the request is deemed complete, unless the commission has delegated approval of requests made pursuant to this section to the executive officer.

If a request is determined not to be complete, the executive officer shall immediately transmit that determination to the requester, specifying those parts of the request that are incomplete and the manner in which they can be made complete.

It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, (2) each bill amends Section 56133 of the Government Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Senate Bill 239, in which case Section 1 of this bill shall not become operative."
