    "content": "The leaders of the eight legislative branch agencies and entities\u2014the Government Accountability Office, the Library of Congress, the Government Publishing Office (formerly Government Printing Office), the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, and the Office of Compliance\u2014are appointed in a variety of manners.  The first four agencies are led by a person appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The next two are appointed by Congress, the next by the Librarian of Congress, and the last by a board of directors.  Congress has periodically examined the procedures used to appoint legislative branch officers with the aim of protecting the prerogatives of, and ensuring accountability to, Congress within the framework of the advice and consent appointment process established in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. Legislation to alter the appointment process for legislative branch agencies and entities has periodically been introduced for many years. Questions remain about various reform proposals, including the ability of Congress to remove the President from the appointment process for some of these positions. These may depend upon the implication or interpretation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, the definition of an \"officer of the United States,\" the specific office or agency in question, and whether or not a change in appointing authority would require any revision in the powers and duties of legislative branch agency leaders. Some previous reforms and proposals have also attempted to find a role for the House of Representatives, which does not play a formal role in the confirmation of presidential nominees, in the search for legislative branch officials.  The report also briefly addresses legislation considered, but not enacted, in the 115 th Congress to change the appointment process for the Register of Copyrights. The following sections contain information on the legislative branch agency heads' appointment processes, length of tenures (if terms are set), reappointment or removal provisions (if any), salaries and benefi ts, and most recent appointments. Information is provided on each agency and summarized in Table 1 . Pursuant to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1990, the Architect is \"appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate for a term of 10 years.\" The act also established a congressional commission responsible for recommending individuals to the President for the position of Architect of the Capitol. The commission, originally consisting of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the majority and minority leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the chairs and the ranking minority Members of the Committee on House Administration and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, was expanded in 1995 to include the chairs and ranking minority Members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.  Prior to 1989, the Architect was selected by the President for an unlimited term without any formal involvement of Congress. The FY1990 act, however, followed numerous attempts dating at least to the 1950s to alter the appointment procedure to provide a role for Congress. The proposals included requiring the advice and consent of the Senate, establishing a commission to recommend names to the President, and removing the appointment process from the President and instead making the Architect appointed solely by Congress.  In the 111 th Congress, two measures ( H.R. 2185 and H.R. 2843 ) were introduced to remove the President from the Architect appointment process and shift it to congressional leaders and chairs and ranking Members of specific congressional committees. Under both measures, the Architect would still serve a 10-year term. Under H.R. 2843 , as reported, the Architect would have been appointed jointly by the same 14-member panel, equally divided between the House and Senate, that currently is responsible for recommending candidates to the President. This bill was reported by the Committee on House Administration ( H.Rept. 111-372 ) on December 10, 2009. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure was discharged from further consideration the same day. The House agreed to the bill, as amended to include an 18-member panel, also equally divided between the House and Senate, by voice vote on February 3, 2010. H.R. 2843 was received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration, although no further action was taken. Under the earlier bill ( H.R. 2185 , 111 th Congress), which was introduced on April 30, 2009, the Architect would have been appointed jointly by the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, the minority leaders in the House and Senate, the chairs and ranking minority Members of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, and the chairs and ranking minority Members of the Committee on House Administration and Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. This bill followed similar legislation ( H.R. 6656 , 110 th Congress), with the same 12-member appointing panel, introduced on July 30, 2008. Both bills were referred to two committees, but no further action was taken.  The Architect of the Capitol is compensated at an \"annual rate which is equal to the lesser of the annual salary for the Sergeant at Arms of the House of Representatives or the annual salary for the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate.\"  Stephen T. Ayers was nominated by President Obama for a 10-year term on February 24, 2010. He was the second Architect nominated pursuant to the new commission procedure. The nomination was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The committee held a hearing on April 15, 2010, and Ayers was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on May 12, 2010. Ayers was previously the Deputy Architect/Chief Operating Officer and had served as Acting Architect of the Capitol following the February 4, 2007, retirement of former Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman.  Upon the retirement of Ayers on November 23, 2018, Christine Merdon, the Deputy Architect of the Capitol/Chief Operating Officer, became the Acting Architect of the Capitol. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 703(a)(1), the Comptroller General shall be \"appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" This procedure dates to the establishment of the agency in 1921. Additionally, a commission procedure established in 1980 recommends individuals to the President in the event of a vacancy. The commission consists of the Speaker of the House, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate, the chairs and ranking minority Members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The commission is to recommend at least three individuals for this position to the President, although the President may request additional names.  The Comptroller General is appointed to a 15-year term and may not be reappointed. The Comptroller General may be removed by \"(A) impeachment; or (B) joint resolution of Congress, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing\" and only by reason of permanent disability; inefficiency; neglect of duty; malfeasance; or a felony or conduct involving moral turpitude. The salary of the Comptroller General is equal to Level II of the Executive Schedule. Additionally, a law enacted in 1953 established a separate retirement system for the Comptroller General.  Gene L. Dodaro, then-Chief Operating Officer at GAO, became the acting Comptroller General on March 13, 2008, upon the resignation of David M. Walker, who had previously been confirmed on October 21, 1998. The White House announced Dodaro's nomination to a 15-year term as Comptroller General on September 22, 2010. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a hearing on the nomination on November 18, 2010, and Dodaro was confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent on December 22, 2010. The Government Publishing Office (formerly Government Printing Office) was established in 1861. The U.S. Code , at 44 U.S.C. 301, states that the President \"shall nominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint a suitable person to take charge of and manage the Government Publishing Office. The title shall be Director of the Government Publishing Office.\"  The current appointment language was enacted in 2014, although the use of the advice and consent procedure for this position can be traced back much further. There is no set term of office for the Director. The Director's pay is equivalent to Level II of the Executive Schedule. Robert C. Tapella was nominated to be Director of the Government Publishing on June 18, 2018. The nomination was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. No further action was taken prior to the end of the 115 th Congress, and the nomination was returned to the President pursuant to Senate Rule XXXI. President Trump renominated Tapella on January 16, 2019. The nomination was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. Previously, Tapella served in this role from October 4, 2007 (confirmed by the Senate by voice vote) until December 28, 2010. GPO's Chief Administrative Officer, Herbert H. Jackson Jr., has served as Acting Deputy Director since July 1, 2018, following the retirement of Andrew M. Sherman. Sherman, formerly GPO's Chief of Staff, had been serving as Acting Deputy Director since the retirement of Acting GPO Director Jim Bradley on March 6, 2018. Bradley, previously the GPO Deputy Director, had assumed this role following the departure of the previous Director, Davita Vance-Cooks, in November 2017. Vance-Cooks had been nominated by President Obama on May 9, 2013, to be Public Printer, as the head of the GPO was then known, and confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on August 1, 2013. The Library of Congress was established in 1800. The U.S. Code , at 2 U.S.C. 136, states: \"The Librarian of Congress shall make rules and regulations for the government of the Library.\" Until an act of February 19, 1897, which made the appointment subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, the Librarian was appointed solely by the President.  Recent changes to the appointment statute, at 2 U.S.C. 136-1, amended the tenure of the Librarian. The Librarian of Congress Succession Modernization Act of 2015, S. 2162 , was introduced in the Senate on October 7, 2015, and agreed to the same day by unanimous consent. It was agreed to in the House without objection on October 20 and signed by President Obama on November 5, 2015 ( P.L. 114-86 ). The act establishes a term limit of 10 years, with the possibility of reappointment by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Previously, there was no set term of office for the Librarian. The U.S. Code , at 2 U.S.C. 136a-2, states: \"the Librarian of Congress shall be compensated at an annual rate of pay which is equal to the annual rate of basic pay payable for positions at Level II of the Executive Schedule under section 5313 of title 5.\"  Carla D. Hayden was nominated to a 10-year term as Librarian of Congress by President Obama on February 24, 2016. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration held a hearing on the nomination on April 20, 2016, and ordered the nomination favorably reported on June 9. Hayden was confirmed as the 14 th Librarian of Congress on July 13, 2016 (74-18, record vote number 128). Hayden succeeded James H. Billington who retired effective September 30, 2015. Billington had been confirmed as Librarian of Congress by the Senate on July 24, 1987.  The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 provides that the Librarian of Congress appoint the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) \"after consultation with the Joint Committee on the Library.\" The basic rate of pay for the director is equivalent to Level III of the Executive Schedule. There is no set term of office. Mary B. Mazanec, who served as Acting Director of CRS following the retirement of former Director Daniel P. Mulhollan on April 2, 2011, was appointed Director by the Librarian of Congress on December 5, 2011. 2 U.S.C. 1901 states: \"There shall be a captain of the Capitol police and such other members with such rates of compensation, respectively, as may be appropriated for by Congress from year to year. The Capitol Police shall be headed by a Chief who shall be appointed by the Capitol Police Board and shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.\" The last sentence was inserted in 1979, struck by the FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, and restored in 2010 by the U.S. Capitol Police Administrative Technical Corrections Act. Pursuant to the FY2003 act, the chief of the Capitol Police receives compensation \"equal to $1,000 less than the lower of the annual rate of pay in effect for the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives or the annual rate of pay in effect for the Sergeant-at-Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate.\" Pay for the chief has been adjusted multiple times in recent years: it formerly was (1) equal to Level IV of the Executive Schedule under 1979 legislation, (2) linked to the Senior Executive Service under an act from 2000, and (3) equal to $2,500 less than these officers pursuant to a 2002 law.  On February 24, 2016, the Capitol Police Board announced the appointment of Matthew R. Verderosa as the new Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, effective March 20, 2016. Previously, Chief Kim Dine was sworn in on December 17, 2012.  The director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has been appointed wholly by Congress since the creation of the post with the passage of the Congressional Budget Act in 1974. The act stipulates that the director is appointed for a four-year term \"by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate after considering recommendations received from the Committees on the Budget of the House and the Senate, without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of his fitness to perform his duties.\" The director may be reappointed, and either chamber can remove the director by simple resolution. Additionally, a director appointed \"to fill a vacancy prior to the expiration of a term shall serve only for the unexpired portion of that term\" and an \"individual serving as Director at the expiration of a term may continue to serve until his successor is appointed.\" The director of CBO receives compensation at an annual rate that is equal to the lower of the highest annual rate of compensation of any officer of the House or any officer of the Senate. Keith Hall, the current director of CBO, began his service on April 1, 2015. He follows Douglas W. Elmendorf, who began his term on January 22, 2009.  2 U.S.C. 1382 states that the chair of the board of directors of the Office of Compliance, \"subject to the approval of the Board, shall appoint and may remove an Executive Director. Selection and appointment of the Executive Director shall be without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of fitness to perform the duties of the Office.\" The executive director must be \"an individual with training or expertise in the application of laws referred to in section 1302(a)\" of Title II of the U.S. Code . The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act altered the compensation for the Office's statutorily established positions, including that of the executive director. The chair of the board may fix the annual rate of pay for the executive director, although the level may not exceed the lesser of House or Senate officers. Prior to the FY2008 act, the maximum pay for this position had been Level V of the Executive Schedule. Separate legislation, P.L. 110-164 , amended the Congressional Accountability Act and altered eligibility and tenure restrictions for the executive director by allowing current or former Office of Compliance employees to serve in this capacity. The legislation also permits the executive director, deputy executive directors, and general counsel, who formerly were limited to one five-year term in their positions, to serve up to two terms. Susan Tsui Grundmann was appointed to a five-year term as executive director commencing January 2017. She succeeded Barbara J. Sapin, who was appointed in 2013.  During the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate considered legislation that would alter the appointment of one position within one of these agencies\u2014the Register of Copyrights. Under current law pertaining to the copyright office (17 U.S.C. 701):  All administrative functions and duties ... are the responsibility of the Register of Copyrights as director of the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress. The Register of Copyrights, together with the subordinate officers and employees of the Copyright Office, shall be appointed by the Librarian of Congress, and shall act under the Librarian's general direction and supervision.  H.R. 1695 and S. 1010 , the Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act, would have made the Register of Copyrights a presidential appointment, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. The legislation would have established a seven-person panel to recommend at least three candidates for this position to the President. The panel would consist of the Speaker of the House, President pro tempore of the Senate, majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate, and Librarian of Congress. The bills would have established a 10-year term of office for the Register. H.R. 1695 was reported by the House Judiciary Committee on April 20, 2017 ( H.R. 1695 , H.Rept. 115-91 ), and passed in the House, as amended, on April 26 (378\u201348, Roll no. 227). The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration held a hearing on September 26, 2018. A Senate committee markup of S. 1010 initially scheduled for December 12, 2018, was postponed. No further action was taken during the 115 th Congress. The office is currently led by Acting Register of Copyrights Karyn A. Temple, who was named to the position by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden on October 21, 2016."
