FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Responders to the terrorist attacks at the World Trade \n        Center, the Pentagon, and the tragedy in Pennsylvania on \n        September 11, 2001, from numerous jurisdictions assisted the \n        fire and rescue, law enforcement, and health workers \n        responsible for responding within their jurisdictions.\n            (2) Even in the largest municipalities, first responders \n        need the support of officials and personnel from their own and \n        neighboring jurisdictions, as well as support from numerous \n        regional, State, Federal, and private sector entities.\n            (3) The sheer number of agencies taking part in any \n        emergency response demands coordination, mutual support, and \n        effective communication. Regional planning and coordination of \n        response efforts are essential to ensure threat-based, multi-\n        jurisdictional, and interoperable assessments and plans.\n            (4) There does not exist a consistent national standard for \n        allocation of homeland security grant money. Threat based \n        vulnerability assessments and plans will provide a consistent \n        national standard based on need.\n            (5) Regional councils of governments, regional planning \n        commissions, regional planning organizations, and development \n        districts have the accountability and experience necessary to \n        develop and coordinate comprehensive regional plans that \n        encompass the needs of the Federal, State, and local \n        governments, the private sector, and all other parties with a \n        stake in providing for the security of their communities. \n        Regional councils of government can ensure the development of a \n        coordinated emergency recovery plan involving Federal, State, \n        and local governments and the private sector.\n            (6) Coordinated, area-wide training, equipment acquisition, \n        and recovery planning is essential for effective regional \n        preparedness and mitigation.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage and \nfacilitate the development and implementation of regional emergency and \ndisaster preparedness, response, and recovery coordination plans among \nFederal, State, and local governments and the private sector within the \nregion and to facilitate preparedness and mitigation efforts.\n\nSEC. 3.
