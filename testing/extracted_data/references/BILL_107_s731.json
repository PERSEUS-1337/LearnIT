FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) National defense is a core responsibility of the \n        Federal Government, which has the sole authority to raise and \n        maintain the military, and the Federal Government has a special \n        responsibility to ensure the voting rights of military members \n        and their families are adequately protected.\n            (2) Over 2,700,000 members of the military and their \n        families are stationed away from their home of record at any \n        given time.\n            (3) The disenfranchisement of military voters has been \n        acknowledged since 1952, when the Subcommittee on Elections of \n        the Committee on House Administration of the House of \n        Representatives conducted hearings on the likely \n        disenfranchisement of military personnel then fighting in the \n        Korean War, and President Truman recommended the enactment of \n        temporary legislation by Congress since it ``should be possible \n        to make all the necessary changes in State laws before the \n        congressional elections of 1954.''\n            (4) The controversy during the 2000 Federal election over \n        uncounted military absentee ballots has again shown that the \n        votes of many military members and their families have not been \n        counted because of confusing State and local procedures, \n        cumbersome ballot request and submission requirements, and \n        complicated procedures and ballots.\n            (5) Some States do not recognize the rights of military \n        voters and their families to vote in their domicile of origin, \n        further disenfranchising these voters and their families.\n            (6) Therefore, Federal legislation is needed to protect the \n        voting rights of military personnel who serve in defense of our \n        Nation.\n\nSEC. 3. GUARANTEE OF RESIDENCY FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL.\n\n    Article VII of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 \n(50 U.S.C. App. 590 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``Sec. 704. (a) For purposes of voting for any Federal office (as \ndefined in section 301 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \nU.S.C. 431)) or a State or local office, a person who is absent from a \nState in compliance with military or naval orders shall not, solely by \nreason of that absence--\n            ``(1) be deemed to have lost a residence or domicile in \n        that State, without regard to whether or not the person intends \n        to return to that State;\n            ``(2) be deemed to have acquired a residence or domicile in \n        any other State; or\n            ``(3) be deemed to have become a resident in or a resident \n        of any other State.\n    ``(b) In this section, the term `State' includes a territory or \npossession of the United States, a political subdivision of a State, \nterritory, or possession, and the District of Columbia.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
