    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Media Marketing Accountability Act \nof 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Children have easy access to a variety of media and \n        entertainment options without leaving their own homes. The vast \n        majority of homes with children have a VCR, a CD player, and \n        either a video game console or a personal computer.\n            (2) Children, and especially teenagers, spend a large \n        amount of time listening to music, seeing movies, and playing \n        video games. Specifically:\n                    (A) Children ages 8 through 13 spend approximately \n                3 hours per week in a movie theater, on average. In \n                addition, 62 percent of children ages 9 through 17 \n                spent an average of 52 minutes per day watching video \n                tapes.\n                    (B) 82 percent of children play video games, and do \n                so for 33 minutes per day, on average.\n                    (C) Children ages 14 through 18 listen to music \n                approximately 2\\1/2\\ hours per day on average.\n            (3) Teenagers spend tens of millions of dollars annually on \n        movies, music, and video games, making them a highly valuable \n        demographic group to the producers and distributors of \n        entertainment products.\n            (4) Media violence can be harmful to children. Most \n        scholarly studies on the impact of media violence find a high \n        correlation between exposure to violent content and aggressive \n        or violent behavior. Additional studies find a high correlation \n        between exposure to violent content and a desensitization to \n        and acceptance of violence in society.\n            (5) On September 11, 2000, the Federal Trade Commission \n        reported that companies in the music, movie, and video game \n        industries routinely target children under age 17 in the \n        advertisement of adult-rated products. Specifically:\n                    (A) The Commission found that 80 percent of the R-\n                rated movies studied had been targeted to children. In \n                addition, marketing plans for 64 percent of the R-rated \n                movies studied explicitly mentioned children under age \n                17 as part of the target audience.\n                    (B) The Commission found that all marketing plans \n                for music recordings with explicit content labels \n                either explicitly mentioned children under age 17 as \n                part of the target audience or called for ad placement \n                in media that would reach a majority or substantial \n                percentage of children under age 17.\n                    (C) The Commission found that 70 percent of Mature-\n                rated video games studied were targeted to children \n                under age 17, and 51 percent explicitly mentioned \n                children under age 17 as part of the target audience. \n                Additionally, the Commission found that 91 percent of \n                the video game manufacturers studied had at one time \n                expressly identified children under age 17 as the core, \n                primary, or secondary audience of an M-rated game.\n            (6) To correct this problem, the Commission called on these \n        industries to adopt voluntary, uniform policies expressly \n        prohibiting these practices and to enforce these policies with \n        real sanctions for violations.\n            (7) To date, as the Commission noted in a follow-up report \n        released on April 24, 2001, only the video game industry has \n        agreed to adopt such a marketing code. The Commission also \n        noted that, despite some encouraging changes in behavior since \n        the release of the Commission's original report in 2000, a \n        number of companies in all three industries have nevertheless \n        continued to market adult-rated products in venues popular with \n        children.\n            (8) Because the entertainment industry continues to target \n        its advertising of adult-rated products to children, there is \n        need for narrowly targeted legislation to prohibit, as a false \n        and deceptive trade practice, the targeting of children in the \n        advertisement and other marketing of products rated for adults, \n        and to authorize the Federal Trade Commission to stop these \n        practices.\n\n      TITLE I--TARGETED MARKETING OF ADULT-RATED MEDIA TO CHILDREN\n\nSEC. 101. PROHIBITION ON TARGETED MARKETING TO MINORS OF ADULT-RATED \n              MEDIA AS UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE PRACTICE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The targeted advertising or other marketing to \nminors of an adult-rated motion picture, music recording, or electronic \ngame, in or affecting commerce, shall be treated as a deceptive act or \npractice within the meaning of section 5 of the Federal Trade \nCommission Act (15 U.S.C. 45), and is hereby declared unlawful.\n    (b) Treatment as Targeted Advertising or Marketing to Minors.--For \npurposes of this section, the advertising or other marketing of an \nadult-rated motion picture, music recording, or electronic game shall \nbe treated as targeted advertising or other marketing of such product \nto minors if--\n            (1) the advertising or marketing--\n                    (A) is intentionally directed to minors; or\n                    (B) is presented to an audience of which a \n                substantial proportion is minors; or\n            (2) the Commission determines that the advertising or \n        marketing is otherwise directed or targeted to minors.\n\nSEC. 102. SAFE HARBOR.\n\n    (a) In General.--The advertising or other marketing to minors of an \nadult-rated motion picture, music recording, or electronic game shall \nnot be treated as targeted advertising or other marketing to minors, \nfor purposes of section 101, if the producer or distributor responsible \nfor the advertising or marketing adheres to a voluntary self-regulatory \nsystem with respect to such product that satisfies the criteria under \nsubsection (b) and is subject to the sanctions referred to in \nsubsection (b)(3).\n    (b) Criteria.--The Federal Trade Commission shall, by rule, \nestablish the criteria referred to in subsection (a). Under such \ncriteria, a voluntary self-regulatory system shall include the \nfollowing elements:\n            (1) An age-based rating or labeling system for the product \n        in question.\n            (2) For all products that are rated or labeled as adult-\n        rated under such system--\n                    (A) prohibitions on the targeted advertising or \n                other marketing to minors of such products; and\n                    (B) other policies to restrict, to the extent \n                feasible, the sale, rental, or viewing to or by minors \n                of such products.\n            (3) Procedures, including sanctions for non-complying \n        producers and distributors, meeting such requirements as the \n        Commission includes in such criteria in order to assure \n        compliance with the prohibitions and other policies referred to \n        in paragraph (2).\n\nSEC. 103. REGULATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Federal Trade Commission shall prescribe rules \nthat define with specificity the acts or practices that are deceptive \nacts or practices under section 101.\n    (b) In Particular.--The rules under subsection (a)--\n            (1) shall specify criteria for determining whether or not \n        an audience is comprised of a substantial proportion of minors \n        for purposes of section 101(b)(1)(B); and\n            (2) may include requirements for the purpose of preventing \n        acts or practices that are deceptive acts or practices under \n        section 101.\n\nSEC. 104.
