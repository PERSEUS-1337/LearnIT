FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) During the 2003-2004 school year, the Office of \n        Overseas Schools of the Department of State is financially \n        assisting 189 elementary and secondary schools in other \n        countries.\n            (2) These ``American-sponsored'' schools serve 99,318 \n        students, of whom 27,412 are United States citizens.\n            (3) Twenty of these American-sponsored schools--serving \n        10,907 students--are located in the Near East and South Asia \n        region, and other American-sponsored schools are located in \n        countries with significant Muslim populations in Africa, \n        Central Asia, and East Asia.\n            (4) American-sponsored schools provide an American-style \n        education in English, with curricula that typically include an \n        emphasis on the development of critical thinking and analytical \n        skills.\n            (5) In response to growing anti-American sentiment in Arab \n        and other predominantly Muslim countries, the United States has \n        placed a renewed emphasis on public diplomacy programs, with \n        education at the elementary, secondary, and university levels \n        representing an important part of that effort.\n            (6) Education is a key element of the efforts of the United \n        States to promote political, economic, and social reform in \n        Arab and predominantly Muslim countries, and is one of the main \n        components of the Middle East Partnership Initiative.\n            (7) As active, vibrant institutions, American-sponsored \n        schools play a vital role in their local communities, and help \n        advance public diplomacy interests of the United States.\n            (8) The Department of State currently provides funds to \n        American-sponsored schools amounting only, on average, to \n        between one and two percent of their annual operating expenses.\n            (9) The United States has an interest in increasing the \n        level of financial support provided to American-sponsored \n        schools in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries, in order \n        to--\n                    (A) increase the number of students in such \n                countries who attend such schools; and\n                    (B) increase the number of young people who may \n                thereby gain at any early age an appreciation for the \n                culture, society, and history of the United States.\n            (10) The United States has an interest in increasing the \n        number of students in Arab and predominately Muslim countries \n        who attend American-sponsored schools beyond those from \n        affluent families who are able to afford the cost of tuition, \n        to include children from lower- and middle-income families who \n        otherwise might not be able to afford to attend such schools.\n            (11) Many American-sponsored schools have the capacity to \n        increase the number of students who attend such schools.\n            (12) The Department of State has legal authority under the \n        Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n        2451 et seq.) (commonly referred to as the Fulbright-Hays Act) \n        to provide increased financial support for American-sponsored \n        schools.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that, based on the findings contained \nin section 2, additional funds should be made available to American-\nsponsored schools in Arab and predominately Muslim countries to provide \nfull or partial merit-based scholarships to children from lower- and \nmiddle-income families of such countries to attend such schools.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANTS TO AMERICAN-SPONSORED SCHOOLS IN ARAB AND OTHER \n              PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM COUNTRIES TO PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIPS TO \n              STUDENTS.\n\n    (a) Grants Authorized.--The Secretary of State, acting through the \nDirector of the Office of Overseas Schools of the Department of State, \nmay make grants to American-sponsored schools in Arab and predominantly \nMuslim countries for the purpose of providing full or partial merit-\nbased scholarships to students from lower- and middle-income families \nof such countries to attend such schools.\n    (b) Determination of Eligible Students.--For purposes of expending \ngrant funds, an American-sponsored school that receives a grant under \nsubsection (a) is authorized to establish criteria to be implemented by \nsuch school to determine what constitutes lower- and middle-income \nfamilies in the country (or region of the country, if regional \nvariations in income levels in the country are significant) in which \nsuch school is located.\n    (c) Restriction on Use of Funds.--Amounts appropriated to the \nSecretary of State pursuant to the authorization of appropriations in \nsubsection (c) shall be used for the sole purpose of making grants \nunder this section, and may not be used for the administration of the \nOffice of Overseas Schools of the Department of State or any other \nactivity of the Office.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated for each of fiscal years 2005 and 2006, $15,000,000 to \ncarry out subsection (a)."
