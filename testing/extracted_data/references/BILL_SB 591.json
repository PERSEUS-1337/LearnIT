    "title": "SB 591",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death and disease in California, claiming the lives of more than 40,000 people every year. California still has approximately 3.64 million adult smokers and 224,000 youth smokers.\n(b) The inevitable health care costs of smoking come to almost $10 for every pack of cigarettes sold in California.\n(c) Tobacco use costs Californians more than $13.29 billion in tobacco-related medical expenses every year. The cost of lost productivity due to tobacco use adds an additional estimated $10.35 billion to the annual economic consequences of smoking in California.\n(d) The treatment of cancer, heart disease and stroke, lung disease, diabetes, and other diseases related to tobacco use continues to impose a significant burden upon California\u2019s overstressed health care system, including publicly funded health care programs.\n(e) In 2015\u201316, it is estimated that the General Fund cost of publicly funded health care programs to the state will be more than $18 billion. In 2015\u201316, it is estimated that publicly funded health care programs will provide health care coverage to more than 12 million Californians. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of families and children go without any medical coverage due to financial constraints upon the state and local government budgets and recent cutbacks in publicly funded health care programs.\n(f) A recent cost-benefit analysis concluded that if states followed the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs 2007 funding guidelines, up to 14 to 20 times the cost of program implementation could be saved through reduced medical and productivity costs as well as reduced Medicaid costs.\n(g) The California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 will help fund the comprehensive California Tobacco Control Program designed to change social norms about tobacco and discourage individuals from taking up smoking and the use of other tobacco products through educational programs, thereby saving the state and local governments significant money now and in the future.\n(h) Tobacco tax increases are an appropriate way to mitigate the impacts of tobacco-related diseases and improve existing programs providing for quality and access to health care services for families and children.\n(i) An increase in the tobacco tax will have an immediate effect on smoking and is the most appropriate mechanism to fund services to prevent tobacco use, help people quit smoking, and discourage many people from taking up smoking.\n(j) California taxes cigarettes at only $0.87 per pack, and ranks 33rd in tobacco tax rates, reflecting one of the lowest tobacco taxes in the United States. Thirty states have cigarette tax rates of $1 per pack or higher, and California is well below other west coast states (Washington: $3.025, Oregon: $1.31, and Arizona: $2). California last raised its tobacco tax in 1998.\n(k) The burden of smoking is not equally shared across California populations and communities. Tobacco use rates are much higher than the general population in African Americans, white men, Korean men, enlisted military personnel, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, young adult, rural, and low-income populations.\n(l) A reinvigorated tobacco control program will allow targeted public health and research efforts to combat the tobacco industry\u2019s predatory marketing to ethnic groups, driving down smoking rates and ultimately reducing heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and cancer in these California communities, which together represent more than\nhalf\none-half\nof our state\u2019s residents.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 30104 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:\n30104.\nThe taxes imposed by this part shall not apply to the sale of cigarettes or tobacco products by a distributor to a common carrier engaged in interstate or foreign passenger service or to a person authorized to sell cigarettes or tobacco products on the facilities of the carrier. Whenever cigarettes or tobacco products are sold by distributors to common carriers engaged in interstate or foreign passenger service for use or sale on facilities of the carriers, or to persons authorized to sell cigarettes or tobacco products on those facilities, the tax imposed under this part shall not be levied with respect to the sales of the cigarettes or tobacco products by the distributors, but a tax is hereby levied upon the carriers or upon the persons authorized to sell cigarettes or tobacco products on the facilities of the carriers, as the case may be, for the privilege of making sales in California at the same rate as set forth under this part. Those common carriers and authorized persons shall pay the tax imposed by this section and file reports with the board, as provided in Section 30186.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 30108 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:\n30108.\n(a) Every distributor engaged in business in this state and selling or accepting orders for cigarettes or tobacco products with respect to the sale of which the tax imposed under this part is inapplicable shall, at the time of making the sale or accepting the order or, if the purchaser is not then obligated to pay the tax with respect to his or her distribution of the cigarettes or tobacco products, at the time the purchaser becomes so obligated, collect the tax from the purchaser, if the purchaser is other than a licensed distributor, and shall give to the purchaser a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the board.\n(b) Every person engaged in business in this state and making gifts of untaxed cigarettes or tobacco products as samples with respect to which the tax imposed under this part is inapplicable shall, at the time of making the gift or, if the donee is not then obligated to pay the tax with respect to his or her distribution of the cigarettes or tobacco products, at the time the donee becomes so obligated, collect the tax from the donee, if the donee is other than a licensed distributor, and shall give the donee a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the board.
