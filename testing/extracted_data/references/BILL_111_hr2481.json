FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress supports the following elements outlined in \n        the President's White Paper of the Interagency Policy Group's \n        Report on United States Policy Toward Afghanistan and Pakistan:\n                    (A) The core goal of the United States must be to \n                disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its \n                affiliated networks and their safe havens in Pakistan.\n                    (B) The threat that al Qaeda poses to the United \n                States and its allies in Pakistan--including the \n                possibility of extremists obtaining fissile material--\n                is all too real.\n                    (C) The United States must overcome its trust \n                deficit with Pakistan and demonstrate that it is a \n                reliable, long-term partner.\n            (2) The Government of Pakistan is facing significant \n        security and socio-economic challenges that set the conditions \n        for greater radicalization and may threaten Pakistan's \n        viability. Such challenges include the following:\n                    (A) Al Qaeda's and other extremist groups' campaign \n                of violent attacks throughout Pakistan, including the \n                Red Mosque incident, the assassination of Benazir \n                Bhutto, and the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in \n                Islamabad.\n                    (B) Pakistan's population growth at a rate of \n                approximately 2 percent a year, with nearly half of its \n                172 million residents illiterate, under the age of 20, \n                and living near or below the poverty line.\n            (3) Security and stability to Pakistan is further \n        complicated given the prevalence of ungoverned spaces between \n        Pakistan and Afghanistan in which state control has not been \n        fully exercised given ethnic and tribal affiliations.\n            (4) The security and stability of Pakistan is vital to the \n        national security of the United States, and the consequences of \n        failure poses a grave threat to the security of the American \n        people, the region, and United States allies.\n            (5) The objectives of United States policy toward Pakistan \n        are to empower and enable Pakistan to--\n                    (A) develop into a prosperous and democratic state \n                that is at peace with itself and with its neighbors;\n                    (B) actively confront, and deny safe haven to, al \n                Qaeda, the Taliban, and other extremists;\n                    (C) implement the economic, legal, and social \n                reforms required to create an environment that \n                discourages violent Islamic extremism; and\n                    (D) maintain robust command and control over its \n                nuclear weapons technology.\n\nSEC. 3.
