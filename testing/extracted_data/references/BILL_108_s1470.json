FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is substantial evidence that many Americans do \n        not have an adequate basis for making sound decisions about \n        personal and household finances;\n            (2) financial education could play a critical role in \n        equipping consumers with the knowledge to make wise decisions, \n        especially for lower income consumers and those underserved by \n        the mainstream financial system;\n            (3) an increased awareness of the availability of credit \n        scores and credit reports, the process of accessing them, their \n        significance in obtaining credit, and their effects on credit \n        terms, are of paramount importance to consumers;\n            (4) easily accessible and affordable resources which inform \n        and educate investors as to their rights and avenues of \n        recourse should be provided when an investor believes his or \n        her rights have been violated by unprofessional conduct of \n        market intermediaries;\n            (5) a basic understanding of the operation of the financial \n        services industry would help consumers and their families to \n        make more informed choices about how best to progress \n        economically, avoid harmful personal debt, avoid discriminatory \n        and predatory practices, invest wisely, develop financial \n        planning skills necessary for maximizing short- and long-term \n        financial well being, and better prepare for retirement;\n            (6) comprehensive financial education would help to provide \n        individuals with the necessary tools to create household \n        budgets, initiate savings plans, manage debt, and make \n        strategic investment decisions for education, retirement, home \n        ownership, or other savings goals; and\n            (7) improved financial decision making, not simply more \n        knowledge, should be the primary financial education goal.\n\nSEC. 3.
