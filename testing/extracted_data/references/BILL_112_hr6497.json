DISPOSAL OF PUBLIC LANDS IN MINING TOWNSITES, ESMERALDA AND NYE \n              COUNTIES, NEVADA.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Government owns real property in and around \n        historic mining townsites in the counties of Esmeralda and Nye \n        in the State of Nevada.\n            (2) While the real property is under the jurisdiction of \n        the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of \n        Land Management, some of the real property land has been \n        occupied for decades by persons who took possession by purchase \n        or other documented and putatively legal transactions, but \n        whose continued occupation of the real property constitutes a \n        ``trespass'' upon the title held by the Federal Government.\n            (3) As a result of the confused and conflicting ownership \n        claims, the real property is difficult to manage under multiple \n        use policies and creates a continuing source of friction and \n        unease between the Federal Government and local residents.\n            (4) Much of the real property is appropriate for disposal \n        for the purpose of promoting administrative efficiency and \n        effectiveness, and the Bureau of Land Management has already \n        identified certain parcels of the real property for disposal.\n            (5) Some of the real property contains historic and \n        cultural values that must be protected.\n            (6) To promote responsible resource management of the real \n        property, certain parcels should be conveyed to the county in \n        which the property is situated in accordance with land use \n        management plans of the Bureau of Land Management so that the \n        county can, among other things, dispose of the property to \n        persons residing on or otherwise occupying the property.\n    (b) Mining Townsite Defined.--In this section, the term ``mining \ntownsite'' means real property in the counties of Esmeralda and Nye, \nNevada, that is owned by the Federal Government, but upon which \nimprovements were constructed because of a mining operation on or near \nthe property and based upon the belief that--\n            (1) the property had been or would be acquired from the \n        Federal Government by the entity that operated the mine; or\n            (2) the person who made the improvement had a valid claim \n        for acquiring the property from the Federal Government.\n    (c) Conveyance Authority.--\n            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding sections 202 and 203 of \n        the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n        1712, 1713), the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \n        Bureau of Land Management, shall convey, without consideration, \n        all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to \n        mining townsites (including improvements thereon) identified \n        for conveyance on the maps entitled ``Original Mining Townsite \n        Gold Point, Nevada, Land Disposal Map'' and ``Original Mining \n        Townsite Ione, Nevada, Land Disposal Map'', dated ______.\n            (2) Availability of maps.--The maps referred to in \n        paragraph (1) shall be on file and available for public \n        inspection in the appropriate offices of the Secretary of the \n        Interior, including the office of the Bureau of Land Management \n        located in the State of Nevada.\n    (d) Recipients.--\n            (1) Original recipient.--Subject to paragraph (2), the \n        conveyance of a mining townsite under subsection (c) shall be \n        made to the county in which the mining townsite is situated.\n            (2) Reconveyance to occupants.--In the case of a mining \n        townsite conveyed under subsection (c) for which a valid \n        interest is proven by one or more persons, under the provisions \n        of Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 244, the county that \n        received the mining townsite under paragraph (1) shall reconvey \n        the property to that person or persons by appropriate deed or \n        other legal conveyance as provided in that State law. For \n        purposes of proving a valid interest, the person making the \n        claim must have occupied the mining townsite for at least 15 \n        years immediately before the date of the enactment of this Act. \n        The county is not required to recognize a claim under this \n        paragraph submitted more than 10 years after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act.\n    (e) Protection of Historic and Cultural Resources.--As a condition \non the conveyance or reconveyance of a mining townsite under subsection \n(c) or (d)(2), all historic and cultural resources (including \nimprovements) on the mining townsite shall be preserved and protected \nin accordance with applicable Federal and State law.\n    (f) Valid Existing Rights.--The conveyance of a mining townsite \nunder this section shall be subject to valid existing rights, including \nany easement or other right-of-way or lease in existence as of the date \nof the conveyance.
