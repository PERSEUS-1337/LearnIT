FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Founding Fathers of this Nation held the value and \n        virtue of work to be an integral part of the American spirit of \n        freedom and unity.\n            (2) Honest work of an individual's choice, whether paid or \n        unpaid, benefits both the individual and society as a whole.\n            (3) The betterment of communities through public service \n        should be encouraged by the Federal Government.\n            (4) After the first months of eligibility for unemployment \n        benefits, involvement by an individual in public service will \n        not infringe on such individual's readiness to work or their \n        ability to search for employment.\n\nSEC. 3.
