    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Iran and Hizballah Western \nHemisphere Prevention Act of 2017''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On June 26, 2017, Ali Issa Chamas, a dual Paraguayan-\n        Lebanese national reportedly with ties to Hizballah, was \n        indicted by a Miami Federal grand jury for drug trafficking \n        after being arrested in the Tri-Border Area of Argentina, \n        Paraguay, and Brazil for allegedly trying to smuggle cocaine to \n        the United States.\n            (2) On June 8, 2017, the Department of Justice announced \n        the arrest of Ali Kourani and Samer El Debek for attempting to \n        provide support to Hizballah, including in Panama, which \n        involved locating the United States and Israeli Embassies and \n        casing security procedures at the Panama Canal.\n            (3) In April 2017, Commander, United States Southern \n        Command, Admiral Kurt Tidd testified to Congress that ``as a \n        continuing state sponsor of terrorism, Iranian involvement in \n        the Western Hemisphere is always a matter of concern [and] with \n        the easing of economic sanctions, Iran may be seeking to \n        rebuild its relationships in the region''.\n            (4) In February 2017, the United States imposed sanctions \n        on Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami, designating him \n        as a drug kingpin for facilitating narcotics to the United \n        States. A subsequent CNN investigation linked El Aissami to \n        ``173 Venezuelan passports and IDs that were issued to \n        individuals from the Middle East, including people connected to \n        the terrorist group Hezbollah''.\n            (5) In September 2016, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani \n        conducted his first visit to Latin America, visiting Venezuela \n        and Cuba. In the same month, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad \n        Zarif also visited Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, \n        Nicaragua, and Venezuela.\n            (6) In February 2016, a Federal prosecutor in Argentina \n        alleged that Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman's death in \n        January 2015 was a homicide. Nisman had previously published \n        two reports documenting Iranian activities in several countries \n        in the region and filed a judicial complaint against former \n        Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner for \n        minimizing Iranian involvement in the 1994 terrorist attack \n        against the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) that \n        killed 85 people.\n            (7) In February 2016, the U.S. Drug Enforcement \n        Administration (DEA) announced the disruption of a Hizballah \n        network as part of DEA's ``Project Cassandra'', which affirmed \n        that members of Hizballah's External Security Organization \n        Business Affairs Component (BAC) had established business \n        relationships with South American drug cartels, such as La \n        Oficina de Envigado.\n            (8) According to the Department of State's 2015 Country \n        Report on Terrorism, Hezbollah maintains a presence in the \n        Western Hemisphere ``with members, facilitators, and supporters \n        engaging in activity in support of the organization'', which \n        includes ``efforts to build Hezbollah's infrastructure in South \n        America and fundraising, both through licit and illicit \n        means''.\n            (9) In 2015, former Commander, United States Southern \n        Command, General Kelly testified to Congress that ``our limited \n        intelligence capabilities make it difficult to fully assess the \n        amount of terrorist financing generated in Latin America, or \n        understand the scope of possible criminal-terrorist \n        collaboration''.\n            (10) In November 2014, Brazilian media published police \n        reports that revealed that Hizballah helped a Brazilian prison \n        gang, the First Capital Command (PCC), obtain weapons in \n        exchange for the protection of prisoners of Lebanese origin \n        tied to Hizballah. Those same reports also found that Lebanese \n        traffickers tied to Hizballah helped sell C4 explosives that \n        the PCC allegedly stole in Paraguay.\n            (11) In November 2014, Peruvian counterterrorism police \n        arrested Mohammed Amadar, a Lebanese citizen, who was \n        reportedly a Hizballah operative, after finding traces of \n        explosive materials and detonators at his home. His targets \n        reportedly included places associated with Israelis and Jews in \n        Peru, the Israeli embassy in Lima, and Jewish community \n        institutions.\n            (12) Hizballah is classified by the Department of State as \n        a Foreign Terrorist Organization, but multiple reports have \n        found that Hizballah has significant and expanding ties to \n        transnational organized crime, drug trafficking, and money-\n        laundering activities in the Western Hemisphere, including \n        partnerships with Mexico's Los Zetas, Colombia's Revolutionary \n        Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and Brazil's Primeriro Comando \n        de la Capital.\n            (13) As of June 2017, the United States has sanctioned 11 \n        individuals and four companies in the Tri-Border Area of \n        Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil for their involvement with \n        Hizballah's terror finance networks. However, multiple reports \n        show that despite United States measures, some of these \n        individuals who are Specially Designated Global Terrorists \n        (SDGTs) under Executive Order 13224 of September 2001 continue \n        to have access to the global financial system.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States to \ncontinue the policy outlined in the Hizballah International Financing \nPrevention Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-102) and the government-wide \nstrategy outlined in Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of \n2012 (Public Law 112-220) to prevent further penetration of Iran and \nHizballah into the Western Hemisphere and prioritize United States \ndiplomatic efforts to engage countries in the Western Hemisphere to \ndisrupt and degrade Hizballah's illicit networks operating in the \nregion.\n\nSEC. 4.
