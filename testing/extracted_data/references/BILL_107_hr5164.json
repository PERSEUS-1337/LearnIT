FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Robert T. Stafford Relief and Emergency Assistance \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 5170 et seq.) was established to provide aid and \n        coordinate Federal disaster relief in response to a major \n        disaster.\n            (2) The effect of the terrorist attack on September 11, \n        2001, on New York City, New York, was declared a major disaster \n        as defined by the Act.\n            (3) The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, brought \n        forth new challenges never dealt with before in a major \n        disaster.\n            (4) These new challenges and lack of comprehensive \n        authority to deal with them, as defined by current statute, \n        slowed down and complicated Federal disaster relief for the New \n        York and Washington Metropolitan Areas, and exposed weaknesses \n        in the authorities Federal agencies have to respond to a \n        homeland security event.\n            (5) Officials throughout the Administration and \n        intelligence community assert that another attack is inevitable \n        so it is imperative to establish new authority to address the \n        inadequacies in the existing system of response.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF MAJOR DISASTER.\n\n    Section 102(2) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122(2)) is amended by striking ``, \nor explosion'' and inserting ``, explosion, terrorist attack (including \na biological, nuclear, chemical, or small arms attack and a cyber-\nattack on computer systems), dispersion of radioactive or other \ncontaminants, dispersion of hazardous substances, or other catastrophic \nevent'';\n\nSEC. 4.
