FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Flight delays and cancellations hit all time highs at \n        major airports nationwide during the summer of 2007, when--\n                    (A) 20 percent more passengers were affected by \n                flight delays than were affected during the previous \n                summer;\n                    (B) nearly 621,000 flights were delayed, an \n                increase of 15 percent compared with approximately \n                539,000 delayed flights in the summer of 2006;\n                    (C) such delays lasted an average of 60 minutes, a \n                7 percent increase from the average length of flight \n                delays in the previous summer;\n                    (D) flight cancellations increased to 48,000, from \n                37,000 in the summer of 2006, affecting nearly \n                3,200,000 passengers; and\n                    (E) on board tarmac delays lasting at least 1 hour \n                increased by 25 percent compared with the summer of \n                2006, affecting over 2,000,000 passengers.\n            (2) The Inspector General of the Department of \n        Transportation--\n                    (A) identified the New York area as 1 of 3 \n                saturation points across the country that impacted \n                delays nationwide;\n                    (B) reported that the biggest airspace bottlenecks \n                during the summer of 2007 were at the 3 major New York \n                area airports and the surrounding airspace, accounting \n                for more than \\1/3\\ of the flight delays nationwide; \n                and\n                    (C) after analyzing the likelihood of having more \n                or less delays at 5 of the busiest airports based on \n                current traffic and existing systems, determined that \n                the significant increase in the peak travel schedule at \n                LaGuardia Airport in the summer 2008 has the potential \n                to worsen delay conditions.\n            (3) The 3 airports in the New York area, Kennedy Airport \n        (JFK), LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Liberty Airport--\n                    (A) are the 3 worst airports across the country in \n                terms of on-time arrivals, with only 59 percent of \n                flights arriving on time at JFK and LaGuardia;\n                    (B) are anticipated to experience massive delays in \n                the summer of 2008; and\n                    (C) have a ripple effect on the national airspace \n                system.\n            (4) Between October 2006 and July 2007 at JFK, average \n        daily operations increased by 23 percent and arrival delays of \n        more than 1 hour increased by 114 percent, to more than 2,300.\n            (5) The Federal Aviation Administration estimates that the \n        number of passengers on commercial aircraft will increase by 36 \n        percent between 2007 and 2015, to a total of 1,000,000,000 \n        passenger trips.\n            (6) Next generation air traffic control technology has the \n        ability to significantly improve congestion problems, but the \n        Federal Aviation Administration has repeatedly delayed its \n        implementation, currently estimated to take place in 2025, 11 \n        years later than originally predicted.\n            (7) In addition to technology improvements, proven tools \n        are available to reduce airspace congestion and address the \n        massive delays.\n            (8) During the Thanksgiving holidays in 2007, military \n        airspace off the East Coast was opened for commercial use, \n        significantly reducing holiday delays and congestion by \n        creating an additional lane for traffic.\n            (9) Empowering a director to oversee and coordinate \n        operations in congested airspace has effectively reduced delays \n        in South Florida, where some air carriers improved arrival \n        performance by 44 percent and reduced delays lasting more than \n        90 minutes by 69 percent.\n\nSEC. 3. PLAN FOR SHARING MILITARY AND SPECIAL USE AIRSPACE.\n\n    The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of \nDefense, shall develop--\n            (1) a plan to open up special use airspace for additional \n        lanes of air traffic at specific choke points during the summer \n        of 2008; and\n            (2) a permanent plan to share the military airspace off the \n        eastern coast of the United States, which--\n                    (A) creates a corridor for commercial flights \n                seeking to avoid inclement weather or excessive air \n                traffic; and\n                    (B) provides for immediate reclamation of such \n                airspace by the Department of Defense in the event of a \n                national emergency.\n\nSEC. 4. NEW YORK INTEGRATION OFFICE.\n\n    (a) Budget Authority.--The Director of the New York Integration \nOffice of the Federal Aviation Administration is authorized to transfer \nany amounts appropriated for the operations of such office to any \nfunction that the Director determines to be necessary to carry out any \nflight delay reduction project involving the airspace in the New York-\nNew Jersey region.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Federal Aviation Administration such sums as may be \nnecessary to carry out the responsibilities of the New York Integration \nOffice, including hiring necessary support staff.\n\nSEC. 5. AVIATION TRAVELER TASK FORCE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) While aircraft safety should be a top priority for the \n        Federal Aviation Administration and air carriers, compliance \n        with Federal safety regulations should not come at the expense \n        of passenger convenience.\n            (2) One of the chief complaints of customers left stranded \n        during April 2008 by massive cancellations was the lack of \n        notification about the status of their flights.\n            (3) Commercial air flight cancellations were announced with \n        little advance notice, causing many travelers to discover that \n        their flight was cancelled after they arrived at the airport.\n            (4) Air carriers have also reduced the number of flights on \n        their schedules, which has frustrated consumers' attempts to \n        find replacement flights on other air carriers.\n    (b) Establishment.--The Administrator of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration shall establish an Aviation Traveler Task Force, \ncomprised of Federal Aviation Administration employees and \nrepresentatives of the commercial aviation industry.\n    (c) Functions.--The Aviation Traveler Task Force shall--\n            (1) clarify interpretations of safety directives issued by \n        the Federal Aviation Administration with which air carriers \n        will soon need to comply;\n            (2) develop contingency plans in the event that additional \n        aircraft--\n                    (A) are found to be out of compliance with such \n                safety directives; and\n                    (B) need to be grounded;\n            (3) generate ideas for the best way to notify passengers on \n        a massive scale that their flights have been cancelled; and\n            (4) design a notification system to alert passengers of \n        potential service disruptions.\n    (d) Inspection Plans.--The Administrator of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration shall ensure that any standardized plan to perform \ninspections of commercial aircraft includes a plan to reduce groundings \nand other consequences resulting from such inspections."
