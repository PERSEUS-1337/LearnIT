    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Training and Knowledge Ensure \nChildren a Risk-Free Environment (TAKE CARE) Act ''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a \n        crucial and essential role in the Nation's child welfare system \n        and in ensuring safety, stability, and permanence for abused \n        and neglected children under the supervision of that system.\n            (2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law \n        105-89; 111 Stat. 2115) establishes explicitly for the first \n        time in Federal law that a child's health and safety must be \n        the paramount consideration when any decision is made regarding \n        a child in the Nation's child welfare system.\n            (3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes \n        stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by \n        requiring timely decision-making in proceedings to determine \n        whether children can safely return to their families or whether \n        they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive homes or \n        other permanent family arrangements outside the foster care \n        system.\n            (4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster \n        care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 \n        specifically requires, among other things, that States move to \n        terminate the parental rights of the parents of those children \n        who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months.\n            (5) While essential to protect children and to carry out \n        the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of \n        1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of parental \n        rights and the other requirements imposed under that Act \n        increase the pressure on the Nation's already overburdened \n        abuse and neglect courts.\n            (6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n        Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be substantially \n        improved by the acquisition and implementation of computerized \n        case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate existing \n        backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads forward in a \n        timely manner, and to move children into safe and stable \n        families. Such systems could also be used to evaluate the \n        effectiveness of such courts in meeting the purposes of the \n        amendments made by, and provisions of, the Adoption and Safe \n        Families Act of 1997.\n            (7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n        Nation's abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by the \n        identification and implementation of projects designed to \n        eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including the \n        temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court \n        hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing \n        caseloads.\n            (8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n        Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be further strengthened \n        by improving the quality and availability of training for \n        judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, guardians ad litem, \n        volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate \n        (CASA) programs, and attorneys who represent the children and \n        the parents of children in abuse and neglect proceedings.\n            (9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this \n        country are already committed to the quality administration of \n        justice, the performance of such courts would be even further \n        enhanced by the development of models and educational \n        opportunities that reinforce court projects that have already \n        been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, case \n        management, representation of children, automated interagency \n        interfaces, and ``best practices'' standards.\n            (10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial \n        officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that \n        proceedings in our Nation's abuse and neglect courts are run \n        efficiently and effectively. The performance of those \n        individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by \n        training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange \n        ideas with their peers.\n            (11) Volunteers who participate in court-appointed special \n        advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and ears \n        of abuse and neglect courts in proceedings conducted by, or \n        under the supervision of, such courts and also bring increased \n        public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court system. The \n        Nation's abuse and neglect courts would benefit from an \n        expansion of this program to currently underserved communities.\n            (12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, \n        comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, \n        model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with \n        respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the \n        purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by \n        reducing the average length of an abused and neglected child's \n        stay in foster care, improving the quality of decision-making \n        and court services provided to children and families, and \n        increasing the number of adoptions.\n\nSEC. 3.
