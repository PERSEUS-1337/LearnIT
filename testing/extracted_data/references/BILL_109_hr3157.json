FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Products produced in a foreign country can be produced \n        or assembled with lower input costs through the intervention by \n        the government of that country in international currency \n        markets, in order to maintain its own currency at artificially \n        low valuations.\n            (2) This practice, in effect, subsidizes the exports of \n        such a country while erecting a cost barrier to goods imported \n        into that country.\n            (3) The United States has the authority under current law \n        to redress practices by other countries that decrease market \n        opportunities for United States exports or otherwise distort \n        trade, including currency manipulation.\n            (4) Misalignments in currency caused by government policies \n        intended to maintain an unfair trade advantage nullify and \n        impair trade concessions.\n            (5) A country is considered to be manipulating its currency \n        to obtain an unfair trade advantage if--\n                    (A) its currency manipulation has a subsidy-like \n                effect;\n                    (B) its currency manipulation constitutes a \n                nullification and impairment of the benefits of the \n                GATT 1994; or\n                    (C) its currency manipulation results in a \n                contravention of the intention of the GATT 1994.\n            (6) The International Monetary Fund also prohibits the use \n        of currency manipulation as a method of gaining unfair trade \n        advantage. The International Monetary Fund defines such \n        manipulation as large-scale and protracted intervention in one \n        direction to gain an unfair trade advantage.\n            (7) Article XV of the GATT 1994 and the Agreement on \n        Subsidies and Countervailing Measures both suggest that \n        currency manipulation in order to gain an unfair trading \n        advantage would violate the intent of those agreements.\n            (8) Sections 301 through 309 of the Trade Act of 1974 \n        provide the authority under United States law to take \n        retaliatory action, including import restrictions, to enforce \n        the rights of the United States against any unjustifiable, \n        unreasonable, or discriminatory practice or policy of a country \n        that burdens or restricts United States commerce.\n            (9) Section 3004 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness \n        Act of 1988 (22 U.S.C. 5304) requires the Secretary of the \n        Treasury to undertake multilateral or bilateral negotiations if \n        it is found that a country is manipulating its currency, and \n        Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the International \n        Monetary Fund prohibits currency manipulation.\n\nSEC. 3. TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVE.\n\n    Section 2102(b) of the Trade Act of 2002 (19 U.S.C. 3802(b)) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(18) Exchange rate policy.--The principal negotiating \n        objective of the United States with respect to currency \n        exchange rates is to ensure that governmental intervention in \n        currency markets to stabilize short-term disruptive market \n        conditions is of limited duration and is carried out in \n        consultation with countries with major trading partners.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORT ON CURRENCY MANIPULATION.\n\n    The Secretary of Commerce shall, not later than 6 months after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, and not later than the end of each \n6-month period thereafter, submit to the Congress, the President, the \nUnited States Trade Representative, and the Secretary of the Treasury, \na report--\n            (1) describing actions by foreign governments to manipulate \n        the currencies of their countries in order to increase exports \n        from those countries to the United States or to limit imports \n        of United States products into those countries, and describing \n        the extent of such currency manipulation;\n            (2) analyzing whether, and to what extent--\n                    (A) currency manipulation described under paragraph \n                (1) affects the manufacturing sector in the United \n                States; and\n                    (B) reduction of the manipulation and of the \n                accumulation of United States dollars by foreign \n                governments might affect United States monetary policy; \n                and\n            (3) setting forth all remedies against such currency \n        manipulation that are available under applicable trade \n        agreements and international institutions such as the World \n        Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nSEC. 5. PROCEEDINGS.\n\n    (a) Action by the President.--In any case in which the Secretary of \nCommerce, in a report under section 3, identities a government of a \nforeign country that is manipulating the currency of that country, the \nPresident, within 45 days after the report is issued, shall initiate \nnegotiations with that country for the purpose of ending the currency \nmanipulation. If the President, within 90 days after the report under \nsection 3 is issued, is unable to reach an agreement with that country \nto end the currency manipulation, the President shall take the \nnecessary steps to initiate proceedings under the applicable trade \nagreements or under the auspices of the World Trade Organization or \nother applicable international institutions, and under applicable \nUnited States law, including section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, \nagainst that country on account of that currency manipulation.\n    (b) Compensation.--\n            (1) In general.--In the course of, or in addition to, \n        action taken under subsection (a) with respect to a country, \n        the President shall seek compensation from that country \n        equivalent to the damages incurred by United States \n        manufacturers and other adversely affected parties in the \n        United States on account of the currency manipulation of that \n        country. The President is not required to seek such \n        compensation if he determines that to do so would not be in the \n        national interests of the United States.\n            (2) Report if compensation not sought.--In any case in \n        which the President does not seek compensation under paragraph \n        (1), the President shall transmit to the Committee on Energy \n        and Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House \n        of Representatives, and to the Committee on Commerce, Science \n        and Transportation and the Committee on Finance of the Senate, \n        a detailed explanation of the President's determination of \n        national interest.\n\nSEC. 6.
