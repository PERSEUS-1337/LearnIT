FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is estimated that--\n                    (A) approximately 2 percent of adults and about 5 \n                percent of infants and young children in the United \n                States suffer from food allergies; and\n                    (B) each year, roughly 30,000 individuals require \n                emergency room treatment and 150 individuals die \n                because of allergic reactions to food;\n            (2)(A) Eight major foods or food groups--milk, eggs, fish, \n        Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans--\n        account for 90 percent of food allergies;\n            (B) at present, there is no cure for food allergies; and\n            (C) a food allergic consumer must avoid the food to which \n        the consumer is allergic;\n            (3)(A) in a review of randomly selected manufacturers of \n        baked goods, ice cream, and candy in Minnesota and Wisconsin in \n        1999, the Food and Drug Administration found that 25 percent of \n        sampled foods failed to list peanuts or eggs as ingredients on \n        the food labels; and\n            (B) nationally, the number of recalls because of unlabeled \n        allergens rose to 121 in 2000 from about 35 a decade earlier;\n            (4) a recent study shows that many parents of children with \n        a food allergy were unable correctly to identify in each of \n        several food labels the ingredients derived from major food \n        allergens;\n            (5)(A) ingredients in foods must be listed by their \n        ``common or usual name'';\n            (B) in some cases, the common or usual name of an \n        ingredient may be unfamiliar to consumers, and many consumers \n        may not realize the ingredient is derived from, or contains, a \n        major food allergen; and\n            (C) spices, flavorings, and certain colorings and \n        incidental additives are exempt from ingredient labeling \n        requirements that would allow consumers to avoid those to which \n        they are allergic; and\n            (6)(A) celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease that \n        causes damage to the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous \n        system, and other organs;\n            (B) the current recommended treatment is avoidance of \n        glutens in foods that are associated with celiac disease; and\n            (C) a multicenter, multiyear study estimated that the \n        prevalence of celiac disease in the United States is 0.5 to 1 \n        percent of the general population.\n\nSEC. 3. FOOD LABELING; REQUIREMENT OF INFORMATION REGARDING ALLERGENIC \n              SUBSTANCES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(t)(1) If it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it \nintentionally bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either--\n            ``(A) `Contains', which statement is followed by the name \n        of the food source as described in section 201(ll)(1) from \n        which the major food allergen is derived, follows immediately \n        after or is adjacent to (in a type size no smaller than the \n        type size used in the list of ingredients) the list of \n        ingredients required under subsections (g) and (i); or\n            ``(B) the common or usual name of the major food allergen \n        in the list of ingredients required under sections (g) and (i) \n        is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source as \n        described in section 201(ll)(1) from which the major food \n        allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is \n        not required when--\n                    ``(i) the common or usual name of the ingredient \n                uses the term used to describe a major food allergen in \n                section 201(ll)(1), or\n                    ``(ii) the name of the food source as described in \n                section 201(ll)(1) appears elsewhere in the ingredient \n                list; and\n        Provided all major food allergens are labeled in a consistent \n        manner either as specified in clause (A) or as specified in \n        clause (B).\n    ``(2) The information required under this subsection may appear in \nlabeling in lieu of appearing on the label only if the Secretary finds \nthat such other labeling is sufficient to protect the public health. A \nfinding by the Secretary under this subparagraph is effective upon \npublication in the Federal Register as a notice (including any change \nin an earlier finding under this subparagraph).\n    ``(3) Notwithstanding subsection (g), (i), or (k), or any other \nlaw, a spice, flavoring, coloring, or incidental additive that is, or \nthat intentionally bears or contains, a major food allergen shall be \nsubject to the labeling requirements of this subsection.\n    ``(4) The Secretary may by regulation modify the requirements of \nsubparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), or eliminate either the \nrequirement of subparagraph (A) or the requirement of subparagraph (B), \nif the Secretary determines that the modification or elimination of the \nrequirement is necessary to protect the public health.\n    ``(u) Notwithstanding subsection (g), (i), or (k), or any other \nlaw, a spice, flavoring, coloring, or incidental additive that is, or \nthat intentionally bears or contains, a food allergen (other than a \nmajor food allergen), as determined by the Secretary by regulation, \nshall be disclosed in a manner specified by the Secretary by \nregulation.''.\n    (b) Effect on Other Authority.--This section does not alter the \nauthority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) to require \nthe labeling of other food allergens.\n    (c) Conforming Amendments.--\n            (1) Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n        (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(ll) The term `major food allergen' means any of the following:\n            ``(1) Milk, egg, fish (e.g. bass, flounder, or tuna), \n        Crustacean shellfish (e.g. crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts \n        (e.g. almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and \n        soybeans.\n            ``(2) A proteinaceous substance derived from a food \n        specified in paragraph (1) (unless the Secretary determines \n        that the substance does not cause an allergic response that \n        poses a risk to human health).''.\n            (2) Section 403A(a)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n        Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343-1(a)(2)) is amended by striking \n        ``or 403(i)(2)'' and inserting ``403(i)(2), 403(t), or \n        403(u)''.\n    (d) Effective Date.--A food that is labeled on or after January 1, \n2006, and that is, or that intentionally bears or contains, a major \nfood allergen (as defined in the amendment made by subsection (c)) \nshall be labeled in compliance with the requirements of the amendment \nmade by subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4.
