FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Advancements in communications and information \n        technology and the widespread use of that technology have \n        enhanced the volume and value of domestic and international \n        communication of electronic information as well as the ability \n        to preserve the confidentiality, protect the privacy, and \n        authenticate the origin, of that information.\n            (2) The proliferation of communications and information \n        technology has made it increasingly difficult for the \n        government to obtain and decipher, in a timely manner and as \n        provided by law, electronic information that is necessary to \n        provide for public safety and national security.\n            (3) The development of the Nation's information \n        infrastructure and the realization of the full benefits of that \n        infrastructure require that electronic information resident in, \n        or communicated over, that infrastructure is secure, \n        confidential, and authentic.\n            (4) Security, privacy, and authentication of electronic \n        information resident in, or communicated over, the Nation's \n        information infrastructure are enhanced with the use of \n        encryption technology.\n            (5) The rights of individuals and other persons to \n        security, privacy, and protection in their communications and \n        in the dissemination and receipt of electronic information \n        should be preserved and protected.\n            (6) The authority and ability of the government to obtain \n        and decipher, in a timely manner and as provided by law, \n        electronic information necessary to provide for public safety \n        and national security should also be preserved.\n            (7) There is a national need to develop, adopt, and use \n        encryption methods and procedures that advance the development \n        of the Nation's information infrastructure and that preserve \n        the personal rights referred to in paragraph (5) and the \n        governmental authority and ability referred to in paragraph \n        (6), as provided by law.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to promote the development of the Nation's information \n        infrastructure consistent with public welfare and safety, \n        national security, and the privacy and protection of personal \n        property;\n            (2) to encourage and facilitate the development, adoption, \n        and use of encryption standards and procedures that provide \n        sufficient privacy, protection, and authentication of \n        electronic information and that reasonably satisfy the needs of \n        government to provide for public safety and national security; \n        and\n            (3) to establish Federal policy governing the development, \n        adoption, and use of encryption standards and procedures and a \n        Federal program to carry out that policy.\n\nSEC. 3. ENCRYPTION STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES.\n\n    (a) Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board.--\n            (1) Requirement of privacy expertise.--Section 21(a)(2) of \n        the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 \n        U.S.C. 278g-4(a)(2)) is amended by inserting ``(including \n        computer systems privacy)'' after ``related disciplines''.\n            (2) Expanded functions.--Section 21(b) of such Act (15 \n        U.S.C. 278g-4(b)) is amended--\n                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph \n                (2);\n                    (B) by striking the period at the end of paragraph \n                (3) and inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (C) by adding after paragraph (3) the following new \n                paragraph:\n            ``(4) to advise the Institute and the Congress on privacy \n        issues pertaining to electronic information and on encryption \n        standards developed under section 31(b).''.\n    (b) Standards and Procedures.--The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology Act is further amended--\n            (1) by redesignating section 31 as section 32; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 30 the following new section \n        31:\n\n``SEC. 31.
