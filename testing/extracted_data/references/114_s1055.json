DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of General Services.\n            (2) Baseline.--The term ``baseline'' means the highest \n        annual rate of energy use for a building during the period \n        beginning on January 1, 2012, and ending on December 31 of the \n        calendar year preceding the calendar year during which the deep \n        energy retrofit of the building commenced.\n            (3) Deep energy retrofit.--The term ``deep energy \n        retrofit'' means a project carried out in a Federal building \n        that results in energy savings in that building of at least 35 \n        percent, and preferably at least 50 percent, relative to the \n        baseline.\n            (4) Energy savings.--\n                    (A) In general.--The term ``energy savings'' means \n                the quantity of energy calculated on an annual basis \n                and equal to the difference between--\n                            (i) the quantity of energy used in a \n                        Federal building after a deep energy retrofit; \n                        and\n                            (ii) the baseline for the building.\n                    (B) Calculation.--For purposes of calculating \n                energy savings under subparagraph (A)--\n                            (i) calculations shall be made for \n                        electricity separately than other fuels;\n                            (ii) conversions from electricity to \n                        British thermal units may be permitted; and\n                            (iii) the baseline and deep retrofit \n                        building consumption data shall be adjusted for \n                        any differences in weather, occupancy, and \n                        other important usage indicators.\n            (5) Federal building.--The term ``Federal building'' means \n        a building owned by a Federal agency.\n            (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n\nSEC. 2. DEEP ENERGY RETROFIT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Planning.--\n            (1) Development.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Administrator and the Secretary \n        shall develop a plan for meeting the 2020 goals described in \n        subsection (b).\n            (2) Agency plans.--\n                    (A) In general.--Not later than July 1, 2018, the \n                head of each Federal agency that owns a Federal \n                building shall submit to the Secretary and the \n                Administrator a plan for deep energy retrofits of at \n                least 50 percent of the Federal buildings of the \n                agency.\n                    (B) Technical assistance.--The Secretary, acting \n                through the Federal Energy Management Program and in \n                cooperation with the Administrator, shall provide \n                technical assistance to each Federal agency to carry \n                out subparagraph (A).\n    (b) 2020 Goal.--\n            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), not \n        later than January 1, 2020, and after consideration of the \n        plans submitted under subsection (a)(1)--\n                    (A) the Administrator shall carry out not fewer \n                than 100 deep energy retrofits; and\n                    (B) the Secretary, acting through the Federal \n                Energy Management Program, shall work with Federal \n                agencies (other than the General Services \n                Administration) to carry out not fewer than 50 deep \n                energy retrofits.\n            (2) Minimum energy savings.--In carrying out paragraph (1), \n        the Administrator and the Secretary shall ensure that at least \n        \\1/3\\ of the total number of energy retrofits achieve energy \n        savings of at least 50 percent.\n            (3) Cost control.--The Secretary and the Administrator may \n        select for deep energy retrofit Federal buildings that--\n                    (A) are scheduled for renovation; or\n                    (B) require replacement of major systems.\n    (c) 2030 Goal.--\n            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), during \n        the 10-year period beginning on January 1, 2020, the \n        Administrator and the Secretary shall carry out deep energy \n        retrofits in not less than 50 percent of the total square \n        footage of Federal buildings remaining for deep energy \n        retrofits after the retrofits carried out under subsection (b) \n        are completed.\n            (2) Minimum energy savings.--In carrying out paragraph (1), \n        the Administrator and the Secretary shall ensure that at least \n        \\1/3\\ of the total number of energy retrofits achieve energy \n        savings of at least 50 percent.\n            (3) Timing.--Of the 50 percent of the total square footage \n        required for deep energy retrofits under paragraph (1), \n        approximately 5 percent shall be completed during each year of \n        the 10-year period described in that paragraph.\n    (d) 2040 Goal.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall set goals for deep \n        energy retrofits during the 10-year period beginning on January \n        1, 2030, after considering the results of the deep energy \n        retrofits carried out under subsections (b) and (c).\n            (2) Waivers and exceptions.--In setting goals under \n        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall allow waivers and exceptions \n        for--\n                    (A) historic structures;\n                    (B) buildings with high energy use for security \n                purposes; and\n                    (C) such other special circumstances as the \n                Secretary may determine.\n    (e) Adjustment.--The Secretary may adjust the number of deep energy \nretrofits required under this section based on the most recent data \nrelating to technical feasibility and economic justification, as \ndetermined by the Secretary taking into account the need to achieve \npositive cashflow over the full life of measures using discount rates \ndesignated by the Office of Management and Budget."
