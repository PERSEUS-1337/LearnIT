FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the National Conference of Commissioners \n        on Uniform State Laws, research has demonstrated that video \n        recording of custodial interrogations furthers three important \n        civic values: truth-finding, efficient and fair administration \n        of justice, and protection of constitutional guarantees. See \n        Richard A. Leo, Police Interrogation and American Justice 296-\n        305 (2008); Thomas P. Sullivan, Recording Federal Custodial \n        Interviews, 45 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1297 (2008).\n            (2) Video recording of the entire process of custodial \n        interrogation has proven to be a major advance in law \n        enforcement, improving the ability to solve crimes and prove \n        cases while lowering the overall costs of investigation and \n        litigation.\n            (3) Video recording of custodial interrogations promotes \n        truth-finding in several ways, including by reducing the \n        incentive to fabricate, compensating for faulty or unreliable \n        recollections of witnesses, deterring problematic interrogation \n        methods, filtering out weak cases, and enhancing the ability of \n        finders of fact to assess witness credibility and veracity.\n            (4) Video recording of custodial interrogations promotes \n        efficiency in the administration of the criminal justice system \n        by reducing the number of frivolous suppression motions, \n        improving the quality of police investigations, improving the \n        quality of review and case screening by prosecutors, and \n        reducing the likelihood of hung juries.\n            (5) Video recording of custodial interrogations safeguards \n        constitutional rights and values by making it easier for courts \n        to adjudicate motions to suppress, by making it easier for \n        prosecutors to preserve and disclose material exculpatory \n        evidence required under the Supreme Court decision in Brady v. \n        Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), by making it easier for superiors \n        to train police officers in how to comply with constitutional \n        mandates and for the press, and by making it easier for the \n        press, the judiciary, prosecutors, independent watchdog groups, \n        and police administrators to identify and correct misuses of \n        power by law enforcement.\n            (6) Video recordings of custodial interrogations make it \n        easier to identify and avoid biases, which would otherwise be \n        difficult to detect and correct because such biases are often \n        unconscious, thus operating outside police awareness.\n            (7) Video recordings of custodial interrogations help to \n        improve public confidence in the fairness and professionalism \n        of policing, which in a democracy not only is a good in itself \n        but also a proven means of reducing crime and enhancing citizen \n        cooperation in solving crimes.\n            (8) Video recording of the entire process of custodial \n        interrogation is likely to be a major boon to law enforcement, \n        improving its ability to prove its cases while lowering overall \n        costs of investigation and litigation. Such recording will \n        also, however, improve systemic accuracy, fairness to the \n        accused and the State alike, protection of constitutional \n        rights, and public confidence in the justice system.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT.\n\n    Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 \n(42 U.S.C. 3711) is amended--\n            (1) in section 1001(a), by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(27) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out \n        part LL such sums as may be necessary for each of the first 5 \n        fiscal years beginning after the date of the enactment of such \n        part.''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n\n       ``PART LL--CUSTODIAL INTERROGATION VIDEO RECORDING GRANTS\n\n``SEC. 3021. CUSTODIAL INTERROGATION VIDEO RECORDING GRANTS.\n\n    ``(a) Grant Program.--The Attorney General shall make grants to \nStates and units of local government to take whatever steps the \nAttorney General determines to be necessary to achieve the complete and \naccurate recording, by both audio and video means, of every custodial \ninterrogation occurring within the State or unit of local government.\n    ``(b) Matching Requirement.--The portion of the costs of a program \nfunded by a grant under this section may not exceed 75 percent.\n    ``(c) Definition of Custodial Interrogation.--In this section, the \nterm `custodial interrogation' means questioning or other conduct by a \nlaw enforcement officer which is reasonably likely to elicit an \nincriminating response from an individual and occurs when reasonable \nindividuals in the same circumstances would consider themselves in \ncustody.''."
