FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 1998, Congress adopted the Nazi War Crimes \n        Disclosure Act (Public Law 105-246) requiring the executive \n        branch to identify any still-classified records in its custody \n        relating to Nazi war crimes, war criminals, persecution, and \n        looted assets and to declassify and release such records to the \n        American public. Under that Act, the President established the \n        Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group (in this \n        section referred to as the ``Interagency Group'') to carry out \n        the functions required by that Act.\n            (2) In its first year, the Interagency Group screened more \n        than 600,000,000 pages of material relating to Nazi war crimes \n        and has declassified 1,500,000 pages of such material and \n        opened them to the public at the National Archives.\n            (3) While the Interagency Group has worked diligently to \n        screen materials and declassify millions of pages of material, \n        the limited staff and funding available to the Interagency \n        Group threaten its ability to complete the functions required \n        by the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act.\n            (4) Already, significant new information about the \n        Holocaust has been revealed in the more than 400,000 records of \n        the Office of Strategic Services that were released by the \n        Interagency Group at the National Archives on June 26, 2000. \n        However, further such revelations depend on the availability of \n        adequate staff support and funding for the Interagency Group.\n            (5) The remarkable progress made by the Interagency Group \n        has been achieved even though Congress has not appropriated \n        funds for the support of the Interagency Group or for the \n        activities carried out by the various Federal agencies which \n        hold records subject to its functions. Without the resources to \n        review the materials being released, it will be years before \n        the significance of the contents of such materials will be \n        understood.\n            (6) The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act charged the \n        Interagency Group with reviewing all records that pertain to \n        World War II, under the direction of, or in association with \n        the Nazi government of Germany, any government occupied by the \n        military of the Nazi government, and any government that was an \n        ally of the Nazi government, which includes the Japanese \n        Imperial Government.\n            (7) After the end of World War II, the United States \n        returned more than 18,000,000 pages of captured Japanese \n        records to the Japanese Government at its request.\n            (8) In order to complete the Congressional directives of \n        the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, the Interagency Group \n        should review the materials that were returned to Japan. \n        Therefore, the full cooperation of the Japanese Government in \n        granting access to the Interagency Group and assisting in the \n        review of all World War II records is desired to insure that \n        these historic records can be reviewed, released, or otherwise \n        made available to the public in a timely and efficient manner.\n            (9) The Interagency Group has been working diligently to \n        fulfill its charge under the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, \n        but the original three-year authorization of the Interagency \n        Group under that Act does not allow for the completion of the \n        momentous tasks outlined in that Act, specifically the \n        completion of the review of the records pertaining to the \n        Japanese Government.\n\nSEC. 3.

The exemption \n                may be asserted only when the head of the agency that \n                maintains the records determines that disclosure and \n                release would be harmful to a specific interest \n                identified in the exemption. An agency head who makes \n                such a determination shall promptly report such \n                determination to the committees of Congress with \n                appropriate jurisdiction, including the Committee on \n                the Judiciary and the Select Committee on Intelligence \n                of the Senate and the Committee on Government Reform \n                and Oversight and the Permanent Select Committee on \n                Intelligence of the House of Representatives. The \n                exemptions set forth in paragraph (2) shall constitute \n                the only authority pursuant to which an agency head may \n                exempt records otherwise subject to release under \n                paragraph (1).''.\n            (4) Conforming amendments.--Such Act is further amended as \n        follows:\n                    (A) In section 2(a)--\n                            (i) by striking ``and'' at the end of \n                        paragraph (3);\n                            (ii) by striking paragraph (4); and\n                            (iii) by adding after paragraph (3) the \n                        following new paragraphs:\n            ``(4) `Japanese Imperial Government records' has the \n        meaning given such term under section 3(b) of this Act; and\n            ``(5) `record' means a Nazi war criminal record or a \n        Japanese Imperial Government record.''.\n                    (B) In section 3(c)(1), as redesignated by \n                paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection, by inserting ``and \n                Japanese Imperial Government records'' after ``Nazi war \n                criminal records''.\n                    (C) In section 4(d), as so redesignated, by \n                inserting ``or Japanese Imperial Government record'' \n                after ``Nazi war criminal record''.\n                    (D) In section 4, by inserting ``or Japanese \n                Imperial Government record'' after ``Nazi war criminal \n                record'' each place it appears.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 2(d) of such Act is \namended to read as follows:\n    ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated for the Interagency Group to carry out this section, \n$5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003.''.\n    (f) Records Included.--Section 3(a)(2)(A) of such Act is amended by \nstriking ``beginning on March 23, 1933, and ending on May 8, 1945'' and \ninserting ``beginning on January 1, 1931, and ending on September 2, \n1945''.\n    (g) Modification of Name of Interagency Group.--Such Act is amended \nby striking ``Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group'' \neach place it appears and inserting ``Nazi War Crimes and Japanese \nImperial Government Records Interagency Working Group''.\n    (h) Clerical Amendments.--(1) The section heading of section 2 of \nsuch Act is amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 2.
