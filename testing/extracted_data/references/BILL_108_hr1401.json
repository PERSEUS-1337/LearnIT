FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Research shows that caring adults can make a difference \n        in children's lives. Forty-five percent of mentored teens are \n        less likely to use drugs. Fifty-nine percent of mentored teens \n        have better academic performance. Seventy-three percent of \n        mentored teens achieve higher goals generally.\n            (2) Children that have mentors have better relationships \n        with adults, fewer disciplinary referrals, and more confidence \n        to achieve their goals.\n            (3) In 2001, over 163,000 children in the foster care \n        system were under the age of 5 years.\n            (4) In 2001, over 124,000 children were under the age of 10 \n        when they were removed from their parents or caretakers.\n            (5) The International Day of the Child, sponsored by \n        Children United Nations, has served as a great tool to recruit \n        mentors and partner them with needy foster care children.\n            (6) On November 10, 2002, as many as 3,000 children will be \n        matched with mentors as a result of the International Day of \n        the Child.\n            (7) States should be encouraged to incorporate mentor \n        programs into the delivery of their foster care services. The \n        State of California serves as a great example, matching close \n        to half a million mentors with needy children.\n            (8) Mentor programs that serve foster children are unique \n        and require additional considerations including specialized \n        training and support necessary to provide for consistent, long \n        term relationships for children in care.\n            (9) Mentor programs are cost-effective approaches to \n        decreasing the occurrence of so many social ills such as teen \n        pregnancy, substance abuse, incarceration and violence.\n\nSEC. 3. PROGRAMS FOR MENTORING CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE.\n\n    Subpart 2 of part B of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 629 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 440.
