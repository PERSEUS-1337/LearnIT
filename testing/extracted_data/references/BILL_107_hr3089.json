FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that it is in the public interest to:\n            (1) Enable small businesses, residences, schools, churches, \n        farms, and other retail electric customers who generate \n        electric energy to reduce their electric bills.\n            (2) Encourage private investment in renewable and \n        unconventional energy resources.\n            (3) Enhance the diversity of the Nation's electric supply \n        by increasing reliance on a wide range of renewable and other \n        environmentally sound distributed generation technologies.\n            (4) Reduce price volatility and enhance reliability by \n        reducing peak load on centrally generated power supplies.\n            (5) Protect the environment by promoting clean energy \n        sources.\n\nSEC. 3. NET METERING.\n\n    Part II of the Federal Power Act is amended by adding the following \nnew section at the end thereof:\n\n``SEC. 215. STATE NET METERING PROGRAMS.\n\n    ``(a) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n            ``(1) The term `customer generator' means the owner or \n        operator of an electric generation unit qualified for net \n        metering under this section.\n            ``(2) The term `net metering' means measuring the \n        difference between the electricity supplied to a customer-\n        generator and the electricity generated by a customer-generator \n        that is delivered to a local distribution system at the same \n        point of interconnection during an applicable billing period \n        and providing a credit to the customer-generator for the net \n        amount, if any, by which the electricity generated by the \n        customer-generator exceeds the electricity supplied to the \n        customer generator during that billing period.\n            ``(3) The terms `electric generation unit qualified for net \n        metering' and `qualified generation unit' mean an electric \n        energy generation unit that meets the requirements of \n        subsection (b)(1) of this section.\n            ``(4) The term `retail electric supplier' means any person \n        that sells electric energy to the ultimate consumer thereof.\n            ``(5) The term `local distribution system' means any system \n        for the distribution of electric energy to the ultimate \n        consumer thereof, whether or not the owner or operator of such \n        system is also a retail electric supplier.\n    ``(b) Net Metering Requirement.--Each State, electric utility not \nregulated by a State, and Federal power marketing agency shall consider \nestablishing a net metering program, or modifying an existing program, \nto meet the minimum Federal standards set forth in subsection (c) of \nthis section. If the Commission determines that a State, electric \nutility not regulated by a State, or Federal power marketing agency has \nnot established a net metering program that meets such minimum \nstandards within 2 years after the enactment of this Act, the \nCommission shall establish a program (in such State or in the service \nterritory of such electric utility or Federal power marketing agency) \nconsistent with such standards.\n    ``(c) Minimum Federal Standards for State and Other Net Metering \nPrograms.--\n            ``(1) Qualified generation unit.--A generation unit that \n        meets the following requirements qualifies for net metering \n        under this section:\n                    ``(A) The unit is a fuel cell or uses as its energy \n                source either solar, wind, or biomass.\n                    ``(B) The unit has a generating capacity of up to \n                200 kilowatts.\n                    ``(C) The unit is located on premises that are \n                owned, operated, leased, or otherwise controlled by the \n                customer-generator.\n                    ``(D) The unit operates in parallel with the retail \n                electric supplier.\n                    ``(E) The unit is used primarily to offset part or \n                all of the customer-generator's requirements for \n                electric energy.\n                    ``(F) The unit is not intended to offset or provide \n                credits for electric consumption at another location of \n                the customer or for any other customer.\n            ``(2) Metering and costs.--The retail electric supplier \n        shall make available upon request net metering service to any \n        customer-generator that the supplier serves if the retail \n        customer-generator pays any incremental costs, including those \n        incurred by suppliers and local distribution systems for \n        equipment or services for safety or performance that are \n        necessary to meet the standards referred to in this section. If \n        a State, nonregulated utility, or Federal power marketing \n        agency determines that the use of a real-time net meter or \n        interval net meter will advance the purposes of this section \n        for such units, a customer-generator in that State (or, in the \n        case of a nonregulated utility or Federal power marketing \n        agency, the relevant service territory) may be required to use \n        the appropriate meter and pay the reasonable incremental costs \n        for such meter and its installation.\n            ``(3) Rates.--Rates and charges for retail electric service \n        to customer-generators, including the amount of a net metering \n        credit, shall be established by the appropriate State \n        regulatory authority and nonpublic utilities. To the extent \n        that a State regulatory authority, nonregulated utility, or \n        Federal power marketing agency does not establish such rates \n        and charges, such rates and charges shall be established by the \n        Commission. The rates and charges established pursuant to this \n        section shall be just and reasonable.\n            ``(4) Safety and performance standards.--A qualified \n        generation unit and net metering system used by a customer-\n        generator shall meet all applicable safety and performance and \n        reliability standards established by the national electrical \n        code, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, \n        Underwriters Laboratories, or the American National Standards \n        Institute, except that a State may adopt additional or \n        different standards provided that such standard is consistent \n        with the purposes of this section and does not impose an unjust \n        or unreasonable burden on a customer-generator that seeks to \n        participate in the State's net metering program.\n            ``(5) State authority to establish additional \n        requirements.--Consistent with the limits of its jurisdiction \n        under this part, nothing in this section shall preclude a State \n        from establishing or imposing--\n                    ``(A) requirements or incentives to encourage \n                qualified generation and net metering that are in \n                addition to or in excess of the minimum standards \n                established in this section (including but not limited \n                to additional eligible fuels, higher capacity limits, \n                and credit amounts that vary by fuel or capacity);\n                    ``(B) limits on the State-wide aggregate amount of \n                generating capacity of customer-generators with \n                qualified generation facilities and net metering \n                systems, provided that such limits are not unduly \n                discriminatory and are consistent with the purposes of \n                this section; or\n                    ``(C) administrative and enforcement procedures and \n                requirements such State deems necessary or appropriate \n                to implement a net metering program under this section, \n                if such procedures and requirements are consistent with \n                the purposes of this section and does not impose an \n                unjust or unreasonable burden on a customer-generator \n                that seeks to participate in the State's net metering \n                program.\n            ``(6) Not a wholesale sale.--A net metering credit under a \n        net metering program established under this section shall not \n        be considered a sale for resale for the purposes of Federal or \n        State law.''."
