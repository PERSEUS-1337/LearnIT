FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) agricultural commodity exports are essential to the \n        economic well-being of the United States farmers and ranchers \n        and related industries and to the entire United States economy;\n            (2) the United States exports the commodity production from \n        one-third of its harvested acreage, worth over $40,000,000,000 \n        in exports, and one million Americans in the United States \n        labor force depend on agricultural commodity exports for their \n        jobs;\n            (3) the newly-formed Republics of the former Soviet Union \n        are struggling to put in place the institutions of democratic \n        government and free market economies and have great need to \n        import agricultural commodities and products to sustain that \n        effort and achieve any measure of success;\n            (4) the former Soviet Union has been the largest importer \n        of United States grain and the new Republics represent an \n        important market in the future for United States agricultural \n        commodities and products;\n            (5) the virtual cessation in recent months of United States \n        agricultural exports to the Republics of the former Soviet \n        Union has created an adverse impact on the markets for the \n        commodities held by United States agricultural producers and is \n        estimated to result in a $1,300,000,000 addition to the United \n        States deficit if not reversed;\n            (6) the abundant natural resources of the Republics of the \n        former Soviet Union and the capacity to produce revenues \n        through the development of those resources provide assurance of \n        their ability to repay direct loans and loan guarantees \n        extended by the United States for the export of agricultural \n        commodities and products within a reasonable time; and\n            (7) in addition to the authority to provide direct loans \n        and credit guarantees and in order to develop, maintain, and \n        expand foreign markets for United States agricultural products \n        under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, the Secretary of \n        Agriculture--\n                    (A) has been provided the authority to institute a \n                program in which agricultural commodities and products \n                may be provided to importing countries through barter \n                in exchange for foreign products from such importing \n                countries;\n                    (B) may initiate a variation of the Export \n                Enhancement Program, the Dairy Export Incentive \n                Program, and the Sunflower Oil Assistance Program that \n                allows sales to third-country buyers for commodities \n                destined to the Republics of the former Soviet Union \n                wherein such buyers are also third-country purchasers \n                of goods exported from the Republics of the former \n                Soviet Union and such buyers rely on compensatory forms \n                of trade such as barter, countertrade, offset \n                arrangements and escrow accounts to be eligible for \n                U.S. Department of Agriculture trade program bonuses; \n                and\n                    (C) may initiate a program through which payment \n                for United States agricultural commodities can be made \n                by recipient countries based on the future sales of \n                their abundant natural resources.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS FOR DIRECT LOANS.\n\n    Section 201(f) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. \n5621(f)) is amended to read as follows--\n    ``(f) Restrictions.--In determining whether to make export sales \nfinancing authorized under this section available in connection with \nsales of agricultural commodities, the Commodity Credit Corporation \nshall take into account--\n            ``(1) the credit needs of countries that are potential \n        purchasers of United States agricultural exports;\n            ``(2) the long-term repayment ability of such countries; \n        and\n            ``(3) whether the availability of Commodity Credit \n        Corporation financing will maintain or improve the competitive \n        position of the United States agricultural exports in world \n        markets.''.\n\nSEC. 4. RESTRICTIONS FOR CREDIT GUARANTEES.\n\n    Section 202(f) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. \n5622(f)) is amended to read as follows--\n    ``(f) Restrictions.--In determining whether to make credit \nguarantees available in connection with sales of agricultural \ncommodities under this section, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall \ntake into account--\n            ``(1) the credit needs of countries that are potential \n        purchasers of United States agricultural exports;\n            ``(2) the long-term repayment ability of such countries; \n        and\n            ``(3) whether the availability of Commodity Credit \n        Corporation guarantees will maintain or improve the competitive \n        position of the United States agricultural exports in world \n        markets.''."
