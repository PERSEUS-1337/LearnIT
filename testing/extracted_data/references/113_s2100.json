    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Cookstoves and Fuels Support \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Nearly half the world's population cooks their food \n        over open fires or inefficient, polluting, and unsafe \n        cookstoves using wood, agricultural waste, dung, coal, or other \n        solid fuels. Smoke from the use of these traditional cookstoves \n        and open fires is associated with a number of chronic and acute \n        diseases and injuries, including respiratory illnesses such as \n        pneumonia, heart disease, and cancer, with women and young \n        children affected disproportionately.\n            (2) The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 doubled the \n        mortality estimates for exposure to smoke from cookstoves, \n        referred to as ``household air pollution'', from 2,000,000 to \n        4,000,000 deaths annually in the developing world, which the \n        Study indicates is more than the deaths from malaria, \n        tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS combined. The Study attributes \n        3,500,000 deaths to cookstoves smoke exposures indoors and \n        500,000 deaths to the contribution of cookstoves to outdoor air \n        pollution. Millions more are sickened from the toxic smoke and \n        thousands suffer burns annually from open fires or unsafe \n        cookstoves and fuels. The Study ranks household air pollution \n        as the fourth worst overall health risk factor in the world and \n        as the second worst health risk factor in the world for women \n        and girls. Cookstove smoke exposures are particularly prominent \n        in developing regions of Asia and Africa.\n            (3) The amount of biomass cooking fuel required each year \n        can reach up to two tons per family. Where demand for local \n        biomass outstrips the natural regrowth of resources, local \n        environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity often \n        result.\n            (4) Tremendous amounts of time, a burden shouldered \n        disproportionately by women and children, is spent collecting \n        and managing biomass cooking fuel resources. As nearby fuel \n        supplies dwindle, women are forced to go farther to find fuel \n        to cook their families' meals. In some regions, women and girls \n        risk rape and gender-based violence during the up to 20 hours \n        per week they spend away from their communities gathering \n        firewood.\n            (5) Recent studies show that black carbon created from \n        biomass cookstoves significantly contributes to regional air \n        pollution and climate change. Black carbon emissions from \n        residential cookstoves in developing countries account for an \n        estimated 21 percent of total global inventory, and mitigation \n        in this sector represents a large potential public health \n        benefit.\n            (6) The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is an \n        innovative public-private partnership hosted by the United \n        Nations Foundation that was created to enable the adoption of \n        clean and efficient stoves in 100,000,000 homes by 2020. The \n        Alliance works with public, private, and non-profit partners to \n        overcome market barriers that currently impede the production, \n        deployment, and use of clean cookstoves and fuels in the \n        developing world.\n            (7) The United States Government has committed a total of \n        up to $125,000,000 to the sector, including approximately \n        $60,000,000 in research, $15,000,000 in field implementation \n        activities, and up to $50,000,000 in financing, through the \n        first five years of the Alliance to help spur the adoption of \n        clean cookstoves and fuels in 100,000,000 households by 2020 as \n        follows:\n                    (A) The Department of State has committed \n                $1,020,000 through fiscal year 2015 and the United \n                States Agency for International Development has \n                committed $18,400,000 through fiscal year 2015.\n                    (B) The Department of Energy has committed \n                $13,200,000 through fiscal year 2016.\n                    (C) The Department of Health and Human Services has \n                committed $31,690,000 through the National Institutes \n                of Health through fiscal year 2016 and $3,900,000 \n                through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n                through fiscal year 2015.\n                    (D) The Environmental Protection Agency has \n                committed $9,670,000 through fiscal year 2015.\n                    (E) The National Science Foundation has committed \n                $1,270,000 through fiscal year 2015.\n                    (F) The Overseas Private Investment Corporation has \n                committed up to $50,000,000 through fiscal year 2016 in \n                debt financing or insurance that meet their credit and \n                lending standards to support projects that provide \n                clean, consistent, and affordable access to energy and \n                energy savings through the manufacture, sale, and \n                purchase of cookstoves.\n            (8) This commitment targets a wide range of work, including \n        expanded research on cookstoves performance, marketing, and \n        adoption; expanded research on the health, climate and air \n        quality benefits of clean cookstoves; and expanded field \n        efforts in Kenya, Haiti, Bangladesh, and Nigeria.\n            (9) Additional Federal support is being provided to the \n        Alliance, including by the Department of Agriculture, the \n        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Peace \n        Corps.\n            (10) The Millennium Challenge Corporation, in 2010, prior \n        to the launch of the Alliance, committed the largest stoves-\n        related investment to date in Mongolia. The commitment of \n        $45,300,000 focused on economic growth from energy efficiency \n        and improved air quality.\n\nSEC. 3.
