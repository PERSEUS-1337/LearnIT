FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Approximately 1 in 4 women will experience domestic \n        violence during her lifetime and every year, 1 in 3 women who \n        is a victim of homicide is murdered by her current or former \n        partner.\n            (2) Every year, more than 3 million children witness \n        domestic violence in their homes and children who live in homes \n        where there is domestic violence also suffer abuse or neglect \n        at high rates.\n            (3) Children are more likely to intervene when they witness \n        severe violence against a parent, which places them at great \n        risk for injury or even death.\n            (4) Girls who witness domestic violence are more vulnerable \n        to abuse as teens and adults and boys who witness domestic \n        violence are more likely to become adult abusers of their \n        partners, their children, or both, thus continuing the cycle of \n        violence in the next generation.\n            (5) Most domestic violence incidents are never reported.\n            (6) Family members, close friends, co-workers, and other \n        persons close to a victim of domestic violence frequently \n        observe things that lead to them to suspect that their loved \n        one or colleague is being abused but do not feel they possess \n        the knowledge and skills needed to provide constructive \n        assistance that can make a real difference in the life of the \n        victim.\n            (7) Domestic violence costs the national economy more than \n        $37 billion a year in law enforcement involvement, legal work, \n        medical and mental health treatment, and lost productivity.\n\nSEC. 3. INCENTIVE FOR STATES TO ENACT ENHANCED SENTENCING PROVISIONS \n              FOR PERSONS CONVICTED OF COMMITTING ACT OF DOMESTIC \n              VIOLENCE IN THE PRESENCE OF A MINOR CHILD.\n\n    (a) In General.--For each fiscal year after the expiration of the \nperiod of implementation specified in subsection (b), a State shall \nprovide by law enhanced sentencing provisions for persons convicted of \ncommitting, or attempting to commit, an act of domestic violence in the \npresence of minor children.\n    (b) Period for Implementation by States.--\n            (1) Deadline.--Each State shall implement this section \n        before 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Extensions.--The Attorney General may authorize up to \n        one 1-year extension of the deadline in paragraph (1).\n    (c) Failure of State To Comply.--\n            (1) In general.--For any fiscal year after the end of the \n        period for implementation under subsection (b), a State that \n        fails, as determined by the Attorney General, to substantially \n        implement this section shall not receive 20 percent of the \n        funds that would otherwise be allocated for that fiscal year to \n        the State under the Violence Against Women Act of 2000.\n            (2) State constitutionality.--\n                    (A) In general.--When evaluating whether a State \n                has substantially implemented this section, the \n                Attorney General shall consider whether the State is \n                unable to substantially implement this section because \n                of a demonstrated inability to implement certain \n                provisions that would place the State in violation of \n                its constitution, as determined by a ruling of the \n                State's highest court.\n                    (B) Efforts.--If the circumstances arise under \n                subparagraph (A), then the Attorney General and the \n                State shall make good faith efforts to accomplish \n                substantial implementation of this section and to \n                reconcile any conflicts between this section and the \n                State's constitution. In considering whether compliance \n                with the requirements of this section would likely \n                violate the State's constitution or an interpretation \n                thereof by the State's highest court, the Attorney \n                General shall consult with the chief executive and \n                chief legal officer of the State concerning the State's \n                interpretation of the State's constitution and rulings \n                thereon by the State's highest court.\n                    (C) Alternative procedures.--If the State is unable \n                to substantially implement this section because of a \n                limitation imposed by the State's constitution, the \n                Attorney General may determine that the State is in \n                compliance with this Act if the State has implemented, \n                or is in the process of implementing, reasonable \n                alternative procedures or accommodations that are \n                consistent with the purposes of this Act.\n                    (D) Funding reduction.--If a State does not comply \n                with subparagraph (C), then the State shall be subject \n                to a funding reduction as specified in paragraph (1).\n            (3) Reallocation.--Amounts not allocated under subpart 1 of \n        part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \n        Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et seq.) to a State for failure to \n        substantially implement this section shall be reallocated under \n        such subpart to States that have not failed to substantially \n        implement this section or may be reallocated to a State from \n        which they were withheld to be used solely for the purpose of \n        implementing this section.\n    (d) Definition of State.--In this section the term ``State'' shall \nhave the meaning given such term in section 901(a) of Omnibus Crime \nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3791(a) et seq.)."
