FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Delays in receiving care after breast cancer diagnosis \n        are reported to be greater for African-American women than \n        white women.\n            (2) Recent studies indicate that African-American women \n        with breast cancer are less likely to receive standard therapy \n        than white women.\n            (3) African-American and Hispanic patients are \n        significantly more likely than white patients to be diagnosed \n        at a more advanced stage of breast cancer.\n            (4) Investigators found that regardless of insurance \n        status, African-American women are 1.9 times more likely to be \n        diagnosed with an advanced stage of breast cancer than white \n        women and Hispanic women are 1.4 times more likely to be \n        diagnosed with an advanced stage of breast cancer than white \n        women.\n            (5) African-American women are ten percent more likely not \n        to receive tests to determine if breast cancer has spread to \n        axillary (underarm) lymph nodes. Studies show that health \n        insurance status, race, income, and educational background are \n        directly linked to irregularity in administering this vital \n        screening.\n            (6) According to American Cancer Society researchers, \n        substantial disparities remain or persist regarding cancer \n        diagnosis and treatment.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to promote the implementation of \nstandardized health care practices for breast cancer treatment under \nthe Medicare program to eliminate disparities in the provision of care \nto such patients based on race, level of education, income, and health \ninsurance status of such patients.\n\nSEC. 4. CONSENSUS-BASED BREAST CANCER TREATMENT PERFORMANCE MEASURES \n              SYSTEM UNDER MEDICARE.\n\n    Title XVIII of the Social Security Act is amended by adding at the \nend the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 1898.
