FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; STATEMENT OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A report of the Congressional Research Service on \n        relations between the United States and Pakistan states that \n        ``[t]he terrorist network led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son \n        Sirajuddin, based in the FATA, is commonly identified as the \n        most dangerous of Afghan insurgent groups battling U.S.-led \n        forces in eastern Afghanistan.''.\n            (2) The report further states that, in mid-2011, the \n        Haqqanis undertook several high-visibility attacks in \n        Afghanistan.\n            (3) A late June 2011 assault on the Intercontinental Hotel \n        in Kabul by eight Haqqani gunmen and suicide bombers left 18 \n        people dead.\n            (4) On September 10, 2011, a truck bomb attack on a United \n        States military base by Haqqani fighters in the Wardak province \n        injured 77 United States troops and killed five Afghans.\n            (5) The September 13, 2011, attack on the United States \n        Embassy compound in Kabul involved an assault that sparked a \n        20-hour-long gun battle and left 16 Afghans dead, five police \n        officers and at least six children among them.\n            (6) The report further states that ``U.S. and Afghan \n        officials concluded the Embassy attackers were members of the \n        Haqqani network.''.\n            (7) General John Allen, Commander, United States Forces \n        Afghanistan, has stated that the Haqqanis are responsible for \n        the deaths of hundreds of United States and coalition service \n        members, and is responsible for planning and conducting high-\n        profile attacks against United States interests, including the \n        deadly assault on the Capital, Kabul in April 2012.\n            (8) In September 22, 2011, testimony before the Committee \n        on Armed Services of the Senate, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n        of Staff Admiral Mullen stated that ``[t]he Haqqani network, \n        for one, acts as a veritable arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services \n        Intelligence agency. With ISI support, Haqqani operatives plan \n        and conducted that [September 13] truck bomb attack, as well as \n        the assault on our embassy. We also have credible evidence they \n        were behind the June 28th attack on the Intercontinental Hotel \n        in Kabul and a host of other smaller but effective \n        operations.''.\n            (9) In October 27, 2011, testimony before the Committee on \n        Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, Secretary of \n        State Hillary Clinton stated that ``I think everyone agrees \n        that the Haqqani Network has safe havens inside Pakistan; that \n        those safe havens give them a place to plan and direct \n        operations that kill Afghans and Americans.''.\n            (10) On November 1, 2011, the United States Government \n        added Haji Mali Kahn to a list of specially designated global \n        terrorists under Executive Order 13224.\n            (11) The Department of State described Haji Mali Khan as \n        ``a Haqqani Network commander'' who has ``overseen hundreds of \n        fighters, and has instructed his subordinates to conduct \n        terrorist acts.''.\n            (12) The designation continued, ``Mali Khan has provided \n        support and logistics to the Haqqani Network, and has been \n        involved in the planning and execution of attacks in \n        Afghanistan against civilians, coalition forces, and Afghan \n        police.''.\n            (13) According to Jason Blazakis, the chief of the \n        Terrorist Designations Unit of the Department of State, Haji \n        Mali Khan also has links to al-Qaeda.\n            (14) Five other top Haqqani Network leaders have been \n        placed on the list of specially designated global terrorists \n        under Executive Order 13224 since 2008, and three of them have \n        been so placed in the last year.\n            (15) Sirajuddin Haqqani, the overall leader of the Haqqani \n        Network as well as the leader of the Taliban's Mira shah \n        Regional Military Shura, was designated by the Secretary of \n        State as a terrorist in March 2008, and in March 2009, the \n        Secretary of State put out a bounty of $5,000,000 for \n        information leading to his capture.\n            (16) The other four individuals so designated are \n        Nasiruddin Haqqani, Khalil al Rahman Haqqani, Badruddin \n        Haqqani, and Mullah Sangeen Zadran.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nSecretary of State should designate the Haqqani Network as a foreign \nterrorist organization in accordance with section 219 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189).\n    (c) Statement of Congress.--Congress encourages continued and \nthorough cooperation between the Secretary of State and the \nintelligence community regarding the Haqqani Network.\n\nSEC. 3.
