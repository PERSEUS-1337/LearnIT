FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the September 7, 2005, report to the \n        General Assembly of the United Nations by the Special \n        Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed \n        Conflict, ``In the last decade, two million children have been \n        killed in situations of armed conflict, while six million \n        children have been permanently disabled or injured. Over \n        250,000 children continue to be exploited as child soldiers and \n        tens of thousands of girls are being subjected to rape and \n        other forms of sexual violence.''.\n            (2) According to the Center for Emerging Threats and \n        Opportunities (CETO), Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, \n        ``The Child Soldier Phenomenon has become a post-Cold War \n        epidemic that has proliferated to every continent with the \n        exception of Antarctica and Australia.''.\n            (3) Many of the children currently serving in armed forces \n        or paramilitaries were forcibly conscripted through kidnapping \n        or coercion, a form of human trafficking, while others joined \n        military units due to economic necessity, to avenge the loss of \n        a family member, or for their own personal safety.\n            (4) Some military and militia commanders force child \n        soldiers to commit gruesome acts of ritual killings or torture, \n        including acts of violence against other children.\n            (5) Many female child soldiers face the additional \n        psychological and physical horrors of rape and sexual abuse, \n        enslavement for sexual purposes by militia commanders, and \n        severe social stigma should they return home.\n            (6) Some military and militia commanders target children \n        for recruitment because of their psychological immaturity and \n        vulnerability to manipulation and indoctrination. Children are \n        often separated from their families in order to foster \n        dependence on military units and leaders. Consequently, many of \n        these children suffer from deep trauma and are in need of \n        psychological counseling and rehabilitation.\n            (7) Child soldiers are exposed to hazardous conditions and \n        are at risk of physical injury and disability, psychological \n        trauma, sexually transmitted diseases, respiratory and skin \n        infections, and often death.\n            (8) On May 25, 2000, the United Nations adopted and opened \n        for signature, ratification, and accession the Optional \n        Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the \n        Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (in this Act referred \n        to as the ``Optional Protocol''), which establishes 18 as the \n        minimum age for conscription or forced recruitment and requires \n        states party to ensure that members of their armed forces under \n        the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities.\n            (9) On June 18, 2002, the Senate unanimously approved the \n        resolution advising and consenting to the ratification of the \n        Optional Protocol.\n            (10) On December 23, 2002, the United States presented the \n        ratified optional protocol to the United Nations.\n            (11) More than 110 governments worldwide have ratified the \n        optional protocol, establishing a clear international norm \n        concerning the use of children in combat.\n            (12) On December 2, 1999, the United States ratified \n        International Labour Convention 182, the Convention concerning \n        the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the \n        Worst Forms of Child Labour, which includes the use of child \n        soldiers among the worst forms of child labor.\n            (13) On October 7, 2005, the Senate gave its advice and \n        consent to the ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, \n        Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \n        and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention \n        Against Transnational Organized Crime.\n            (14) It is in the national security interest of the United \n        States to reduce the chances that members of the United States \n        Armed Forces will be forced to encounter children in combat \n        situations.\n            (15) Section 502B(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n        1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304(a)(3)) provides that ``the President is \n        directed to formulate and conduct international security \n        assistance programs of the United States in a manner which will \n        promote and advance human rights and avoid identification of \n        the United States, through such programs, with governments \n        which deny to their people internationally recognized human \n        rights and fundamental freedoms, in violation of international \n        law or in contravention of the policy of the United States as \n        expressed in this section or otherwise''.\n\nSEC. 3. CHILD SOLDIER DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, consistent with the provisions of the Optional \nProtocol, the term ``child soldier''--\n            (1) means--\n                    (A) any person under age 18 who takes a direct part \n                in hostilities as a member of governmental armed \n                forces;\n                    (B) any person under age 18 who has been \n                compulsorily recruited into governmental armed forces;\n                    (C) any person under age 16 voluntarily recruited \n                into governmental armed forces; and\n                    (D) any person under age 18 recruited or used in \n                hostilities by armed forces distinct from the armed \n                forces of a state; and\n            (2) includes any person described in subparagraphs (B), \n        (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) who is serving in any capacity, \n        including in a support role such as a cook, porter, messenger, \n        medic, guard, or sex slave.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress--\n            (1) to condemn the conscription, forced recruitment or use \n        of children by governments, paramilitaries, or other \n        organizations in hostilities;\n            (2) that the United States Government should support and, \n        where practicable, lead efforts to establish and uphold \n        international standards designed to end this abuse of human \n        rights;\n            (3) that the United States Government should expand ongoing \n        services to rehabilitate recovered child soldiers and to \n        reintegrate them back into their communities by--\n                    (A) offering ongoing psychological services to help \n                victims recover from their trauma and relearn how to \n                deal with others in nonviolent ways such that they are \n                no longer a danger to their community;\n                    (B) facilitating reconciliation with their \n                communities through negotiations with traditional \n                leaders and elders to enable recovered abductees to \n                resume normal lives in their communities; and\n                    (C) providing educational and vocational \n                assistance;\n            (4) that the United States should work with the \n        international community, including, where appropriate, third \n        country governments, nongovernmental organizations, faith-based \n        organizations, United Nations agencies, local governments, \n        labor unions, and private enterprise--\n                    (A) on efforts to bring to justice rebel \n                organizations that kidnap children for use as child \n                soldiers, including the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in \n                Uganda, Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia \n                (FARC), and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), \n                including, where feasible, by arresting the leaders of \n                such groups; and\n                    (B) on efforts to recover those children who have \n                been abducted and to assist them in their \n                rehabilitation and reintegration into communities;\n            (5) that the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Labor, \n        and the Secretary of Defense should coordinate programs to \n        achieve the goals specified in paragraph (3), and in countries \n        where the use of child soldiers is an issue, whether or not it \n        is supported or sanctioned by the governments of such \n        countries, United States diplomatic missions should include in \n        their mission program plans a strategy to achieve the goals \n        specified in such paragraph;\n            (6) that United States diplomatic missions in countries in \n        which governments use or tolerate child soldiers should \n        develop, as part of annual program planning, strategies to \n        promote efforts to end this abuse of human rights; and\n            (7) that, in allocating or recommending the allocation of \n        funds or recommending candidates for programs and grants funded \n        by the United States Government, United States diplomatic \n        missions should give particular consideration to those programs \n        and candidates deemed to promote the end to this abuse of human \n        rights.\n\nSEC. 5.
