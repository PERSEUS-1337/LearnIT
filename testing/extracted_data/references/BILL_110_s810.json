FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) To remain competitive in science and technology in the \n        global economy, the United States must increase the number of \n        students graduating from high school prepared to pursue \n        postsecondary education in science, technology, engineering, \n        and mathematics.\n            (2) There is broad agreement in the scientific community \n        that learning science requires direct involvement by students \n        in scientific inquiry and that laboratory experience is so \n        integral to the nature of science that it must be included in \n        every science program for every science student.\n            (3) In America's Lab Report, the National Research Council \n        concluded that the current quality of laboratory experiences is \n        poor for most students and that educators and researchers do \n        not agree on how to define high school science laboratories or \n        on their purpose, hampering the accumulation of research on how \n        to improve labs.\n            (4) The National Research Council found that schools with \n        higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and schools with \n        higher concentrations of poor students are less likely to have \n        adequate laboratory facilities than other schools.\n            (5) The Government Accountability Office reported that 49.1 \n        percent of schools where the minority student population is \n        greater than 50.5 percent reported not meeting functional \n        requirements for laboratory science well or at all.\n            (6) 40 percent of those college students who left the \n        science fields reported some problems related to high school \n        science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience \n        and no introduction to theoretical or to analytical modes of \n        thought.\n            (7) It is the national interest for the Federal Government \n        to invest in research and demonstration projects to improve the \n        teaching of laboratory science in the Nation's high schools.\n\nSEC. 2. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    Section 8(8) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act \nof 2002 (Public Law 107-368) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) through (F) as \n        clauses (i) through (vi), respectively, and indenting \n        appropriately;\n            (2) by moving the flush language at the end 2 ems to the \n        right;\n            (3) in the flush language at the end, by striking \n        ``paragraph'' and inserting ``subparagraph'';\n            (4) by striking ``Initiative.--A program of'' and inserting \n        ``initiative.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--A program of''; and\n            (5) by inserting at the end the following:\n                    ``(B) Pilot program.--\n                            ``(i) In general.--In accordance with \n                        subparagraph (A)(v), the Director shall \n                        establish a pilot program designated as \n                        `Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' \n                        to award grants to partnerships to improve \n                        laboratories and provide instrumentation as \n                        part of a comprehensive program to enhance the \n                        quality of mathematics, science, engineering, \n                        and technology instruction at the secondary \n                        school level.
