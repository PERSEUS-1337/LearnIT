Upon receipt of such a \n        complaint, the Secretary of Labor shall notify the person named \n        in the complaint and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n        Administration of the filing of the complaint, of the \n        allegations contained in the complaint, of the substance of \n        evidence supporting the complaint, and of the opportunities \n        which will be afforded to such person under paragraph (2).\n            ``(2) Investigation; preliminary order.--Within 60 days of \n        receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (1) and after \n        affording the person named in the complaint of an opportunity \n        to submit to the Secretary of Labor a written response to the \n        complaint and an opportunity to meet with a representative of \n        the Secretary to present statements from witnesses, the \n        Secretary of Labor shall conduct an investigation and determine \n        whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint \n        has merit and notify the complainant and the person alleged to \n        have committed a violation of subsection (a) of the Secretary's \n        findings.

The filing \n        of such objections shall not operate to stay any reinstatement \n        remedy contained in the preliminary order. Such hearings shall \n        be conducted expeditiously.
