Reports.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On September 16, 2003, the Under Secretary for Arms \n        Control and International Security, John R. Bolton, stated \n        before the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n        Representatives that: ``Without question, among rogue states, \n        those most aggressively seeking to acquire or develop weapons \n        of mass destruction and their means of delivery, and which are \n        therefore threats to our national security, are Iran and North \n        Korea, followed by Libya and Syria. It is also the case that \n        these states are among those we identify as state sponsors of \n        terrorism.''.\n            (2) In his statement before the International Atomic Energy \n        Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations on September 8, 2003, \n        United States Ambassador Kenneth Brill denounced Iran's \n        patterns of deception regarding its nuclear program by \n        declaring Iran to be ``working in secret, going back into the \n        1980s, to develop sophisticated nuclear facilities; stalling, \n        stonewalling, and on a number of occasions first providing the \n        IAEA false information, and then changing its story when the \n        original version was revealed to be inaccurate; and attempting \n        to cover up traces of its activities to avoid detection by the \n        Agency''.\n            (3) The Final Resolution of the Board of Governors of the \n        International Atomic Energy Agency on September 11, 2003, noted \n        with concern, ``that the agency environmental sampling at \n        Natanz has revealed the presence of two types of highly \n        enriched uranium, which requires additional work to enable the \n        Agency to arrive at a conclusion; that IAEA inspectors found \n        considerable modifications had been made to the premises at the \n        Kalaye Electric Company prior to inspections that may impact on \n        the accuracy of the environmental sampling; that some of Iran's \n        statements to the IAEA have undergone significant and material \n        changes, and that the number of outstanding issues has \n        increased since the report; and that despite the Board's \n        statement in June 2003 encouraging Iran as a confidence-\n        building measure, not to introduce nuclear material into its \n        pilot centrifuge enrichment cascade at Natanz, Iran has \n        introduced such material''.\n            (4) The Government of Iran, in a letter to the \n        International Atomic Energy Agency of August 19, 2003, \n        acknowledged that, in the early 1990s, there had been ``bench \n        scale'' uranium conversion experiments. Iran has indicated that \n        more time will be needed to find the people involved in these \n        experiments and to trace any other closed down facilities.\n            (5) Iranian authorities have stated that none of the \n        imported uranium had been processed and specifically, that it \n        had not been used in any centrifuge tests. It was observed, \n        however, during IAEA verification in March 2003, that some of \n        the UF&lt;INF&gt;6&lt;/INF&gt; was in fact missing from the two small \n        cylinders.\n            (6)(A) Iranian authorities told the International Atomic \n        Energy Agency that the decision to launch a centrifuge \n        enrichment program had actually been taken in 1985 and that \n        Iran had received drawings of the centrifuge through a foreign \n        intermediary around 1987.\n            (B) The Iranian authorities described the program as having \n        consisted of three phases: activities during the first phase, \n        from 1985 until 1997, had been located mainly at the Atomic \n        Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) premises in Tehran; during \n        the second phase, between 1997 and 2002, the activities had \n        been concentrated at the Kalaye Electric Company in Tehran; \n        during the third phase, 2002 to the present, the research and \n        development and assembly activities were moved to the Natanz \n        facility.\n            (7) In the August 19, 2003, letter from Iran, the \n        International Atomic Energy Agency was informed that, in the \n        past, apart from planned co-operation in laser fusion and laser \n        spectroscopy which never materialized, there had been a \n        research thesis on laser spectroscopy prepared by a university \n        student in co-operation with the laser division of the Atomic \n        Energy Organization of Iran. Such a study by the AEOI could \n        later prove to be relevant to the implementation of laser \n        enrichment programs in Iran.\n            (8) In September 2003, Britain, France, and Germany \n        nevertheless offered western technology to Iran if it stopped \nits nuclear fuel enrichment program and accepted more intrusive United \nNations inspections of its nuclear facilities, all in defiance of the \nUnited States efforts to achieve a united front to counter the \nburgeoning Iranian nuclear program.\n            (9) European oil investment and credit provisions have \n        unquestionably helped the Iranian economy by enabling it to \n        build its nuclear program. The Iranians are boasting that as \n        much as $20,000,000,000 in oil agreements have been signed \n        between Iran and European Union countries since 1995.\n            (10) France's Totalfina formed a multi-billion dollar \n        consortium to develop Iranian oil fields of South Pars in 1995 \n        and has been adding to its development ever since. Britain has \n        issued credit guarantees to back up its oil investments in Iran \n        as well.\n            (11) Germany is actively seeking to increase its exports to \n        Iran and in 2001 it quadrupled its export insurance to that \n        country. The French bank BNP Paribas has arranged \n        $2,230,000,000 in loans for Iran since 1990.\n            (12) Europe has also been actively seeking a European \n        Union-Iran trade pact, formally giving the go-ahead to pursue \n        investments in Iran.\n            (13) The Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation, \n        John S. Wolf, in testimony before the Committee on Foreign \n        Relations of the Senate on March 19, 2003, stated that: ``Libya \n        has crossed the nuclear threshold and is among the list of \n        nuclear wannabees. These wannabees seek nuclear weapons \n        capabilities even though they are all parties to the [Treaty on \n        the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons].''.\n            (14) In testimony before the Select Committee on \n        Intelligence of the Senate on February 10, 2003, the Director \n        of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, remarked: ``Libya \n        clearly intends to reestablish its offensive chemical weapons \n        capability and has produced at least 100 tons of chemical \n        agents at its Rabta facility.''.\n            (15) In addition to manufacturing and possessing chemical \n        weapons, Libya has a history of employing them. According to \n        the Department of Defense, in 1987 Libya employed chemical \n        agents against troops from its neighboring country of Chad. \n        Libya has used missiles and aircraft in combat. Libya also \n        ``fired SCUD missiles at an Italian island in 1987'', according \n        to the 2001 Department of Defense ``Proliferation: Threat and \n        Response'' Report.\n            (16) According to the same report, Libya may be capable of \n        producing small quantities of biological agents. And, ``with \n        the suspension of UN sanctions, Libya's ability to acquire \n        biological-related equipment and expertise will increase''.\n            (17) The Government of Libya continues to seek ballistic \n        missile delivery systems that could be used for chemical or \n        nuclear warfare. On October 31, 2002, the director of the \n        United States Missile Defense Agency, Lieutenant General Ronald \n        Kadish, stated: ``The Libyans have been pretty active in trying \n        to get missile capability, and not just short-range. They have \n        enough money to buy it . . . We worry a lot about Libya in the \n        Missile Defense Agency.''.\n\n    TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO THE IRAN AND LIBYA SANCTIONS ACT OF 1996\n\nSEC. 101.
