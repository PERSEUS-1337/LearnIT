PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To conduct a comprehensive study of ballistic imaging \n        technology and evaluate design parameters for packing and \n        shipping of fired cartridge cases and projectiles.\n            (2) To determine the effectiveness of the National \n        Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) as a tool in \n        investigating crimes committed with handguns and rifles.\n            (3) To establish the cost and overall effectiveness of \n        State-mandated ballistic imaging systems and the sharing and \n        retention of the data collected by the systems.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 12 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall enter into an \narrangement with the National Research Council of the National Academy \nof Sciences, which shall have sole responsibility for conducting under \nthe arrangement a study to determine the following:\n            (1) The design parameters for an effective and uniform \n        system for packing fired cartridge cases and projectiles, and \n        for collecting information that will accompany a fired \n        cartridge case and projectile and be entered into a ballistic \n        imaging system.\n            (2) The most effective method for projectile recovery that \n        can be used to collect fired projectiles for entry into a \n        ballistic imaging system and the cost of such recovery \n        equipment.\n            (3) Which countries are employing ballistic imaging systems \n        and the results of the systems as a tool in investigating \n        crimes committed with handguns and rifles.\n            (4) The comprehensive cost, to date, for Federal, State, \n        and local jurisdictions that have implemented a ballistic \n        imaging system to include startup, operating costs, and outlays \n        for personnel and administration.\n            (5) The estimated yearly cost for administering a ballistic \n        imaging system, the storage of cartridge cases and projectiles \n        on a nationwide basis, and the costs to industry and consumers \n        of doing so.\n            (6) How many revolvers, manually operated handguns, \n        semiautomatic handguns, manually operated rifles, and \n        semiautomatic rifles are sold in the United States each year, \n        the percentage of crimes committed with revolvers, other \n        manually operated handguns, and manually operated rifles as \n        compared with semiautomatic handguns and semiautomatic rifles, \n        and the percentage of each currently on record in the NIBIN \n        system.\n            (7) Whether in countries where ballistic identification has \n        been implemented, a shift has occurred in the number of \n        semiautomatic handguns and semiautomatic rifles, compared with \n        revolvers, other manually operated handguns, and manually \n        operated rifles that are used to commit a crime.\n            (8) A comprehensive list of environmental and \n        nonenvironmental factors, including modifications to a firearm, \n        that can substantially alter or change the identifying marks on \n        a cartridge case and projectile so as to preclude a \n        scientifically reliable comparison between specimens and the \n        stored image from the same firearm being admissible as evidence \n        in a court of law.\n            (9) The technical improvements in database management that \n        will be necessary to keep pace with system growth and the \n        estimated cost of the improvements.\n            (10) What redundant or duplicate systems exist, or have \n        existed, the ability of the various systems to share \n        information, and the cost and time it will take to integrate \n        operating systems.\n            (11) Legal issues that need to be addressed at the Federal \n        and State levels to codify the type of information that would \n        be captured and stored as part of a national ballistic \n        identification program and the sharing of the information \n        between State systems and NIBIN.\n            (12) What storage and retrieval procedures guarantee the \n        integrity of cartridge cases and projectiles for indefinite \n        periods of time and insure proper chain of custody and \n        admissibility of ballistic evidence or images in a court of \n        law.\n            (13) The time, cost, and resources necessary to enter \n        images of fired cartridge cases and fired projectiles into a \n        ballistic imaging identification system of all new handguns and \n        rifles sold in the United States and those possessed lawfully \n        by firearms owners.\n            (14) Whether an effective procedure is available to collect \n        fired cartridge cases and projectiles from privately owned \n        handguns and rifles.\n            (15) Whether the cost of ballistic imaging technology is \n        worth the investigative benefit to law enforcement officers.\n            (16) Whether State-based ballistic imaging systems, or a \n        combination of State and Federal ballistic imaging systems that \n        record and store cartridge cases and projectiles can be used to \n        create a centralized list of firearms owners.\n            (17) The cost-effectiveness of using a Federal, NIBIN-based \n        approach to using ballistic imaging technology as opposed to \n        State-based initiatives.\n\nSEC. 4.
