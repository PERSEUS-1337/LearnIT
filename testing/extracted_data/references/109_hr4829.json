Chain of custody procedures shall \n        apply to such labels and shall include procedures applicable to \n        contractual agreements for the use and distribution of the \n        labels, methods to audit the use of the labels, and database \n        access for the relevant governmental agencies for audit or \n        verification of the use and distribution of the labels.\n    (e) Penalty.--A prescription drug is deemed to be misbranded for \npurposes of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et \nseq.) if the packaging or labeling of the drug is in violation of a \nrequirement or prohibition applicable to the drug under subsection (a), \n(b), or (d).\n    (f) Transitional Provisions; Effective Dates.--\n            (1) National specified list of susceptible prescription \n        drugs.--\n                    (A) Initial publication.--Not later than 180 days \n                after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n                Secretary of Health and Human Services shall publish in \n                the Federal Register a list, to be known as the \n                National Specified List of Susceptible Prescription \n                Drugs, consisting of not less than 30 of the \n                prescription drugs that are most frequently subject to \n                counterfeiting in the United States (as determined by \n                the Secretary).\n                    (B) Revision.--Not less than annually through the \n                end of calendar year 2009, the Secretary shall review \n                and, as appropriate, revise the National Specified List \n                of Susceptible Prescription Drugs.
