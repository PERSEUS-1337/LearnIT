PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to promote the capacity of recipient \nnongovernmental organizations to provide appropriate mental disability \nand mental trauma care training for providers on a national, regional, \nand local level abroad.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The efforts of the United States to promote democracy \n        and human rights abroad must include vigorous efforts to \n        improve treatment of those with mental disabilities and mental \n        trauma.\n            (2) The World Health Report 2001, published by the World \n        Health Organization, reported that approximately 450,000,000 \n        people worldwide experience a mental disorder.\n            (3) War, conflict, and dictatorial regimes around the world \n        have also created tens of thousands of victims of violence, \n        rape, torture, and forced relocation who suffer from mental \n        trauma.\n            (4) Mental disability and mental trauma care resources are \n        sufficiently scarce in developed and developing countries that \n        national care giving practices are often antiquated and \n        underfunded.\n            (5) The World Health Organization reports that--\n                    (A) about 50 percent of mental disorders begin \n                before the sufferer reaches 14 years of age;\n                    (B) about 20 percent of the children and \n                adolescents of the world are estimated to have a mental \n                disorder; and\n                    (C) regions of the world in which a high percentage \n                of the population is under 19 years of age have the \n                lowest amount of mental disability care resources.\n            (6) There is tremendous inequity in the worldwide \n        distribution of skilled human resources for mental disability \n        and mental trauma care. A shortage of psychiatrists, \n        psychiatric nurses, psychologists, and social workers continues \n        to be a significant barrier to the provision of treatment and \n        care in low- and middle-income countries.\n            (7) In much of the world, there are immense obstacles to \n        full participation in society by people who suffer from a \n        mental disability or have experienced mental trauma.\n            (8) The World Health Organization reports that stigma about \n        mental disorders and discrimination against patients and \n        families can prevent people from seeking care.\n            (9) Social stigma and a lack of resources can often result \n        in the inappropriate institutionalization and effective \n        segregation from society of large numbers of people with mental \n        disabilities or mental trauma, often under appalling \n        conditions.\n            (10) Such inappropriate institutionalization does not \n        represent ``best-practice'' mental disability and mental trauma \n        care methods and is often an unacceptable violation of human \n        rights standards.\n\nSEC. 4. MENTAL DISABILITY AND MENTAL TRAUMA CARE QUALITY AND CAPACITY \n              IMPROVEMENT GRANTS.\n\n    Chapter 1 of Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \nU.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 104C the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 104D.
