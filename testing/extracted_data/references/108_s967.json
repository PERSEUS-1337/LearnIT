    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Equal Treatment Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) \n        formula, established by the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        pursuant to section 429 of the Departments of Veterans Affairs \n        and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies \n        Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-204; 110 Stat. 2929), \n        has proved to be an ineffective means of allocating veterans \n        medical care dollars fairly across the 22 national service \n        regions, known as Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), \n        of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n            (2) The VERA formula has resulted in a system of \n        inequitable care at veterans hospitals in different regions of \n        the country.\n            (3) The VERA formula has resulted in a system in which \n        veterans in some regions of the country are forced to compete \n        with veterans in other regions for critical medical care \n        funding, when the system should be providing funding for \n        medical care for all veterans, regardless of where they live, \n        to ensure that all veterans have access to the level and \n        quality of medical care that they have all earned and deserve.\n            (4) The VERA formula should be replaced with a new funding \n        formula that puts the funds provided to the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs for medical care into the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs Medical Centers that are treating patients.\n\nSEC. 3. REVISION TO MEDICAL CARE FUNDING ALLOCATION FORMULA FOR \n              DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\n\n    (a) Termination of Vera Formula.--The funding allocation formula \nfor the Department of Veterans Affairs medical care system known as the \nVeterans Equitable Resource Allocation system, established pursuant to \nsection 429 of the Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to section \n429 of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public \nLaw 104-204; 110 Stat. 2929), shall be discontinued by the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs effective at the end of the fiscal year during which \nthis Act is enacted.\n    (b) Development of Replacement Formula.--The Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs shall develop a new formula for the allocation of funds \nappropriated to the Department of Veterans Affairs for Medical Care to \nthe national service regions, known as Veterans Integrated Service \nNetworks (VISNs), of the Department. In developing such formula, the \nSecretary shall take the following requirements into account:\n            (1) For any fiscal year for which the amount appropriated \n        for Medical Care is an increase from the preceding year, the \n        funding level provided under the new formula to any VISN may \n        not be less than the amount provided for the preceding year.\n            (2) The new formula shall take into account additional \n        costs incurred by a VISN due to any of the following factors at \n        that VISN being in excess of the median for all VISNs:\n                    (A) The number of veterans moving into the \n                geographic area of that VISN.\n                    (B) The median age of veterans in that VISN.\n                    (C) The number of veterans in that VISN requiring \n                complex care or nursing home care.\n                    (D) The age of Department health care facilities in \n                that VISN.\n    (c) Transition Formula.--If as of the date specified in subsection \n(a) for the termination of the funding allocation formula referred to \nin that subsection the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has not \nimplemented a replacement funding allocation formula in accordance with \nsubsection (b), then effective as of that date and until such \nreplacement funding allocation formula is implemented, the funding \nallocation formula to be applied to amounts appropriated for veterans \nmedical care shall be the formula in effect before the formula referred \nto in subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    (a) Authorization of Appropriations for Replacement Allocation \nFormula.--There is authorized to be appropriated to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs for fiscal year 2004, $10,000,000 for development and \nimplementation of a replacement funding allocation formula in \naccordance with section 3(b).\n    (b) Additional Authorization of Appropriations for Medical Care.--\nThere is authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs for fiscal year 2004, $100,000,000 for ``Medical Care'' for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Such amount is in addition to any other \namount authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs for fiscal year 2004 and shall be allocated by the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to the national service regions, known as Veterans \nIntegrated Service Networks (VISNs), of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs on the basis of need, as follows:\n            (1) First, to the VISN that has experienced the greatest \n        reduction in funding from the funding levels for fiscal year \n        1997.\n            (2) Second, to any other VISN that has experienced an \n        overall funding decrease during the six-fiscal-year period \n        beginning with fiscal year 1997.\n            (3) Third, if any amount appropriated pursuant to such \n        authorization remains after allocations pursuant to paragraphs \n        (1) and (2), such amount shall be allocated equally among the \n        remaining 22 VISNs before implementation of the new formula."
