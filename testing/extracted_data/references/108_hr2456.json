FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare genetic bone marrow \n        failure disorder, which develops in infancy and results in \n        severe anemia due to failure to make red blood cells.\n            (2) Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients have an increased risk \n        of leukemia, solid tumors, and complete bone marrow failure.\n            (3) Fifty percent of patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia \n        are born with birth defects, including abnormalities to the \n        face, head, upper arm and hand, genitourinary, and heart, and \n        21 percent of the affected patients have more than 1 defect.\n            (4) Treatments for Diamond-Blackfan anemia, including the \n        use of blood transfusions and steroids such as prednisone, have \n        potential long-term side effects, including osteoporosis, iron \n        overload (because of the transfusions), and impaired growth \n        (because of the steroids).\n            (5) The only cure for Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a bone \n        marrow transplant, a procedure that carries serious risks and, \n        since most patients lack an acceptable donor, is an option for \n        only about 25 percent of patients.\n            (6) Because Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a genetic disorder \n        of red cell production and a cancer predisposition syndrome \n        with a high rate of congenital anomalies, the Federal \n        investment regarding Diamond-Blackfan anemia must be expanded \n        to allow the careful dissection of this disease, which will \n        provide valuable insights into the biology of blood disorders \n        and cancer predisposition and serve as an important model for \n        understanding the genetics of birth defects.\n\nSEC. 3. DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA.\n\n    (a) DBA-Related Activities of NIH.--Part A of title IV of the \nPublic Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section 404G \n(42 U.S.C. 283i) the following:\n\n                       ``diamond-blackfan anemia\n\n    ``Sec. 404H.
