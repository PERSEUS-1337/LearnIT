ENERGY SAVINGS CONTRACT.\n\n    Section 804(3) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 \nU.S.C. 8287c(3)) is amended to read as follows:\n            ``(3) The terms `energy savings contract' and `energy \n        savings performance contract' mean a contract which provides \n        for--\n                    ``(A) the performance of services for the design, \n                acquisition, installation, testing, operation, and, \n                where appropriate, maintenance and repair, of an \n                identified energy or water conservation measure or \n                series of measures at one or more locations; or\n                    ``(B) energy savings through the construction and \n                operation of one or more buildings or facilities to \n                replace one or more existing buildings or \n                facilities.''.\n\nSEC. 6.

PILOT PROGRAM FOR ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACT \n              INVESTMENTS IN NON-BUILDING ENERGY SAVINGS PROJECTS.\n\n    ``(a) Authorization.--The Secretary of Defense and the heads of \nother interested Federal agencies are authorized, on a pilot basis, to \nenter into up to ten energy savings performance contracts under this \nTitle for the purpose of achieving savings, secondary savings, and \nbenefits incidental to those purposes, in non-building energy \nefficiency improvement projects.\n    ``(b) Selection of Projects.--The Secretary of Energy, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other \ninterested Federal agencies, shall select up to ten contract projects \nfor this pilot program. The projects shall be selected to demonstrate \nthe applicability and benefit of energy savings performance contracting \nto a range of non-building energy efficiency improvement projects.\n    ``(c) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n            ``(1) The term `non-building' means any vehicle, device, or \n        equipment that is transportable under its own power by land, \n        sea, or air and consumes energy from any fuel source for the \n        purpose of such transportability, or to maintain a controlled \n        environment within such vehicle, device or equipment; or any \n        Federally owned equipment used to generate electricity or \n        transport water.\n            ``(2) The term `secondary savings', means additional energy \n        or cost savings that are a direct consequence of the energy \n        savings that result from the energy efficiency improvements \n        that were financed and implemented pursuant to the energy \n        savings performance contract. Such `secondary savings' may \n        include, but are not limited to, energy and cost savings that \n        result from a reduction in the need for fuel delivery and \n        logistical support. In the case of electric generation \n        equipment, secondary savings may include the benefits of \n        increased efficiency in the production of electricity.\n    ``(d) Report.--No later than three years after the enactment of \nthis section, the Secretary of Energy shall report to the Congress on \nthe progress and results of this program. Such report shall include: a \ndescription of all projects undertaken; the energy and cost savings, \nsecondary savings, other benefits and problems resulting from such \nprojects; and the overall cost-benefit of such projects. The report \nshall also include recommendations, developed in consultation with \nthose agencies that undertook projects under the program, as to whether \nthe authorization to enter into energy savings performance contract for \nnon-building projects should be extended, expanded, or otherwise \nmodified.''.\n\nSEC. 9. UTILITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS.\n\n    Section 546(c)(3) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act \n(42 U.S.C. 8256(c)(3)) is amended by striking ``facilities'' and \ninserting ``facilities, equipment and vehicles''."
