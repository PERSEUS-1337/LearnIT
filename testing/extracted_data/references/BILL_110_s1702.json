PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to promote employment opportunities for \nindividuals with severe disabilities, by requiring Federal agencies to \noffer incentives to Government contractors and subcontractors that \nemploy substantial numbers of individuals with severe disabilities.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Of the 9,400,000 people with severe disabilities in the \n        United States who want to work, only 26.1 percent are employed.\n            (2) The Social Security trustees project that, by 2029, the \n        Disability Trust Fund will be exhausted, 13 years before the \n        Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund.\n            (3) A June 2005 Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n        report designated modernizing federal disability programs as a \n        high-risk area, one that requires urgent attention and \n        organizational transformation to ensure that programs function \n        in the most economical, efficient and effective manner \n        possible. Solutions to these problems are likely to require \n        fundamental changes, including regulatory and legislative \n        action.\n            (4) If one percent of people with severe disabilities now \n        receiving Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental \n        Security Income payments were employed, the projected 10-year \n        cost savings for the Treasury would equal $45,000,000,000.\n            (5) It is appropriate for the Federal Government to offer \n        incentives to government contractors who employ significant \n        numbers of individuals with severe disabilities.\n\nSEC. 4.
