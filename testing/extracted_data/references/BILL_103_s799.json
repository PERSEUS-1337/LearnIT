FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) Since 1985, approximately 400 infants have drowned in \n        4-gallon to 6-gallon buckets, or nearly 1 child a week.\n            (2) Children drowning or hospitalized as a result of \n        falling into a bucket of liquid ranged in age from 1 month to \n        28 months although nearly 80 percent of all victims were 8 to \n        13 months old.\n            (3) Where race was reported in connection with such \n        drownings, African-American infants accounted for more of the \n        drowning deaths than any other racial group followed by \n        Caucasians and then Hispanics. In approximately 14 percent of \n        the investigated deaths, Spanish was reported to be the spoken \n        language.\n            (4) Only about 10 percent of 5-gallon buckets manufactured \n        annually are voluntarily labeled, and States are beginning to \n        establish their own labeling standards. There is no mandatory \n        Federal labeling standard regarding buckets.\n            (5) To prevent infant drownings in buckets and to assure \n        uniformity in bucket labels and a minimal impact on interstate \n        commerce, it is appropriate to establish a Federal labeling \n        standard.\n            (6) To address the bucket drowning problem in a more \n        permanent way, it is appropriate to establish performance \n        standards.\n\nSEC. 3. LABELING STANDARD REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    Effective 180 days following the date of the enactment of this Act, \nthere is established a consumer product safety standard under section 9 \nof the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058), to eliminate or \nreduce the risk of injury or death resulting from children falling into \n4-gallon to 6-gallon buckets containing liquid. Such standard, when \neffective, shall require straight sided or slightly tapered, open head \ncontainers with a capacity of more than 4 gallons and less than 6 \ngallons (referred to in this Act as a ``bucket''), to bear 2 warning \nlabels, 1 in English and 1 in Spanish. The labels shall meet the \nfollowing requirements:\n            (1) Each label shall be permanent so that such label cannot \n        be removed, torn or defaced without the aid of tools or \n        solvents.\n            (2) Each label shall be at least 7 inches in height, and 5 \n        inches in width, or any larger size as the labeler may choose. \n        The information on the label shall be proportionate to the \n        label's size.\n            (3) A label shall be centered on each side of the bucket \n        just below the point where the handle is inserted. The label on \n        1 side shall be in English and the label on the other side \n        shall be in Spanish.\n            (4) Each label shall have a border or other form of \n        contrast around its edges to delineate it from any other \n        information on the bucket.\n            (5) Each label shall bear (A) the signal word ``WARNING'' \n        in bold uppercase lettering, in black ink, on an orange \n        background, and (B) in upper and lower case lettering in black \n        ink on a white background, the words ``Children Can Fall Into \n        Bucket and Drown--Keep Children Away From Buckets With Even a \n        Small Amount of Liquid''. The signal word panel shall be \n        preceded by a safety alert symbol consisting of an orange \n        exclamation mark on a black triangle.\n            (6) Each label shall include a picture of a child falling \n        into a bucket containing liquid. A red prohibition symbol shall \n        be superimposed over, and totally surround the pictorial. The \n        picture shall be positioned between the signal word panel and \n        the message panel.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS.\n\n    (a) Removal of Label.--Once placed on a bucket pursuant to the \nstandard provided pursuant to section 3, it shall be a prohibited act \nunder section 19 of the Consumer Product Safety Act for any person in \nthe chain of distribution of the bucket to intentionally cover, \nobstruct, tear, deface or remove the label.\n    (b) Consumer Product Safety Standard.--The standard established \npursuant to section 3 of this Act shall be considered a consumer \nproduct safety standard established under the Consumer Product Safety \nAct.\n\nSEC. 5. EXISTING LABELS.\n\n    Any bucket label in use on September 1, 1993, which is \nsubstantially in conformance with the requirements in section 3, may \ncontinue to be used until 12 months after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, buckets subject to \nthis Act must bear both an English and Spanish language label after the \neffective date of the standard established pursuant to section 3.\n\nSEC. 6. AMENDMENTS.\n\n    Section 553 of title 5, United States Code, shall apply with \nrespect to the Consumer Product Safety Commission's issuance of any \namendments or changes to the bucket labeling standard required by \nsection 3 of this Act. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety \nAct shall not apply to such amendments or changes.\n\nSEC. 7. RESPONSIBILITY FOR LABELING.\n\n    (a) Labeling.--The standard established by section 3 requires the \nlabeling of buckets covered by such standard to be the responsibility \nof the manufacturer or distributor of any such bucket without regard to \nwhether or not such bucket is intended for sale by a retailer in an \nempty state for use as a consumer product, or is intended for sale by a \nretailer, together with its contents.\n    (b) Time for Placing Labels.--The required label must be on the \nbucket at the time it is sold or delivered to the end user of the \nbucket's contents or, in the case of a bucket intended to be sold to \nthe public in an empty state, at the time it is shipped to a retailer \nfor sale to the public.\n\nSEC. 8. PERFORMANCE STANDARD.\n\n    Within 30 days following the date of enactment of this Act, the \nCommission shall commence a proceeding under the Consumer Product \nSafety Act for the issuance of a performance standard for buckets to \naddress the drowning hazard associated with this product. Section 553 \nof title 5, United States Code, shall apply with respect to the \nissuance of such standard. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product \nSafety Act shall not apply to the issuance of such standard. Such \nstandard shall take effect at such time as may be prescribed by the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, but in no event later than 180 days \nfollowing the date of the enactment of this Act."
