FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States faces increasing danger related to \n        methamphetamine trafficking, production, and abuse.\n            (2) Methamphetamine is a highly addictive drug that can be \n        readily made from products and precursors purchased from retail \n        stores. Step-by-step recipes can easily be found on the \n        Internet, which is a factor in the dramatic increase in the \n        number of clandestine labs in recent years.\n            (3) Methamphetamine-producing clandestine laboratories have \n        been identified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a \n        significant threat to the Nation's public health and safety. \n        The manufacture of methamphetamine produces highly toxic and \n        unstable chemicals that threaten the well-being of first \n        responders, law enforcement officers, and the community at-\n        large.\n            (4) Methamphetamine production, once exclusively found in \n        West Coast States, has rapidly moved eastward to the Midwest. \n        Production can now be found on the East Coast, in the States of \n        New York and Florida.\n            (5) Methamphetamine abuse is indiscriminate of age, \n        socioeconomic level, or race.\n            (6) Pseudoephedrine is a necessary precursor chemical in \n        the production of methamphetamine, which prompted the Drug \n        Enforcement Administration to initiate investigations regarding \n        the chemical's sale and distribution.\n            (7) Efforts to reduce access to pseudoephedrine by \n        methamphetamine producers, such as blister packaging and sales \n        thresholds, have not been effective deterrents, and \n        pseudoephedrine tablets remain pervasive in the illicit \n        production of methamphetamine.\n            (8) Pseudoephedrine in liquid gel and liquid forms have not \n        been found to be used in methamphetamine production.\n            (9) As States and communities attempt to combat and control \n        methamphetamine through restricting the sale of pseudoephedrine \n        products, it is incumbent upon the Congress to develop a \n        uniform standard for the distribution of pseudoephedrine in \n        tablet form.\n\nSEC. 2. CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES; ADDITION OF EPHEDRINE ALKALOIDS AND \n              PHENYLPROPANOLAMINE TO SCHEDULE V.\n\n    (a) In General.--Effective upon the expiration of 30 days after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, ephedrine alkaloids (including \nephedrine and pseudoephedrine) and phenylpropanolamine, and their \nsalts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers, whether alone or \nin combination with other substances, shall be considered to be listed \nin schedule V of the schedules of controlled substances established \nunder section 202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act, subject to \nsubsection (b) and subject to the authority of the Attorney General \nunder such Act to designate substances as controlled substances or \nlisted chemicals. The Attorney General shall amend part 1308 of title \n21, Code of Federal Regulations, accordingly.\n    (b) Certain Forms of Pseudoephedrine and Phenylpropanolamine.--\nSubject to the authority of the Attorney General under the Controlled \nSubstances Act to designate substances as controlled substances or \nlisted chemicals--\n            (1) subsection (a) does not apply to pseudoephedrine or \n        phenylpropanolamine when contained in a drug that is in liquid \n        or gel form and is marketed or distributed lawfully in the \n        United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; \n        and\n            (2) pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine when so \n        contained shall be considered a listed chemical.\n\nSEC. 3. REGULATION OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING LISTED CHEMICALS; \n              EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN DOSAGE FORMS AND QUANTITIES OF \n              PSEUDOEPHEDRINE OR PHENYLPROPANOLAMINE.\n\n    (a) Definition of Regulated Transaction.--Section 102(39)(A)(iv) of \nthe Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(39)(A)(iv)) is amended--\n            (1) in the matter preceding subclause (I), by striking \n        ``unless--'' and inserting ``unless, subject to clause (v)--''; \n        and\n            (2) in subclause (II)--\n                    (A) by inserting ``in liquid or gel form'' after \n                ``containing pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine \n                products''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``shall be 9 grams of \n                pseudoephedrine or 9 grams of phenylpropanolamine'' and \n                inserting ``shall be any quantity in excess of 9.0 \n                grams of pseudoephedrine or 9.0 grams of \n                phenylpropanolamine''.\n    (b) Definition of Ordinary Over-the-Counter Pseudoephedrine or \nPhenylpropanolamine Product.--Section 102 of the Controlled Substances \nAct (21 U.S.C. 802) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (39)(A)(iv)(I)(aa), by striking ``, except \n        that'' and all that follows through ``1996)''; and\n            (2)(A) by striking paragraph (45); and\n            (B) by redesignating paragraph (46) as paragraph (45).\n    (c) Chemical Mixtures not Easily Used in Illicit Production.--\nSection 102(39)(A)(v) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n802(39)(A)(v)) is amended by inserting after ``chemical mixture'' the \nfollowing: ``(including a mixture that may be marketed or distributed \nlawfully in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act)''."
