FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The people of the United States have long demonstrated \n        an interest in the well-being of the people of Iran, including \n        through the work of missionaries whose work in Iran dates back \n        to the 1830s.\n            (2) Famous Americans such as Howard Baskerville, Dr. Samuel \n        Martin, Jane E. Doolittle, and Louis G. Dreyfus, Jr., made \n        significant contributions to Iranian society by furthering the \n        educational opportunities of the people of Iran and improving \n        the opportunities of the less fortunate citizens of Iran.\n            (3) Iran served as a key ally of the United States \n        following World War II and through the late 1970s serving as an \n        important regional ally and a key bulwark against Soviet \n        influence.\n            (4) In November 1979, following the arrival of Mohammed \n        Reza Shah Pahlavi in the United States, a mob of students and \n        extremists seized the United States Embassy in Tehran, Iran, \n        holding United States diplomatic personnel hostage until \n        January 1981.\n            (5) Following the seizure of the United States Embassy, \n        Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the repressive \n        revolutionary movement in Iran, expressed support for the \n        actions of the students in taking American citizens hostage.\n            (6) Despite the historic victory of Mohammad Khatami in the \n        presidential election of May 1997, an election which Khatami \n        won with 69 percent of the vote and in which an estimated 91 \n        percent of the electorate participated, control of the internal \n        and external affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran is still \n        exercised by the courts in Iran and the Revolutionary Guards, \n        Supreme Leader, and Council of Guardians of the Government of \n        Iran.\n            (7) The election results of the May 1997 election and the \n        high level of voter participation in that election demonstrate \n        that the people of Iran favor economic and political reforms \n        and greater interaction with the United States and the Western \n        world in general.\n            (8) Despite the election of President Khatami and the \n        outreach of the Clinton administration to ease sanctions and to \n        promote people-to-people exchanges, Leader of the Islamic \n        Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Militant Clerics' \n        Society, the Islamic Coalition Organization, and Supporters of \n        the Party of God have all opposed efforts to open Iranian \n        society to Western influences and have opposed efforts to \n        change the dynamic of relations between the United States and \n        Iran.\n            (9) For the past two decades, the Department of State has \n        found Iran to be the leading sponsor of international terrorism \n        in the world.\n            (10) In 1983, the Iran-sponsored Hezbollah terrorist \n        organization conducted suicide terrorist operations against \n        United States military and civilian personnel in Beirut, \n        Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Americans.\n            (11) Intelligence analysts and law enforcement personnel \n        have linked Iran to attacks against American military personnel \n        at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996 and to al Qaeda \n        attacks against civilians in Saudi Arabia in 2004.\n            (12) Iran has provided a safe haven and a base of \n        operations for terrorist groups, including al Qaeda, Islamic \n        Jihad, and Ansar al Islam, and to terrorist leaders, including \n        Abu Musab al Zarkawi, Zayman al Zawahiri, and members of the \n        bin Laden family.\n            (13) Iran currently operates more than 10 radio and \n        television stations broadcasting in Iraq that support violent \n        actions against United States and coalition personnel in Iraq.\n            (14) The current leaders of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \n        and Hashemi Rafsanjani, have repeatedly called upon Muslims to \n        kill Americans in Iraq and install a theocratic regime in Iraq.\n            (15) The United States intelligence community believes the \n        Government of Iran is pursuing a clandestine nuclear weapons \n        program.\n            (16) The Government of Iran has failed to meet repeated \n        pledges to arrest and extradite foreign terrorists in Iran.\n            (17) The United States Government believes that the \n        Government of Iran supports terrorists and extremist religious \n        leaders in Iraq with the clear intention of subverting \n        coalition efforts to bring peace and democracy to Iraq.\n            (18) The Ministry of Defense of Iran confirmed in July 2003 \n        that it had successfully conducted the final test of the \n        Shahab-3 missile, giving Iran an operational intermediate-range \n        ballistic missile capable of striking both Israel and United \n        States troops throughout the Middle East and Afghanistan.\n\nSEC. 3.
