FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States spends more per capita on health care \n        than any other nation, and yet it has mediocre health outcomes, \n        including the second-highest infant mortality rate of all \n        industrialized nations.\n            (2) The efficacy of best practices guidelines in improving \n        health care delivery and patient outcomes is well established.\n            (3) Existing payment systems compensate physicians without \n        adequate attention to the appropriateness or quality of care \n        delivered and often without reference to established best \n        practices.\n            (4) Identification of and adherence to best practices can \n        improve the quality of health care while reducing overall costs \n        to the health care system.\n            (5) Orderly administrative proceedings involving \n        knowledgeable professionals will enhance best practices for \n        health care.\n            (6) Control of medical practices through denial of claims \n        by insurance companies has proven wasteful and confusing, and \n        has failed to motivate adequate development and use of best \n        practices for health care.\n\nSEC. 3. VOLUNTARY STATE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF QUALIFYING BEST \n              PRACTICES; INCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE INSURERS.\n\n    (a) State Approval of Best Practices.--\n            (1) In general.--A State health department may approve best \n        practices in a course of, or as a means of treatment for, a \n        particular condition, illness, or procedure, as the qualifying \n        standard of care for the State in order to take advantage of \n        the differential rates of payment implemented under sections \n        1898 and 1902(dd) of the Social Security Act (as added by \n        sections 4 and 5, respectively) and the private insurance \n        incentive under subsection (b).\n            (2) Qualifying process for state approval.--In order for \n        best practices approved by a State under paragraph (1) to \n        qualify as best practices for purposes of implementing such \n        differential rates of payment and for purposes of such private \n        insurance incentive, a State health department shall--\n                    (A) allow any duly constituted State medical \n                society or medical specialty group to file with the \n                State health department a course or means of treatment \n                representing best practices for a particular condition, \n                illness, or procedure to be applicable in the State, \n                including cost-effective prevention and management \n                measures;\n                    (B) provide for notice and hearing consistent with \n                the administrative procedures of the State with respect \n                to the approval of best practices for a particular \n                condition, illness, or procedure;\n                    (C) permit any health insurer described in \n                subsection (b)(1), including any individual authorized \n                by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to act as \n                a representative of the Medicare and Medicaid programs \n                under titles XVIII and XIX, respectively, of the Social \n                Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.; 1396 et seq.), to \n                intervene in any administrative proceeding to approve \n                such best practices;\n                    (D) provide appropriate notice of any such \n                administrative proceeding to established advocacy \n                groups concerned with the condition or illness involved \n                in the proceeding; and\n                    (E) in the case where the State health department \n                determines that a course of treatment filed in \n                accordance with subparagraph (A) would lower system \n                costs and improve quality of care, approve that best \n                practices course of treatment within its jurisdiction \n                as the qualifying standard of care under this \n                subsection for that condition, illness, or procedure.\n            (3) Priority of approvals.--State health departments are \n        encouraged to prioritize approval of best practices that \n        address conditions, illnesses, or procedures where those best \n        practices are reasonably anticipated to result in the greatest \n        overall cost savings and quality improvements.\n            (4) Approval of qualifying best practices.--If, at the \n        conclusion of a process that meets the requirements of \n        paragraph (2), the State health department approves best \n        practices (as described in paragraph (1)), those best practices \n        shall be--\n                    (A) deemed qualifying best practices;\n                    (B) the basis for differential rates of payment \n                under sections 1898 and 1902(dd) of the Social Security \n                Act (as added by sections 4 and 5, respectively); and\n                    (C) eligible for the private insurance incentive \n                under subsection (b).\n            (5) Definition of state.--In this subsection the term \n        ``State'' includes such regional or local areas as the State \n        health department determines appropriate.\n    (b) Incentive for Private Insurers To Provide Timely Payment for \nServices Provided in Accordance With Best Practices.--\n            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n        law, in the case where qualifying best practices have been \n        approved by a State health department in accordance with \n        subsection (a), any health insurer doing business in interstate \n        commerce and providing health care coverage within the State \n        shall pay all provider charges for any service provided in \n        accordance with such best practices not later than 30 days \n        after the date on which such service is provided and, absent \n        fraud, without regard for the insurer's internal utilization \n        review or claims denial procedure.\n            (2) Standing to enforce.--Any provider or specialty group \n        that does business in a State where the State health department \n        has approved qualifying best practices in accordance with \n        subsection (a) may bring a civil action in an appropriate \n        United States district court to enjoin efforts by any health \n        insurer to challenge or delay payment for services provided by \n        the provider or a member of the specialty group in accordance \n        with such best practices approved in the State. The district \n        court shall award a provider or specialty group costs and \n        attorney's fees in such a civil action if the court finds that \n        the challenge or delay was a willful violation of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
