    "content": "Key equatorial climate phenomena such as QBO and ENSO have never been adequately explained as deterministic processes. This in spite of recent research showing growing evidence of predictable behavior. This study applies the fundamental Laplace tidal equations with simplifying assumptions along the equator \u2014 i.e. no Coriolis force and a small angle approximation. The solutions to the partial differential equations are highly non-linear related to Navier-Stokes and only search approaches can be used to fit to the data."
