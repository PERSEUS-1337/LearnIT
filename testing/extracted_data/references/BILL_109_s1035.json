FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Sioux Indians used their native languages, Dakota, \n        Lakota, and Dakota Sioux, as code during World War II;\n            (2) those individuals, who manned radio communications \n        networks to advise of enemy actions, became known as the Sioux \n        Code Talkers;\n            (3) under some of the heaviest combat action, the Code \n        Talkers worked around the clock to provide information that \n        saved the lives of many Americans in war theaters in the \n        Pacific and Europe, such as the location of enemy troops and \n        the number of enemy guns; and\n            (4) the Sioux Code Talkers were so successful that military \n        commanders credit the code with saving the lives of countless \n        American soldiers and being instrumental to the success of the \n        United States in many battles during World War II.\n\nSEC. 102. CONGRESSIONAL COMMEMORATIVE MEDAL.\n\n    The President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives shall make appropriate arrangements for the \npresentation, on behalf of Congress, of a commemorative medal of \nappropriate design, to each Sioux Code Talker, including--\n            (1) Eddie Eagle Boy;\n            (2) Simon Brokenleg;\n            (3) Iver Crow Eagle, Sr.;\n            (4) Edmund St. John;\n            (5) Walter C.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on \n        December 7, 1941, and Congress declared war on Japan the \n        following day;\n            (2) the military code developed by the United States for \n        transmitting messages had been deciphered by the Axis powers, \n        and United States military intelligence sought to develop a new \n        means to counter the enemy;\n            (3) the Federal Government called on the Comanche Nation to \n        support the military effort by recruiting and enlisting \n        Comanche men to serve in the United States Army to develop a \n        secret code based on the Comanche language;\n            (4) at the time, the Comanches were--\n                    (A) considered to be second-class citizens; and\n                    (B) discouraged from using their own language;\n            (5) the Comanches of the 4th Signal Division became known \n        as the ``Comanche Code Talkers'' and helped to develop a code \n        using their language to communicate military messages during \n        the D-Day invasion and in the European theater during World War \n        II;\n            (6) to the frustration of the enemy, the code developed by \n        those Native Americans--\n                    (A) proved to be unbreakable; and\n                    (B) was used extensively throughout the European \n                war theater;\n            (7) the Comanche language, discouraged in the past, was \n        instrumental in developing 1 of the most significant and \n        successful military codes of World War II;\n            (8) the efforts of the Comanche Code Talkers--\n                    (A) contributed greatly to the Allied war effort in \n                Europe;\n                    (B) were instrumental in winning the war in Europe; \n                and\n                    (C) saved countless lives;\n            (9) only 1 of the Comanche Code Talkers of World War II \n        remains alive today; and\n            (10) the time has come for Congress to honor the Comanche \n        Code Talkers for their valor and service to the United States.\n\nSEC. 202. CONGRESSIONAL COMMEMORATIVE MEDAL.\n\n    The President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives shall make appropriate arrangements for the \npresentation, on behalf of Congress, of a commemorative medal of \nappropriate design to each of the following Comanche Code Talkers of \nWorld War II, in recognition of contributions of those individuals to \nthe United States:\n            (1) Charles Chibitty.\n            (2) Haddon Codynah.\n            (3) Robert Holder.\n            (4) Forrest Kassanovoid.\n            (5) Willington Mihecoby.\n            (6) Perry Noyebad.\n            (7) Clifford Otitivo.\n            (8) Simmons Parker.\n            (9) Melvin Permansu.\n            (10) Dick Red Elk.\n            (11) Elgin Red Elk.\n            (12) Larry Saupitty.\n            (13) Morris Sunrise.\n            (14) Willie Yackeschi.\n\n                    TITLE III--CHOCTAW CODE TALKERS\n\nSEC. 301. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) on April 6, 1917, the United States, after \n        extraordinary provocations, declared war on Germany and entered \n        World War I, the War to End All Wars;\n            (2) at the time of that declaration of war, Indian people \n        in the United States, including members of the Choctaw Nation, \n        were not accorded the status of citizens of the United States;\n            (3) without regard to this lack of citizenship, many \n        members of the Choctaw Nation joined many members of other \n        Indian tribes and nations in enlisting in the Armed Forces to \n        fight on behalf of the United States;\n            (4) members of the Choctaw Nation were--\n                    (A) enlisted in the force known as the American \n                Expeditionary Force, which began hostile actions in \n                France in the fall of 1917; and\n                    (B) incorporated in a company of Indian enlistees \n                serving in the 142d Infantry Company of the 36th \n                Division;\n            (5) a major impediment to Allied operations in general, and \n        operations of the United States in particular, was the fact \n        that the German forces had deciphered all codes used for \n        transmitting information between Allied commands, leading to \n        substantial loss of men and materiel during the first year in \n        which the military of the United States engaged in combat in \n        World War I;\n            (6) because of the proximity and static nature of the \n        battle lines, a method to communicate without the knowledge of \n        the enemy was needed;\n            (7) a commander of the United States realized the fact that \n        he had under his command a number of men who spoke a native \n        language;\n            (8) while the use of such native languages was discouraged \n        by the Federal Government, the commander sought out and \n        recruited 18 Choctaw Indians to assist in transmitting field \n        telephone communications during an upcoming campaign;\n            (9) because the language used by the Choctaw soldiers in \n        the transmission of information was not based on a European \n        language or on a mathematical progression, the Germans were \n        unable to understand any of the transmissions;\n            (10) the Choctaw soldiers were placed in different command \n        positions to achieve the widest practicable area for \n        communications;\n            (11) the use of the Choctaw Code Talkers was particularly \n        important in--\n                    (A) the movement of American soldiers in October of \n                1918 (including securing forward and exposed \n                positions);\n                    (B) the protection of supplies during American \n                action (including protecting gun emplacements from \n                enemy shelling); and\n                    (C) in the preparation for the assault on German \n                positions in the final stages of combat operations in \n                the fall of 1918;\n            (12) in the opinion of the officers involved, the use of \n        Choctaw Indians to transmit information in their native \n        language saved men and munitions, and was highly successful;\n            (13) based on that successful experience, Choctaw Indians \n        were withdrawn from frontline units for training in \n        transmission of codes so as to be more widely used when the war \n        came to an end;\n            (14) the Germans never succeeded in breaking the Choctaw \n        code;\n            (15) that was the first time in modern warfare that the \n        transmission of messages in a Native American language was used \n        for the purpose of confusing the enemy;\n            (16) this action by members of the Choctaw Nation--\n                    (A) is another example of the commitment of Native \n                Americans to the defense of the United States; and\n                    (B) adds to the proud legacy of such service; and\n            (17) the Choctaw Nation has honored the actions of those 18 \n        Choctaw Code Talkers through a memorial bearing their names \n        located at the entrance of the tribal complex in Durant, \n        Oklahoma.\n\nSEC. 302.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Sac and Fox Indians used their native language, \n        Meskwaki, to transmit military code during Word War II;\n            (2) those individuals, who manned radio communications \n        networks to advise of enemy actions, became known as the Sac \n        and Fox Code Talkers; and\n            (3) under heavy combat action, the Code Talkers worked \n        without sleep to provide information that saved the lives of \n        many Americans.\n\nSEC. 402. CONGRESSIONAL COMMEMORATIVE MEDAL.\n\n    The President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives shall make appropriate arrangements for the \npresentation, on behalf of Congress, of a commemorative medal of \nappropriate design, to each of the following Sac and Fox Code Talkers \nof World War II, in recognition of the contributions of those \nindividuals to the United States:\n            (1) Frank Sanache.\n            (2) Willard Sanache.\n            (3) Dewey Youngbear.\n            (4) Edward Benson.\n            (5) Judie Wayne Wabaunasee.\n            (6) Mike Wayne Wabaunasee.\n            (7) Dewey Roberts.\n            (8) Melvin Twin.\n\n                      TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSEC. 501.
