FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) After World War II, the United States established a \n        program to provide for the reconstruction of Europe, named \n        after General George C. Marshall and commonly referred to as \n        the ``Marshall Plan'', which made a significant contribution to \n        the stimulation of economic growth and international trade in \n        Europe from 1948 to 1951, thereby helping to stem the spread of \n        Communism and to foster stable political governments in Europe.\n            (2) By providing assistance to Europe through the Marshall \n        Plan, the United States recognized the direct link between \n        economic growth and political stability, thereby investing \n        resources into economic development and assistance.\n            (3) The Marshall Plan is chiefly characterized by its \n        integration of recipients into the development process, forming \n        a partnership whereby European countries agreed to a ``plan of \n        action'' that committed Europe to take steps toward solution of \n        its economic and political problems prior to the formulation of \n        a program of assistance.\n            (4) On April 17, 2002, President Bush stated in a speech at \n        the Virginia Military Institute (VMI): ``[General] Marshall \n        knew that our military victory against enemies in World War II \n        had to be followed by a moral victory that resulted in better \n        lives for individual human beings. America has a much greater \n        purpose than just eliminating threats and containing \n        resentment. Because we believe in the dignity and value of \n        every individual, America seeks hope and opportunity for all \n        people in all cultures.''.\n            (5) A principal objective of United States foreign \n        assistance programs, as stated in the Foreign Assistance Act of \n        1961, continues to be the ``encouragement and sustained support \n        of the people of developing countries in their efforts to \n        acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development \n        and to build the economic, political, and social institutions \n        which will improve the quality of their lives.''.\n            (6) Significant poverty, corruption, and human rights \n        abuses in many countries of Eurasia and the Middle East \n        contribute to the political and economic deterioration of those \n        regions.\n            (7) The potential resources of many countries of Eurasia \n        and the Middle East are rich and plentiful and can be developed \n        in peace and in partnership through cooperation and mutual \n        assistance.\n            (8) The attacks against the United States that occurred on \n        September 11, 2001, and the subsequent global war on terrorism, \n        have enhanced United States strategic concern for the economic \n        and political future of countries of Eurasia and the Middle \n        East.\n            (9) United States foreign assistance programs continue to \n        influence the direction of the Central Asia, Eurasia, and \n        Middle East regions.\n            (10) In 1972, the United Nations voted to recommend that \n        developed countries should contribute an amount equal to 0.7 \n        percent of their gross domestic product for assistance to \n        developing countries, however, the United States currently \n        provides an amount equal to only 0.1 percent of its gross \n        domestic product for assistance to developing countries.\n            (11) The magnitude of the economic, humanitarian, and \n        political challenges in the Eurasia and Middle East regions is \n        extensive and demands consistent and enhanced input and \n        assistance from the United States, particularly through the \n        United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as \n        well as extensive coordination with other appropriate United \n        States agencies and international donor organizations, in order \n        to effectively implement development assistance and effectively \n        eliminate the causes of terrorism in these regions.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to enhance and increase United States foreign \n        assistance to the developing countries of Eurasia and the \n        Middle East; and\n            (2) to assist such countries of Eurasia and the Middle East \n        to grow, prosper, and to seize the opportunities of the global \n        economy in order to achieve transparent, accountable, and \n        politically stable democratic forms of government in such \n        countries.\n\nSEC. 3.
