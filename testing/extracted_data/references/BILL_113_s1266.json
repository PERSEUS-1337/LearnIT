FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is approximately $1,100,000,000,000 of \n        outstanding student loan debt in the United States, including \n        more than $150,000,000,000 in private education loans;\n            (2) as of 2008, 81 percent of individuals graduating with \n        an undergraduate degree with more than $40,000 in student loans \n        had a private education loan;\n            (3) the limited number of lenders in the private education \n        loan marketplace reduce the ability of borrowers with private \n        education loans to restructure, refinance, or negotiate \n        repayment terms for their current loans, leading to excessive \n        debt burdens and potential default; and\n            (4) excessive student indebtedness reduces economic \n        activity, threatens homeownership, hurts small business growth, \n        and limits opportunities for economic expansion in rural \n        communities.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to spur economic growth, \nby establishing a mechanism to allow borrowers of private education \nloans to refinance their loans in order--\n            (1) to facilitate greater competition in the private \n        education lending and refinancing markets;\n            (2) to address inefficiencies in the private education \n        lending and refinancing markets;\n            (3) to encourage innovation in the private education \n        refinancing markets; and\n            (4) to promote the participation of private capital in the \n        private education refinancing markets.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the term ``private education loan'' has the same \n        meaning as in section 140(a) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 \n        U.S.C. 1650(a)); and\n            (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n        Treasury, other than in the context of the Secretary of \n        Education.\n\nSEC. 4.

and\n                                    (II) reduce the likelihood of \n                                delinquency and default on private \n                                education loans;\n                            (ii) benefit borrowers that are most likely \n                        to have private student debt service \n                        obligations that represent a disproportionate \n                        share of their income; and\n                            (iii) ensure that borrowers pay lower \n                        interest rates that are commensurate with \n                        credit risk, so that they may pursue more \n                        economically productive activities, such as \n                        home purchases and small business formation.\n                    (B) Consultation.--\n                            (i) In general.--Any determination under \n                        subparagraph (A) shall be made jointly with the \n                        Secretary of Education and the Director of the \n                        Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.\n                            (ii) Compliance system.--Prior to \n                        establishing a facility under this subsection, \n                        the Secretary, or any administrator designated \n                        by the Secretary to establish a program to \n                        carry out the authority provided in this \n                        subsection, shall establish a compliance system \n                        in consultation with the Bureau of Consumer \n                        Financial Protection.\n            (2) No net cost to government.--Mechanisms established \n        under this subsection shall not result in any net cost to the \n        Federal Government, as determined jointly by the Secretary, the \n        Secretary of Education, and the Director of the Office of \n        Management and Budget.\n    (b) Federal Register Notice.--Prior to exercising any authority \nprovided under subsection (a), the Secretary shall publish a notice in \nthe Federal Register to seek comment from interested parties on its \nproposed exercise of such authority, including--\n            (1) the terms and conditions governing the lending, \n        purchases, or other credit facilities authorized by subsection \n        (a);\n            (2) an outline of methodology and factors considered in the \n        purchase or restructuring of private education loans;\n            (3) private education loan modification options that may be \n        available for existing loans;\n            (4) how they will ensure that borrowers whose education \n        debt service obligations represent a disproportionate share of \n        their income will be provided relief; and\n            (5) how the use of the methodology and factors, as proposed \n        in the notice, will be used to ensure that any exercise of \n        authority by the Secretary will result in no net cost to the \n        Federal Government.\n    (c) Initial Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress a report that includes--\n            (1) a plan of the Secretary to implement credit mechanisms \n        under the authority of this Act;\n            (2) a description of macroeconomic benefits of increased \n        efficiency and refinance activity in the student loan market;
