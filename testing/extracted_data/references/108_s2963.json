    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Local Control of Broadcast Towers \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The placement, construction, and modification of \n        broadcast transmission facilities near residential communities \n        and facilities such as schools can greatly reduce the value of \n        residential properties, destroy the views from properties, \n        produce radio frequency interference, raise concerns about \n        potential long-term health effects of such facilities, and \n        reduce substantially the desire to live in the areas of such \n        facilities.\n            (2) States and local governments have traditionally \n        regulated development and should be able to exercise control \n        over the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast \n        transmission facilities through the use of zoning and other \n        land use regulations relating to the protection of the \n        environment, public health and safety, and the general welfare \n        of the community and the public.\n            (3) The Federal Communications Commission establishes \n        policies to govern interstate and international communications \n        by television, radio, wire, satellite, and cable. The \n        Commission ensures compliance of such activities with \n        applicable Federal laws, including the National Environmental \n        Policy Act of 1969 and the National Historic Preservation Act, \n        in its decision-making on such activities.\n            (4) The Commission defers to State and local authorities \n        which regulate the placement, construction, and modification of \n        broadcast transmission facilities through the use of zoning, \n        construction and building, and environmental and safety \n        regulations in order to protect the environment and the health, \n        safety, and general welfare of communities and the public.\n            (5) On August 19, 1997, the Commission issued a proposed \n        rule, MM Docket No. 97-182, which would preempt the application \n        of most State and local zoning, environmental, construction and \n        building, and other regulations affecting the placement, \n        construction, and modification of broadcast transmission \n        facilities.\n            (6) The telecommunications industry and its experts should \n        be expected to have access to the best and most recent \n        technical information and should therefore be held to the \n        highest standards in terms of their representations, \n        assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to confirm that State and \nlocal governments are the appropriate entities--\n            (1) to regulate the placement, construction, and \n        modification of broadcast transmission facilities consistent \n        with State and local zoning, construction and building, \n        environmental, and land use regulations;\n            (2) to regulate the placement, construction, and \n        modification of broadcast transmission facilities so that their \n        placement, construction, or modification will not interfere \n        with the safe and efficient use of public airspace or otherwise \n        compromise or endanger the health, safety, and general welfare \n        of the public; and\n            (3) to hold accountable applicants for permits for the \n        placement, construction, or modification of broadcast \n        transmission facilities, and providers of services using such \n        facilities, for the truthfulness and accuracy of \n        representations and statements placed in the record of hearings \n        for such permits, licenses, or approvals.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON ADOPTION OF RULE REGARDING PREEMPTION OF STATE \n              AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER BROADCAST TRANSMISSION \n              FACILITIES.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal \nCommunications Commission shall not adopt as a final rule or otherwise \ndirectly or indirectly implement any portion of the proposed rule set \nforth in ``Preemption of State and Local Zoning and Land Use \nRestrictions on Siting, Placement and Construction of Broadcast Station \nTransmission Facilities'', MM Docket No. 97-182, released August 19, \n1997.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF \n              BROADCAST TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.\n\n    Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 340. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND \n              MODIFICATION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.\n\n    ``(a) Authority To Require Least Intrusive Facilities.--\n            ``(1) In general.--A State or local government may deny an \n        application to place, construct, or modify broadcast \n        transmission facilities on the basis that alternative \n        technologies, delivery systems, or structures are capable of \n        delivering broadcast signals comparable to that proposed to be \n        delivered by such facilities in a manner that is less intrusive \n        to the community concerned than such facilities.\n            ``(2) Considerations.--In determining under paragraph (1) \n        the intrusiveness of technologies, delivery systems, or \n        structures for the transmission of broadcast signals, a State \n        or local government may  consider the aesthetics of such \ntechnologies, systems, or structures, the environmental impact of such \ntechnologies, systems, or structures, and the radio frequency \ninterference or radiation emitted by such technologies, systems, or \nstructures.\n            ``(3) Burden of proof.--In any hearing for purposes of the \n        exercise of the authority in paragraph (1), the burden shall be \n        on the applicant.\n    ``(b) Radio Interference.--A State or local government may regulate \nthe location, height, or modification of broadcast transmission \nfacilities in order to address the effects of radio frequency \ninterference caused by such facilities on local communities and the \npublic.\n    ``(c) Authority To Require Studies and Documentation.--No provision \nof this Act may be interpreted to prohibit a State or local government \nfrom--\n            ``(1) requiring a person seeking authority to place, \n        construct, or modify broadcast transmission facilities to \n        produce--\n                    ``(A) environmental, biological, and health \n                studies, engineering reports, or other documentation of \n                the compliance of such facilities with radio frequency \n                exposure limits, radio frequency interference impacts, \n                and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and \n                regulations governing the effects of such facilities on \n                the environment, public health and safety, and the \n                general welfare of the community and the public; and\n                    ``(B) documentation of the compliance of such \n                facilities with applicable Federal, State, and local \n                aviation safety standards or aviation obstruction \n                standards regarding objects effecting navigable \n                airspace; or\n            ``(2) refusing to grant authority to such person to place, \n        construct, or modify such facilities within the jurisdiction of \n        such government if such person fails to produce studies, \n        reports, or documentation required under paragraph (1).\n    ``(d) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed to \nprohibit or otherwise limit the authority of a State or local \ngovernment to ensure compliance with or otherwise enforce any \nstatements, assertions, or representations filed or submitted by or on \nbehalf of an applicant with the State or local government for authority \nto place, construct, or modify broadcast transmission facilities within \nthe jurisdiction of the State or local government.\n    ``(e) Broadcast Transmission Facility Defined.--In this section, \nthe term `broadcast transmission facility' means the equipment, or any \nportion thereof, with which a broadcaster transmits and receives the \nradiofrequency waves that carry the services of the broadcaster, \nregardless of whether the equipment is sited on one or more towers or \nother structures owned by a person or entity other than the \nbroadcaster, and includes the location of such equipment.''."
