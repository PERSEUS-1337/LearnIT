FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The National Security Strategy of the United States, \n        dated September 17, 2002, concludes that ``[i]n Africa, promise \n        and opportunity sit side-by-side with disease, war, and \n        desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the \n        United States preserving human dignity and our strategic \n        priority combating global terror. American interests and \n        American principles, therefore, lead in the same direction: we \n        will work with others for an African continent that lives in \n        liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.''.\n            (2) On March 19, 2002, the Director of the Central \n        Intelligence Agency testified that ``[t]he chronic problems of \n        sub-Saharan Africa make it, too, fertile ground for direct and \n        indirect threats to United States interests. Governments \n        without accountability and natural disasters have left Africa \n        with the highest concentration of human misery in the world''.\n            (3) The United Nations World Food Programme reports that \n        there is an unprecedented hunger crisis on the African \n        continent where approximately 38,000,000 people face \n        starvation.\n            (4) The scale of the humanitarian crisis in sub-Saharan \n        Africa has grown dramatically and there has been an average \n        increase of 30 percent in commodity prices since the President \n        submitted a budget request for food aid and other humanitarian \n        assistance for fiscal year 2003.\n            (5) A trip report prepared by a congressional delegation \n        that traveled to Ethiopia and Eritrea from December 29, 2002 to \n        January 4, 2003 stated that ``the U.S. Government will need to \n        do more to avert a disaster of biblical proportions . . . \n        Donors, including the United States, must make prompt and \n        significant food-aid pledges to help Ethiopia overcome its \n        current crisis.''.\n            (6) At a United Nations Security Council meeting on March \n        12, 2002, concerning the food crisis in Africa, the United \n        States representative stated that adequate levels of assistance \n        must be provided immediately to avert disaster in sub-Saharan \n        Africa.\n            (7) On December 6, 2002, the United States Agency for \n        International Development reported that ``[a] number of \n        Southern African countries are currently experiencing food \n        security crises, due to a combination of adverse climate \n        conditions for two consecutive growing seasons, mismanagement \n        of grain reserves, and restrictive government policies that \n        severely inhibit private sector commerce''.\n            (8) The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports \n        that the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa, affecting 29,400,000 \n        people, has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis by reducing \n        agricultural productivity and food security, undercutting \n        people's ability to recover and contributing to long-term \n        poverty.\n            (9) The HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, which \n        strikes at working adults involved in agricultural production, \n        is a major component of this crisis.\n\nSEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) effectively addressing the famine in sub-Saharan Africa \n        is in the national security interests of the United States;\n            (2) the President should immediately submit a request for \n        emergency supplemental appropriations to Congress for food aid \n        and other humanitarian assistance to reach vulnerable \n        populations living in poverty in sub-Saharan Africa;\n            (3) the President should immediately consult with the \n        chairmen and ranking members of the Committee on Agriculture, \n        Nutrition, and Forestry, the Committee on Appropriations, and \n        the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \n        Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on Appropriations, and \n        the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n        Representatives to formulate a legislative strategy to address \n        the immediate and long-term needs caused by the humanitarian \n        crisis in sub-Saharan Africa; and\n            (4) the United States should engage in direct talks with \n        members of the European Union and other appropriate nations to \n        increase the amount of contributions from other nations to sub-\n        Saharan Africa.\n\nSEC. 103.
