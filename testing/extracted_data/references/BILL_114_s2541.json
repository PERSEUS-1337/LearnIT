FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) as of February 2016--\n                    (A) the global illicit trade in wildlife is \n                estimated to be worth up to $20,000,000,000 annually; \n                and\n                    (B) the legal wildlife trade in the United States \n                was estimated to have a value of $2,800,000,000 \n                annually;\n            (2) the illegal trade in prohibited wildlife species (as \n        defined in section 2 of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 \n        U.S.C. 3371)) stimulates demand and expands markets in which \n        prohibited wildlife species are sold illegally;\n            (3) private possession, breeding, and sale of prohibited \n        wildlife species have substantial and detrimental effects on--\n                    (A) the health and general welfare of the people of \n                the United States; and\n                    (B) the conservation of the prohibited wildlife \n                species;\n            (4) the private possession and breeding of prohibited \n        wildlife species has a substantial and direct effect on \n        interstate commerce because prohibited wildlife species are \n        often--\n                    (A) bred and possessed--\n                            (i) for use in public exhibition; or\n                            (ii) for sale or transfer of ownership in \n                        the exotic pet trade; and\n                    (B) transported in interstate commerce for the \n                activities described in subparagraph (A);\n            (5) the private possession and breeding of prohibited \n        wildlife species contributes to interstate trafficking in \n        prohibited wildlife species and may contribute to the \n        international illegal trade in prohibited wildlife species;\n            (6) prohibited wildlife species in private possession and \n        prohibited wildlife species that are subject to intrastate \n        distribution are fungible commodities that cannot be \n        differentiated, for purposes of control, from prohibited \n        wildlife species that are subject to interstate distribution;\n            (7) it is exceedingly difficult to distinguish between--\n                    (A) prohibited wildlife species that have been \n                possessed, bred, sold, or transported in interstate \n                commerce; and\n                    (B) prohibited wildlife species that have not been \n                possessed, bred, sold, or transported in interstate \n                commerce;\n            (8) Federal control of intrastate private possession and \n        breeding of prohibited wildlife species is essential to the \n        effective control of interstate trafficking in prohibited \n        wildlife species; and\n            (9) the United States is a party to the Convention on \n        International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and \n        Flora, done at Washington March 3, 1973 (27 UST 1087; TIAS \n        8249), which was designed to protect species of wild fauna and \n        flora from exploitation through international trade.\n\nSEC. 3.
