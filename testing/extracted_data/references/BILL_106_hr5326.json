FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since the enactment of mandatory minimum sentencing for \n        drug users, the Federal Bureau of Prisons budget has increased \n        by more than 1,350 percent, from $220,000,000 in 1986 to about \n        $3,019,000,000 in 1997.\n            (2) Mandatory minimums have not reduced sentencing \n        discretion, but rather have transferred discretion from judges \n        to prosecutors. Prosecutors, not judges, have the discretion to \n        drop or pursue a charge, offer or withhold a plea bargain, \n        reward or deny a defendant's substantial assistance or \n        cooperation in the prosecution of someone else, and ultimately, \n        to determine the final sentence of the defendant.\n            (3) African Americans comprise 12 percent of the United \n        States population, 15 percent of drug users, 17 percent of \n        cocaine users, but 33 percent of all Federal drug convictions \n        and 57 percent of Federal cocaine convictions.\n            (4) In 1986, before the mandatory minimums for crack \n        cocaine offenses became effective, the average Federal prison \n        sentence for African Americans was 11 percent higher than for \n        whites. Following the implementation of mandatory drug \n        sentencing laws, the average drug offense sentence for African \n        Americans was 49 percent higher than whites.\n            (5) The average dealer holds a low-wage job and sells part \n        time to obtain drugs for his or her own use.\n            (6) According to a 1999 Justice Department report, the \n        amount of time spent in prison does not affect recidivism \n        rates.\n\nSEC. 102. APPROVAL OF CERTAIN PROSECUTIONS BY ATTORNEY GENERAL.\n\n    A Federal prosecution for an offense under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, or for \nany conspiracy to commit such an offense, where the offense involves \nthe illegal distribution or possession of a controlled substance in an \namount less than that amount specified as a minimum for an offense \nunder section 401(b)(1)(A) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n841(b)(1)(A)) or, in the case of any substance containing cocaine or \ncocaine base, in an amount less than 500 grams, shall not be commenced \nwithout the prior written approval of the Attorney General.\n\nSEC. 103.
