    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Compact-Impact Reimbursement Act of \n2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In approving the Compact of Free Association it was not \n        the intent of Congress to cause adverse consequences for Guam, \n        American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n        Islands, or the State of Hawaii.\n            (2) Congress declared that if any adverse consequences to \n        Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n        Islands, or the State of Hawaii resulted from implementation of \n        the Compact of Free Association, Congress would act \n        sympathetically and expeditiously to redress those adverse \n        consequences.\n            (3) The Government Accountability Office has reported that \n        migration from the Freely Associated States has had a \n        significant impact on Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern \n        Mariana Islands, and the State of Hawaii.\n            (4) By placing demands on local governments for health, \n        educational, and other social services, migration under the \n        Compact has adversely affected the budgetary resources of Guam, \n        the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the State \n        of Hawaii.\n            (5) Insufficient sums have been appropriated to cover the \n        costs incurred by Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern \n        Mariana Islands, and the State of Hawaii, resulting from \n        increased demands placed on health, educational, and other \n        social services by individuals from the Federated States of \n        Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the \n        Republic of Palau.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to address the unfunded \nmandate and adverse financial consequences resulting from the Compact \nby meeting the obligations set forth in the Compact.\n\nSEC. 3.
