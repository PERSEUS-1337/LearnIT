    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Pro bono Work to Empower and \nRepresent Act of 2018'' or the ``POWER Act''.\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) Extremely high rates of domestic violence, dating violence, \n    sexual assault, and stalking exist at the local, State, tribal, and \n    national levels and such violence or behavior harms the most \n    vulnerable members of our society.\n        (2) According to a study commissioned by the Department of \n    Justice, nearly 25 percent of women suffer from domestic violence \n    during their lifetime.\n        (3) Proactive efforts should be made available in all forums to \n    provide pro bono legal services and eliminate the violence that \n    destroys lives and shatters families.\n        (4) A variety of factors cause domestic violence, dating \n    violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and a variety of solutions \n    at the local, State, and national levels are necessary to combat \n    such violence or behavior.\n        (5) According to the National Network to End Domestic Violence, \n    which conducted a census including almost 1,700 assistance \n    programs, over the course of 1 day in September 2014, more than \n    10,000 requests for services, including legal representation, were \n    not met.\n        (6) Pro bono assistance can help fill this need by providing \n    not only legal representation, but also access to emergency \n    shelter, transportation, and childcare.\n        (7) Research and studies have demonstrated that the provision \n    of legal assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating \n    violence, sexual assault, and stalking reduces the probability of \n    such violence or behavior reoccurring in the future and can help \n    survivors move forward.\n        (8) Legal representation increases the possibility of \n    successfully obtaining a protective order against an attacker, \n    which prevents further mental and physical injury to a victim and \n    his or her family, as demonstrated by a study that found that 83 \n    percent of victims represented by an attorney were able to obtain a \n    protective order, whereas only 32 percent of victims without an \n    attorney were able to do so.\n        (9) The American Bar Association Model Rules include commentary \n    stating that ``every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence \n    or professional workload, has a responsibility to provide legal \n    services to those unable to pay, and personal involvement in the \n    problems of the disadvantaged can be one of the most rewarding \n    experiences in the life of a lawyer''.\n        (10) As leaders in their legal communities, judges in district \n    courts should encourage lawyers to provide pro bono resources in an \n    effort to help victims of such violence or behavior escape the \n    cycle of abuse.\n        (11) A dedicated army of pro bono attorneys focused on this \n    mission will inspire others to devote efforts to this cause and \n    will raise awareness of the scourge of domestic violence, dating \n    violence, sexual assault, and stalking throughout the country.\n        (12) Communities, by providing awareness of pro bono legal \n    services and assistance to survivors of domestic violence, dating \n    violence, sexual assault, and stalking, will empower those \n    survivors to move forward with their lives.\nSEC. 3. DISTRICT COURTS TO PROMOTE EMPOWERMENT EVENTS.\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, and annually thereafter for a period of 4 years, the chief \njudge, or his or her designee, for each judicial district shall lead \nnot less than one public event, in partnership with a State, local, \ntribal, or territorial domestic violence service provider or coalition \nand a State or local volunteer lawyer project, promoting pro bono legal \nservices as a critical way in which to empower survivors of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking and engage \ncitizens in assisting those survivors.\n    (b) Districts Containing Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations.--\nDuring each 2-year period, the chief judge, or his or her designee, for \na judicial district that contains an Indian tribe or tribal \norganization (as those terms are defined in section 4 of the Indian \nSelf-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304)) shall \nlead not less than one public event promoting pro bono legal services \nunder subsection (a) of this section in partnership with an Indian \ntribe or tribal organization with the intent of increasing the \nprovision of pro bono legal services for Indian or Alaska Native \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking.\n    (c) Requirements.--Each chief judge shall--\n        (1) have discretion as to the design, organization, and \n    implementation of the public events required under subsection (a); \n    and\n        (2) in conducting a public event under subsection (a), seek to \n    maximize the local impact of the event and the provision of access \n    to high-quality pro bono legal services by survivors of domestic \n    violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\nSEC. 4.
