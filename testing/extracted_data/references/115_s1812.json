FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) competitive markets are critical to ensuring \n        opportunity for all people in the United States;\n            (2) when companies compete, businesses offer the highest \n        quality and choice of goods for the lowest possible prices to \n        consumers and other businesses;\n            (3) competition fosters small business growth, reduces \n        economic inequality, and spurs innovation;\n            (4) concentration that leads to market power and \n        anticompetitive conduct makes it more difficult for people in \n        the United States to start their own businesses, depresses \n        wages, and increases economic inequality;\n            (5) undue market concentration also contributes to the \n        consolidation of political power, undermining the health of \n        democracy in the United States;\n            (6) the anticompetitive effects of market power created by \n        concentration include higher prices, lower quality, \n        significantly less choice, reduced innovation, foreclosure of \n        competitors, increased entry barriers, and monopsony power;\n            (7) monopsony power--\n                    (A) allows a firm to force suppliers of goods or \n                services to cut their prices to unreasonably low \n                levels, resulting in reduced business opportunities for \n                suppliers and reduced availability and quality of \n                products and services for consumers; and\n                    (B) can result in workers being forced to accept \n                unreasonably low wages;\n            (8) horizontal consolidation, vertical consolidation, and \n        conglomerate mergers all have potential to cause \n        anticompetitive harm;\n            (9) unprecedented consolidation is reducing competition and \n        threatens to place the American dream further out of reach for \n        many consumers in the United States;\n            (10) since 2008, firms in the United States have engaged in \n        over $10,000,000,000,000 in mergers and acquisitions;\n            (11) between 2010 and 2015, there was a 50-percent increase \n        in the number of mergers and acquisitions reviewed by the \n        Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the \n        Department of Justice;\n            (12) the antitrust laws, particularly section 7 of the \n        Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18), are the first line of defense \n        against anticompetitive mergers; and\n            (13) in recent years, some court decisions and enforcement \n        policies have limited the vitality of the Clayton Act to \n        prevent harmful consolidation by--\n                    (A) discounting previously accepted presumptions \n                that certain acquisitions are anticompetitive;\n                    (B) focusing inordinately on the impact on price of \n                an acquisition in the short term;\n                    (C) underestimating the dangers that horizontal, \n                vertical, and conglomerate mergers will lower quality, \n                reduce choice, impede innovation, exclude competitors, \n                increase entry barriers, or create monopsony power; and\n                    (D) requiring the government to prove harmful \n                effects of a merger to a near certainty.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to promote competition \nand prevent harmful consolidation by restoring the original intent of \nthe Clayton Act to address the full range of anticompetitive harms, \nincluding--\n            (1) eliminating the requirement that a merger \n        ``substantially'' lessens competition to clarify that the \n        Clayton Act prohibits mergers that, as a result of \n        consolidation, may materially lower quality, reduce choice, \n        reduce innovation, exclude competitors, increase entry \n        barriers, or increase price;\n            (2) inserting the phrase ``materially'' to establish that \n        the plaintiff need not show an acquisition may cause a \n        substantial amount of harm to competition, but rather show that \n        an acquisition may cause more than a de minimis amount of harm \n        to competition;\n            (3) amending the Clayton Act to include the term \n        ``monopsony'' to clarify that an acquisition that tends to \n        create a monopsony violates the Clayton Act; and\n            (4) establishing simple, cost-effective decision rules that \n        require the parties to certain acquisitions that either \n        significantly increase consolidation or are extremely large \n        bear the burden of establishing that the acquisition will not \n        materially harm competition.\n\nSEC. 3. UNLAWFUL ACQUISITIONS.\n\n    Section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18) is amended--\n            (1) in the first and second undesignated paragraphs, by \n        striking ``substantially'' each place that term appears and \n        inserting ``materially'';\n            (2) by inserting ``or a monopsony'' after ``monopoly'' each \n        place that term appears; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``In a case brought by the United States, the Federal Trade \nCommission, or a State attorney general, a court shall determine that \nthe effect of an acquisition described in this section may be \nmaterially to lessen competition or create a monopoly or a monopsony \nif--\n            ``(1) the acquisition would lead to a significant increase \n        in market concentration in any line of commerce or in any \n        activity affecting commerce in any section of the country; or\n            ``(2)(A) the acquisition is not a transaction that is \n        described in section 7A(c); and\n            ``(B)(i) as a result of such acquisition, the acquiring \n        person would hold an aggregate total amount of the voting \n        securities and assets of the acquired person in excess of \n        $5,000,000,000 (as adjusted and published for each fiscal year \n        beginning after September 30, 2018, in the same manner as \n        provided in section 8(a)(5) to reflect the percentage change in \n        the gross national product for such fiscal year compared to the \n        gross national product for the year ending September 30, 2017); \n        or\n            ``(ii)(I) the person acquiring or the person being acquired \n        has assets, net annual sales, or a market capitalization \n        greater than $100,000,000,000 (as so adjusted and published); \n        and\n            ``(II) as a result of such acquisition, the acquiring \n        person would hold an aggregate total amount of the voting \n        securities and assets of the acquired person in excess of \n        $50,000,000 (as so adjusted and published),\nunless the acquiring and acquired person establish, by a preponderance \nof the evidence, that the effect of the acquisition will not be to tend \nto materially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly or a \nmonopsony. In this paragraph, the term `materially lessen competition' \nmeans more than a de minimis amount.''.\n\nSEC. 4. POST-SETTLEMENT DATA.\n\n    Section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18a) is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(l)(1) Each person who enters into an agreement with the Federal \nTrade Commission or the United States to resolve a proceeding brought \nunder the antitrust laws or under the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 \nU.S.C. 41 et seq.) regarding an acquisition with respect to which \nnotification is required under this section shall, on an annual basis \nduring the 5-year period beginning on the date on which the agreement \nis entered into, submit to the Federal Trade Commission or the \nAssistant Attorney General, as applicable, information sufficient for \nthe Federal Trade Commission or the United States, as applicable, to \nassess the competitive impact of the acquisition, including--\n            ``(A) the pricing, availability, and quality of any product \n        or service, or inputs thereto, in any market, that was covered \n        by the agreement;\n            ``(B) the source, and the resulting magnitude and extent, \n        of any cost-saving efficiencies or any consumer benefits that \n        were claimed as a benefit of the acquisition and the extent to \n        which any cost savings were passed on to consumers; and\n            ``(C) the effectiveness of any divestitures or any \n        conditions placed on the acquisition in preventing or \n        mitigating harm to competition.\n    ``(2) The requirement to provide the information described in \nparagraph (1) shall be included in an agreement described in that \nparagraph.\n    ``(3) The Federal Trade Commission, with the concurrence of the \nAssistant Attorney General, by rule in accordance with section 553 of \ntitle 5, United States Code, and consistent with the purposes of this \nsection--\n            ``(A) shall require that the information described in \n        paragraph (1) be in such form and contain such documentary \n        material and information relevant to a proposed acquisition as \n        is necessary and appropriate to enable the Federal Trade \n        Commission and the Assistant Attorney General to assess the \n        competitive impact of the acquisition under paragraph (1); and\n            ``(B) may--\n                    ``(i) define the terms used in this subsection;\n                    ``(ii) exempt, from the requirements of this \n                section, information not relevant in assessing the \n                competitive impact of the acquisition under paragraph \n                (1); and\n                    ``(iii) prescribe such other rules as may be \n                necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of \n                this section.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
