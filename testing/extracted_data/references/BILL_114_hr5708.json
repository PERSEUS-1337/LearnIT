FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 2006, Nicaragua, under President Enrique Bolanos, \n        entered into a $175,000,000, 5-year compact with the Millennium \n        Challenge Corporation (MCC).\n            (2) After the 2008 municipal elections, the MCC stated that \n        there was a pattern of decline in political rights and civil \n        liberties in Nicaragua.\n            (3) In 2009, the MCC terminated the compact and reduced the \n        amount of MCC funds available to Nicaragua by $61,500,000, \n        which led to the compact ending in 2011.\n            (4) According to Nicaraguan law, the National Assembly is \n        the only institution allowed to change the constitution but in \n        2009, Daniel Ortega circumvented the legislature and went to \n        the Supreme Court, which he controls, to rule in his favor that \n        Presidential term limits were inapplicable.\n            (5) The House Committee on Foreign Affairs convened a \n        congressional hearing on December 1, 2011, entitled ``Democracy \n        Held Hostage in Nicaragua: Part 1'' where former United States \n        Ambassador to Nicaragua Robert Callahan testified, ``First, \n        that Daniel Ortega's candidacy was illegal, illegitimate, and \n        unconstitutional; second, that the period leading to the \n        elections and the elections themselves were marred by serious \n        fraud; third, that Daniel Ortega and his Sandinista party have \n        systematically undermined the country's fragile governmental \n        institutions''.\n            (6) From fiscal year 2012 until present, the Department of \n        State found that Nicaragua did not meet international standards \n        of fiscal transparency.\n            (7) On January 25, 2012, a press statement from Secretary \n        of State Hillary Clinton said: ``As noted by international \n        observers and Nicaraguan civil society groups, Nicaragua's \n        recent elections were not conducted in a transparent and \n        impartial manner, and the entire electoral process was marred \n        by significant irregularities. The elections marked a setback \n        to democracy in Nicaragua and undermined the ability of \n        Nicaraguans to hold their government accountable.''.\n            (8) According to the Department of State's 2015 Fiscal \n        Transparency Report: ``Nicaragua's fiscal transparency would be \n        improved by including all off-budget revenue and expenditure in \n        the budget, auditing state-owned enterprises, and conducting a \n        full audit of the government's annual financial statements and \n        making audit reports publicly available within a reasonable \n        period of time.''.\n            (9) According to the Department of State's Country Reports \n        on Human Rights Practices for 2015: ``In 2011 the Supreme \n        Electoral Council (CSE) announced the re-election of President \n        Daniel Ortega Saavedra of the Sandinista National Liberation \n        Front (FSLN) in elections that international and domestic \n        observers characterized as seriously flawed. International and \n        domestic organizations raised concerns regarding the \n        constitutional legitimacy of Ortega's re-election. The 2011 \n        elections also provided the ruling party with a supermajority \n        in the National Assembly, allowing for changes in the \n        constitution, including extending the reach of executive branch \n        power and the elimination of restrictions on re-election for \n        executive branch officials and mayors. Observers noted serious \n        flaws during the 2012 municipal elections and March 2014 \n        regional elections.''.\n            (10) According to the Department of State's Country Reports \n        on Human Rights Practices for 2015 in Nicaragua: ``The \n        principal human rights abuses were restrictions on citizens'' \n        right to vote; obstacles to freedom of speech and press, \n        including government intimidation and harassment of journalists \n        and independent media, as well as increased restriction of \n        access to public information, including national statistics \n        from public offices; and increased government harassment and \n        intimidation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil \n        society organizations.\n            (11) The same 2015 report stated: ``Additional significant \n        human rights abuses included considerably biased policies to \n        promote single-party dominance; arbitrary police arrest and \n        detention of suspects, including abuse during detention; harsh \n        and life-threatening prison conditions with arbitrary and \n        lengthy pretrial detention; discrimination against ethnic \n        minorities and indigenous persons and communities.''.\n            (12) In February 2016, the Ortega regime detained and \n        expelled Freedom House's Latin America Director, Dr. Carlos \n        Ponce, from Nicaragua.\n            (13) On May 10, 2016, the Supreme Electoral Council \n        announced and published the electoral calendar which aims to \n        govern the electoral process.\n            (14) After receiving the electoral calendar for the 2016 \n        Presidential elections, the Nicaraguan political opposition \n        raised concerns and pointed to a number of anomalies such as: \n        the electoral calendar failed to contemplate national and \n        international observations, failed to agree to publicly publish \n        the precincts results of each Junta Receptora de Voto (JRV), \n        and failed to purge the electoral registration rolls in a \n        transparent and open manner.\n            (15) Nicaragua's constitution mandates terms of 5 years for \n        municipal authorities, which would indicate that the next \n        municipal elections must occur in 2017.\n            (16) On June 3, 2016, the Nicaraguan Supreme Court--which \n        is controlled by Nicaragua's leader, Daniel Ortega--instructed \n        the Supreme Electoral Council not to swear in Nicaraguan \n        opposition members to the departmental and regional electoral \n        councils.\n            (17) On June 5, 2016, regarding international observers for \n        the 2016 Presidential elections, President Ortega stated: \n        ``Here, the observation ends. Go observe other countries . . . \n        There will be no observation, neither from the European Union, \n        nor the OAS . . .''.\n            (18) On June 7, 2016, the Department of State's Bureau of \n        Democracy, Human Rights and Labor posted on social media: \n        ``Disappointed government of Nicaragua said it will deny \n        electoral observers requested by Nicaraguan citizens, church, \n        and private sector . . . We continue to encourage the \n        government of Nicaragua to allow electoral observers as \n        requested by Nicaraguans.''.\n            (19) On June 8, 2016, the Supreme Electoral Council--which \n        is controlled by Nicaragua's leader, Daniel Ortega--announced a \n        ruling, which changed the leadership structure of the \n        opposition party and in practice allegedly barred all existing \n        opposition candidates from running for office.\n            (20) On June 14, 2016, President Ortega expelled three \n        United States Government officials (two officials from U.S. \n        Customs and Border Protection and one professor from the \n        National Defense University) from Nicaragua.\n            (21) On June 29, 2016, the Department of State issued a \n        Nicaragua Travel Alert which stated: ``The Department of State \n        alerts U.S. citizens about increased government scrutiny of \n        foreigners' activities, new requirements for volunteer groups, \n        and the potential for demonstrations during the upcoming \n        election season in Nicaragua . . . Nicaraguan authorities have \n        denied entry to, detained, questioned, or expelled foreigners, \n        including United States Government officials, academics, NGO \n        workers, and journalists, for discussions, written reports or \n        articles, photographs, and/or videos related to these topics. \n        Authorities may monitor and question private United States \n        citizens concerning their activities, including contact with \n        Nicaraguan citizens.''.\n            (22) On August 1, 2016, the Department of State issued a \n        press release to express grave concern over the Nicaraguan \n        government limiting democratic space leading up to the \n        elections in November and stated that ``[o]n June 8, the \n        Nicaraguan Supreme Court stripped the opposition Independent \n        Liberal Party (PLI) from its long recognized leader. The \n        Supreme Court took similar action on June 17 when it \n        invalidated the leadership of the Citizen Action Party, the \n        only remaining opposition party with the legal standing to \n        present a presidential candidate. Most recently, on July 29, \n        the Supreme Electoral Council removed 28 PLI national assembly \n        members (16 seated and 12 alternates) from their popularly-\n        elected positions.''.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to support--\n            (1) the rule of law and an independent judiciary and \n        electoral council in Nicaragua;\n            (2) independent pro-democracy organizations in Nicaragua; \n        and\n            (3) free, fair, and transparent elections under \n        international and domestic observers in Nicaragua in 2016 and \n        2017.\n\nSEC. 4.
