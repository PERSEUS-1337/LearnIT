    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Education for Retirement Security \nAct of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Improving financial literacy is a critical and complex \n        task for Americans of all ages.\n            (2) Low levels of savings and high levels of personal and \n        real estate debt are serious problems for many households \n        nearing retirement.\n            (3) Only 53 percent of working Americans have any form of \n        pension coverage. Three out of four women aged 65 or over \n        receive no income from employer-provided pensions.\n            (4) The more limited timeframe that mid-life and older \n        individuals and families have to assess the realities of their \n        individual circumstances, to recover from counter-productive \n        choices and decisionmaking processes, and to benefit from more \n        informed financial practices, has immediate impact and near \n        term consequences for Americans nearing or of retirement age.\n            (5) Research indicates that there are now 4 basic sources \n        of retirement income security. Those sources are social \n        security benefits, pensions and savings, healthcare insurance \n        coverage, and, for an increasing number of older individuals, \n        necessary earnings from working during one's ``retirement'' \n        years.\n            (6) The $5,000,000,000,000 loss in stock market equity \n        values since 2000 has had a significantly negative effect on \n        mid-life and older individuals and on their pension plans and \n        retirement accounts, affecting both individuals with plans to \n        retire and those who are already in retirement.\n            (7) Although today's older individuals are generally \n        thought to be doing well, nearly \\1/5\\ (18 percent) of such \n        individuals were living below 125 percent of the poverty line \n        during a year of national prosperity, 1995.\n            (8) Over the next 30 years, the number of older individuals \n        in the United States is expected to double, from 35,000,000 to \n        nearly 75,000,000, and long-term care costs are expected to \n        skyrocket.\n            (9) Financial exploitation is the largest single category \n        of abuse against older individuals and this population \n        comprises more than \\1/2\\ of all telemarketing victims in the \n        United States.\n            (10) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Identity Theft Data \n        Clearinghouse has reported that incidents of identity theft \n        targeting individuals over the age of 60 increased from 1,821 \n        victims in 2000 to 5,802 victims in 2001, a threefold increase.\n\nSEC. 3.
