SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Ellie Helton, Lisa Colagrossi, \nTeresa Anne Lawrence, and Jennifer Sedney Focused Research Act'' or \n``Ellie's Law''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) An estimated 6 million people in the United States, or \n        1 in 50 people, have an unruptured brain aneurysm.\n            (2) Each year, an estimated 30,000 people in the United \n        States suffer a brain aneurysm rupture. Ruptured brain \n        aneurysms are fatal in about 40 percent of cases. Of those who \n        survive, about 66 percent suffer some permanent neurological \n        deficit.\n            (3) Brain aneurysms are more likely to occur in women than \n        in men by a 3 to 2 ratio. People who experienced a brain \n        aneurysm rupture include the following:\n                    (A) Ellie Helton. On July 16, 2014, Ellie Helton, a \n                vibrant, loving 14-year-old from Apex, North Carolina, \n                passed away as a result of a ruptured aneurysm, \n                stunning her parents, two sisters, and many, many loved \n                ones. A day earlier, on her second day of high school, \n                she woke up with a terrible headache after a plum-sized \n                aneurysm on her brain stem ruptured. While she suffered \n                headaches throughout her life, she was never diagnosed. \n                Ellie was an avid reader and excellent student, loved \n                the arts, and was incredibly creative. She had an \n                unwavering, constant love for the family and friends in \n                her life.\n                    (B) Lisa Colagrossi. On March 20, 2015, Lisa \n                Colagrossi--WABC Eyewitness News reporter, wife of 17 \n                years, and mother of two sons--unexpectedly passed away \n                at the age of 49 years after suffering a massive \n                ruptured brain aneurysm. Despite experiencing one of \n                the classic warning signs of a brain aneurysm (the \n                ``worst headache of my life''), Lisa's passing came as \n                a tremendous shock to her family and friends, who did \n                not know what a brain aneurysm was, let alone its signs \n                and symptoms. She is remembered for being a loving \n                wife, a mother, and a successful reporter, and for her \n                love of the New York Rangers.\n                    (C) Teresa Anne Lawrence, devoted mother of three, \n                beloved wife, and staple of her community, collapsed \n                while visiting her son's school on December 8, 1983. \n                She had been struggling with and taking medication for \n                hypertension for several years. At age 34, after being \n                unconscious for four days, she passed away as a result \n                of a brain aneurysm. Her loving husband and extended \n                family were left to raise their children, whom Teresa \n                cherished so much.\n                    (D) Jennifer Sedney. On December 25, 2013, Jennifer \n                Sedney, a beautiful, accomplished young woman, passed \n                away suddenly at the age of 27 from a ruptured brain \n                aneurysm. Her only symptom was the ``worst headache of \n                her life'', which none of her friends or family \n                realized was a symptom of a potentially fatal \n                condition. Jenny was a jogger, a disciplined exerciser, \n                and a successful health care consultant and had \n                recently launched a health blog founded on three \n                principles--``bee curious, bee radiant, bee well''. Her \n                brother, mother, father, and a large devoted network of \n                friends and relatives remember her every day.\n            (4) The combined lost wages of survivors of brain aneurysm \n        ruptures and their caretakers are approximately $138,000,000 \n        per year.\n            (5) Despite the widespread prevalence of this condition and \n        the high societal cost it imposes on the Nation, the Federal \n        Government only spends approximately $0.83 per year on brain \n        aneurysm research for each person afflicted with a brain \n        aneurysm.\n            (6) The first three iterations of the International Study \n        on Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) have advanced \n        researchers' and clinicians' understanding of how to most \n        effectively manage and treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms.\n\nSEC. 3. FUNDING.\n\n    (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--To conduct or support further \ncomprehensive research on unruptured intracranial aneurysms, studying a \nbroader patient population diversified by age, sex, and race, there are \nauthorized to be appropriated to the National Institute of Neurological \nDisorders and Stroke $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018 through \n2022, to remain available through September 30, 2026.\n    (b) Supplement, Not Supplant.--Any funds made available pursuant to \nthis section shall supplement, not supplant, other funding made \navailable for research on brain aneurysms."
