FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 \n        U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) established new and expanded units of the \n        National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System in \n        many areas of Alaska. The purposes of these conservation system \n        units include protection of habitat for fish and wildlife, \n        conservation of fish and wildlife populations, continued \n        opportunity for subsistence uses by local residents, and \n        protection of archeological sites associated with Alaska Native \n        cultures.\n            (2) Many rural Alaskan communities are in close proximity \n        to conservation system units and the purposes of these \n        conservation system units are uniquely relevant to the culture \n        and ways of Alaska Natives and other residents of rural Alaska \n        communities. Congress recognized this close relationship in \n        sections 1306, 1307, and 1308 of the Alaska National Interest \n        Lands Conservation Act, which directed the Secretary of the \n        Interior to establish programs whereby Alaska Native lands were \n        given preference for the siting of conservation system unit \n        facilities, Alaska Native corporations and local residents were \n        given preference for the provision of visitor services, and \n        local residents were given preference for employment.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To promote innovative management strategies that are \n        designed to lead to greater efficiency in conservation system \n        unit management.\n            (2) To expand Alaska Native contracting opportunities.\n            (3) To increase local employment in Alaska.\n            (4) To further the unique purposes of conservation system \n        units as they relate to subsistence practices, Alaska Native \n        culture, and the conservation of fish and wildlife habitat and \n        populations.\n\nSEC. 3.
