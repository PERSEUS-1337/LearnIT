FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress of the United States finds the \nfollowing:\n            (1) The disappearance of good jobs, the shrinking of the \n        middle class, and growing income inequality are the greatest \n        domestic challenges confronting the Nation.\n            (2) The United States Government is the largest purchaser \n        of goods and services in the Nation's private-sector economy, \n        spending over $1.5 trillion dollars annually at firms that \n        employ a quarter of American workers.\n            (3)(A) Federal purchasing power is currently creating \n        millions of poverty-level jobs, subsidizing labor law-breakers, \n        and funding ballooning executive compensation.\n            (B) The Federal Government is the Nation's leading creator \n        of low-wage jobs in the private sector, funding more than \n        2,000,000 jobs paying under $12 per hour.\n            (C) The Federal Government awards taxpayer dollars to a \n        substantial number of firms that violate Federal labor, \n        employment, and occupational safety laws.\n            (D) Federal Government purchasing subsidizes the excessive \n        salaries of private-sector executives who do business with the \n        American people.\n            (4) When Federal purchasing power is used in such a manner, \n        workers have less to spend on the necessities of life and are \n        forced to rely on public assistance. Lack of working purchasing \n        power hurts job creation and undermines economic growth, \n        ultimately imposing significant costs on American taxpayers.\n            (5)(A) Federal purchasing power should be used to create \n        good jobs, rebuild the middle class, and curb rising income \n        inequality.\n            (B) Federal purchasing power should be used to create good \n        jobs for America. Good jobs allow workers and their families to \n        live in dignity without relying on public assistance or private \n        charity. Good jobs pay enough to provide for subsistence, \n        health care, education, housing, and savings, as well as enough \n        disposable income to allow workers to enjoy quality time off \n        with their loved ones.\n            (C) Federal purchasing power should be used to rebuild the \n        middle class. A strong middle class stimulates the economy by \n        increasing consumer spending and job growth.\n            (D) Federal purchasing power should be used to narrow the \n        growing gulf between the richest one percent of the population \n        and ordinary working families that is threatening the survival \n        of participatory democracy.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To use Federal purchasing power to incentivize private-\n        sector firms.\n            (2) To create good jobs for America's workers.\n            (3) To rebuild America's middle class.\n            (4) To address America's crisis of income inequality.\n            (5) To invigorate the economy by increasing the purchasing \n        power of working Americans.\n\nSEC. 3. GOOD JOBS MODEL EMPLOYER STANDARDS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act, a Good Jobs Model Employer is one which \nmeets the following standards:\n            (1) Respects employees' rights to bargain collectively with \n        their employers without being forced to take strike action to \n        win better wages and working conditions.\n            (2) Offers to each employee living wages, decent benefits \n        including health care, paid leave for sickness and caregiving, \n        and fair work schedules that are predictable and stable.\n            (3) Affirmatively demonstrates an exemplary standard of \n        compliance with workplace protection laws, including laws \n        governing labor relations, wages and hours, and health and \n        safety, as well as other applicable labor laws.\n            (4) Limits executive compensation to 50 times the median \n        salary paid to the company's workers.\n            (5) Employs a workforce not less than 35 percent of which \n        reside within one or more Historically Underutilized Business \n        Zones.\n            (6) Subcontracts only with other Good Jobs Model Employers.\n\nSEC. 4. APPLICATION TO FEDERAL CONTRACTS AND ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) Eligibility for Award of Procurement Contracts.--In the award \nof a contract for the acquisition of supplies or services, an executive \nagency may not award the contract to a source that is not a Good Jobs \nModel Employer, unless there is no offer from a source that is a Good \nJobs Model Employer.\n    (b) Eligibility for Award of Financial and Nonfinancial \nAssistance.--An executive agency may not provide other forms of \nfinancial or nonfinancial assistance to entities that are not model \nemployers when there is a similarly situated Good Jobs Model Employer \nthat could receive the assistance, unless doing so would substantially \nundermine the value of the assistance to the public good.\n    (c) Incorporation Into Future Federal Contracts and Assistance \nAgreements.--Beginning on January 1, 2015, executive agencies shall \nincorporate into each new contract, contract-like instrument, or \nassistance agreement a clause requiring the contractor or recipient to \nconduct itself as a Good Jobs Model Employer for the duration of the \ncontract.\n    (d) Exclusions.--None of the provisions of this section shall be \ninterpreted to apply to--\n            (1) direct Federal statutory entitlements;\n            (2) mandatory awards;\n            (3) direct awards to foreign governments or public \n        international organizations;\n            (4) benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement; or\n            (5) Federal employment.\n\nSEC. 5.
