FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The combined effects of the strongest economy in 40 \n        years, the lowest unemployment rate since the establishment of \n        an all-volunteer force for the Armed Forces, and a declining \n        propensity on the part of America's youth to serve in the \n        military make the recruitment of persons for the Armed Forces \n        unusually challenging.\n            (2) For the recruitment of high quality personnel, each of \n        the Armed Forces faces intense competition from the other \n        branches of the Armed Forces, the private sector, and \n        postsecondary educational institutions.\n            (3) It is becoming increasingly difficult for the Armed \n        Forces to meet their respective recruiting goals. Despite a \n        variety of innovative approaches taken by recruiters and the \n        extensive programs of benefits that are available for recruits, \n        recruiters have to devote extraordinary time and effort to fill \n        monthly requirements for immediate accessions.\n            (4) A number of local educational agencies have denied \n        recruiters for the Armed Forces access to secondary school \n        students, or to student directory information about secondary \n        school students, of those agencies. In 1999, there were 4,515 \n        instances of denial of access in the case of the Army, 4,364 \n        instances in the case of the Navy, 4,884 instances in the case \n        of the Marine Corps, and 5,465 instances in the case of the Air \n        Force.\n            (5) As of the beginning of 2000, local educational agencies \n        operating nearly one-fourth of all secondary schools nationwide \n        did not release student directory information to the Armed \n        Forces for recruiting purposes.\n            (6) In testimony presented to the Committee on Armed \n        Services of the Senate, military recruiters have stated that \n        the single biggest obstacle to carrying out their recruiting \n        mission for new enlisted accessions is the denial of access to \n        directory information about secondary school students.\n            (7) The denial to military recruiters of direct access to \n        secondary school students and the denial of access to directory \n        information about those students unfairly harms the students \n        themselves, since students are thereby prevented from receiving \n        full information on the educational and training incentives \n        offered by the Armed Forces, thus impairing the career \n        decisionmaking process for the students by limiting the \n        availability of complete information on their options.\n            (8) The denial of access for Armed Forces recruiters to \n        secondary school students or to student directory information \n        ultimately undermines the national defense by making it more \n        difficult for the Armed Forces to recruit young Americans in \n        the quantity and of the quality necessary for maintaining the \n        readiness of the Armed Forces to provide for the national \n        defense.\n\nSEC. 3. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES DENYING EQUAL ACCESS TO SECONDARY \n              SCHOOLS FOR MILITARY RECRUITING PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Denial of Educational Assistance Funds.--Section 503 of title \n10, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following \nnew subsection:\n    ``(d) Denial of Federal Educational Assistance Funds to Local \nEducational Agencies Denying Equal Access to Recruiters.--(1) Section \n983 of this title (other than subsection (a) of that section) shall \napply to each local educational agency included on the list maintained \nunder paragraph (2) as if the local educational agency were an \ninstitution of higher education described in subsection (b) of that \nsection.\n    ``(2) The Secretary of Defense shall maintain a list of local \neducational agencies that are required under paragraph (3) to be listed \nas local educational agencies that deny recruiting access to the armed \nforces.\n    ``(3)(A) If a local educational agency denies a request by a \nrepresentative of an armed force for recruiting access to secondary \nschool students, the Secretary concerned shall provide for an officer \nof that armed force to meet with representatives of that local \neducational agency in person, at the offices of that agency, for the \npurpose of attempting to arrange for recruiting access. The Secretary \nshall seek to have such meeting occur not later than 120 days after the \ndate of the denial of the request.\n    ``(B) If, after a meeting under subparagraph (A) with \nrepresentatives of a local educational agency that has denied a request \nby a representative of an armed force for recruiting access to \nsecondary school students or (if such a meeting cannot be arranged \nwithin 120 days of such denial) after the end of such 120-day period, \nthe Secretary of Defense determines that the agency continues to deny \nrecruiting access, the Secretary shall transmit to the Chief Executive \nof the State in which the local educational agency is located a \nnotification of the denial of recruiting access and a request for \nassistance in obtaining such access.
