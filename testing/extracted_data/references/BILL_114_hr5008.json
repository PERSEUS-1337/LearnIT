SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Clarify Workers \nMisclassification in the Construction Industry Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Worker misclassification in the construction industry \n        has reached epidemic proportions. Studies from California, \n        Tennessee, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, and other States detail \n        hundreds of millions of dollars in lost employment and income \n        taxes because of improper classification of workers for \n        taxation in the construction industry. New Jersey revenue \n        collection officials have indicated that $535 million in taxes \n        in the State are lost due to worker misclassification.\n            (2) Worker misclassification takes place at construction \n        projects involving military bases, hospitals, universities, \n        convention centers, and major hotels.\n            (3) There is significant anecdotal evidence that a large \n        number of workers in the construction industry are currently \n        being misclassified as independent contractors in order to \n        avoid tax withholding and other employer responsibilities, but \n        the Internal Revenue Service is barred from issuing rules or \n        guidance to reclassify these workers by section 530 of the \n        Revenue Act of 1978.\n            (4) Legitimate construction contractors are unable to \n        compete with contractors who avoid employment and income taxes \n        through misclassification. This creates competitive pressure on \n        other contractors to also misclassify employees to remain \n        competitive. States, leading contractors, and construction \n        labor leaders agree that government action is needed to reverse \n        this spiral.\n            (5) According to the Internal Revenue Service, a dollar \n        spent on tax enforcement typically yields an additional six \n        dollars in revenue to the Treasury. This figure does not \n        include revenue gained from deterring misclassification which \n        would increase tax revenue significantly beyond the level \n        projected.\n    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to increase efforts to \nidentify and reduce misclassification, to prosecute tax evasion in the \nconstruction industry, and provide the Secretary of the Treasury the \nresources necessary to accomplish these objectives.\n\nSEC. 2. DIRECTIVES AND AUTHORITIES TO IMPROVE TAX COMPLIANCE IN THE \n              CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.\n\n    (a) Enforcement Actions.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \ninitiate an enforcement initiative aimed at increasing tax compliance \nin the construction industry. Measures taken to implement this \ninitiative shall include:\n            (1) Consultations with industry experts and leaders on the \n        scope and priorities of this initiative, including the \n        Secretary of Labor, State government officials, the General \n        Accountability Office, leading private sector construction \n        organizations, and labor organizations involved in the \n        construction industry.\n            (2) Targeted tax audits of major construction contractors \n        that the Secretary finds reason to believe may not be in \n        compliance with applicable Federal tax laws.\n            (3) Civil and criminal tax enforcement actions under \n        existing legal authorities.\n            (4) Educational efforts aimed at entities in the \n        construction industry to increase voluntary tax compliance.\n    (b) Authority To Issue Guidance Clarifying Employment Status for \nPurposes of Employment Taxes.--\n            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n        including section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978, the Secretary \n        shall promulgate rules and issue guidance to reclassify \n        individuals who are not currently being treated as employees \n        consistent with the proper classification of employees under \n        common law standards within the construction industry.\n            (2) Restriction to construction industry.--Any rules or \n        guidance under paragraph (1) shall apply only with respect to \n        services provided within the construction industry.\n            (3) Effective date.--Any rules or guidance under paragraph \n        (1) shall not take effect before the date which is 180 days \n        after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Resources.--The Secretary shall reassign personnel and \nresources from other activities to carry out this Act.\n    (d) Oversight and Review.--\n            (1) Annual reports by treasury.--The Secretary shall submit \n        an annual written report to the Committee on Ways and Means of \n        the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of \n        the Senate regarding the implementation of this Act together \n        with any recommendations for further action by Congress which \n        would be consistent with the purposes of this Act.\n            (2) Study and report by comptroller general.--The \n        Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a \n        comprehensive study of the various forms of tax fraud, \n        including employee misclassification, in the construction \n        industry, efforts to combat such fraud, and recommendations for \n        further action. Not later than June 30, 2017, the Comptroller \n        General shall submit a written report to the Committee on Ways \n        and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n        Finance of the Senate detailing the results of such study.\n    (e) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n            (1) Construction industry.--The term ``construction \n        industry'' means all general contractors and operative builders \n        primarily engaged in the remodeling, addition, or construction \n        of residential, farm, industrial, commercial, or other \n        buildings including wharves or other structures attached to \n        land.\n            (2) Secretary of the treasury.--The terms ``Secretary of \n        the Treasury'' and ``Secretary'' mean the Secretary of the \n        Treasury or the Secretary's designee.\n    (f) Termination.--This section, and any rules promulgated or \nguidance issued under subsection (b), shall cease to have any force or \neffect after September 30, 2021."
