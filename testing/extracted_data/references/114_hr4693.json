SHORT TITLE; FINDING.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Young Child Tax \nCredit Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Economists have found similar effects of the importance \n        of income in the earliest years with returns to school \n        achievement.\n            (2) Pediatricians and other child development experts have \n        long talked about the critical importance of the earliest years \n        of life.\n            (3) Young children, including babies and toddlers, are the \n        poorest people in the country by age.\n            (4) With the recent improvements signed into law in \n        December, together, the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax \n        Credit now lift more children out of poverty than any other \n        Federal policies.\n            (5) Families with young children receive the smallest child \n        tax credits, despite the fact that the economic literature \n        suggests that these credits have particularly beneficial \n        effects for families with young children.\n            (6) Economists have found that large fluctuations in a \n        family's income can be detrimental to the development of young \n        children. Research on scarcity have found it is hard for \n        parents to focus on children if they are worrying about having \n        sufficient income to meet their family's needs.\n\nSEC. 2.
