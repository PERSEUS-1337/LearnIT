FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1978, the Judicial Conference of the United States \n        established a procedure for creating new Federal judicial \n        districts, which is still in force. According to the \n        ``Proceedings of the Judicial Conference, September 21-22, \n        1978'', this procedure requires that 4 principal criteria be \n        taken into consideration in evaluating the establishment of a \n        new Federal judicial district: caseload, judicial \n        administration, geography, and community convenience.\n            (2) The criterion of ``caseload'' is found to include the \n        total number of Federal court cases and the number of cases per \n        Federal judge, for both civil and criminal Federal cases.\n            (3)(A) The substantial criminal caseload concentrated in \n        the southern counties of New Jersey requires the creation of a \n        separate judicial district.\n            (B) 281 Federal criminal cases originated in the 8 southern \n        New Jersey counties in 1998 and were handled by the 5 judges of \n        the Camden vicinage and the 3 judges of the Trenton vicinage.\n            (C) The criminal caseload in the southern region of New \n        Jersey exceeds that of 51 of the current Federal judicial \n        districts. Only 44 of the 95 Federal district courts have more \n        criminal cases filed than the southern region of New Jersey.\n            (D) For example, in the Eastern District of Virginia (9 \n        judges), 110 criminal cases were filed in 1998. In the District \n        of Connecticut (8 judges), only 221 criminal cases were filed \n        in 1998.\n            (4)(A) The substantial civil caseload concentrated in the \n        southern counties of New Jersey requires the creation of a \n        separate judicial district.\n            (B) 2,116 Federal civil cases originated in the 8 southern \n        New Jersey counties in 1998 and were handled by the 5 judges of \n        the Camden vicinage and the 3 judges of the Trenton vicinage.\n            (C) The civil caseload in the southern region of New Jersey \n        exceeds that of 52 of the current Federal judicial districts. \n        Only 43 out of the 95 Federal districts have more civil cases \n        filed than this region of the New Jersey District.\n            (D) For example, in the Southern District of West Virginia, \n        a separate judicial district with 5 judges, only 1,315 civil \n        cases were filed in 1998. The Western District of Tennessee, \n        similarly, with 5 judges, had only 1,581 civil cases filed in \n        1998.\n            (5) The criterion of ``judicial administration'' is found \n        to include the backlog of pending cases in a Federal judicial \n        district, which hinders the effective resolution of pending \n        business before the court.\n            (6)(A) The size of the backlog of pending cases \n        concentrated in the southern counties of New Jersey requires \n        the creation of a separate judicial district.\n            (B) The number of pending cases in the Camden vicinage of \n        New Jersey exceeds the number of cases pending before entire \n        judicial districts with similar numbers of judges, clearly \n        indicating that southern New Jersey merits a separate Federal \n        judicial district. For example, there are 1,431 civil cases \n        pending before the Camden vicinage, and only 113 of those were \n        commenced in 1999. The Western District of Tennessee, with 5 \n        judges, had only 1,104 civil cases pending in 1998. The Western \n        District of Oklahoma had only 1,359 civil cases pending in 1998 \n        before 6 judges. Finally, there are 161 criminal cases pending \n        before the Camden vicinage, while the entire Southern District \n        of Indiana, with 5 judges, had only 116 criminal cases pending \n        in 1998.\n            (7) The criterion of ``geography'' is found to mean the \n        accessibility of the central administration of the Federal \n        judicial district to officers of the court, parties with \n        business before the court, and other citizens living within the \n        Federal judicial district.\n            (8)(A) The distance between the northern and southern \n        regions of New Jersey creates a substantial barrier to the \n        efficient administration of justice.\n            (B) The distance from Newark, New Jersey to Camden, New \n        Jersey is more than 85 miles.\n            (C) When a new Federal court district was created in \n        Louisiana in 1971, the distance between New Orleans and Baton \nRouge (nearly 80 miles) was cited as a major factor in creating a new \ndistrict court, as travel difficulties were impeding the timely \nadministration of justice.\n            (9) The criterion of ``community convenience'' is found to \n        mean the extent to which creating a new Federal judicial \n        district will allow the court to better serve the population \n        and diverse communities of the area.\n            (10)(A) New Jersey's culturally and regionally diverse \n        population of 8,000,000 citizens, widely distributed across a \n        large State, is inconvenienced by having only 1 judicial \n        district.\n            (B) Of the 25 States that have only a single Federal \n        judicial district (including Puerto Rico, the United States \n        territories, and the District of Columbia), New Jersey has the \n        highest population.\n            (C) More than a dozen States have smaller populations than \n        New Jersey, yet they have multiple Federal judicial districts, \n        including Washington, Oklahoma, Iowa, Georgia, West Virginia, \n        and Missouri.\n            (11) In evaluating the creation of a new Southern District \n        of New Jersey, the Judicial Conference should seek the views of \n        the chief judge of the affected district, the judicial council \n        for the affected circuit court, and the affected United States \n        Attorney as representative of the views of the Department of \n        Justice, as required in the procedure established by the \n        ``Proceedings of the Judicial Conference, September 21-22, \n        1978''.\n\nSEC. 2.
