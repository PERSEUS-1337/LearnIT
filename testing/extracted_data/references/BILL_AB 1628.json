The authority may also utilize bond proceeds to fund necessary reserves for principal and interest, capitalized interest, credit enhancement or liquidity costs, costs of issuance, administrative expenses under Section 5849.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and to reimburse loans under Section 5849.14 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n(c) The authority may provide for the issuance of bonds of the authority for the purpose of redeeming, refunding, or retiring any bonds or any series or issue of bonds then outstanding issued under subdivision (b), including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption, purchase, or maturity of the bonds. Subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 15446 apply to, and in connection with, bonds issued under this subdivision. Sections 15441 to 15445, inclusive, and Sections 15447 to 15450, inclusive, apply to, and in connection with, bonds issued under this subdivision in the same manner and to the same extent as bonds issued under subdivision (b).\n(d) The authority may make secured or unsecured loans to the Department of Housing and Community Development in connection with financing permanent supportive housing pursuant to the No Place Like Home Program or to refund bonds previously issued pursuant to this section, in accordance with an agreement between the authority and the Department of Housing and Community Development. Loan proceeds may also be used to fund reserves for principal and interest, capitalized interest, credit enhancement and liquidity costs, expenses of funding, financing, and refinancing, administrative expenses under Section 5849.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and to reimburse loans under Section 5849.14 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n(e) Each of the authority and the Department of Housing and Community Development may enter into any agreement for credit enhancement or liquidity, execute any instruments, and do any other acts it deems necessary, convenient, or desirable in connection with revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section or carry out any power expressly granted pursuant to this section.\n(f) (1) This section provides a complete, additional, and alternative method for performing the acts authorized by this section and shall be construed as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws; provided, however, that the issuance of the bonds and refunding bonds and the execution of any agreements under this section are not subject to, and need not comply with, the requirements of any other law applicable to the issuance of those bonds or refunding bonds and the execution of those agreements, including, but not limited to, the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).\n(2) Except as provided in paragraph (1), funding or financing under this section shall not exempt the permanent supportive housing from the requirements of any other law otherwise applicable to the permanent supportive housing.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 5849.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:\n5849.1.\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares that this part is consistent with and furthers the purposes of the Mental Health Services Act, enacted by Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, within the meaning of Section 18 of that measure.\n(b) The Legislature further finds and declares all of the following:\n(1) Housing is a key factor for stabilization and recovery to occur and results in improved outcomes for individuals living with a mental illness.\n(2) Untreated mental illness can increase the risk of homelessness, especially for single adults.\n(3) California has the nation\u2019s largest homeless population that is disproportionally comprised of women with children, veterans, and the chronically homeless.\n(4) California has the largest number of homeless veterans in the United States at 24 percent of the total population in our nation. Fifty percent of California\u2019s veterans live with serious mental illness and 70 percent have a substance use disorder.\n(5) Fifty percent of mothers experiencing homelessness have experienced a major depressive episode since becoming homeless and 36 percent of these mothers live with post-traumatic stress disorder and 41 percent have a substance use disorder.\n(6) Ninety-three percent of supportive housing tenants who live with mental illness and substance use disorders voluntarily participated in the services offered.\n(7) Adults who receive 2 years of \u201cwhatever-it-takes,\u201d or Full Service Partnership services, experience a 68 percent reduction in homelessness.\n(8) For every dollar of bond funds invested in permanent supportive housing, the state and local governments can leverage a significant amount of additional dollars through tax credits, Medicaid health services funding, and other housing development funds.\n(9) Tenants of permanent supportive housing reduced their visits to the emergency department by 56 percent, and their hospital admissions by 45 percent.\n(10) The cost in public services for a chronically homeless Californian ranges from $60,000 to $100,000 annually. When housed, these costs are cut in half and some reports show reductions in cost of more than 70 percent, including potentially less involvement with the health and criminal justice systems.\n(11) Californians have identified homelessness as their top tier priority; this measure seeks to address the needs of the most vulnerable people within this population.\n(12) Having counties provide mental health programming and services is a benefit to the state.\n(13) The Department of Housing and Community Development is the state entity with sufficient expertise to implement and oversee a grant or loan program for permanent supportive housing of the target population.\n(14) The California Health Facilities Financing Authority is authorized by law to issue bonds and to consult with the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission and the State Department of Health Care Services concerning the implementation of a grant or loan program for California counties to support the development of programs that increase access to, and capacity for, crisis mental health services. It is therefore appropriate for the authority to issue bonds and contract for services with the Department of Housing and Community Development to provide grants or loans to California counties for permanent supportive housing for the target population.\n(15) Use of bond funding will accelerate the availability of funding for the grant or loan program to provide permanent supportive housing for the target population as compared to relying on annual allocations from the Mental Health Services Fund and better allow counties to provide permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals living with mental illness.\n(16) The findings and declarations set forth in subdivision (c) of Section 5849.35 are hereby incorporated herein.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 5849.2 of the Welfare and Instiace Like Home Program Advisory Committee established pursuant to Section 5849.3.\n(f) \u201cCounty\u201d includes, but is not limited to, a city and county, and a city receiving funds pursuant to Section 5701.5.\n(g) \u201cDepartment\u201d means the Department of Housing and Community Development.\n(h) \u201cDevelopment sponsor\u201d has the same meaning as \u201csponsor\u201d as defined in Section 50675.2 of the Health and Safety Code.\n(i) \u201cFund\u201d means the No Place Like Home Fund established pursuant to Section 5849.4.\n(j) \u201cHomeless\u201d has the same meaning as defined in Section 578.3 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as that section read on May 1, 2016.\n(k) \u201cPermanent supportive housing\u201d has the same meaning as \u201csupportive housing,\u201d as defined in Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety Code, except that \u201cpermanent supportive housing\u201d shall include associated facilities if used to provide services to housing residents.\n(l) \u201cProgram\u201d means the process for awarding funds and distributing moneys to applicants established in Sections 5849.7, 5849.8, and 5849.9 and the ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the applicants\u2019 activities pursuant to Sections 5849.8, 5849.9, and 5849.11.\n(1) \u201cCompetitive program\u201d means that portion of the program established by Section 5849.8.\n(2) \u201cDistribution program\u201d means that portion of the program described in Section 5849.9.\n(m) \u201cTarget population\u201d means individuals or households as provided in Section 5600.3 who are homeless, chronically homeless, or at risk of chronic homelessness."
