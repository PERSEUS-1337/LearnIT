FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown \n        bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant \n        panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on Appendix I or II \n        of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species \n        of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 8249) (referred to \n        in this section as ``CITES'');\n            (2) Article XIV of CITES provides that Parties to CITES may \n        adopt stricter domestic measures regarding the conditions for \n        trade, taking, possession, or transport of species on Appendix \n        I or II, and the Parties to CITES adopted a resolution (Conf. \n        10.8) urging Parties to take immediate action to demonstrably \n        reduce the illegal trade in bear parts and derivatives;\n            (3) the Asian bear populations have declined significantly \n        in recent years, as a result of habitat loss and poaching due \n        to a strong demand for bear viscera used in traditional \n        medicines and cosmetics;\n            (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed \n        that American bears have been poached for their viscera;\n            (5) while most American black bear populations are \n        generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could \n        stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the \n        demand for bear viscera increases; and\n            (6) prohibitions against the importation into the United \n        States and exportation from the United States, as well as \n        prohibitions against the interstate trade, of bear viscera and \n        products containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, \n        bear viscera will assist in ensuring that the United States \n        does not contribute to the decline of any bear population as a \n        result of the commercial trade in bear viscera.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term viability of the \nworld's 8 bear species by--\n            (1) prohibiting international trade in bear viscera and \n        products containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, \n        bear viscera;\n            (2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral efforts to \n        eliminate such trade; and\n            (3) ensuring that adequate Federal legislation exists with \n        respect to domestic trade in bear viscera and products \n        containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear \n        viscera.\n\nSEC. 4.
