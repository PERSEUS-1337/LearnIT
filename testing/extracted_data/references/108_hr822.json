FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Americans cherish the continued existence of diverse \n        wilderness ecosystems and wildlife found on their Federal lands \n        and share a strong sense of moral responsibility to protect \n        their wilderness heritage as an enduring resource to cherish, \n        protect, and bequeath undisturbed to future generations of \n        Americans.\n            (2) The values an area of wilderness offer to this and \n        future generations of Americans are greatly enhanced to the \n        degree that the area is diverse in topography, elevation, life \n        zones and ecosystems, and to the extent that it offers a wide \n        range of outdoor recreational and educational opportunities \n        accessible in all seasons of the year.\n            (3) Large blocks of wildlands embracing a wide range of \n        ecosystems and topography, including low-elevation forests, \n        have seldom remained undisturbed due to many decades of \n        development.\n            (4) Certain wildlands on the western slope of the Cascade \n        Range in the Skykomish River valley of the State of Washington \n        offer an outstanding representation of the original character \n        of the forested landscape, ranging from high alpine meadows and \n        extremely rugged peaks to low-elevation mature and old-growth \n        forests, including groves with some of the largest and most \n        spectacular trees in Washington, with diameters of eight feet \n        and larger.\n            (5) These diverse, thickly forested mountain slopes and \n        valleys of mature and old-growth trees in the Skykomish River \n        valley harbor nearly the full complement of the original \n        wildlife and fish species found by settlers of the 19th \n        century, including mountain goats, bald eagles, black bear, \n        pine marten, black-tailed deer, as well as rare and endangered \n        wildlife such as northern spotted owls and goshawks, Chinook \n        and Coho salmon, and steelhead and bull trout.\n            (6) An ecologically and topographically diverse wilderness \n        area in the Skykomish River valley accessible in all seasons of \n        the year will be enjoyable to users of various kinds, such as \n        hikers, horse riders, hunters, anglers, and educational groups, \n        but also to the many who cherish clean water and clean air, \n        fish and wildlife (including endangered species such as wild \n        salmon), and pristine mountain and riverside scenery.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--Congress hereby declares that it is the \npolicy of the United States--\n            (1) to better serve the diverse wilderness and \n        environmental education needs of the people of the State of \n        Washington and its burgeoning metropolitan regions by granting \n        wilderness protection to certain lower elevation wildlands in \n        the Skykomish River valley of the State of Washington; and\n            (2) to protect additional lands adjacent to the Henry M. \n        Jackson Wilderness designated by section 3(8) of the Washington \n        State Wilderness Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-339; 98 Stat. 300), \n        in further tribute to the ecologically enlightened vision of \n        the distinguished Senator from the State of Washington and \n        former Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural \n        Resources of the Senate.\n\nSEC. 3.
