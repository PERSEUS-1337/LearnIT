FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 2001, some broadband service providers are \n        pervasively regulated, and some offering functionally \n        equivalent services are not significantly regulated.\n            (2) Common carrier regulation is being extended \n        inappropriately to new broadband services being deployed by \n        incumbent local exchange carriers, while no regulation is \n        applied to new broadband services being deployed by local cable \n        television companies.\n            (3) There should be deregulatory parity in the provision of \n        broadband services.\n            (4) Broadband services and broadband service providers \n        should be subject to little or no regulation, as there are no \n        monopoly providers of such services and regulation of a nascent \n        service inhibits the development of a competitive market.\n            (5) Facilities used to provide broadband services, such as \n        packet switching, are widely available in the market place and \n        should therefore not be considered a network element, which \n        common carriers must make available to other providers. Access \n        should continue for essential facilities.\n            (6) It is important for the economic development of the \n        United States that all areas of the country receive the \n        benefits of access to high speed Internet and the deployment of \n        broadband services.\n            (7) Common carrier regulation will not induce the \n        deployment of broadband services, but will retard it.\n            (8) Both Federal and State regulatory agencies have \n        followed a regulatory scheme with respect to broadband \n        services, and this pattern must be reversed.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To accelerate the deployment of broadband services to \n        all parts of the United States.\n            (2) To achieve deregulatory parity among providers of \n        broadband services.\n            (3) To reduce regulation of broadband services by the \n        Federal Government and the States.\n\nSEC. 3. DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND SERVICES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Part II of title II of the Communications Act of \n1934 (47 U.S.C. 251 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new section:\n\n``SEC. 262.
