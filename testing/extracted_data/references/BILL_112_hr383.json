FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Women's Health Initiative terminated its study of \n        hormone therapy three years early because of findings that the \n        combination of estrogen and progestin increases the risk of \n        heart disease, stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer, and that \n        estrogen alone increases the risk of stroke and, in women over \n        65 years of age, increases the risk of dementia.\n            (2) The National Institutes of Health has stated \n        unequivocally that while menopause is a natural process in \n        women's lives, some women at midlife experience hot flashes, \n        night sweats, vaginal dryness, sleep disturbances, and mood \n        disturbances that disrupt quality of life. Women who have had \n        menopause induced by surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation are \n        more likely to experience these symptoms.\n            (3) Women deserve relief from menopause-related symptoms.\n            (4) The National Institutes of Health have stated that \n        while estrogen and progestin have been found to be effective \n        remedies for these symptoms, these remedies are not without \n        risk.\n            (5) Concerned about these risks, women seek alternative \n        types of treatments for symptoms that disrupt quality of life, \n        such as hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, sleep \n        disturbances, and mood disturbances.\n            (6) The National Institutes of Health have found that \n        although there are many alternatives to synthetic hormones \n        available, including bio-identical or ``natural'' hormones as \n        well as herbal remedies and food supplements, the effectiveness \n        and long-term safety of these products need to be rigorously \n        studied in diverse populations.\n            (7) Government insurance programs, such as Medicare, \n        Medicaid, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program \n        (FEHBP), and the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not cover \n        non-prescription alternative treatments for menopause-related \n        symptoms because of a lack of demonstrated safety and efficacy \n        of these products.\n            (8) Most private health insurance coverage does not cover \n        non-prescription alternative treatments for menopause-related \n        symptoms because of a lack of demonstrated safety and efficacy \n        of these products.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE COVERAGE OF MENOPAUSAL HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AND \n              ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR MENOPAUSAL HORMONE REPLACEMENT \n              THERAPY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1861(s)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395x(s)(2)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (EE);\n            (2) by adding ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (FF); and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n            ``(GG)(i) hormone replacement therapy for treatment of \n        menopausal symptoms; and\n            ``(ii) an alternative therapy for hormone replacement \n        therapy for treatment of menopausal symptoms if the therapy is \n        recommended by a health care provider who is licensed, \n        accredited, or certified under State law, if it has been proven \n        safe and effective in peer-reviewed scientific studies, and if \n        it is administered only after the health care provider obtains \n        the informed consent of the patient to receive it;''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall \napply to therapies furnished on or after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
