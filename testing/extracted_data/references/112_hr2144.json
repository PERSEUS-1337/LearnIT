    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Global Health \nTechnology Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Applied research and development is a critical \n        component of United States leadership in global health. \n        Research and innovation can help to break the cycle of aid \n        dependency by providing sustainable solutions to long-term \n        problems. Research and development for global health is crucial \n        for meeting new and emerging challenges, creating efficiencies, \n        strengthening health systems, shifting tasks and strengthening \n        workforces, and increasing access to health services for the \n        most vulnerable. Research suggests that advances in health and \n        medical technologies have been the major drivers behind massive \n        improvements in health worldwide over the past century, \n        resulting in an average increase in life expectancies of 21 \n        years in low- and middle-income countries between 1960 and \n        2002.\n            (2) Because of its presence in the field, the United States \n        Agency for International Development (USAID) is uniquely placed \n        to assess local health conditions, then partner with public and \n        private stakeholders to ensure the development and timely \n        introduction and scale-up of tools that are culturally \n        acceptable, address serious and all-too-common health problems, \n        and contribute to the strengthening of health systems. In a \n        recent report to Congress, USAID calls health research \n        ``integral'' to its ``ability to achieve its health and \n        development objectives worldwide'' and states that innovation \n        through research allows the agency ``to develop and introduce \n        affordable health products and practices and contribute to \n        policies appropriate for addressing health-related concerns in \n        the developing world''. In 2006, USAID outlined a five-year \n        health research strategy: ``Report to Congress: Health-Related \n        Research and Development Activities at USAID (HRRD), May \n        2006'', with a timeline through 2010.\n            (3) Congress notes the interrelated initiatives that USAID \n        has taken to advance science, technology, and innovation for \n        development, including the Grand Development Challenges, the \n        Innovation Fund, Development Innovation Ventures, the \n        Development Lab, and the Innovation Fellowship.\n            (4) Applied research and development at USAID--\n                    (A) facilitates public-private collaboration in the \n                development of global health technologies;\n                    (B) leverages public and private sector support for \n                early stage research and development of health \n                technologies to encourage private sector investment in \n                late-stage technology development and product \n                introduction in developing countries;\n                    (C) benefits the United States economy by investing \n                in the growing United States global health technology \n                sector, which--\n                            (i) provides skilled jobs for American \n                        workers;\n                            (ii) creates opportunities for United \n                        States businesses in the development and \n                        production of new technologies; and\n                            (iii) enhances United States \n                        competitiveness in the increasingly \n                        technological and knowledge-based global \n                        economy; and\n                    (D) enhances United States national security by--\n                            (i) reducing the risk of pandemic disease; \n                        and\n                            (ii) contributing to economic development \n                        and stability in developing countries.\n            (5) Investments by the United States in affordable, \n        appropriate health technologies, such as medical devices for \n        maternal, newborn, and child care; new vaccines; new vaccine \n        technologies and delivery tools; safe injection devices; \n        diagnostic tests for infectious diseases; new tools for water, \n        sanitation, and nutrition; multipurpose prevention \n        technologies; information systems and mobile health and \n        information systems; and innovative disease prevention \n        strategies--\n                    (A) reduce the risk of disease transmission;\n                    (B) accelerate access to life-saving global health \n                interventions for the world's poor;\n                    (C) reduce the burden on local health systems; and\n                    (D) have been found by the United States Government \n                and the World Health Organization to result in \n                significant cost savings for development assistance \n                funds.\n            (6) Product development partnerships (PDPs) are one model \n        that is successfully accelerating research to benefit the \n        developing world. PDPs are non-profit, nongovernmental entities \n        that work to accelerate the development of new tools to fight \n        diseases in resource-poor settings. Typically, PDPs manage \n        resources and partnerships from across public, private, and \n        philanthropic sectors to drive the development of a full \n        pipeline of potential new products that could save and improve \n        lives in the developing world. USAID has played a significant \n        role in advancing the PDP model through its financial support. \n        Over the past decade, the achievements of PDPs have become \n        increasingly successful at advancing new products through the \n        development pipeline towards registration, product \n        introduction, and use.\n            (7) Through a cooperative agreement, known as the Health \n        Technologies program, USAID supports the development of \n        technologies that--\n                    (A) maximize the limited resources available for \n                global health; and\n                    (B) ensure that products and medicines developed \n                for use in low-resource settings reach the people that \n                need such products and medicines.\n        Through the Health Technologies program, 85 technologies have \n        been invented, designed, developed, or co-developed, with many \n        of these technologies moved to global use and billions of units \n        used worldwide. Over its 25-year history, more than 95 private-\n        sector collaborators have been involved in the Health \n        Technologies program, matching USAID dollars two to one.\n            (8) USAID's translational research is complementary to the \n        work of other agencies:\n                    (A) The Quadrennial Development and Diplomacy \n                Review (QDDR) proposes to transition leadership of the \n                Global Health Initiative (GHI) to USAID with a target \n                date of the end of 2012. A core principle of the GHI is \n                ``Research and innovation''.\n                    (B) The Presidential Policy Directive on Global \n                Development identifies innovation as contributing to \n                the resolution of ``long-standing development \n                challenges''.\n                    (C) The QDDR affirms that ``US leadership in \n                science and innovation is often linked to our ability \n                to contribute to a safer, healthier, and more stable \n                world.''.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to codify the cooperative agreement, \nknown as the Health Technologies program, in effect as of the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, under which the United States Agency for \nInternational Development supports the development of technologies for \nglobal health to--\n            (1) improve global health;\n            (2) reduce maternal, newborn, and child mortality rates;\n            (3) reverse the incidence of HIV/AIDS, malaria, \n        tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases;\n            (4) reduce the burden of chronic diseases; and\n            (5) support research and development that is consistent \n        with a global development strategy and other related strategies \n        developed by USAID.\n\nSEC. 4. CODIFICATION OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAM.\n\n    Section 107 the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151e) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) Health Technologies Program.--(1) There is established in the \nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) a health \ntechnologies program (referred to in this subsection as the `program').\n    ``(2) The program shall develop, advance, and introduce affordable, \navailable, and appropriate and primarily late-stage technologies \nspecifically designed to--\n            ``(A) improve the health and nutrition of populations in \n        developing countries;\n            ``(B) reduce maternal, newborn, and child mortality in such \n        countries; and\n            ``(C) improve the diagnosis, prevention, and reduction of \n        disease, especially HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other \n        infectious diseases, in such countries.\n    ``(3) The program shall be carried out under a cooperative \nagreement between USAID and one or more institutions with a successful \nrecord of--\n            ``(A) advancing the technologies described in paragraph \n        (2); and\n            ``(B) integrating practical field experience into the \n        research and development process in order to introduce the most \n        appropriate technologies.\n    ``(4) The provisions of this subsection codify the cooperative \nagreement, known as the Health Technologies program, in effect as of \nthe date of the enactment of this subsection, under which USAID \nsupports the development of technologies for global health.
