FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Each year, nearly 750,000 American teenagers ages 15 \n        through 19 become pregnant, giving the United States the \n        highest teenage pregnancy rate of all industrialized nations.\n            (2) Overall, there has been an impressive decline in teen \n        pregnancy and birth rates since the early 1990s. Between 2005 \n        and 2006, however, teen pregnancy rates increased for the first \n        time in 14 years.\n            (3) Seventy percent of teenagers who become pregnant drop \n        out of high school, and teenage fathers tend to complete, on \n        average, one semester of high school fewer than men who delay \n        fatherhood until they are 21 years or older. Fewer economic \n        opportunities are available to these teenage parents.\n            (4) Some teenagers drop out of school as a result of \n        subsequent pregnancies. In 2006, subsequent pregnancies \n        accounted for 85,000, or almost 20 percent, of all teenage \n        pregnancies.\n            (5) Marginalized racial or ethnic minority and immigrant \n        communities generally have less access to the education, \n        support, and services needed for healthy growth and \n        development, and are at high risk for teenage pregnancy.\n            (6) The high rate of teenage pregnancy in racial or ethnic \n        minority and immigrant communities can lead to a \n        disproportionate dropout rate in those communities. School \n        systems in many such communities lack the funding and expertise \n        to effectively counter high school teenage pregnancy dropout \n        rates.\n            (7) Fifty-two percent of Latina teens and 50 percent of \n        African-American teen girls will become pregnant at least once \n        before they are 20 years old. Birth rates among Latina and \n        African-American youth ages 15 through 17 are more than twice \n        the birth rates of Caucasian youth in the same age range.\n            (8) The 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey contained the \n        surprising finding that sexually active lesbian, gay, and \n        bisexual youth are three times as likely to face an unwanted \n        pregnancy as their heterosexual peers.\n            (9) Only 51 percent of all teenage mothers, and 38 percent \n        of teenage mothers who have a child before they turn 18, have a \n        high school diploma, compared to 89 percent of all other women.\n            (10) Parenthood is a leading cause of school dropout among \n        teenage women. Of all teenage women who have dropped out of \n        high school, 30 percent cited pregnancy or parenthood as a \n        reason they dropped out, including 36 percent of Latina women \n        and 38 percent of African-American women.\n            (11) Two-thirds of all teenage births occur among teenagers \n        ages 18 and 19. Birth rates among women of those ages have \n        declined less significantly than among teenage women of other \n        ages. These older teenage parents would benefit from the \n        increased availability of services at institutions of higher \n        education, particularly at community colleges.\n            (12) The responsibilities of pregnancy and parenting can \n        interfere with the attainment of a college degree. Sixty-one \n        percent of women who have children after enrolling in community \n        college do not graduate. Women who do not have children after \n        enrollment graduate at a 65 percent higher rate than women who \n        do.\n            (13) Comprehensive support through schools, public \n        agencies, and community-based organizations can reduce high \n        school dropout rates and ensure that more pregnant and \n        parenting teenagers complete high school and enroll in \n        institutions of higher education.\n            (14) More data on the prevalence of pregnant and parenting \n        teenagers is needed so that Federal assistance reaches the \n        communities in which it is most needed.\n\nSEC. 3.
