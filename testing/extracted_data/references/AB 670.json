Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nThe state has a very strong interest in protecting its information technology systems from intrusion, because those systems contain confidential information and play a critical role in the performance of the duties of state government. Thus, information regarding the specific vulnerabilities of those systems must be protected to preclude use of that information to facilitate attacks on those systems."
