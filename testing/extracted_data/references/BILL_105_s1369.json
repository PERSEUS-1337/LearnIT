FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 1994, courts in the United States formally processed \n        36,400 truancy cases, representing a 35 percent increase since \n        1990, and a 67 percent increase since 1985, in the formal \n        processing of truancy cases;\n            (2) in 1993, among individuals aged 16 through 24, \n        approximately 3,400,000,000 (11 percent of all individuals in \n        this age group) had not completed high school and were not \n        enrolled in school;\n            (3) the economic and social costs of providing for the \n        increasing population of youth who are at risk of leaving or \n        who have left the educational mainstream are an enormous drain \n        on the resources of Federal, State, and local governments and \n        the private sector;\n            (4) truancy is the first indicator that a young person is \n        giving up and losing his or her way;\n            (5) students who become truant and eventually drop out of \n        school put themselves at a long-term disadvantage in becoming \n        productive citizens;\n            (6) high school drop-outs are two and one-half times more \n        likely to be on welfare than high school graduates;\n            (7) high school drop-outs are almost twice as likely to be \n        unemployed as high school graduates;\n            (8) in 1993, 17 percent of youth under age 18 who entered \n        adult prisons had not completed grade school, one-fourth of \n        such youth had completed 10th grade, and 2 percent of such \n        youth had a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent;\n            (9) truancy contributes to increased use of the foster care \n        and court systems;\n            (10) truancy is a gateway to crime, and high rates of \n        truancy are linked to high daytime burglary rates and high \n        vandalism rates;\n            (11) communities that have instituted truancy prevention \n        programs have seen daytime burglary rates decline by as much as \n        75 percent; and\n            (12) truancy prevention and reduction programs result in \n        significant increases in school attendance.\n\nSEC. 3.
