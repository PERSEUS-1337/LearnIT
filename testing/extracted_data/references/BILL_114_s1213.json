GENERAL RIGHT TO NEUTRALITY OF INTERCONNECTION.\n\n    The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended by \ninserting after section 4 (16 U.S.C. 2603) the following:\n\n``SEC. 5. GENERAL RIGHT TO NEUTRALITY OF INTERCONNECTION.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Distributed energy resources (as defined in \nsection 3 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796)) shall have a \ngeneral right of interconnection under this Act.\n    ``(b) Rates and Fees.--All rates and fees for interconnection of \ndistributed energy resources under this Act, regardless of whether the \ndistributed energy resource is a qualifying facility, shall--\n            ``(1) be just and reasonable;\n            ``(2) provide for the 2-way benefit for the distributed \n        energy resource and the electricity grid;\n            ``(3) shall not exceed the actual cost of service; and\n            ``(4) shall not be punitive.\n    ``(c) Timeframes.--Timeframes for interconnection of distributed \nenergy resources under this Act, regardless of whether the distributed \nenergy resource is a qualifying facility, shall be well-defined, \nexpeditious, and not unduly protracted.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
