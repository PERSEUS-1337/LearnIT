FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Natural disasters cause enormous loss of life. Almost \n        all States and territories are at risk from the effects of 1 or \n        more types of natural disaster. Coastal States and many island \n        States and territories are vulnerable to the hazards of \n        windstorms. All Midwest, Southern, and Mid-Atlantic States are \n        vulnerable to the hazards of tornadoes and thunderstorms and \n        increased building activity is occurring in high-risk areas \n        such as the seashore and ``tornado alley''.\n            (2) Hurricanes, which combine high winds and flooding, and \n        related natural disasters cause enormous loss of life, injury, \n        destruction of property, and economic and social disruption, as \n        evidenced by the 56 deaths and $6,000,000,000 in property \n        damage in 1999 from Hurricane Floyd. From 1990 to 1999 \n        hurricanes caused an average of 14 deaths and $4,970,000,000 in \n        property losses annually while tornadoes and other windstorms \n        caused over 58 deaths and $871,000,000 in property losses \n        annually.\n            (3) Improved windstorm and related hazard reduction \n        measures have the potential over the next 10 years to reduce \n        these losses that will only increase if steps are not taken to \n        help communities reduce their vulnerability. These measures \n        include--\n                    (A) cost-effective and affordable design and \n                construction methods and practices;\n                    (B) effective mitigation programs at the local, \n                State, and national level;\n                    (C) informed land use decisions;\n                    (D) impact prediction methodologies and early \n                warning systems;\n                    (E) application of research results; and\n                    (F) public education and outreach programs.\n            (4) Engineering research needs to address both improving \n        new structures and retrofitting existing ones.\n            (5) There is an appropriate role for the Federal Government \n        in the collection, preparation, coordination, and dissemination \n        of windstorm and related hazards reduction information in order \n        to protect public health and safety and in increasing public \n        awareness of the dangers of these hazards and of affordable \n        steps homeowners can take to preserve life and property. \n        Improved outreach and implementation mechanisms are needed to \n        translate existing information and research findings into \n        usable, state-of-the-art specifications, criteria, and cost-\n        effective practices for design and construction professionals, \n        State and local officials, manufacturers, and the public.\n            (6) An effective Federal program in windstorm and related \n        hazard reduction will require interagency coordination, input \n        from individuals and institutions outside the Federal \n        Government who are expert in the sciences of natural hazards \n        reduction and in the practical application of mitigation \n        measures, and improved mechanisms for the transfer of new \n        knowledge to State and local officials, to homeowners, and to \n        the design and construction industry. Tax credits are an \n        effective incentive for helping homeowners apply mitigation \n        measures.\n            (7) Windstorms and related hazards are a worldwide problem, \n        and international cooperation is desirable for mutual learning \n        and mitigation.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Director'' means the Director of the Office \n        of Science and Technology Policy.\n            (2) The term ``related hazards'' means any naturally \n        destructive environmental phenomena related to windstorms such \n        as flooding, wildfires, and hail, and any major hazard of human \n        origin potentially resulting in similar destruction, including \n        terrorist acts.\n            (3) The term ``State'' means each of the States of the \n        United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of \n        Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American \n        Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and \n        any other territory or possession of the United States.\n            (4) The term ``windstorm'' means any storm with a damaging \n        or destructive wind component, such as a hurricane, tropical \n        storm, tornado, or thunderstorm.\n\nSEC. 4.
