MORTGAGE CREDIT RISK SHARING PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) at the direction of FHFA, the enterprises have entered \n        into transactions to transfer credit risk they assume by \n        guaranteeing the payment of principal and interest on \n        securities backed by certain residential mortgage loans; and\n            (2) credit risk transfer transactions should be encouraged \n        that reduce taxpayer exposure to credit risk assumed by an \n        enterprise and do not expose an enterprise to excessive \n        counterparty risk.\n    (b) Establishment.--Subject to the requirements of this section, \nthe Director shall require each enterprise to establish a Mortgage \nCredit Risk Sharing Pilot Program (in this section referred to as the \n``Pilot Program'').\n    (c) Pilot Program Requirements.--Under the Pilot Program, FHFA \nshall direct each enterprise to, each quarter beginning with the first \nquarter following the end of the 9-month period beginning on the date \nof the enactment of this Act, conduct risk-sharing transactions that \nprovide for an enterprise to share credit risk on a pool of single-\nfamily residential mortgage loans that back securities on which the \nenterprise guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest with \nthe private sector. Such transactions shall meet the following \nrequirements:\n            (1) Targeted loans.--Credit risk shall be transferred on \n        targeted loans. Targeted loans are residential mortgage loans \n        that--\n                    (A) are single family residential mortgage loans;\n                    (B) are not the result of an excluded refinancing, \n                as determined by FHFA; and\n                    (C) are a representative sample of the unpaid \n                principal balance loans eligible for the to-be-\n                announced market.\n            (2) Losses transferred through the pilot program.--\n                    (A) In general.--Each enterprise shall transfer to \n                the private sector--\n                            (i) either all or the majority of the \n                        aggregate risk shared on a pari passu basis of \n                        the expected and unexpected loss on the unpaid \n                        principal balance on the transactions; and\n                            (ii) a target of at least 10 percent in a \n                        vertical position of the risk of all of the \n                        catastrophic credit loss on the unpaid \n                        principal balance on the transactions.\n                    (B) Authority of the director.--The Director may \n                permit an enterprise to transfer less than 10 percent \n                in a vertical position of the risk of catastrophic \n                credit loss during a transition period, up until 15 \n                months after the date of the enactment of this Act, to \n                compliance with the 10 percent target of the Pilot \n                Program.\n                    (C) Treatment of catastrophic risk.--Risk of \n                catastrophic credit loss shall be transferred on a pari \n                passu basis.\n            (3) Scope of the pilot program.--The Director shall require \n        that credit risk on at least 5 percent of new acquisitions, as \n        defined by the Director, of targeted loans described in \n        paragraph (1) shall be transferred through the Pilot Program. \n        Each enterprise may vary the percentage of new acquisitions of \n        targeted loans transferred through the Pilot Program, provided \n        that the average annual percentage over each year of the Pilot \n        Program is not less than 5 percent.\n            (4) Measurements.--In carrying out the Pilot Program, FHFA \n        shall measure the credit risk and the amount of risk \n        transferred.\n            (5) Additional requirements.--In carrying out the Pilot \n        Program, the enterprises shall--\n                    (A) collect and disclose loan-level data on each of \n                the mortgage loans backing the credit risk \n                transactions, including consumer credit score \n                information and the loan-to-value ratio of the loan; \n                and\n                    (B) refine transaction structure designs to improve \n                execution.\n    (d) Promotion of Market for Credit Risk Transactions.--With respect \nto all credit risk transfer transactions of an enterprise, including \nany transaction under the Pilot Program, the Director shall do the \nfollowing:\n            (1) Work to ensure a secondary market for credit risk \n        transfer products that will give investors as deep and liquid a \n        market.\n            (2) Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment \n        of this Act, in consultation with the Securities Exchange \n        Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and any \n        Federal banking agency as appropriate, issue a report to the \n        Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives \n        and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the \n        Senate that provides recommendations on how to incentivize \n        additional sources of private capital to participate in credit \n        risk transfer transactions, including regulatory actions taken \n        and recommendations for legislative proposals to remove \n        impediments to such participation. Nothing in the preceding \n        sentence is intended to prevent or delay FHFA or another agency \n        from developing and implementing a regulatory action to remove \n        any impediment to or incentivize such participation prior to \n        issuance of such report as authorized under current law.\n            (3) Require the enterprises to make 60 percent of mortgages \n        available to be subject to credit risk transactions in the \n        first fiscal year after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n        70 percent in the second fiscal year after such date of \n        enactment, and 80 percent in the third fiscal year after such \n        date of enactment.\n    (e) Capital Standards.--\n            (1) In general.--The Director may set capital or collateral \n        requirements for participants in the Pilot Program.\n            (2) Use of certain capital markets transactions.--In \n        setting capital standards under paragraph (1), the Director \n        shall allow participants to prudently reduce or eliminate any \n        capital requirements for credit-risk sharing transactions \n        through the use of capital markets transactions that pre-fund \n        the risk, including credit-linked notes.\n    (f) Economic Considerations.--If the Director of the FHFA and the \nSecretary of the Treasury determine that the Pilot Program is \neconomically unreasonable due to housing market conditions, the \nDirector may lower the percentage amounts specified under subsection \n(c)(2), (c)(3), or (d)(1)(C).\n    (g) FHFA Reports.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n        Director shall provide a report to the Committee on Financial \n        Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n        Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate containing--\n                    (A) information on credit risk transfer transaction \n                pricing on quarterly basis;\n                    (B) the amount of credit risk that has been \n                transferred from the enterprises on a quarterly basis;\n                    (C) metrics and annual goals regarding the Pilot \n                Program;\n                    (D) the percentage of the unpaid principal balance \n                of mortgage loans covered under the Pilot Program in \n                each year;\n                    (E) a description of how the FHFA intends to move \n                forward with mortgage insurance focused transactions \n                following the recently finalized mortgage insurance \n                master policy requirements and private mortgage insurer \n                eligibility requirements, and how the FHFA evaluates \n                the remaining counterparty risk with mortgage insurers;\n                    (F) a description of new credit risk transfer pilot \n                programs that FHFA intends an enterprise to undertake \n                over the next three years and steps FHFA intends to \n                take to solicit new ideas for new and innovative ways \n                to transfer credit risk away from the enterprises and \n                the taxpayers, including transfers of expected, \n                unexpected, and catastrophic credit loss; and\n                    (G) a description of how FHFA plans to transition \n                from credit risk sharing pilot programs to a regular \n                standardized program of credit risk transfers that \n                establish a stable and liquid market for mortgage \n                credit risk.\n            (2) Solicitation of public feedback.--In preparing any \n        report required under paragraph (1), the Director shall solicit \n        public feedback, including feedback to--\n                    (A) generate new potential forms of credit risk \n                transfer;
