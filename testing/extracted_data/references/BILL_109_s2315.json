FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Methamphetamine addiction is a growing epidemic in the \n        United States.\n            (2) Existing programs within the Federal Government do not \n        specifically target methamphetamine use in an effective manner, \n        considering the widespread use of the drug.\n            (3) The existing drug policy of the Federal Government \n        focuses on the impact of marijuana as a gateway drug rather \n        than methamphetamine.\n            (4) Methamphetamine use impacts a variety of Federal and \n        State services, from child welfare to addiction, treatment, and \n        housing costing taxpayers millions of dollars every year.\n            (5) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n        Administration found in 2004 that 1,400,000 persons ages 12 and \n        older used methamphetamine in the past year.\n            (6) Precursor chemicals for the production of \n        methamphetamine vary widely and are easily accessible across \n        the United States.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to prevent the spread \nof methamphetamine through the establishment of a competitive grant \nprogram to identify successful methamphetamine education and awareness \ncampaigns.\n\nSEC. 3.
