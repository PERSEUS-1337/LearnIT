    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Vessel Discharge Evaluation and \nReview Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Starting with passage of the Act to Prevent Pollution \n        from Ships in 1980, the United States Coast Guard has been the \n        principal Federal authority charged with administering, \n        enforcing, and prescribing regulations relating to the \n        discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged in maritime \n        commerce and transportation.\n            (2) There are more than 16 million State-registered boats, \n        110,000 commercial fishing vessels, and 53,000 freight and tank \n        barges operating in United States waters. Since 1973 certain \n        discharges incidental to the normal operation of these vessels \n        have been exempted from regulation.\n            (3) When required, Congress has specifically mandated \n        Federal programs for control of discharges from vessels, \n        including--\n                    (A) the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 \n                U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980;\n                    (B) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention \n                and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.);\n                    (C) the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (16 \n                U.S.C. 4701 note); and\n                    (D) section 1401 of the 2000 Omnibus Consolidated \n                and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal \n                Year 2001, which prevented discharge of treated sewage \n                and graywater in certain areas of Alaska.\n\nSEC. 3. EVALUATION AND REVIEW OF CERTAIN DISCHARGES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in consultation \nwith the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and the \nhead of any other appropriate agency or department of the United \nStates, shall conduct an evaluation and review of vessel discharges, \nother than aquatic nuisance species, that are described in section \n122.3(a) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on \nJanuary 5, 1989. The evaluation shall include--\n            (1) a characterization of the various types and composition \n        of such discharges by different classes of vessels;\n            (2) the volumes of such discharges for representative \n        individual vessels and by classes of vessels in the aggregate;\n            (3) an analysis of current technologies or best management \n        practices, and their associated costs, used to control such \n        discharges;\n            (4) an analysis of the extent to which such discharges are \n        currently subject to regulation under existing Federal laws or \n        binding international obligations of the United States;\n            (5) the locations of such discharges;\n            (6) analyses and conclusions as to the nature and extent of \n        potential effects of such discharges on human health, welfare, \n        and the environment;\n            (7) an analysis of practicable measures, including best \n        management practices, to control such discharges; and\n            (8) recommendations as to steps, including regulatory \n        changes, together with a schedule for implementation, that are \n        appropriate to address such discharges.\n    (b) Public Comment.--The Commandant shall--\n            (1) publish a draft report containing findings, \n        conclusions, and recommendations from the evaluation and review \n        required by subsection (a) in the Federal Register;\n            (2) accept public comments regarding such draft for a \n        period of not less than 120 days after the date the draft is \n        published in the Federal Register; and\n            (3) consider any such public comments in the preparation of \n        the final report.\n    (c) Final Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Commandant shall prepare and submit to the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House \nof Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure a \nfinal report containing findings, conclusions, and recommendations from \nthe evaluation and review required by subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4. DISCHARGES INCIDENTAL TO NORMAL OPERATION OF VESSELS.\n\n    (a) Statement of Purpose.--The purposes of this section are--\n            (1) to provide for the establishment of nationally uniform, \n        environmentally sound, standards for discharges incidental to \n        the normal operation of vessels; and\n            (2) to establish procedures for designation of no discharge \n        zones as necessary to protect waters within the jurisdiction of \n        a State from the effects of discharges incidental to the normal \n        operation of vessels.\n    (b) Evaluation and Review of Certain Discharges.--Subtitle B of the \nNonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 \nU.S.C. 4711 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 1105.
