FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Nation's 361 seaports are considered a major \n        terrorist target. Al Qaeda has strong ties to the shipping \n        industry and one of the aims of this terrorist network is to \n        weaken the economic security of our country.\n            (2) The Nation's coastline is our longest border, which is \n        a 95,000-mile coast that includes the Great Lakes and inland \n        waterways.\n            (3) Protecting America's seaports is critical to the \n        Nation's economic growth and vitality. Seaports handle 95 \n        percent of our Nation's overseas trade by volume, support the \n        mobilization and deployment of the Armed Forces, and serve as \n        transit points for millions of cruise and ferry passengers.\n            (4) Maritime industries contribute $742,000,000,000 per \n        year to our Gross National Product.\n            (5) The United States Coast Guard has issued final \n        regulations that call for an immediate and long-term investment \n        in the security of our seaports.\n            (6) According to the United States Coast Guard, \n        implementing these regulations will cost $1,125,000,000 in the \n        first year and $5,450,000,000 over 10 years.\n            (7) Given the Nation's economic dependence on our seaports \n        and our ongoing national security concerns, seaport security \n        funding and the need for Federal support for the Nation's \n        security should be ongoing.\n            (8) Given the enormity of the seaport capital \n        infrastructure projects, Congress needs to establish a multi-\n        year seaport grant program that resembles the Letter of Intent \n        measures established in the aviation security program.\n            (9) The continuing security and economic needs that face \n        the Nation and our seaports should be recognized by the \n        implementation of this Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
