FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The countries of the Western Hemisphere have enjoyed \n        more success in the twentieth century in the peaceful conduct \n        of their relations among themselves than have the countries in \n        the rest of the world.\n            (2) The economic prosperity of the United States and its \n        trading partners in the Western Hemisphere is increased by the \n        reduction of trade barriers.\n            (3) Trade protection endangers economic prosperity in the \n        United States and throughout the Western Hemisphere and \n        undermines civil liberty and constitutionally limited \n        government.\n            (4) The successful establishment of a North American Free \n        Trade Area sets the pattern for the reduction of trade barriers \n        throughout the Western Hemisphere, enhancing prosperity in \n        place of the cycle of increasing trade barriers and deepening \n        poverty that results from a resort to protectionism and trade \n        retaliation.\n            (5) The reduction of government interference in the foreign \n        and domestic sectors of a nation's economy and the concomitant \n        promotion of economic opportunity and freedoms promote civil \n        liberty and constitutionally limited government.\n            (6) Countries that observe a consistent policy of free \n        trade, the promotion of free enterprise and other economic \n        freedoms (including effective protection of private property \n        rights), and the removal of barriers to foreign direct \n        investment, in the context of constitutionally limited \n        government and minimal interference in the economy, will follow \n        the surest and most effective prescription to alleviate poverty \n        and provide for economic, social, and political development.\n\nSEC. 3. FREE TRADE AREA FOR THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.\n\n    \n    (a) In General.--The President shall take action to initiate \nnegotiations to obtain trade agreements with the sovereign countries \nlocated in the Western Hemisphere, the terms of which provide for the \nreduction and ultimate elimination of tariffs and other nontariff \nbarriers to trade, for the purpose of promoting the eventual \nestablishment of a free trade area for the entire Western Hemisphere.\n    (b) Reciprocal Basis.--An agreement entered into under subsection \n(a) shall be reciprocal and provide mutual reductions in trade barriers \nto promote trade, economic growth, and employment.\n    (c) Bilateral or Multilateral Basis.--Agreements may be entered \ninto under subsection (a) on a bilateral basis with any foreign country \ndescribed in that subsection or on a multilateral basis with all of \nsuch countries or any group of such countries.\n\nSEC. 4. FREE TRADE WITH FREE CUBA.\n\n    (a) Restrictions Prior to Restoration of Freedom in Cuba.--The \nprovisions of this Act shall not apply to Cuba unless the President \ncertifies to Congress that--\n            (1) freedom has been restored in Cuba; and\n            (2) the claims of United States citizens for compensation \n        for expropriated property have been appropriately addressed.\n    (b) Standards for the Restoration of Freedom in Cuba.--The \nPresident shall not make the certification that freedom has been \nrestored in Cuba, for purpose of subsection (a), unless the President \ndetermines that--\n            (1) a constitutionally guaranteed democratic government has \n        been established in Cuba with leaders chosen through free and \n        fair elections;\n            (2) the rights of individuals to private property have been \n        restored and are effectively protected and broadly exercised in \n        Cuba;\n            (3) Cuba has a currency that is fully convertible \n        domestically and internationally;\n            (4) all political prisoners have been released in Cuba; and\n            (5) the rights of free speech and freedom of the press in \n        Cuba are effectively guaranteed.\n    (c) Priority for Free Trade With Free Cuba.--Upon making the \ncertification described in subsection (a), the President shall give \npriority to the negotiation of a free trade agreement with Cuba.\n\nSEC. 5.
