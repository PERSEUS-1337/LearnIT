    "content": "Since the mid-1950s, Congress has added numerous provisions to the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) that authorize education and training programs for various health, medical, and nursing professionals. The programs, consolidated in Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA, provide grants, scholarships, and loans to individuals and institutions in order to increase the supply of professionals in health care, medicine, and nursing. Title VII programs support individuals who study to become primary care physicians, dentists, public health, and allied health professionals. Also, institutions that train these individuals are eligible for grants to support the development of education and training opportunities through endeavors such as multidisciplinary collaborative efforts and community partnerships. Title VIII programs support individuals in the study of nursing and enhance the ability of institutions to sustain nursing workforce programs. Major health reform legislation enacted in 2010 includes amendments to Title VII and Title VIII that add, delete or modify program authorities. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers Title VII and Title VIII programs. Discretionary funding for these programs is provided in the annual appropriations act for the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education (Labor-HHS-ED). The FY2010 enacted appropriations for Title VII and Title VIII programs are $254.1 million and $243.9 million, respectively, for a total of $498.0 million. In addition, a portion of the supplemental funds provided through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) is available for FY2010.  Major provisions enacted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) amended Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA to revise existing authorities or create new ones. Implementation of the discretionary programs authorized in PPACA will depend on future appropriations actions.  After reviewing the status of authorizations for Title VII and Title VIII programs, this report summarizes the appropriations history for the period from FY2001 through FY2010, together with the FY2011 President's budget request. Table 1 provides an appropriations history for Title VII; Table 2 , an appropriations history for Title VIII; and Table 3 , a consolidation of program totals for Title VII and Title VIII. Appendix A provides details about plans within HRSA to distribute ARRA funds in FY2009 and FY2010 for Title VII and Title VIII programs. Appendix B summarizes the sections of PPACA that amend various sections in Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA.  Before PPACA was enacted in March 2010, statutory authorities for Title VII and Title VIII programs had been amended numerous times since their initial passage. For Title VII, the Health Education Partnerships Act of 1998 ( P.L. 105-392 ) had been the most recent reauthorizing legislation, authorizing appropriations for many programs through FY2002. The same law also extended appropriations authority for most Title VIII programs through FY2002. Subsequently, authorizations for some, but not all, Title VIII programs had been extended through FY2007 in the Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-205 ). In the 111 th Congress, multiple provisions of PPACA added, eliminated, or revised program authorities in each of Title VII and Title VIII, including new or extended authorization of appropriations for selected programs (see Appendix B ).  On February 1, 2010, President Barack Obama presented the FY2011 budget, requesting a total of $503.9 million for Title VII and Title VIII programs. The amount is an increase of $5.9 million (1.2%) above the $498.0 million enacted in the FY2010 appropriations for these programs. The FY2010 enacted appropriations for Title VII and Title VIII programs are $254.1 million and $243.9 million, respectively. PPACA provided no supplemental FY2010 appropriations for Title VII and Title VIII programs. For FY2009, Congress appropriated funds for Title VII and Title VIII programs in two separate enactments. Regular appropriations of $392.7 million were provided in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. A supplemental appropriation of $200 million for health, medical, and nursing workforce programs was added by ARRA. Of that $200 million, the Secretary has allocated $148.5 million to Title VII and Title VIII programs, and $50 million for equipment to enhance the training of health professionals. Unlike regular appropriations, most ARRA funds are available for obligation over two fiscal years, through September 30, 2010. As shown in Appendix A , HRSA obligated about one-third ($68.2 million) of the $200 million in FY2009, leaving about two-thirds ($131.8 million) for obligation in FY2010. President Obama's FY2011 budget request would provide a total of $260.0 million for Title VII programs, representing an increase of $5.9 million (2.3%) above the FY2010 appropriation of $254.1 million. All currently funded programs would receive level funding, except for the Workforce Information and Analysis program, which would be increased from $2.8 million to $8.8 million.   Table 1 presents Title VII appropriations for health and medical professions training programs for the period from FY2001 through FY2010, together with President Obama's FY2011 budget request. During the period from FY2001 through FY2010, total annual appropriations for Title VII programs fluctuated significantly, from a high of $308.4 million in FY2003 to a low of $145.1 million in FY2006. Throughout much of this period, the George W. Bush Administration sought to eliminate funds for most Title VII programs, but Congress generally restored funding. Funding for several progams was eliminated starting in FY2006, including Health Education and Training Centers, Workforce Information and Analysis, and Health Administration Traineeships and Special Projects. However, Workforce Information and Analysis received renewed funding in FY2010. President Obama's FY2011 budget request would provide $243.9 million for Title VIII programs, which is equal to the FY2010 enacted appropriation. The request would maintain current levels of funding for each of six authorized programs.  Table 2 presents Title VIII appropriations for nursing programs from FY2001 through FY2010, together with President Obama's FY2011 budget request. During the period from FY2001 through FY2009, appropriations for Title VIII programs increased by 104%, from $83.8 million to $171.0 million. In the FY2010 appropriation, Congress boosted Title VIII funding by an additional 43% over the FY2009 regular appropriation. The Public Service Announcements program (PHSA Sections 851 and 852) is the only program authorized in P.L. 107-205 that has received no funding.  Table 3 compiles total appropriations for Title VII and Title VIII programs for FY2001 through FY2010, and shows President Obama's FY2011 budget request. Appendix A details HRSA's planned obligations of $200 million in ARRA funding over FY2009 and FY2010. Appendix B summarizes the sections of the health care reform legislation that added, deleted or modified selected authorities in Title VII and Title VIII. Appendix A.
