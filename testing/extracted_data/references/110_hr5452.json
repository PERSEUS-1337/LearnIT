STATE OCEAN AND COASTAL RENEWABLE ENERGY PLANNING.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \n1451 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 306A the following:\n\n ``ocean and coastal renewable energy state surveys; renewable energy \n                    site identification and planning\n\n    ``Sec. 306B.  (a) Grants to States.--The Secretary may make grants \nto eligible coastal States to support voluntary State efforts to \ninitiate and complete surveys of portions of coastal State waters and \nFederal waters adjacent to a State's coastal zone, in consultation with \nthe Minerals Management Service, to identify potential areas suitable \nor unsuitable for the exploration, development, and production of \nrenewable energy that are consistent with the enforceable policies of \ncoastal management plans approved pursuant to section 306(d).\n    ``(b) Survey Elements.--Surveys developed with grants under this \nsection shall include consideration of--\n            ``(1) hydrographic and bathymetric surveys;\n            ``(2) oceanographic observations and measurements of the \n        physical ocean environment, especially seismically active \n        areas;\n            ``(3) identification and characterization of significant or \n        sensitive marine ecosystems or other areas possessing important \n        conservation, recreational, ecological, historic, or aesthetic \n        values;\n            ``(4) surveys of existing marine uses in the outer \n        Continental Shelf and identification of potential conflicts;\n            ``(5) inventories and surveys of shore locations and \n        infrastructure capable of supporting renewable energy \n        development;\n            ``(6) inventories and surveys of offshore locations and \n        infrastructure capable of supporting renewable energy \n        development; and\n            ``(7) other matters as may be necessary.\n    ``(c) Participation and Cooperation.--To the extent practicable, \ncoastal States shall provide opportunity for the participation in \nsurveys under this section by relevant Federal agencies, State \nagencies, local governments, regional organizations, port authorities, \nand other interested parties and stakeholders, public and private, that \nis adequate to develop a comprehensive survey.\n    ``(d) Guidelines.--The Secretary shall, within 180 days after the \ndate of enactment of this section and after consultation with the \ncoastal States, publish guidelines for the application for and use of \ngrants under this section.\n    ``(e) Annual Grants.--For each of fiscal years 2009 through 2012, \nthe Secretary may make a grant to a coastal State under this section if \nthe coastal State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary \nthat the grant will be used to develop a renewable energy survey \nconsistent with the requirements set forth in this section.\n    ``(f) Grant Amounts.--The amount of any grant under this section \nshall not exceed $750,000 for any fiscal year.\n    ``(g) State Match.--\n            ``(1) Before fiscal year 2011.--The Secretary shall not \n        require any State matching fund contribution for grants awarded \n        under this section for any fiscal year before fiscal year 2011.\n            ``(2) After fiscal year 2011.--The Secretary shall require \n        a coastal State to provide a matching fund contribution for a \n        grant under this section for surveys of a State's coastal \n        waters, according to--\n                    ``(A) a 2-to-1 ratio of Federal-to-State \n                contributions for fiscal year 2011; and\n                    ``(B) a 1-to-1 ratio of Federal-to-State \n                contributions for fiscal year 2012.\n            ``(3) Limitation.--The Secretary shall not require any \n        matching funds for surveys of Federal waters adjacent to a \n        State's coastal zone.\n    ``(h) Secretarial Review.--After an initial grant is made to a \ncoastal State under this section, no subsequent grant may be made to \nthat coastal State under this section unless the Secretary finds that \nthe coastal State is satisfactorily developing its survey.\n    ``(i) Limitation on Eligibility.--No coastal State is eligible to \nreceive grants under this section for more than 3 fiscal years.\n    ``(j) Applicability.--This section and the surveys conducted with \nassistance under this section shall not be construed to convey any new \nauthority to any coastal State, or repeal or supersede any existing \nauthority of any Federal agency, to regulate the siting, licensing, \nleasing, or permitting of renewable energy facilities in areas of the \nouter Continental Shelf under the administration of the Federal \nGovernment.
