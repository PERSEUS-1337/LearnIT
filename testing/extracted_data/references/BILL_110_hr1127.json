FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The competitiveness of manufacturing industries in the \n        United States must be a priority for the United States \n        Government.\n            (2) Antidumping and countervailing duty laws of the United \n        States are in the interest of the United States, when applied \n        in an objective and fair manner, to prevent unfair pricing and \n        subsidized competition.\n            (3) Imposing antidumping and countervailing duties may harm \n        United States industrial users of imported goods or domestic \n        like products, because those users rely on such goods to \n        manufacture products in the United States.\n            (4) Current law does not permit United States industrial \n        users to participate fully in antidumping or countervailing \n        duty cases that might affect their businesses substantially; \n        nor can decisionmakers in these cases consider, under United \n        States law, the effects on United States industrial users in \n        determining whether to impose antidumping or countervailing \n        duties.\n            (5) It is a matter of fundamental fairness that businesses \n        in the United States that may be affected by antidumping and \n        countervailing duties should be able to participate \n        meaningfully in the process by which decisions regarding those \n        duties are made.\n            (6) In order to ensure economically sound decisions and the \n        health of United States manufacturers, the benefits of imposing \n        antidumping and countervailing duties should be balanced \n        against the economic harm caused by imposing those duties, and \n        antidumping and countervailing duties should not be imposed if \n        the harm is greater than the benefits of imposing such duties.\n\nSEC. 3. PARTICIPATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN COUNTERVAILING AND \n              ANTIDUMPING DUTY PROCEEDINGS.\n\n    Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.) is \namended as follows:\n            (1) Section 701(a) (19 U.S.C. 1671(a)) is amended--\n                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph \n                (1);\n                    (B) by adding ``and'' after ``merchandise for \n                importation,'' at the end of paragraph (2);
