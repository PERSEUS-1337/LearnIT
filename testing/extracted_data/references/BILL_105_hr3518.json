CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The use of fixed allocations of joint multipurpose \n        project costs and the failure to provide for the recovery of \n        actual interest costs and depreciation have resulted in \n        substantial failures to recover costs properly recoverable \n        through power rates by the Federal Power Marketing \n        Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority and have \n        resulted in the imposition of unreasonable burdens on the \n        taxpaying public.\n            (2) Existing under allocations and under recovery of costs \n        have led to inefficiencies in the marketing of Federally \n        generated electric power and to environmental damage.\n            (3) With the emergence of open access to power transmission \n        and competitive bulk power markets, market prices will provide \n        the lowest reasonable rates consistent with sound business \n        principles, consistent with maximum recovery of costs properly \n        allocated to power production and consistent with encouraging \n        the most widespread use of power marketed by Federal Power \n        Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide for full cost recovery rates \nfor power sold by Federal Power Marketing Administrations and the \nTennessee Valley Authority and a transition to market-based rates for \nsuch power.\n\nSEC. 4. MODIFICATION OF EXISTING POWER MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS.\n\n    (a) Accounting.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nSecretary of Energy shall, in consultation with the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, immediately upon enactment of this Act develop \nand implement procedures to ensure that the Federal Power Marketing \nAdministrations utilize the same accounting principles and \nrequirements, including those with respect to the accrual of actual \ninterest costs during construction and pending repayment for any \nproject and recognition of depreciation expenses, as are applied by the \nCommission to the electric operations of public utilities.\n    (b) Development and Submittal of Rates to the Commission.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, each Federal Power \nMarketing Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority shall, not \nlater than 1 year after enactment of this Act (and periodically \nthereafter but not less frequently than once each 5 years), submit to \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rates for the sale or \ndisposition of Federal energy that will ensure the recovery of all \ncosts incurred by such Federal Power Marketing Administration or the \nTennessee Valley Authority for the generation and marketing of such \nFederal energy. Such costs shall include all fish and wildlife \nexpenditures required under existing treaty and legal obligations \nassociated with the construction and operation of the facilities from \nwhich the federally marketed power is generated and sold. Such costs \nshall not include any cost of transmitting such Federal energy.\n    (c) Commission Review, Approval or Modification.--The Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission shall review and either approve of or \nmodify rates for the sale or disposition of Federal energy submitted to \nthe Commission by each Federal Power Marketing Administration and the \nTennessee Valley Authority under this section, to ensure that such \nrates will recover all costs of generating and marketing such Federal \nenergy (including all fish and wildlife costs associated with such \nFederal energy as required under existing treaty and legal obligations, \nbut not including any cost of transmitting such Federal energy). Such \nreview by the Commission shall be based on the record of proceedings \nbefore the Federal Power Marketing Administration or the Tennessee \nValley Authority, except that all persons shall be afforded an \nopportunity by the Commission for an additional hearing in accordance \nwith the procedures established for ratemaking by the Commission \npursuant to the Federal Power Act.\n    (d) Application of Rates.--Immediately upon approval or \nmodification by the Commission of rates under this section for the sale \nor disposition of Federal energy by a Federal Power Marketing \nAdministration or the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Federal Power \nMarketing Administration shall apply such rates, as approved or \nmodified by the Commission, to each existing contract for the sale or \ndisposition of Federal energy by such Federal Power Marketing \nAdministration or the Tennessee Valley Authority to the maximum extent \npermitted by such contract. This section shall not apply to any Federal \nPower Marketing Administration or the Tennessee Valley Authority if and \nat such time as it no longer has any outstanding commitments under any \ncontract for the sale or disposition of Federal energy that were in \nexistence as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (e) Accounting Principles and Requirements.--In developing or \nreviewing the rates required by this section, the Federal Power \nMarketing Administrations, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the \nCommission shall rely upon the accounting principles and requirements \ndeveloped pursuant to subsection (a).\n    (f) Interim Rates.--Until market pricing for such power sales is \nfully implemented, such full cost recovery rates shall be implemented \nfor all new contracts for power sales by the Federal Power Marketing \nAdministrator and the Tennessee Valley Authority entered into after the \nenactment of this Act and for renewals after the enactment of this Act \nfor existing contracts for power sales by Federal Power Marketing \nAdministrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n    (g) Transition to Market-Based Rates.--If the transition to full \ncost recovery rates would result in rates that exceed market rates, the \nSecretary of Energy is authorized to price power sold by Federal Power \nMarketing Administrations at market rates, and the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority is authorized to price power sold by the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority at market rates, if--\n            (1) operation and maintenance costs are recovered, \n        including all fish and wildlife costs required under existing \n        treaty and legal obligations;\n            (2) the contribution toward recovery of investment \n        pertaining to power production is maximized; and\n            (3) purchasers of power under existing contracts consent to \n        the remarketing by the relevant Federal Power Marketing \n        Administration or the Tennessee Valley Authority of such power \n        not later than 3 years thereafter through competitive bidding.\nCompetitive bidding shall be utilized to remarket power that is not \naccepted by existing customers under this section.\n    (h) Market-Based Pricing.--Within 2 years after the enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary of Energy shall develop and implement \nprocedures to assure that all power sold by Federal Power Marketing \nAdministrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority is sold at prices \nset by demand and supply within the relevant bulk power supply market. \nThe Secretary of Energy shall establish through notice and comment \nrulemaking bid and auction procedures to implement market-based pricing \nfor power sold pursuant to any power sales contract entered into by a \nFederal Power Marketing Administration or the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority after the date 2 years after the enactment of this Act, \nincluding power that is under contract but which is declined by the \nparty entitled to purchase such power and remarketed after such date.\n    (i) Use of Revenues Collected Through Market-Based Pricing.--\n            (1) In general.--Revenues collected through market-based \n        pricing shall be disposed of as follows:\n                    (A) Revenues shall be remitted to the Secretary of \n                the Treasury, first, to cover all power-related \n                operations and maintenance expenses, all fish and \nwildlife costs required under existing treaty and legal obligations, \nand the project investment cost pertaining to power production.\n                    (B) Such revenues as shall remain after remission \n                to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to \n                subparagraph (A) shall be divided as follows:\n                            (i) 50 percent of such revenues shall be \n                        remitted to the Secretary of the Treasury for \n                        the purpose of reducing the Federal budget \n                        deficit.\n                            (ii) 35 percent of such revenues shall be \n                        deposited in the fund established under \n                        paragraph (2)(A) for the purpose of helping \n                        cover the costs of mitigating the damage to, \n                        and restoring the health of, fish, wildlife, \n                        and other environmental resources that is \n                        attributable to the construction and operation \n                        of the facilities from which power is generated \n                        and sold.\n                            (iii) 15 percent of such revenues shall be \n                        deposited in the fund established under \n                        paragraph (3)(A) for the purpose of helping \n                        cover the costs of the incremental cost (above \n                        the expected market cost of electricity) of \n                        nonhydroelectric renewable resources in the \n                        region in which power is marketed by the \n                        applicable power marketing administration.\n            (2) Fund regarding environmental mitigation.--\n                    (A) There is hereby established a fund to hold and \n                expend the revenues allocated for environmental \n                mitigation and restoration pursuant to paragraph \n                (1)(B)(ii). The fund shall be established within the \n                Department of Interior and shall be governed by a Board \n                of Directors consisting of the Secretary of the \n                Interior, the Secretary of Energy, and the \n                Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or \n                their designees. Other than expenditure of revenues to \n                cover the costs of establishing and managing the fund, \n                all revenues may be spent only pursuant to project-\n                specific plans to mitigate damage to, and restore the \n                health of, the environment.\n                    (B) At no time may the fund established under \n                subparagraph (A) hold more than $200,000,000 that is \n                not necessary to cover the costs of 1 or more project-\n                specific mitigation plans. Revenues that would \n                otherwise be deposited in the fund but for the absence \n                of 1 or more project-specific plans for environmental \n                mitigation shall be remitted to the Secretary of the \n                Treasury for purposes of Federal budget deficit \n                reduction.\n                    (C) The Board of Directors of the fund established \n                under subparagraph (A) shall develop project-specific \n                mitigation plans for each project used to generate \n                power marketed by the power marketing administrations \n                or the Tennessee Valley Authority. In developing such \n                plans, the Board is directed, where feasible, to rely \n                on data, information, and mitigation and restoration \n                plans already developed by the United States Bureau of \n                Reclamation, the United States Fish and Wildlife \n                Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other \n                Federal, State, and tribal agencies.\n            (3) Fund regarding renewable resources.--\n                    (A) There is hereby established a fund to hold and \n                expend the revenues allocated for renewable resources \n                pursuant to paragraph (1)(B)(iii). The fund shall be \n                established within the Department of Energy. Revenues \n                in the fund may be expended to pay for the incremental \ncosts of nonhydroelectric renewable resources in the States in which \nthe applicable power marketing administration markets power. Other than \nexpenditure of revenues to cover the costs of establishing and managing \nthe fund, all revenues may be spent only--\n                            (i) pursuant to a plan developed by the \n                        Secretary of Energy designed to foster the \n                        development of nonhydroelectric renewable \n                        resources that show substantial long-term \n                        promise but which are presently too expensive \n                        to attract private capital sufficient to \n                        develop or ascertain their potential; and\n                            (ii) on recipients chosen by a process of \n                        competitive bidding.\n                    (B) At no time may the fund established under \n                subparagraph (A) hold more than $50,000,000 that is not \n                necessary to meet the plan developed pursuant to such \n                subparagraph. Revenues that would otherwise be \n                deposited in this fund but for the absence of such a \n                plan shall be remitted to the Secretary of the Treasury \n                for purposes of Federal budget deficit reduction.\n    (j) Preference.--Public bodies and cooperatives shall be given a \npreference to future power allocations or reallocations of Federal \npower through a right of first refusal at market prices. Power obtained \nthrough preference rights shall be consumed by the preference customer \nor resold for consumption by the constituent end-users of the \npreference customer and may not be resold to other entities. As \nregulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, preference \nrecipients shall have transmission access to this purchased power. If a \npublic body or cooperative does not take allocation, the next highest \nbidder takes the allocation.\n    (k) Reforms.--The Secretary of Energy shall require each Federal \nPower Marketing Administration to implement--\n            (1) program management in order to assign personnel and \n        incur expenses for authorized power marketing, reclamation, and \n        flood control activities only, and not diversification into \n        ancillary activities including consulting or operating services \n        for other entities; and\n            (2) annual reporting plainly disclosing to the American \n        public, the activities of the Power Marketing Administration \n        including, but not limited to, the full cost of such power \n        projects and power marketing programs.\n    (l) Contract Renewal.--After the enactment of this Act, no Federal \nPower Marketing Administration may enter into or renew any power \nmarketing contract for a term that exceeds 5 years.\n    (m) Restrictions.--Excepting only the Bonneville Power \nAdministration, each Federal Power Marketing Administration shall be \nsubject to the restrictions on the construction of transmission and \nadditional facilities established by section 5 of the Flood Control Act \nof 1944.\n\nSEC. 5. FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION JURISDICTION OVER \n              TRANSMISSION SERVICE PROVIDED BY POWER MARKETING \n              ADMINISTRATIONS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY.\n\n    Transmission service provided by Federal Power Marketing \nAdministrations shall be provided on an open access basis and at just \nand reasonable rates approved or established by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission under part II of the Federal Power Act in the \nsame manner as such service is provided pursuant to Commission rules by \nany public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under \nsuch Part II. The preceding sentence shall not require any Federal \nPower Marketing Administration to expand transmission or \ninterconnection capabilities or transmissions in the absence of other \nauthority of law.\n\nSEC. 6. IMPLEMENTATION BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION.\n\n    Pending the implementation of market-based pricing, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission shall have authority to review and \napprove, reject, or revise power rate schedules recommended for \napproval by the Secretary of Energy, and existing rate schedules, for \npower sales by the Federal Power Marketing Administrations. The Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission shall base its approval of final rates \nupon the protection of the public interest and shall undertake to \nprotect the interest of the taxpaying public as well as the interests \nof consumers in accordance with section 4. The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission may review the factual basis for determinations \nmade by the Secretary of Energy and may revise or modify those findings \nas appropriate and may revise proposed or effective rate schedules or \nremand the rate schedules to the Secretary of Energy as the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission determines is necessary to protect the \npublic interest in accordance with section 4 until a full transition is \nmade to market-based rates for power sold by Federal Power Marketing \nAdministrations. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is authorized \nto proceed pursuant to informal notice and comment rulemaking pursuant \nto section 553(c) of title 5, United States Code. Any affected party, \nincluding a taxpayer, bidder, preference customer, or affected \ncompetitor may seek a rehearing and judicial review of a final decision \nof the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to section 313 of \nthe Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 8251).\n\nSEC. 7. REPEALS.\n\n    The following provisions are repealed:\n            (1) The last sentence of section 302(a)(3) of the \n        Department of Energy Organization Act.\n            (2) Section 505 of Public Law 102-377.\n\nSEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Act, the \nprovisions of this Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \neffect with respect to power sales contracts entered into by a Federal \nPower Marketing Administration or the Tennessee Valley Authority after \nJuly 23, 1997."
