FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) American kindergarten through grade 12 schools spend \n        over $6,000,000,000 annually on energy costs, which is more \n        than is spent on books and computers combined.\n            (2) Approximately 25,000,000 students are attending schools \n        with at least 1 unsatisfactory environmental condition.\n            (3) Educators teach and students learn best in an \n        environment that is comfortable, healthy, naturally lit where \n        possible, and in good repair, and studies have indicated that \n        student achievement is greater and attendance higher when those \n        conditions are met.\n            (4) Over half of our Nation's kindergarten through grade 12 \n        schools are more than 40 years old and in need of renovation to \n        reach such standard of efficiency and comfort, and 6,000 new \n        schools will be required over the next 10 years to accommodate \n        the growing number of students.\n            (5) Inadequate ventilation in school buildings, poor \n        lighting and acoustical quality, and uncomfortable temperatures \n        can cause poor health and diminish students' capacity to \n        concentrate and excel.\n            (6) Inefficient use of water, either in consumption or from \n        poorly maintained systems, is prevalent in older schools.\n            (7) Using a whole building approach in the design of new \n        schools and the renovation of existing schools (considering how \n        materials, systems, and products connect and overlap and also \n        how a school is integrated on its site and within the \n        surrounding community) will result in healthy and high \n        performance school buildings.\n            (8) Adoption of whole building concepts has been shown to \n        result in dramatic improvements in student and teacher \n        performance.\n            (9) Adopting a whole building approach usually results in a \n        lower life cycle cost for the school building than for a \n        conventionally designed and built building.\n            (10) Systematic use of energy conservation in school \n        construction and renovation projects can save at least one \n        quarter of current energy costs, leaving more money for \n        teachers and educational materials.\n            (11) The use of renewable energy sources such as \n        daylighting, solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass \n        power in a building already designed to be energy-efficient can \n        help meet the building's energy needs without added emissions.\n            (12) Using environmentally preferable products and \n        providing for adequate supplies of fresh air will improve \n        indoor air quality and provide healthful school buildings.\n            (13) Most school districts do not have the knowledge of \n        cutting-edge design and technologies to integrate optimum \n        efficiency and environmentally healthy designs into new school \n        construction or into school renovations.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to assist local \neducational agencies in the production of high performance elementary \nschool and secondary school buildings that are healthful, productive, \nenergy-efficient, and environmentally sound.\n\nSEC. 3.
