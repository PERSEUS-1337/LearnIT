FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Urban communities are disproportionately impacted by \n        water quality degradation and aquatic habitat loss.\n            (2) Local residents in urban communities can and should be \n        supported and empowered to revitalize and restore the urban \n        streams, rivers, lakes, and wetlands in their neighborhoods.\n            (3) Water quality and watershed programs in urban areas \n        must create new and diverse jobs for youths and other \n        unemployed workers in order to ensure the long-term \n        participation of urban communities within these programs.\n            (4) A range of biological techniques, including \n        revegetation and other methods, have been demonstrated to be \n        effective in restoring urban waters, but have been \n        underutilized and underfunded in municipal stormwater and \n        watershed management programs.\n            (5) Loss of species diversity and the invasion of exotic \n        species negatively impact estuarine habitat and can be \n        addressed through projects that enhance the diversity of \n        indigenous plant and animal communities.\n            (6) Lack of public access to waterways and riparian \n        parkland fosters human isolation from and disinterest in urban \n        watersheds. Access to waterways can and should be created in \n        urban neighborhoods when and where appropriate.\n            (7) The Nation benefits by supporting citizen monitoring \n        and local initiatives to protect and prevent further \n        degradation of urban waterways.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To enable local citizen and government organizations in \n        urban areas to undertake, with Federal, State, and private \n        assistance, urban watershed restoration programs which are \n        consistent with existing watershed and estuarine restoration \n        plans and existing Federal regulatory programs.\n            (2) To restore both small and large urban waterbodies to \n        become oases of beauty, recreation, sustenance, and renewal for \n        their communities.\n            (3) To achieve the goals of the Federal Water Pollution \n        Control Act in the most degraded and neglected urban areas; \n        specifically, to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, \n        and biological integrity of urban waters and watersheds, \n        including restoration and maintenance of water quality, a \n        balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and \n        wildlife, aquatic and riparian vegetation, and recreational \n        activities in and on the water, and to protect designated uses, \n        including fishing, swimming, and drinking water supply.\n            (4) To support the formation of, and provide the funds for, \n        small local and minority-owned businesses and nonprofit citizen \n        organizations focused on providing urban watershed restoration \n        jobs, services, and products for persons and communities in \n        degraded urban watershed areas.\n            (5) To promote development of careers in urban watershed \n        restoration and related fields, as well as environmental \n        education, for youths.\n            (6) To create urban watershed restoration project \n        opportunities for State and local conservation or service \n        corps.\n            (7) To encourage the coordination of urban watershed \n        restoration projects and municipal stormwater and combined \n        sewer overflow permit programs.\n            (8) To increase public access to urban waterways and to \n        increase the amount of urban estuarine and riparian parkland \n        available for passive recreation.\n            (9) To promote the use of physical restoration of urban \n        waterways as a means to low-cost stormwater management.\n            (10) Creation of new wetland and riparian environments as \n        part of a multiobjective stormwater management system in which \n        the created wetlands, stream channels, and riparian zones \n        provide stormwater storage, detention, retention, nutrient \n        filtering, wildlife habitat, and increase biological diversity.\n\nSEC. 4.
