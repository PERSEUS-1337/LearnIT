FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Iraq's ability to establish stability and security \n        within its borders and defeat terrorist organizations is \n        significantly affected by the actions of neighboring nations \n        and by regional conflicts and events, while other nations in \n        the region have a vested interest in achieving a resolution to \n        the conflict in Iraq.\n            (2) On December 6, 2006, the first recommendation released \n        by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group was that the United States, \n        working with the Iraqi Government, should launch a \n        comprehensive New Diplomatic Offensive to deal with the \n        problems in Iraq and in the region before December 31, 2006.\n            (3) The Iraq Study Group recommended the following specific \n        goals for the New Diplomatic Offensive:\n                    (A) Support the unity and territorial integrity of \n                Iraq.\n                    (B) Stop destabilizing interventions and actions by \n                Iraq's neighbors.\n                    (C) Secure Iraq's borders, including the use of \n                joint patrols with neighboring countries.\n                    (D) Prevent the expansion of the instability and \n                conflict in Iraq beyond its borders.\n                    (E) Promote economic assistance, commerce, trade, \n                political support, and, if possible, military \n                assistance for the Iraqi Government from non-\n                neighboring Muslim nations.\n                    (F) Energize countries to support national \n                political reconciliation in Iraq.\n                    (G) Validate Iraq's legitimacy by resuming \n                diplomatic relations, where appropriate, and \n                reestablishing embassies in Baghdad.\n                    (H) Assist Iraq in establishing active working \n                embassies in key capitals in the region (for example, \n                in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n                    (I) Help Iraq reach a mutually-acceptable agreement \n                on Kirkuk.\n                    (J) Assist the Iraqi Government in achieving \n                certain security, political, and economic milestones, \n                including better performance on issues such as national \n                reconciliation, equitable distribution of oil revenues, \n                and the dismantling of militias.\n            (4) The Iraq Study Group recommended regional involvement \n        in the diplomatic efforts of stabilizing Iraq and the Middle \n        East, including involvement of the five permanent members of \n        the United Nations Security Council.\n            (5) On July 22, 2004, the bipartisan National Commission on \n        Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as the \n        ``9/11 Commission'') recommended the United States should \n        engage other nations in developing a comprehensive coalition \n        strategy against Islamist terrorism in the Middle East.\n            (6) President George W. Bush and his Administration have \n        already undertaken critical elements of such a diplomatic \n        effort, including diplomatic talks with key Iraqi neighbors in \n        Sharm-al-Sheik, Egypt and in Baghdad, Iraq in May 2007, as well \n        as proposing a comprehensive Middle East peace conference.\n            (7) Despite these positive actions, significantly more \n        robust diplomatic effort is needed to establish international \n        consensus on achieving security and stability in Iraq, \n        promoting national reconciliation efforts in Iraq, supporting \n        the reconstruction of Iraq, and supporting the sovereignty and \n        territorial integrity of the Iraqi nation.\n\nSEC. 3.
