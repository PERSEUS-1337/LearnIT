FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The amount of paperwork special education teachers are \n        required to complete is burdensome, takes valuable time away \n        from the classroom, and undermines the goal of providing the \n        best quality education possible to all children.\n            (2) Special education teachers spend an average of 5 hours \n        per week on paperwork, compared to general education teachers \n        who spend an average of 2 hours per week on paperwork.\n            (3) The average length of an individualized education \n        program (referred to in this Act as an ``IEP''), 1 of the \n        biggest sources of paperwork, is between 8 and 16 pages.\n            (4) More than 60 percent of special education teachers \n        spend between \\1/2\\ to 1\\1/2\\ days a week completing paperwork, \n        according to a survey by the Council for Exceptional Children \n        conducted in 2000. Though special education teachers believe \n        IEPs are essential to providing quality instruction to students \n        with disabilities, they say IEPs need to be streamlined and \n        more relevant to their students' educational needs.\n            (5) 83 percent of special education teachers report \n        spending from \\1/2\\ to 1\\1/2\\ days each week in IEP-related \n        meetings, and special education teachers estimate they spend 4 \n        hours planning before each IEP meeting, according to the \n        Council for Exceptional Children.\n            (6) 14 percent of special education teachers spend 1 hour \n        or less per week on paperwork while 24 percent spend 1.5 to 3 \n        hours and 8 percent spend 14 hours or more on paperwork.\n            (7) 53 percent of special education teachers report that, \n        to a great extent, their routine duties and paperwork interfere \n        with their interaction with their students.\n            (8) The causes of burdensome paperwork for special \n        education teachers include--\n                    (A) Federal regulations;\n                    (B) misconceptions at State and local levels \n                regarding Federal regulations, resulting in additional \n                State and local requirements; and\n                    (C) litigation and the threat of litigation.\n            (9) The benefits of mediation as an alternative to lawsuits \n        for special education disputes are the following:\n                    (A) Mediation can be a more constructive option for \n                special education children, parents, and teachers \n                because it allows families to maintain a positive \n                relationship with teachers and service providers and \n                parents have the benefit of working together with \n                educators and service providers as partners instead of \n                as adversaries.\n                    (B) Parents and children, most likely, will have \n                their concerns addressed much more quickly through \n                mediation than through litigation.\n                    (C) Mediation is a much less costly alternative for \n                families and school districts.\n                    (D) Mediation often results in agreements with \n                which both parties are satisfied and the parties tend \n                to carry out the terms of the agreement, for example, \n                in Pennsylvania, 85 percent of special education \n                mediations end in agreement.\n\nSEC. 3.
