FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1)(A) the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 split the Federal \n        budgeting process into two budget categories, one for receipts \n        and mandatory spending and the other for discretionary \n        spending; and\n            (B) each budget category has its own rules, procedures, and \n        incentives;\n            (2) the taxes deposited into the Highway Trust Fund are in \n        the mandatory category, but most spending from the Highway \n        Trust Fund is in the discretionary category;\n            (3) since the Highway Trust Fund is split between the two \n        budget categories, the link between Highway Trust Fund taxes \n        and transportation spending is severed; and\n            (4) to reestablish the link between the taxes and spending \n        of the Highway Trust Fund, all the components of the Highway \n        Trust Fund should be part of the same budget category and \n        subject to the same budget rules and procedures.\n\nSEC. 3.

BUDGETARY IMPACT.\n\n    (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n            (1) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n                    (A) the United States has substantial surface \n                transportation and infrastructure needs; and\n                    (B) this Act will result in additional spending \n                from the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund to \n                help address these substantial needs.\n            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to clarify \n        that any budgetary offset necessary because of the additional \n        spending provided by this Act should not come from surface \n        transportation programs.\n    (b) Sequestration.--The budgetary impact of the amendments made by \nthis Act shall not be considered for purposes of sequestration under \nsections 251 or 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \nControl Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901, 902).\n    (c) Discretionary Spending Limitations.--OMB shall reduce \ndiscretionary spending limits for budget authority and outlays in \naccordance with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \nof 1985 for each applicable fiscal year set forth in section \n601(a)(2)--\n            (1) for budget authority, by an amount equal to the total \n        amount of discretionary budget authority provided from the \n        Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund in the Department of \n        Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997; \n        and\n            (2) for outlays, by an amount equal to an estimate of the \n        amount of discretionary outlays that would be expended from the \n        Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund assuming that the \n        total amount of new budget authority and obligation authority \n        from the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund equaled the \n        amounts of new budget authority and obligation authority \n        provided from the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund in \n        the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \n        Appropriations Act, 1997.\n\nSEC. 6. STUDY TO ENSURE THAT THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND IS DEFICIT NEUTRAL.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is the policy of the United States Government that \n        the Highway Trust Fund should not contribute to or reduce the \n        Federal Government's annual budget deficit.\n            (2) Under current budgetary scorekeeping conventions used \n        by both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of \n        Management and Budget, increases in Highway Trust Fund revenue \n        generated by tax increases are partially offset by a reduction \n        in other Federal revenues that is equal to 25 percent of the \n        increase in Highway Trust Fund revenue.\n            (3) This 25 percent offset is a scorekeeping convention \n        that applies to all excise taxes, and is not uniquely applied \n        to Highway Trust Fund taxes.\n            (4) An up-to-date examination of how this offset should be \n        applied to Highway Trust Fund taxes is needed.\n    (b) Report.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 24 months after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Treasury, in \n        consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and \n        Budget, shall submit a report to Congress on ensuring the \n        deficit neutrality of the Highway Trust Fund.\n            (2) Contents.--In the report, the Secretary shall--\n                    (A) determine the extent to which each of the taxes \n                deposited into the Highway Trust Fund is a deductible \n                expense from other Federal taxes;\n                    (B) provide an estimate of the amount of Highway \n                Trust Fund taxes that were deducted from Federal income \n                taxes or other taxes;\n                    (C) provide an estimate of the annual revenue loss \n                because Highway Trust Fund taxes are deductible from \n                other Federal taxes;\n                    (D) determine the appropriate scorekeeping \n                convention that should apply to Highway Trust Fund \n                taxes, or if needed, separately to each of the taxes \n                now deposited into the Highway Trust Fund; and\n                    (E) provide the Congress with policy options that \n                would ensure that changes to the Highway Trust Fund \n                taxes do not contribute to the deficit."
