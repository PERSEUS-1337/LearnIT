FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) An estimated 80 million Americans have a potentially \n        blinding eye disease, and more than 19.1 million Americans \n        report trouble seeing, even with eye glasses or contacts. At \n        least 1.1 million Americans are legally blind, and 200,000 \n        Americans experience profound vision loss. Refractive errors \n        affect approximately one third of persons 40 years or older in \n        the United States. Visual impairment is one of the 10 more \n        frequent causes of disability in the United States.\n            (2) While it is believed that half of all blindness can be \n        prevented, the number of Americans who are blind or visually \n        impaired is expected to double by 2030.\n            (3) Vision loss can, especially without appropriate \n        rehabilitation and skills training, significantly impact an \n        individual's ability to conduct activities of daily living, as \n        well as developmental learning, communicating, working, health, \n        and quality of life.\n            (4) One in twenty preschoolers experience visual impairment \n        which, if unaddressed, can affect learning ability, \n        personality, and adjustment in school.\n            (5) It is estimated that blindness and visual impairment \n        cost the Federal Government more than $4 billion annually in \n        benefits and lost taxable income, and cost the United States \n        economy approximately $51.4 billion annually in direct medical \n        costs, direct non medical costs, and indirect costs such as \n        lost productivity and wages.\n            (6) Vision rehabilitation helps people with vision loss to \n        live safely and independently at home and in the community, \n        reduce medication errors, cook and perform other daily \n        activities reliably, and avoid accidents which may lead to \n        injury or even the onset of additional disabilities, especially \n        among older persons living with vision loss.\n            (7) Recognizing that the Nation requires a public health \n        approach to visual impairment, the Department of Health and \n        Human Services dedicated a portion of its Healthy People 2010 \n        initiative to vision. The initiative set out as a goal the \n        improvement of the Nation's visual health through prevention, \n        early detection, treatment, and rehabilitation.\n            (8) Greater efforts must be made at the Federal, State, and \n        local levels to increase awareness of vision loss and its \n        causes, its impact, the importance of early diagnosis, \n        treatment, and rehabilitation, and effective prevention \n        strategies.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nNation must have a full-scale integrated public health strategy to \ncomprehensively address vision loss and its causes that, at a minimum, \nincludes the following:\n            (1) Communication and education.\n            (2) Surveillance, epidemiology, and prevention research.\n            (3) Programs, policies, and systems change.\n\nSEC. 3. VISION LOSS PREVENTION.\n\n    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 317S the following:\n\n``SEC. 317T.
