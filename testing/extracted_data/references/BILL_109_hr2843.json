FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In issuing remote control railroad operation guidelines \n        in 2001, the Federal Railroad Administration noted that its \n        ``first priority . . . is to ensure that these operations pose \n        no threat to railroad workers or the general public''.\n            (2) The Nation's freight rail system is relatively open to \n        outside access when compared to the aviation system. Security \n        is provided almost solely by private railroad carriers, and \n        terrorists could easily gain access to a remote control \n        locomotive or an operator control unit and then operate a \n        remote control transmitter controlling a remote control \n        locomotive.\n            (3) Remote control locomotives carrying hazardous materials \n        in urban areas could be sabotaged or remote control locomotives \n        could be used to cause intentional accidents with other trains, \n        causing loss of life, release of hazardous materials, and the \n        disruption of interstate and international commerce.\n            (4) Therefore, the risk of terrorists hijacking remote \n        control locomotive operations is far too great in situations \n        where remote control locomotives are carrying hazardous \n        materials.\n\nSEC. 2. REMOTE CONTROL LOCOMOTIVE USE.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--No railroad carrier shall operate or cause to be \noperated on the general system of railroad transportation a remote \ncontrol locomotive to carry hazardous materials.\n    (b) Penalty.--(1) A railroad carrier that knowingly violates this \nsection or a rule issued under this section is liable to the United \nStates Government for a civil penalty of at least $5,000 but not more \nthan $50,000 for each violation. A railroad carrier acts knowingly \nwhen--\n            (A) the railroad carrier has actual knowledge of the facts \n        giving rise to the violation; or\n            (B) a reasonable railroad carrier acting in the \n        circumstances and exercising reasonable care would have that \n        knowledge.\n    (2) A separate violation occurs for each day the violation \ncontinues.\n\nSEC. 3. REMOTE CONTROL TRANSMITTER SECURITY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue a \nrule requiring that--\n            (1) railroad carriers inventory and maintain a continuous \n        accounting of remote control transmitters;\n            (2) such transmitters be assigned only to personnel with \n        proper identification and authorization to use such devices; \n        and\n            (3) such transmitters be kept in a secure location (under \n        lock and key) when not in use.\n    (b) Penalty.--A railroad carrier that violates the rule issued \nunder subsection (a) shall be liable to the United States Government \nfor a civil penalty of at least $5,000 for each occurrence.\n\nSEC. 4. REMOTE CONTROL LOCOMOTIVE SECURITY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue a \nrule requiring that the manual operational control area of any remote \ncontrol locomotive be kept under lock and key when such locomotive is \noperated without personnel of the railroad carrier present.\n    (b) Penalty.--A railroad carrier that violates the rule issued \nunder subsection (a) shall be liable to the United States Government \nfor a civil penalty of at least $5,000 for each occurrence.\n\nSEC. 5. CIVIL PENALTIES.\n\n    (a) Hearing Requirement.--The Secretary of Transportation may find \nthat a railroad carrier has violated this Act only after notice and an \nopportunity for a hearing. The Secretary shall impose a civil penalty \nunder this Act by giving the railroad carrier written notice of the \namount of the penalty.\n    (b) Penalty Consideration.--In determining the amount of a civil \npenalty under this Act, the Secretary shall consider--\n            (1) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the \n        violation;\n            (2) with respect to the violator, the degree of \n        culpability, any history of prior violations, the ability to \n        pay, and any effect on the ability to continue to do business; \n        and\n            (3) other matters that justice requires.\n    (c) Civil Actions to Collect.--The Attorney General may bring a \ncivil action in an appropriate district court of the United States to \ncollect a civil penalty under this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. CRIMINAL PENALTY.\n\n    (a) In General.--A railroad carrier knowingly violating this Act \nshall be fined under title 18, United States Code, imprisoned for not \nmore than 5 years, or both; except that the maximum amount of \nimprisonment shall be 10 years in any case in which the violation \ninvolves the release of a hazardous material that results in death or \nbodily injury to any person.\n    (b) Knowing Violations.--For purposes of this section--\n            (1) a railroad carrier acts knowingly when--\n                    (A) the railroad carrier has actual knowledge of \n                the facts giving rise to the violation; or\n                    (B) a reasonable railroad carrier acting in the \n                circumstances and exercising reasonable care would have \n                that knowledge; and\n            (2) knowledge of the existence of a statutory provision, or \n        a regulation or a requirement issued by the Secretary of \n        Transportation, is not an element of an offense under this Act.\n\nSEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) the term ``hazardous material'' has the meaning given \n        that term in section 5102(2) of title 49, United States Code;\n            (2) the term ``railroad carrier'' has the meaning given \n        that term in section 20102 of title 49, United States Code;\n            (3) the term ``remote control locomotive'' means a \n        locomotive which, through use of a radio transmitter and \n        receiver system, can be operated by a person not physically \n        located at the controls within the confines of the locomotive \n        cab, but does not include a locomotive that is remotely \n        controlled from the lead locomotive of the same train; and\n            (4) the term ``remote control transmitter'' means the \n        transmitter component of a remote control locomotive system."
