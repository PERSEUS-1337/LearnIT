PURPOSES.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) intensify research that may result in improved \n        understanding of or treatments for diseases and other adverse \n        health conditions; and\n            (2) promote the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines \n        without the creation of human embryos for research purposes or \n        discarding, destroying, or knowingly harming a human embryo.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Altered nuclear transfer.--The term ``altered nuclear \n        transfer'' means a method for obtaining pluripotent stem cells \n        using a modified form of somatic cell nuclear transfer to \n        produce a biological artifact.\n            (2) Biological artifact.--The term ``biological artifact'' \n        means an artificially created non-embryonic cellular system, \n        engineered to lack the essential elements of embryogenesis but \n        still capable of some cell division and growth.\n            (3) Direct reprogramming of adult cells.--The term ``direct \n        reprogramming of adult cells'' means a procedure whereby \n        differentiated, somatic cells are restored to a more \n        undifferentiated, multipotent condition. Such process is also \n        known as ``dedifferentiation''.\n            (4) Embryo adoption.--The term ``embryo adoption'' means \n        the occurrence of a woman receiving into her uterus a human \n        embryo or embryos to which neither she nor her partner has \n        contributed a gamete for the purpose of child bearing.\n            (5) Embryonic stem cells.--The term ``embryonic stem \n        cells'' means primitive cells derived from the inner cell mass \n        of the human embryo or embryos, that have the potential to \n        become a wide variety of specialized cell types.\n            (6) Human embryo or embryos.--The term ``human embryo or \n        embryos'' includes any organism, not protected as a human \n        subject under part 46 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, \n        as of the date of enactment of this section, that is derived by \n        fertilization, parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means \n        from one or more human gametes or human diploid cells.\n            (7) In vitro fertilization.--The term ``in vitro \n        fertilization'' means the union of an egg and sperm, where the \n        event takes place outside the body and in an artificial \n        environment.\n            (8) Oocyte.--The term ``oocyte'' means an unfertilized \n        human egg cell.\n            (9) Organismically dead embryo.--The term ``organismically \n        dead embryo'' means the irreversible loss of the capacity of \n        continued and integrated cellular division, growth and \n        differentiation.\n            (10) Pluripotent cell.--The term ``pluipotent cell'' means \n        a cell that can produce all the cell types of the developing \n        body. Embryonic stem cells, as well as the inner cell mass \n        cells of the blastocyst, are pluripotent cells.\n            (11) Pluripotent stem cells.--The term ``pluripotent stem \n        cells'' means precursor cells that are capable both of \n        perpetuating themselves as stem cells and of producing all or \n        almost all the cell types of the developing body, and that have \n        functional capacity (stable pluripotency) as an embryonic stem \n        cell, though not necessarily the same origin.\n            (12) Review board.--The term ``Review Board'' means the \n        National Stem Cell Review Board established under section 5.\n            (13) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Health and Human Services.\n            (14) Stem cell line.--The term ``stem cell line'' means \n        stem cells which have been cultured under in vitro conditions \n        that allow proliferation without differentiation from months to \n        years.\n\nSEC. 4.
