    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Continued Dumping or Subsidy Offset \nAct of 1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS OF CONGRESS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Consistent with the rights of the United States under \n        the World Trade Organization, injurious dumping is to be \n        condemned and actionable subsidies which cause injury to \n        domestic industries must be effectively neutralized.\n            (2) United States unfair trade laws have as their purpose \n        the restoration of conditions of fair trade so that jobs and \n        investment that should be in the United States are not lost \n        through false market signals.\n            (3) The continued dumping or subsidization of imported \n        product after the issuance of antidumping orders or findings or \n        countervailing duty orders can frustrate the remedial purpose \n        of the laws by preventing market prices from returning to fair \n        levels.\n            (4) Where dumping or subsidization continues, domestic \n        producers will be reluctant to reinvest or rehire and may be \n        unable to maintain pension and health care benefits that \n        conditions of fair trade would permit. Similarly, small \n        businesses and America's farmers and ranchers may be unable to \n        pay down accumulated debt, to obtain working capital or \n        otherwise remain viable.\n            (5) United States trade laws should be strengthened to see \n        that the remedial purpose of the laws is achieved in fact.\n\nSEC. 3.
