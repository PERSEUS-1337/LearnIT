FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) American Latinos are an ethnically and racially diverse \n        population. Still, whether known by the term ``Hispanic'' or \n        ``Latino,'' or by the various national identities from which \n        they obtain their ethnicity, American Latinos share a common \n        heritage rooted in the mixture of the cultures of the \n        indigenous peoples of the American continent, of the European \n        colonizers from Spain, and of Africans who were brought to \n        those colonies as slaves.\n            (2) While the history of the United States formally dates \n        from 1776, American civilization was already centuries old by \n        then. Latinos were present on the continent for more than 200 \n        years prior to the Declaration of Independence. Spanish \n        colonists founded the first permanent settlement on future \n        United States territory in St. Augustine, Florida in 1565. \n        Indigenous nations that had thrived for centuries prior to the \n        landing of Columbus would later mix with colonists of various \n        ethnicities from Spain to create a third culture, one that \n        continues to thrive in various forms throughout the Americas \n        today.\n            (3) Since before our Nation's founding, Latinos have come \n        to this land searching for opportunity, prosperity, and chance. \n        In this regard, not much has changed in over 3 centuries. \n        Through every era of our Nation's history, whether in the \n        fields of plenty or on the field of battle, a Latino presence \n        was felt. Since before the early colonization of the west, \n        Latinos have labored under the harsh sun to put food on \n        America's tables. From the earliest days of American industry, \n        Latinos have worked in our factories. Through every war and \n        conflict, Latinos have served honorably and proudly next to \n        their fellow Americans to defend the ideals of freedom, \n        democracy, and liberty worldwide, earning countless awards for \n        valor and sacrifice.\n            (4) The history, art, politics, economy, and culture of the \n        United States have been enriched since the Nation's founding by \n        the influence of American Latinos and their traditions and \n        innovations. Both native and foreign-born Latinos in the United \n        States continue to make significant contributions to the arts \n        and humanities, academia, and the popular culture that have \n        benefited all Americans.\n            (5) According to the Bureau of the Census, the population \n        of American Latinos recently grew to become the largest \n        demographic minority group in the country. As of July 2002, \n        there were an estimated 38.8 million Latinos in the United \n        States. One out of every three of these is under the age of 18, \n        and four out of every 10 is under the age of 25. The \n        youthfulness and rapid growth of this population ensure that \n        American Latinos will have a substantial role in American life \n        ranging from public policy to popular entertainment. Greater \n        understanding of this role will benefit all of American \n        society.\n            (6) The American Latino population historically has been \n        concentrated in certain regions of the United States. In the \n        last several decades, however, there has been more dispersed \n        growth of the community throughout the entire country. In the \n        southern states other than Texas, most have seen the population \n        of Latinos, primarily immigrants, double between the years 1990 \n        and 2000, adding to the mixture of cultures already there as \n        these individuals adapt to Southern life.\n            (7) Despite the history and demography as well as the \n        ongoing contributions that American Latinos make to the \n        cultural life of the United States, there remains a great gap \n        in the level and quality of awareness that other Americans \n        possess about the rich and diverse character of Latino culture \n        and history. Sometimes the lack of awareness manifests itself \n        in the development of stereotypes or misconceptions about \n        Latinos. Greater effort is needed at a national level to \n        educate other Americans about Latinos, and to celebrate and \n        disseminate information about Latino arts and history. \n        Americans of all backgrounds benefit from greater understanding \n        of the diversity that exists in the United States.\n            (8) The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest \n        museum and research complex, with 16 museums in the District of \n        Columbia and New York City. The Smithsonian Institution \n        museums, especially those on the National Mall, play a unique \n        and important role in educating visitors to the Nation's \n        capital about our history, arts, and culture. The American \n        people and international visitors recognize the Smithsonian \n        Institution as the premier American museum, representing the \n        vast diversity of cultural history of the United States.\n            (9) After extensive dialogue, conferences, and \n        collaboration among educators, scholars, and community leaders, \n        as well as museums, universities, cultural, and public \n        institutions, a task force appointed to examine the Smithsonian \n        Institution's representation of American Latinos in its \n        permanent exhibits and other public programs published \n        ``Willful Neglect: The Smithsonian Institution and U.S. \n        Latinos'' (May 1994) and ``Toward a Shared Vision: U.S. Latinos \n        and the Smithsonian Institution'' (October 1997). The reports \n        indicate that the Smithsonian historically had a poor record of \n        representing Latinos. This criticism led to the creation of the \n        Smithsonian's Center for Latino Initiatives in 1998.\n            (10) The Center for Latino Initiatives has increased the \n        profile of Latino arts and culture and should be commended for \n        promoting diversity and understanding of American Latino \n        culture by the Smithsonian's patrons. The Center's short \n        history has shown that American Latino exhibits and programs \n        are well received by the public and by the Latino community, \n        which benefits from having some representation at the \n        Smithsonian. Still, the level of representation at the \n        Smithsonian of the Latino community is far from where it should \n        be given American Latino history, demography, and contributions \n        to the American cultural landscape.\n            (11) For these reasons, it is necessary to establish a \n        commission to draft a plan of action for creating a National \n        Museum of the American Latino within the Smithsonian \n        Institution, on or near the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\n\nSEC. 3.
