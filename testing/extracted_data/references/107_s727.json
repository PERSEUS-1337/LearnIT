FINDINGS.\n\n    ``The Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Teaching school children to perform the life-saving \n        skill of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), to identify and \n        respond to choking victims, and to recognize the signs of \n        stroke can improve their confidence in responding to an \n        emergency and can encourage continued efforts to update these \n        skills after graduation, thereby potentially reducing the rate \n        of death from sudden cardiac arrest, choking and stroke.\n            ``(2) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the \n        United States.\n            ``(3) 220,000 Americans die each year of sudden cardiac \n        arrest.\n            ``(4) The American Heart Association estimates that the \n        lives of 50,000 cardiac arrest victims could be saved each year \n        through initiating a course of action known as the `chain of \n        survival'.\n            ``(5) The chain of survival includes prompt notification of \n        emergency services and early CPR, defibrillation, and advanced \n        cardiac life support.\n            ``(6) An important part of United States school children's \n        education is learning healthy behaviors, including proper \n        nutrition and physical activity. This health education should \n        also include basic emergency life-saving skills.\n            ``(7) Incorporating these lifesaving training programs into \n        the health curriculum of elementary and secondary schools will \n        give school children these skills.\n\n``SEC. 1273.
