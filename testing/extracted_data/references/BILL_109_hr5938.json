The rate among adolescents aged \n        12 to 19 more than tripled, increasing from 5 percent to 17.1 \n        percent.\n            (3) An estimated 61 percent of overweight young people have \n        at least 1 additional risk factor for heart disease, such as \n        high cholesterol or high blood pressure. In addition, children \n        who are overweight are at greater risk for bone and joint \n        problems, sleep apnea, and social and psychological problems \n        such as stigmatization and poor self-esteem.\n            (4) According to the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, obesity-related illnesses cost this nation \n        approximately $117,000,000,000 per year in increased health \n        care costs. This includes $61,000,000,000 in direct medical \n        costs for treatment of related diseases and $56,000,000,000 in \n        indirect costs such as lost productivity.\n            (5) A report released by Trust for America's Health, \n        entitled ``F as in Fat: How Obesity Policies are Failing in \n        America'', found that the United States does not have an \n        aggressive, coordinated national strategy needed to address \n        this crisis.\n\nSEC. 3.
