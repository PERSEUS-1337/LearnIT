FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) International humanitarian law codifies the principle \n        of medical neutrality in the Geneva Conventions, to which the \n        United States is a signatory, during times of national or \n        international armed conflict, which offer special protections \n        to medical facilities and personnel. These provisions recognize \n        ambulances, hospitals, hospital ships, the personnel serving in \n        ambulances and hospitals, citizens who assist the wounded as \n        neutral and protected during conflict.\n            (2) The Geneva Conventions specify that the wounded and \n        sick shall receive adequate care, be protected from ill-\n        treatment, and be protected from discrimination, and that \n        emblems such as the red cross and red crescent are recognized \n        as protective emblems in conflict. Many parts of the Geneva \n        Conventions have been declared by the International Committee \n        on the Red Cross (ICRC) to be customary international \n        humanitarian law.\n            (3) International human rights law further expands norms of \n        medical neutrality during the absence of an armed conflict. \n        Article 25 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and \n        Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social \n        and Cultural Rights, to which the United States is a signatory, \n        establish the right to health.\n    (b) Statement of Congress.--Congress affirms its support of \nparticipants of peaceful demonstrations around the world, as part of \nthe United States' support for freedom of assembly as enshrined in the \nUnited States Constitution. The United States takes particular umbrage \nat countries that harm or endanger medical professionals during times \nof unrest.\n\nSEC. 3.
