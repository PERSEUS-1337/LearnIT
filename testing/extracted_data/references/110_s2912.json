    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Sportsmanship in Hunting Act of \n2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The ethic of hunting involves the consideration of fair \n        chase, which allows the animal the opportunity to avoid the \n        hunter.\n            (2) At more than 1,000 commercial canned hunt operations \n        across the country, trophy hunters pay a fee to shoot captive \n        exotic animals, from African lions to giraffes and blackbuck \n        antelope, in fenced-in enclosures.\n            (3) Clustered in a captive setting at unusually high \n        densities, confined exotic animals attract disease more readily \n        than more widely dispersed native species who roam freely.\n            (4) The transportation of captive exotic animals to \n        commercial canned hunt operations can facilitate the spread of \n        disease across great distances.\n            (5) The regulation of the transport and treatment of exotic \n        animals on shooting preserves falls outside the traditional \n        domains of State agriculture departments and State fish and \n        game agencies.\n    (b) Purposes.--This Act--\n            (1) is limited in its purpose and will not limit the \n        licensed hunting of any native mammals or any native or exotic \n        birds;\n            (2) does not aim to criticize those hunters who pursue \n        animals that are not enclosed within a fence; and\n            (3) does not attempt to prohibit slaughterhouse activities, \n        nor does it aim to prohibit the routine euthanasia of \n        domesticated farm animals.\n\nSEC. 3. TRANSPORT OR POSSESSION OF EXOTIC ANIMALS FOR PURPOSES OF \n              KILLING OR INJURING THEM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 3 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 50.
