In selecting \nparticipants, the Secretary shall give priority to holders of a right-\nof-way who have worked with Forest Service fire scientists and used \ntechnologies, such as Light Detection and Ranging surveys, to improve \nutility infrastructure protection prescriptions.\n    (c) Project Elements.--A vegetation management project under the \npilot program involves limited and selective vegetation management \nactivities, which--\n            (1) shall create the least amount of disturbance reasonably \n        necessary to protect utility infrastructure from passing \n        wildfires based on applicable models, including Forest Service \n        fuel models;\n            (2) may include thinning, fuel reduction, creation and \n        treatment of shaded fuel breaks, and other measures as \n        appropriate;\n            (3) shall only take place adjacent to the participant's \n        right-of-way or within 75 feet of the participant's right-of-\n        way;\n            (4) shall not take place in any designated wilderness area, \n        wilderness study area, or inventoried roadless area; and\n            (5) shall be subject to approval by the Forest Service in \n        accordance with this Act.\n    (d) Project Costs.--A participant in the pilot program shall be \nresponsible for all costs, as determined by the Secretary, incurred in \nparticipating in the pilot program, unless the Secretary determines \nthat it is in the public interest for the Forest Service to contribute \nfunds for a vegetation management project conducted under the pilot \nprogram.\n    (e) Liability.--\n            (1) In general.--Participation in the pilot program does \n        not affect any existing legal obligations or liability \n        standards that--\n                    (A) arise under the right-of-way for activities in \n                the right-of-way; or\n                    (B) apply to fires resulting from causes other than \n                activities conducted pursuant to an approved vegetation \n                management project.\n            (2) Project work.--A participant shall not be liable to the \n        United States for damage proximately caused by activities \n        conducted pursuant to an approved vegetation management project \n        unless--\n                    (A) such activities were carried out in a manner \n                that was grossly negligent or that violated criminal \n                law; or\n                    (B) the damage was caused by the failure of the \n                participant to comply with specific safety requirements \n                expressly imposed by the Forest Service as a condition \n                of participating in the pilot program.\n    (f) Implementation.--The Secretary shall utilize existing laws and \nregulations in the conduct of the pilot program and, in order to \nimplement the pilot program in an efficient and expeditious manner, may \nwaive or modify specific provisions of the Federal Acquisition \nRegulation, including modifications to allow for formation of contracts \nor agreements on a noncompetitive basis.\n    (g) Treatment of Proceeds.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw, the Secretary may--\n            (1) retain any funds provided to the Forest Service by a \n        participant in the pilot program;
