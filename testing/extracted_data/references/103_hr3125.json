FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) State laws requiring a waiting period before the \n        purchase of a firearm have endangered the lives of law-abiding \n        Americans by preventing them from protecting themselves, as \n        demonstrated by the following examples:\n                    (A) In 1991, Bonnie Elmasri of Wisconsin tried to \n                get a handgun to protect herself from her estranged \n                husband, but he returned home and killed her and her 2 \n                children before the 48-hour waiting period required by \n                State law had expired.\n                    (B) In 1990, Catherine Latta of North Carolina \n                tried to buy a firearm but was told by police that it \n                would take her 2 to 4 weeks to get the necessary \n                permit. After telling the clerk she ``would be dead by \n                then,'' she illegally bought a handgun on the street. 5 \n                hours later she was attacked again by the man who had \n                already robbed, assaulted, and raped her. She used her \n                handgun to protect herself by shooting and killing him. \n                Had she not had a handgun, the outcome would have been \n                much different.\n                    (C) Residents of Los Angeles were forced to wait 15 \n                days during the 1991 riots before they could legally \n                buy a firearm for protection, in spite of the fact that \n                police were admitting that they could not protect the \n                people.\n            (2) A point-of-sale instant background check can easily \n        lead to a gun owner registration system. Commenting on the \n        Virginia State instant check system, the Congressional Office \n        of Technology Assessment said ``The Virginia transaction log \n        does not include the names of firearm purchasers, but the \n        potential exists regardless of legal prohibitions.''.\n            (3) Laws requiring a waiting period before the purchase of \n        a firearm have not prevented crime rates in various States that \n        have enacted such laws from increasing far above the national \n        average increase in crime rates.\n            (4) Police cannot protect, and are not legally responsible \n        for protecting, individual citizens, as evidenced by the \n        following:\n                    (A) The courts have consistently ruled that the \n                police do not have an obligation to protect \n                individuals, only the public in general. In Warren v. \n                District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department \n                (D.C. App. 444 A. 2d 1 (1981)), the court stated \n                ``courts have without exception concluded that when a \n                municipality or other governmental entity undertakes to \n                furnish police services, it assumes a duty only to the \n                public at large and not to individual members of the \n                community''.\n                    (B) Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith told \n                Florida legislators that police responded to only \n                200,000 of 700,000 calls for help to Dade County \n                authorities.\n                    (C) The Department of Justice found that, in 1989, \n                there were 168,881 crimes of violence which were not \n                responded to by police within 1 hour.\n                    (D) Currently, there are about 150,000 police \n                officers on duty to protect a population of more than \n                250,000,000 Americans.\n\nSEC. 3. SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFYING FELONS AND PERSONS ADJUDICATED MENTALLY \n              INCOMPETENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--The laws and procedures of a State are of the type \ndescribed in this subsection if the laws and procedures, in substance, \nprovide the following:\n            (1) Records check required before issuance of driver's \n        license and identification documents; use of magnetic strips to \n        identify prohibited persons.--Before the State transportation \n        agency issues, reissues, or reinstates a license, the agency \n        shall--\n                    (A) conduct a record check to determine whether the \n                applicant therefor is a prohibited person by examining \n                the State list referred to in paragraph (4) of this \n                subsection and the national list referred to in \n                subsection (b)(1); and\n                    (B) affix to the license of the person a magnetic \n                strip on which is encoded information that--\n                            (i) identifies the licensee as a prohibited \n                        person or as a nonprohibited person; and\n                            (ii) may be discerned only through the use \n                        of an electronic device that--\n                                    (I) is read only;\n                                    (II) does not have storage or \n                                communication capabilities; and\n                                    (III) signals the user of the \n                                device with--\n                                            (aa) a green light if the \n                                        device reads a magnetic strip \n                                        that does not identify the \n                                        person as a prohibited person; \n                                        and\n                                            (bb) a red light if the \n                                        device reads a magnetic strip \n                                        that identifies the person as a \n                                        prohibited person.\n            (2) Effects of felony conviction or adjudication of mental \n        incompetency.--\n                    (A) Seizure and voiding of driver's license.--If a \n                State court convicts a person of a crime punishable by \n                imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year or adjudicates \n                a person as mentally incompetent, the court shall seize \n                any license issued to the person by the State \n                transportation agency, and any such license shall be \n                void.\n                    (B) Issuance of new license upon request.--Upon \n                request of a person referred to in subparagraph (A), \n                the State transportation agency shall issue to the \n                person (if otherwise eligible therefor) another such \n                license affixed to which is a magnetic strip \n                identifying the person as a prohibited person.\n            (3) Funding of records checks.--\n                    (A) Increase in fines imposed upon convicted \n                felons.--Any person convicted in the State of a crime \n                punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year \n                shall, in addition to any sentence imposed under any \n                other provision of State law, be fined an amount \n                sufficient to cover the expenses of criminal records \n                checks conducted pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), taking \n                all such convictions into account on an annual basis.\n                    (B) Surcharge imposed on prohibited persons to \n                obtain a driver's license.--In addition to any fee \n                required to be paid by a person to obtain a license, \n                the State transportation agency shall require a \n                prohibited person to pay surcharge in an amount \n                determined by the State to be sufficient to cover the \n                expenses of criminal records checks conducted by the \n                agency pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), taking into \n                account fines imposed under subparagraph (B) of this \n                paragraph.\n            (4) Requirement to maintain and update computerized list of \n        prohibited persons.--The State shall create and maintain a \n        computerized list of all persons who are prohibited persons by \n        reason of a conviction or adjudication in the State, and, \n        within 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n        shall achieve and maintain at least 80 percent currency of case \n        dispositions in the computerized list for all cases in which \n        there has been an entry of activity within the then immediately \n        preceding 5 years.\n    (b) Duties of the Attorney General.--The Attorney General of the \nUnited States shall--\n            (1) create a national, computerized list of prohibited \n        persons;\n            (2) incorporate State criminal history records into the \n        Federal criminal records system maintained by the Federal \n        Bureau of Investigation;\n            (3) develop hardware and software systems to link State \n        lists referred to in subsection (a)(4) with the national list \n        referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection;
