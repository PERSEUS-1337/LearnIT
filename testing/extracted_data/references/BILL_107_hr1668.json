COMMEMORATIVE WORK TO HONOR JOHN ADAMS AND HIS LEGACY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n        (1) Few families have contributed as profoundly to the United \n    States as the family that gave the Nation its second president, \n    John Adams; its sixth president, John Quincy Adams; first ladies \n    Abigail Smith Adams and Louisa Catherine Johnson Adams; and \n    succeeding generations of statesmen, diplomats, advocates, and \n    authors.\n        (2) John Adams (1735-1826), a lawyer, a statesman, and a \n    patriot, was the author of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of \n    Massachusetts (the oldest written constitution still in force), the \n    leader of the Second Continental Congress, a driving force for \n    independence, a negotiator of the Treaty of Paris (which brought \n    the Revolutionary War to an end), the first Vice President, the \n    second President, and an unwavering exponent of freedom of \n    conscience and the rule of law.\n        (3) Abigail Smith Adams (1744-1818) was one of the most \n    remarkable women of her time. Wife of former President John Adams \n    and mother of former President John Quincy Adams, she was an early \n    advocate for the rights of women and served the cause of liberty as \n    a prolific writer, fierce patriot, and staunch abolitionist.\n        (4) John Quincy Adams (1767-1848), the son of John and Abigail \n    Adams, was a distinguished lawyer, legislator, and diplomat and a \n    master of 7 languages, who served as Senator, Minister to the \n    Netherlands under President George Washington, Minister to Prussia \n    under the first President Adams, Minister to Great Britain under \n    President James Madison, chief negotiator of the Treaty of Ghent \n    (which ended the War of 1812), Secretary of State under President \n    James Monroe, author of the Monroe Doctrine (which declared the \n    Western Hemisphere off limits to European imperial expansion), \n    sixth President, and the only former President to be elected to the \n    House of Representatives, where he was known as ``Old Man \n    Eloquent'' and served with great distinction as a leader in the \n    fight against slavery and a champion of unpopular causes.\n        (5) Louisa Catherine Johnson Adams (1775-1852), the wife of \n    former President John Quincy Adams, was an educated, accomplished \n    woman and the only first lady born outside the United States. Like \n    Abigail Adams, she wrote eloquently on behalf of the rights of \n    women and in opposition to slavery.\n        (6) Charles Francis Adams (1807-1886), the son of John Quincy \n    and Louisa Adams, served 6 years in the Massachusetts legislature, \n    was a steadfast abolitionist who received the Free Soil Party's \n    vice-presidential nomination in 1848, was elected to his father's \n    seat in the House of Representatives in 1856, and served as \n    ambassador to Great Britain during the Civil War, where his efforts \n    were decisive in preventing the British Government from recognizing \n    the independence of the Confederacy.\n        (7) Henry Adams (1838-1918), the son of Charles Francis Adams, \n    was an eminent writer, scholar, historian, and public intellectual, \n    and was the author of many celebrated works, including \n    ``Democracy'', ``The Education of Henry Adams'', and his 9-volume \n    ``History of the United States during the Administrations of \n    Jefferson and Madison''.\n        (8) Both individually and collectively, the members of this \n    illustrious family have enriched the Nation through their profound \n    civic consciousness, abiding belief in the perfectibility of the \n    Nation's democracy, and commitment to service and sacrifice for the \n    common good.\n        (9) Although the Congress has authorized the establishment of \n    commemorative works on Federal lands in the District of Columbia \n    honoring such celebrated former Presidents as George Washington, \n    Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, the National Capital has no \n    comparable memorial to former President John Adams.\n        (10) In recognition of the 200th anniversary of the end of the \n    presidency of John Adams, the time has come to correct this \n    oversight so that future generations of Americans will know and \n    understand the preeminent historical and lasting significance to \n    the Nation of his contributions and those of his family.\n    (b) Authority to Establish Commemorative Work.--The Adams Memorial \nFoundation may establish a commemorative work on Federal land in the \nDistrict of Columbia and its environs to honor former President John \nAdams, along with his wife Abigail Adams and former President John \nQuincy Adams, and the family's legacy of public service.\n    (c) Compliance with Standards for Commemorative Works.--The \nestablishment of the commemorative work shall be in accordance with the \nCommemorative Works Act (40 U.S.C. 1001, et seq.).\n    (d) Use of Federal Funds Prohibited.--Federal funds may not be used \nto pay any expense of the establishment of the commemorative work. The \nAdams Memorial Foundation shall be solely responsible for acceptance of \ncontributions for, and payment of the expenses of, the establishment of \nthe commemorative work.\n    (e) Deposit of Excess Funds.--If, upon payment of all expenses of \nthe establishment of the commemorative work (including the maintenance \nand preservation amount provided for in section 8(b) of the \nCommemorative Works Act (40 U.S.C. 1001, et seq.)), or upon expiration \nof the authority for the commemorative work under section 10(b) of such \nAct, there remains a balance of funds received for the establishment of \nthe commemorative work, the Adams Memorial Foundation shall transmit \nthe amount of the balance to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit \nin the account provided for in section 8(b)(1) of such Act.\n\nSEC. 2.
