For purposes of the preceding \n        sentence, indebtedness that is incurred to construct, improve, \n        or acquire property, and that is secured by an interest in such \n        property shall be allocated to such property. All other \n        indebtedness of the taxpayer shall be allocated among the items \n        of property held by the taxpayer based on their respective \n        adjusted bases.\n            ``(5) Net income.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The net income of the taxpayer \n                from the operation of an electric generating facility \n                is the excess of--\n                            ``(i) gross income from the sale of \n                        electricity produced at such facility, over\n                            ``(ii) the deductions allowable by this \n                        subtitle which are directly allocable to the \n                        operations of such facility.\n                    ``(B) Sales to related persons.--If a sale of \n                electricity is to a related person (within the meaning \n                of section 482), the sale shall be treated for purposes \n                of this paragraph as being made at the price at which \n                the electricity is first sold to a person who is not a \n                related person (as so defined), minus transmission \n                costs.\n                    ``(C) Determination adjusted basis, etc.--For \n                purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (4), adjusted \n                bases and depreciation deductions shall be determined \n                as if the alternative system of subsection (g) applied \n                to the facility for all taxable years and only interest \n                on indebtedness allocable to the facility shall be \n                taken into account.\n            ``(6) Previously allowed accelerated benefits.--The \n        previously allowed accelerated benefits with respect to \n        property are the excess of--\n                    ``(A) depreciation deduction allowable under \n                section 167(a) with respect to such property for all \n                prior taxable years, over\n                    ``(B) the amount that would have been so allowable \n                if such deductions had been determined under the \n                alternative depreciation system of subsection (g) for \n                all prior taxable years.\n            ``(7) Treatment of recaptured amount.--The adjusted basis \n        of any property with respect to which there is an amount \n        included in gross income under paragraph (1)(B) shall be \n        increased by the amount so included.\n            ``(8) Exemptions for facilities using renewable energy.--\n        This subsection shall not apply to any facility producing \n        electricity from renewable sources.
