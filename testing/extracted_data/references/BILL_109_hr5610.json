FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Immigration law allows citizens and aliens lawfully \n        admitted for permanent residence to bring foreign family \n        members to the United States on the basis of immediate relative \n        status or a preference classification.\n            (2) Immediate relative status and preference \n        classifications are obtained by filing petitions with the \n        Secretary of Homeland Security.\n            (3) For national security purposes, the Secretary of \n        Homeland Security conducts background checks on the \n        beneficiaries of such petitions and, since September 11, 2001, \n        on the petitioners as well.\n            (4) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has \n        determined that, in fiscal year 2005, at least 398 of the \n        petitioners who filed family-based visa petitions were on the \n        National Sex Offender Registry maintained by the Federal Bureau \n        of Investigations.\n            (5) GAO was only able to ascertain the nature of the sex \n        offense for 194 of the 398 petitioners.\n            (6) GAO was able to ascertain, however, that 119 of the \n        convictions were for sex assault, 35 for child fondling, 9 for \n        strong arm rape, 9 for carnal abuse combined with a sexual \n        assault, 7 were for statutory rape, 4 for crimes against \n        persons, 3 for indecent exposure, 2 for kidnapping, 2 for \n        obscene material possession, 1 for exploitation of a minor with \n        photographs, 1 for incest with a minor, 1 for sodomizing a boy, \n        and 1 for restricting movement.\n            (7) At least 14 of the 398 petitioners were classified as \n        ``sexual predators'', which means a determination had been made \n        that they are likely to commit additional sex offenses.\n            (8) At least 45 of the petitioners were convicted of sex \n        offenses against children.\n            (9) The Immigration and Nationality Act does not provide \n        the Secretary of Homeland Security with authorization to deny \n        family-based petitions on the basis of a petitioner's \n        conviction for a sex offense, even when the conviction record \n        indicates that a spouse or a child beneficiary may be in grave \n        danger.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO DENY FAMILY-SPONSORED CLASSIFICATION \n              PETITION BY PETITIONER LISTED ON NATIONAL SEX OFFENDER \n              REGISTRY.\n\n    Section 204 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(l) Authority to Deny Family-Based Petition by Petitioner Listed \non National Sex Offender Registry.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary Homeland Security may, in \n        the discretion of the Secretary, deny a petition under \n        subsection (a) for classification of a spouse or child if--\n                    ``(A) the Secretary has confirmed that the \n                petitioner is on the national sex offender registry \n                maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a \n                conviction that individually (disregarding any \n                aggregation due to any other conviction) resulted in \n                incarceration for more than 1 year;\n                    ``(B) the petitioner has been given at least 90 \n                days to establish that the petitioner is not the person \n                named on the registry or that the conviction did not \n                result in incarceration for more than 1 year and has \n                failed to establish such fact; and\n                    ``(C) the Secretary finds that granting the \n                petition would put a primary or derivative spouse or \n                child beneficiary in grave danger of being sexually \n                abused.\n            ``(2) Determining danger.--In making the determination \n        under paragraph (1)(C), the Secretary shall use the following \n        principles:\n                    ``(A) Nature of the relationship.--In evaluating a \n                petitioner who has filed a petition for a spouse, \n                consideration should be given to indications of how \n                well the petitioner and the spouse know each other. \n                Petitions filed on the basis of marriages between men \n                and women who have had little direct, personal contact \n                with each other should be viewed with suspicion. In \n                cases where the petitioner and the spouse have had \n                little direct, personal contact with each other, \n                evidence should be submitted to establish that they \n                have gotten to know each other in some other way.\n                    ``(B) Nature of the sex offense.--Consideration \n                should be given to when each offense occurred for which \n                the petitioner was incarcerated for more than a year, \n                how serious it was, the sentence that was imposed, how \n                long the petitioner was incarcerated, the age of the \n                petitioner when it was committed, and the \n                characteristics of the victim.\n                    ``(C) Rehabilitation.--Evidence of rehabilitation \n                should be evaluated with respect to whether it \n                diminishes the risk of sexual abuse to the primary or \n                derivative spouse or child beneficiaries.\n                    ``(D) Previous visa petitions.--The records for any \n                previous petitions shall be examined to determine \n                whether they provide or might lead to evidence that is \n                pertinent to determining whether granting the petition \n                would put a primary or derivative spouse or child \n                beneficiary in grave danger of being sexually abused.\n            ``(3) Rebuttal.--If the Secretary intends to deny a \n        petition under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide the \n        petitioner with a notice that states the reasons for the \n        intended denial and provides the petitioner with at least 90 \n        days to submit rebuttal evidence. Rebuttal should focus \n        primarily on the factors that led the Secretary to believe that \n        granting the petition would put a primary or derivative spouse \n        or child beneficiary in grave danger of being sexually abused.\n            ``(4) Post-denial remedies.--\n                    ``(A) Appeal.--All final denials under paragraph \n                (1) may be appealed to the Board of Immigration \n                Appeals.\n                    ``(B) New petition.--The petitioner may file a new \n                petition whenever the petitioner has additional \n                evidence that the petitioner believes might be \n                sufficient to warrant granting the new petition.\n            ``(5) Disclosure by the secretary of homeland security to \n        beneficiaries.--In all cases in which it has been confirmed \n        that the name of a petitioner under subsection (a) is listed on \n        the national sex offender registry maintained by the Federal \n        Bureau of Investigation, and regardless of whether the \n        Secretary may exercise discretion under paragraph (1), the \n        Secretary shall give the petitioner at least 90 days to \n        establish that the petitioner is not the person named on the \n        registry. If the petitioner fails to establish that the \n        petitioner is not the person named on the registry within the \n        time allotted, the Secretary shall provide the beneficiaries \n        with a written copy of the information on the registry that is \n        available to the public before making a decision on the \n        petition. The beneficiary shall be informed that the registry \n        information is based on available records and may not be \n        complete.\n            ``(6) Disclosure to department of state.--In all cases in \n        which it has been confirmed that the name of a petitioner under \n        subsection (a) is listed on the national sex offender registry \n        maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and \n        regardless of whether the Secretary may exercise discretion \n        under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide the Secretary \n        of State with--\n                    ``(A) a separate document with information about \n                the record on the national sex offender registry that \n                is available to the public;\n                    ``(B) any additional information it has that raises \n                concern that a primary or derivative spouse or child \n                beneficiary may be subject to sexual abuse, including \n                information from the registry that is not available to \n                the public; and\n                    ``(C) information about any previous petitions \n                under subsection (a) filed by the petitioner.\n            ``(7) Disclosure by consular officer to beneficiaries.--\n        When a petition under subsection (a) is granted, if the \n        petition is filed by a petitioner who has failed to make the \n        demonstration of mis-identification described in paragraph (5), \n        the consular officer shall conduct an interview with the \n        primary or derivative spouse or child beneficiary of the \n        petition before issuing a visa to the beneficiary. At least \n        part of the interview must be held without the presence of the \n        petitioner. During the private part of the interview, the \n        beneficiary will be given a written copy of the information \n        about the petitioner from the registry that is available to the \n        public. This document must be written in the beneficiary's \n        primary language. The consular officer is required to advise \n        the beneficiary that approval of the visa petition does not \n        mean that there are no reasons to be concerned about his or her \n        safety.\n            ``(8) Additional responsibilities of consular officer.--The \n        consular officer may return files to the Secretary of Homeland \n        Security for further consideration in cases where the consular \n        officer is concerned that granting the visa might put a primary \n        or derivative spouse or child beneficiary in grave danger of \n        being sexually abused. When returning a file under the previous \n        sentence, the consular officer may add any additional \n        information or observations the officer has that might have a \n        bearing on whether the visa should be granted, including the \n        results of any field examination that has been conducted.''.\n\nSEC. 4.

If it is \n                determined that any alien spouse, son, or daughter is \n                being abused or harmed by the petitioning spouse, the \n                victim shall be offered whatever assistance is \n                appropriate, including information on ways to remain in \n                the United State that do not depend on continuing the \n                qualifying marriage.''.\n    (b) Hardship Waiver in Cases Where the Alien Spouse or Child Is \nSubject to Sexual Abuse.--Section 216(c)(4) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186a(c)(4)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``or'' at the end\n            (2) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end \n        and inserting ``, or''; and\n            (3) by inserting after subparagraph (C) the following:\n                    ``(D) the qualifying marriage was entered into in \n                good faith by the alien spouse and during the marriage \n                the alien spouse, or a son or daughter of the spouse, \n                was sexually abused and the alien was not at fault in \n                failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1).''.\n\nSEC. 5.
