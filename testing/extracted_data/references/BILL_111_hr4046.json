FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Arab League's trade boycott of the State of Israel \n        is inconsistent with World Trade Organization's (WTO) principle \n        of nondiscrimination.\n            (2) Trade boycotts of the State of Israel are a barrier to \n        better relations between Israel and nations of the Arab League.\n            (3) It has been the long-standing policy of the United \n        States to oppose the enforcement of trade boycotts of Israel.\n            (4) Many members of the World Trade Organization continue \n        to enforce the primary trade boycott of the State of Israel. \n        Other WTO members continue to enforce the secondary and \n        tertiary trade boycott of the State of Israel.\n            (5) Taxpayers are required to report requests to \n        participate in or cooperate with an international boycott. \n        Section 999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires the \n        Secretary of the Treasury to keep a list of countries which \n        require or may require participation in, or cooperation with, a \n        trade boycott of Israel. Currently, the list of countries which \n        require or may require participation in a trade boycott of \n        Israel includes Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, \n        Syria, the United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Yemen.\n            (6) In 2005, during negotiations for the accession of the \n        Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the World Trade Organization (WTO), \n        the United States received assurances from the Kingdom of Saudi \n        Arabia that, upon accession, ``WTO rules will apply between \n        Saudi Arabia and all current members'' which includes Israel. \n        Further, the United States received assurances that ``Saudi \n        Arabia is legally obligated to provide most-favored nation \n        treatment to all WTO Members, including Israel. Any government \n        sanctioned activity on the Boycott [of Israel] would be a \n        violation of Saudi Arabia's obligations and subject to dispute \n        settlement. This legal obligation cannot be changed.''.\n            (7) The United States Trade Representative reports annually \n        on the Arab League's trade boycott of Israel under the National \n        Trade Estimate report but that reporting on trade boycotts of \n        Israel can be improved through additional reporting \n        requirements.\n            (8) Greater transparency and more comprehensive reporting \n        will assist United States taxpayers in complying with United \n        States law and policy regarding trade boycotts of Israel.\n            (9) Improved reporting will enhance efforts to end all \n        trade boycotts of Israel and allow progress on ending such \n        boycotts to be better measured.\n            (10) Taking steps to improve transparency with respect to \n        the boycott of Israel can serve the United States goal of the \n        elimination of the trade boycott of Israel. Fostering increased \n        trade and investment ties between Israel and the countries of \n        the greater Middle East can encourage stronger ties and greater \n        understanding among the peoples of the Middle East.\n\nSEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress reaffirms its opposition to trade boycotts of Israel and \ncalls on the President to take stronger steps to end all trade boycotts \nof Israel.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL TRADE ESTIMATE REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n    Section 181(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2241(b)) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(4) Report on the boycott of israel.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The United States Trade \n                Representative shall include in each report submitted \n                under paragraph (1) a list of each country that \n                participates in any trade boycott of Israel.
