FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has a strategic national interest in \n        improving its image around the world, given the historically \n        low levels of public opinion toward the United States in many \n        countries.\n            (2) International exchange programs have been proven to be \n        one of the most beneficial and cost-effective means by which to \n        promote mutual understanding between citizens of the United \n        States and citizens of other countries and to advance United \n        States national interests through closer working partnerships \n        with leaders around the world.\n            (3) Prominent world leaders during recent decades, such as \n        Tony Blair and Anwar Sadat, have deepened their friendship and \n        openness to the United States through international exchanges, \n        and many persons who previously had highly anti-American \n        opinions have changed their views after participating in \n        exchange programs organized by the United States Government.\n            (4) United States exchange programs, such as the \n        International Visitors Program, make a tremendous impact in the \n        lives of those individuals who participate and consistently are \n        ranked by public diplomacy experts as some of the most \n        effective public diplomacy programs.\n            (5) The International Visitors Program of the United States \n        Department of State organizes exchange programs for anticipated \n        future leaders in their countries who travel to the United \n        States for programs generally of three weeks, and it produces \n        very positive results among its target audience.\n            (6) Another key target audience for United States exchanges \n        is not addressed by the International Visitors Program; this \n        group includes current political, economic, and civil society \n        leaders, often from less privileged backgrounds, who have not \n        traveled to the United States previously.\n            (7) Such persons currently in leadership positions in their \n        countries are often unable to leave their jobs for a period of \n        three weeks, given the press of their responsibilities, and \n        United States embassies administering exchange programs not \n        infrequently find that identified candidates for International \n        Visitor Program exchanges decline participation because of this \n        fact.\n            (8) A number of United States embassies, including the \n        embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, have piloted country-specific, \n        embassy-initiated exchange programs targeted to such groups of \n        current leaders who have never traveled to the United States. \n        These programs generally last from 5-7 program days and bring \n        together 8-10 participants from a country who work on similar \n        issues but have not worked with each other before. Some of \n        these programs have been coordinated with the Voluntary \n        Visitors Division of the International Visitors Office in the \n        Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the Department of \n        State.\n            (9) Such programs have proven highly effective in having an \n        immediate impact on current leaders working in key sectors and \n        in helping advance United States interests such as greater \n        democratization, observance of human rights, economic reform \n        and poverty alleviation, empowerment of women and girls, and \n        improved cooperation with the United States in confronting \n        threats from organized crime, narco-trafficking, and terrorist \n        groups. These programs also promote greater cooperation across \n        sectors, agencies, and regions within a country, given the \n        shared experience the exchange visitors have together during \n        their trip to the United States.\n            (10) A key element of the success of these pilot exchanges \n        is that they are conceived and developed in individual \n        embassies overseas, keyed to specific interests of the United \n        States in each country.\n            (11) However, these pilot exchanges currently have not been \n        replicated widely within the Department of State, being \n        confined to only a few United States embassies around the \n        world, because there are no Department-wide programmatic \n        guidelines or central funding for these exchange programs.\n\nSEC. 3.
