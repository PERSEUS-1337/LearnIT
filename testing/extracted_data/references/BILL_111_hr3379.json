SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Lowering Oil Price \nSpeculation for Infrastructure Dedicated to Economic Development Act of \n2009'' or the ``LOPSIDED Oil Prices Act of 2009''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The price of oil has risen and fallen dramatically over \n        the last decade without a clear connection to the laws of \n        supply and demand.\n            (2) The price of a barrel of oil predictably stayed beneath \n        $20 a barrel of oil for decades. In the beginning of 1999, the \n        price was under $10 a barrel of oil, but since then the oil \n        market has been plagued by speculation and fluctuated wildly.\n            (3) In late 2004, the price of oil exceeded $40 a barrel of \n        oil, up 400 percent in 5 years.\n            (4) In late 2007, the price exceeded $80 a barrel of oil, \n        up 800 percent in 8 years.\n            (5) Nine months later, the price of oil peaked at $145 per \n        barrel of oil, up 1450 percent in just under 10 years. While \n        demand has risen, it has not to risen at those rates.\n            (6) The price of oil collapsed in 2008, but the collapse \n        preceded the greater economic downturn. In January 2009, the \n        price had dropped to just over $30 a barrel of oil.\n            (7) The economy continues to slide downward pushing with it \n        oil demand, but illogically the price of oil recently peaked at \n        over $70 a barrel of oil.\n            (8) Many economists have attributed this irrational \n        behavior of the oil market to the large increase in speculative \n        trading in oil derivatives. Crude oil is now the world's most \n        actively traded commodity futures contract.\n            (9) In 2004, the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) \n        facilitated 52 million oil futures contracts, and in 2008 NYMEX \n        facilitated 134 million oil futures contracts. Other exchanges \n        have seen similar increases, and there is no accurate measure \n        for over-the-counter trades.\n            (10) On June 13, 2009, the finance ministers from G8 \n        countries--Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, \n        Britain and the United States--said ``Excess volatility of \n        commodity prices poses risks to growth.''\n            (11) Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner Bart Chilton, \n        said in June 2009, ``Crude oil prices are up 60 percent on the \n        year. Supplies are at a 10-year high, and demand is at a 10-\n        year low. You do the math. Why should prices be over $70?''\n            (12) Many economists argue that a transaction tax on \n        speculative trading will deter short-term speculation, which \n        will reduce the volatility and price of oil.\n            (13) James Tobin, a Nobel Prize winner in economics, stated \n        a security transaction tax ``would automatically penalize \n        short-horizon round trips, while negligibly affecting the \n        incentives for . . . longer-term capital investments.''\n            (14) Larry Summers, the current Chairman of the National \n        Economic Council and the top economic adviser President Obama, \n        wrote in 1989 that imposing a securities transaction tax \n        ``would have the beneficial effects of curbing instability \n        introduced by speculation, reducing the diversion of resources \n        into the financial sector of the economy, and lengthening the \n        horizon of corporate managers. The efficiency benefits derived \n        from curbing speculation are likely to exceed any costs or \n        reduced liquidity or increased costs of capital that come from \n        taxing financial transactions more heavily.''\n            (15) A well-designed oil transaction tax could reduce the \n        volatility of the oil futures market without harming legitimate \n        hedge traders. Oil prices will then return to accurate price \n        discovery following the supply and demand price curve.\n            (16) Since 70 percent of oil consumed in the United States \n        is for transportation, the revenue raised on oil transactions \n        is an ideal additional source of funds for the Highway Trust \n        Fund.\n\nSEC. 2.
