LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout the \n        unborn child's entire body and nerves link these receptors to \n        the brain's thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than 20 \n        weeks after fertilization.\n            (2) By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts \n        to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli \n        that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult \n        human, for example, by recoiling.\n            (3) In the unborn child, application of such painful \n        stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress \n        hormones known as the stress response.\n            (4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with \n        long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered \n        pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and \n        learning disabilities later in life.\n            (5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal \n        anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a \n        decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when \n        painful stimuli are applied without such anesthesia. In the \n        United States, surgery of this type is being performed by 20 \n        weeks after fertilization and earlier in specialized units \n        affiliated with children's hospitals.\n            (6) The position, asserted by some physicians, that the \n        unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point \n        later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization \n        predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to \n        experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires \n        nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. However, \n        recent medical research and analysis, especially since 2007, \n        provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning \n        cortex is not necessary to experience pain.\n            (7) Substantial evidence indicates that children born \n        missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with \n        hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.\n            (8) In adult humans and in animals, stimulation or ablation \n        of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while \n        stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.\n            (9) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for \n        pain processing in early development differ from those of \n        adults, using different neural elements available at specific \n        times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to \n        fulfill the role of pain processing.\n            (10) The position, asserted by some commentators, that the \n        unborn child remains in a coma-like sleep state that precludes \n        the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent with the \n        documented reaction of unborn children to painful stimuli and \n        with the experience of fetal surgeons who have found it \n        necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia to prevent \n        the unborn child from engaging in vigorous movement in reaction \n        to invasive surgery.\n            (11) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence \n        that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least \n        by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier.\n            (12) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert a \n        compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of \n        unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical \n        evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.\n            (13) The compelling governmental interest in protecting the \n        lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial \n        medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling \n        pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the \n        compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of \n        unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither \n        governmental interest is intended to replace the other.\n\nSEC. 3. PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 74 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by inserting after section 1531 the following:\n``Sec. 1532.
