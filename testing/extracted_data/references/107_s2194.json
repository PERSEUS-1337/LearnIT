    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Arafat Accountability Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), under the \n        leadership of Chairman Yasser Arafat, has failed to abide by \n        its promises, enumerated in the Oslo Accords, to commit itself \n        to ``a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two \n        sides'', that ``all outstanding issues relating to permanent \n        status will be resolved through negotiations'', and that the \n        PLO ``renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of violence \n        and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements and \n        personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent \n        violence, and discipline violators''.\n            (2) Yasser Arafat failed to exercise his authority and \n        responsibility to maintain law and order in the West Bank and \n        Gaza, which has resulted in ongoing acts of terrorism against \n        Israeli and American civilians in the State of Israel.\n            (3) Yasser Arafat has failed, through words and deeds, to \n        offer credible security guarantees to the Palestinian and \n        Israeli peoples, and has once again violated his commitment to \n        peace through the recent purchase of 50 tons of offensive \n        weaponry from Iran.\n            (4) Yasser Arafat and the forces directly under his control \n        are responsible for the murder of hundreds of innocent Israelis \n        and the wounding of thousands more since October 2000.\n            (5) Yasser Arafat has been directly implicated in funding \n        and supporting terrorists who have claimed responsibility for \n        homicide bombings in Israel.\n            (6) Under the present circumstances, Yasser Arafat's \n        failure to adequately respond to end the homicide bombings \n        further complicates the prospects for a resolution of the \n        conflict in that region.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the United States continue to urge an immediate and \n        unconditional cessation of all terrorist activities and the \n        commencement of a cease-fire;\n            (2) the Palestine Liberation Organization and the \n        Palestinian Authority immediately surrender to Israel for \n        detention and prosecution those Palestinian extremists wanted \n        by the Government of Israel for assassination of Israeli \n        Minister of Tourism Rehavam Zeevi;\n            (3) PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation \n        Organization take immediate and concrete action to--\n                    (A) publicly condemn all acts of terrorism, \n                including and especially homicide bombings, which \n                murdered over 125 Israeli men, women, and children \n                during the month of March alone, and the injury of \n                hundreds more;\n                    (B) confiscate and destroy the infrastructures of \n                terrorism, including weapons, bomb factories, and other \n                offensive materials;\n                    (C) end all financial support for terrorism; and\n                    (D) urge all Arab nations and individuals to \n                immediately cease funding for terrorist operations and \n                payments to the families of terrorists; and\n            (4) the Congress supports the President's efforts, in \n        conjunction with Israel, the Arab states, and the international \n        community, to develop a comprehensive peace in the region, and \n        encourages continued efforts by all parties.\n\nSEC. 4.
