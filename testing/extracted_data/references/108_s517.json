If the Secretary determines \nthat such a presumption is warranted, the Secretary, not later than 60 \ndays after making the determination, shall issue proposed regulations \nsetting forth the Secretary's determination.\n    ``(B) If the Secretary determines that a presumption of service \nconnection is not warranted, the Secretary, not later than 60 days \nafter making the determination, shall publish in the Federal Register a \nnotice of that determination. The notice shall include an explanation \nof the scientific basis for that determination. If the disease already \nis included in regulations providing for a presumption of service \nconnection, the Secretary, not later than 60 days after publication of \nthe notice of a determination that the presumption is not warranted, \nshall issue proposed regulations removing the presumption for the \ndisease.\n    ``(C) Not later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary \nissues any proposed regulations under this subsection, the Secretary \nshall issue final regulations. Such regulations shall be effective on \nthe date of issuance.\n    ``(4) Whenever a disease is removed from regulations prescribed \nunder this section--\n            ``(A) a veteran who was awarded compensation for such \n        disease on the basis of the presumption provided in subsection \n        (b) before the effective date of the removal shall continue to \n        be entitled to receive compensation on that basis; and\n            ``(B) a survivor of a veteran who was awarded dependency \n        and indemnity compensation for the death of a veteran resulting \n        from such disease on the basis of such presumption shall \n        continue to be entitled to receive dependency and indemnity \n        compensation on such basis.\n    ``(5) The Secretary shall carry out this subsection in consultation \nwith, and after taking into consideration the views of, the Advisory \nCommittee on Former Prisoners of War established under section 541 of \nthis title.''."
