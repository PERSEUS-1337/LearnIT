FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Great Lakes Fishery Resources Restoration Study, \n        for which a report was submitted to the Congress in 1995, was a \n        comprehensive study of the status, assessment, management, and \n        restoration needs of the fishery resources of the Great Lakes \n        Basin, and was conducted through the joint effort of the United \n        States Fish and Wildlife Service, State fish and wildlife \n        resource management agencies, Indian tribes, and the Great \n        Lakes Fishery Commission.\n            (2) This study found the following:\n                    (A) Physical changes to the Great Lakes through \n                dredging, construction of hydroelectric and other dams, \n                stone revetment projects, clearing of shoreline \n                vegetation, and increased agriculture have altered \n                habitats, fish spawning mortality, erosion, \n                sedimentation, oxygen levels, contaminant transport, \n                nutrient loading, and aesthetic character. Combined \n                effects of overexploitation, habitat impairment, and \n                destabilizing effects of nonindigenous species are \n                responsible for most of the decline of native fishes in \n                the Great Lakes. Physical changes to the nearshore \n                environments, riverine tributaries, and wetlands by \n                development projects have affected those species \n                relying on these habitats for critical phases of their \n                life histories. Monitoring of contaminants and analysis \n                of their effects should be coordinated and expanded.\n                    (B) Significant habitats necessary for self-\n                sustaining populations of fish and wildlife are \n                threatened or impaired. Actions should include \n                identifying and protecting habitats that are used by \n                fish and wildlife for spawning, breeding, nesting, \n                rearing and feeding, and rehabilitating degraded \n                habitats to be utilized by a diverse community.\n                    (C) Working under the cooperatively developed \n                guidance of the Strategic Plan for Management of the \n                Great Lakes Fisheries, published by the Great Lakes \n                Fishery Commission in 1980, and the Great Lakes Water \n                Quality Agreement, State, Provincial, Native American \n                tribal, and Federal agencies bordering the Great Lakes \n                have made significant progress toward the goal of \n                restoring a healthy fish community to the Great Lakes. \n                Differences in mandate, perception of priorities, and \n                style of management create major institutional \n                impediments to systematic and comprehensive \n                coordination of ecosystem management. Many of the \ncurrent problems are, in fact, the unintended consequences of \nuncoordinated management of water quality, fisheries, shipping, and \nhuman developments in the Great Lakes Basin. Concepts of responsible \nresource use and management and biological conservation should not be \nat odds, but should be integrated via partnerships to meet future \nneeds. Information exchange and cross-program forums should be \nestablished to encourage management. Setting of specific management \ngoals is central to the coordination of management efforts. Fishery \nmanagers should increase their involvement with the Binational Program, \nRemedial Action Plans, Lake-Wide Management Plans, and the \nEnvironmental Monitoring and Assessment Program planning process.\n\nSEC. 3. REFERENCE.\n\n    Whenever in this Act an amendment is expressed in terms of an \namendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference \nshall be considered to be made to that section or other provision of \nthe Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. \n941 et seq.), as set forth in title I of Public Law 101-573.\n\nSEC. 4.
