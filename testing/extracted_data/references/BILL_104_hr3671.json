DECLARATION OF POLICY, CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress declares and finds the following:\n            (1) It is the policy of the United States to promote tribal \n        self-determination and economic self-sufficiency and to support \n        the resolution of disputes over historical claims through \n        settlements mutually agreed to by Indian and non-Indian \n        parties.\n            (2) The United Houma Nation have used, occupied, and \n        possessed vast tracts of lands within the State of Louisiana \n        and adjacent States, and by this use, occupancy, and possession \n        have laid claim to these lands.\n            (3) The significant historical events which have led to the \n        present state of affairs include (but are not limited to) the \n        following:\n                    (A) The United Houma Nation have an unbroken tribal \n                existence from time immemorial and before recorded \n                history.\n                    (B) The United Houma Nation enters recorded history \n                in 1682, when the explorer Robert Cavalier, Sieur de La \n                Salle encountered this tribe at the intersection of the \n                Mississippi and Red Rivers.\n                    (C) By 1706, the United Houma Nation reacted to the \n                rivalry between the French and English by migrating \n                south, in order to be closer to their French allies.\n                    (D) During the early 1700's, the United Houma \n                Nation fought with other Indian tribes, and the French, \n                over lands.\n                    (E) The United States assumed sovereignty over \n                these lands with the purchase of the Louisiana \n                Territory in 1803 and promised all Indian tribes \n                inhabiting the newly acquired territory that their land \n                ownership and possession would be protected and honored \n                as such ownership was protected and honored by the \n                former sovereigns of Spain and France.\n                    (F) In order to protect themselves from threats \n                presented by non-Indian peoples, portions of the United \n                Houma Nation sought refuge and safety in the then \n                remote wetlands and bayous of southern Louisiana where \n                they continued their social life and existence as a \n                tribal entity.\n                    (G) Members of the United Houma Nation have always \n                been accorded the status of Indians as evidenced by--\n                            (i) receiving educational support from the \n                        Federal Government; and\n                            (ii) recognition of the United Houma Nation \n                        as an Indian tribe by the State of Louisiana.\n                    (H) The United Houma Nation reorganized their \n                government under a corporate form in the 1970's, which \n                culminated in the creation of a corporate entity known \n                as the ``United Houma Nation'' in 1979.\n            (4) The assertion of the land claims of the United Houma \n        Nation through litigation will lead to substantial economic and \n        social hardship for a large number of landowners, citizens, and \n        communities in the State of Louisiana, including the United \n        Houma Nation itself. Congress recognizes that if these claims \n        are not resolved--\n                    (A) litigation against thousands of landowners \n                would be likely;\n                    (B) any final resolution of these disputes through \n                a process of litigation would--\n                            (i) take many years and entail great \n                        expenses to all parties;\n                            (ii) continue economically and socially \n                        damaging controversies;\n                            (iii) prolong uncertainty as to the \n                        ownership of property; and\n                            (iv) seriously impair long-term economic \n                        planning and development for all parties.\n            (5) The settlement of these land claims and the avoidance \n        of costly, protracted, and uncertain litigation--\n                    (A) will advance the goals of the Federal policy of \n                Indian self-determination; and\n                    (B) in recognition of the obligation of the United \n                States as a guardian and trustee, will be in \n                furtherance of the Federal policy of settling \n                historical Indian claims through legislation rather \n                than confrontation.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to recognize the United Houma Nation, the historical \n        descendant of the group known in history as the Houma Tribe, as \n        a federally recognized tribe on a sovereign-to-sovereign basis, \n        with all rights, benefits, and responsibilities thereto;\n            (2) to authorize and direct the Secretary of the Interior \n        to implement the terms and provisions of this Act;\n            (3) to remove the cloud on titles in the State of Louisiana \n        resulting from any land claims which have been asserted, are \n        being asserted, or may be asserted, by the United Houma Nation; \n        and\n            (4) to confirm and recognize the trust relationship between \n        the United Houma Nation and the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
