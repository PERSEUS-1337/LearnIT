FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) when a child in foster care cannot return safely home, \n        the child deserves to be placed in a setting that is best for \n        that child, regardless of whether it is in the child's State or \n        another State;\n            (2) the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children \n        (ICPC) was established in 1960 to provide a uniform legal \n        framework for the placement of children across State lines in \n        foster and adoptive homes;\n            (3) frequently, children waiting to be placed with an \n        adoptive family, relative, or foster parent in another State \n        spend more time waiting for this to occur than children who are \n        placed with an adoptive, family, relative, or foster parent in \n        the same State, because of the outdated, administratively \n        burdensome ICPC process;\n            (4) no child should have to wait longer to be placed in a \n        loving home simply because the child must cross a State line;\n            (5) the National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise \n        (NEICE) was launched in August 2014 in Indiana, Nevada, \n        Florida, South Carolina, Wisconsin, and the District of \n        Columbia, has since expanded into Illinois, Virginia, Rhode \n        Island, California, Alaska, Nebraska, and Georgia, and is \n        expected to be expanded into additional States to improve the \n        administrative process by which children are placed with \n        families across State lines;\n            (6) States using this electronic interstate case-processing \n        system have reduced administrative costs and the amount of \n        staff time required to process these cases, and caseworkers can \n        spend more time helping children instead of copying and mailing \n        paperwork between States;\n            (7) since NEICE was launched, placement time has decreased \n        by 30 percent for interstate foster care placements; and\n            (8) on average, States using this electronic interstate \n        case-processing system have been able to reduce from 24 \n        business days to 13 business days the time it takes to identify \n        a family for a child and prepare the paperwork required to \n        start the ICPC process.\n\nSEC. 3. STATE PLAN REQUIREMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 471(a)(25) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 671(a)(25)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``provide'' and insert ``provides''; and\n            (2) by inserting ``, which in the case of a State other \n        than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin \n        Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, not later than October 1, \n        2027, shall include the use of an electronic interstate case-\n        processing system'' before the 1st semicolon.\n    (b) Exemption of Indian Tribes.--Section 479B(c) of such Act (42 \nU.S.C. 679c(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(4) Inapplicability of state plan requirement to have in \n        effect procedures providing for the use an electronic \n        interstate case-processing system.--The requirement in section \n        471(a)(25) that a State plan provide that the State shall have \n        in effect procedures providing for the use of an electronic \n        interstate case-processing system shall not apply to an Indian \n        tribe, tribal organization, or tribal consortium that elects to \n        operate a program under this part.''.\n    (c) Effective Date.--\n            (1) In general.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n        shall take effect on the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter \n        beginning on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n        and shall apply to payments under part E of title IV of the \n        Social Security Act for calendar quarters beginning on or after \n        such date.\n            (2) Delay permitted if state legislation required.--If the \n        Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that State \n        legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) is \n        required in order for a State plan developed pursuant to part E \n        of title IV of the Social Security Act to meet the additional \n        requirement imposed by the amendments made by subsection (a), \n        the plan shall not be regarded as failing to meet any of the \n        additional requirements before the 1st day of the 1st calendar \n        quarter beginning after the first regular session of the State \n        legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of this \n        Act. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the State has a \n        2-year legislative session, each year of the session is deemed \n        to be a separate regular session of the State legislature.\n\nSEC. 4. FUNDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ELECTRONIC INTERSTATE CASE-\n              PROCESSING SYSTEM TO EXPEDITE THE INTERSTATE PLACEMENT OF \n              CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE OR GUARDIANSHIP, OR FOR ADOPTION.\n\n    Section 437 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 629g) is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n    ``(g) Funding for the Development of an Electronic Interstate Case-\nProcessing System to Expedite the Interstate Placement of Children in \nFoster Care or Guardianship, or for Adoption.--\n            ``(1) Purpose.--The purpose of this subsection is to \n        facilitate the development of an electronic interstate case-\n        processing system for the exchange of data and documents to \n        expedite the placements of children in foster, guardianship, or \n        adoptive homes across State lines.\n            ``(2) Requirements.--A State that seeks funding under this \n        subsection shall submit to the Secretary the following \n        information:\n                    ``(A) A description of the goals and outcomes to be \n                achieved, which goals and outcomes must result in--\n                            ``(i) reducing the time it takes for a \n                        child to be provided with a safe and \n                        appropriate permanent living arrangement across \n                        State lines;\n                            ``(ii) improving administrative processes \n                        and reducing costs in the foster care system; \n                        and\n                            ``(iii) the secure exchange of relevant \n                        case files and other necessary materials in \n                        real time, and timely communications and \n                        placement decisions regarding interstate \n                        placements of children.\n                    ``(B) A description of the activities to be funded \n                in whole or in part with the funds, including the \n                sequencing of the activities.\n                    ``(C) A description of the strategies for \n                integrating programs and services for children who are \n                placed across State lines.\n                    ``(D) Such other information as the Secretary may \n                require.\n            ``(3) Funding authority.--The Secretary may provide funds \n        to a State that complies with paragraph (2).
