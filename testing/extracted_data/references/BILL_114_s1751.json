FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In 2013, more than 33,000 Americans were killed by guns \n        and almost 90 percent of the firearms used in these deaths were \n        handguns.\n            (2) Recently published research by top national experts, \n        notably on Missouri and Connecticut handgun purchaser licensing \n        laws, have estimated that Missouri's repeal of its handgun \n        purchaser licensing law led to a 25-percent increase in firearm \n        homicide rates while Connecticut's adoption of its handgun \n        purchaser licensing law led to a 40-percent decrease in firearm \n        homicide rates.\n            (3) In States which have had effective handgun purchaser \n        licensing laws for decades, such as Connecticut, Massachusetts, \n        New Jersey, and New York, the vast majority of guns traced to \n        crimes originated in other States, which supports the need for \n        handgun purchaser licensing laws in every State.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the terms ``Attorney General'' and ``handgun'' have the \n        meanings given those terms in section 921(a) of title 18, \n        United States Code; and\n            (2) the term ``Indian tribe'' has the meaning given the \n        term in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and \n        Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b).\n\nSEC. 4.
