    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Parental Rights and Responsibilities \nAct of 1995''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Supreme Court has regarded the right of parents to \n        direct the upbringing of their children as a fundamental right \n        implicit in the concept of ordered liberty within the 14th \n        amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as \n        specified in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923) and Pierce \n        v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925);\n            (2) the role of parents in the raising and rearing of their \n        children is of inestimable value and deserving of both praise \n        and protection by all levels of government;\n            (3) the tradition of western civilization recognizes that \n        parents have the responsibility to love, nurture, train, and \n        protect their children;\n            (4) some decisions of Federal and State courts have treated \n        the right of parents not as a fundamental right but as a \n        nonfundamental right, resulting in an improper standard of \n        judicial review being applied to government conduct that \n        adversely affects parental rights and prerogatives;\n            (5) parents face increasing intrusions into their \n        legitimate decisions and prerogatives by government agencies in \n        situations that do not involve traditional understandings of \n        abuse or neglect but simply are a conflict of parenting \n        philosophies;\n            (6) governments should not interfere in the decisions and \n        actions of parents without compelling justification; and\n            (7) the traditional 4-step process used by courts to \n        evaluate cases concerning the right of parents described in \n        paragraph (1) appropriately balances the interests of parents, \n        children, and government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect the right of parents to direct the \n        upbringing of their children as a fundamental right;\n            (2) to protect children from abuse and neglect as the terms \n        have been traditionally defined and applied in statutory law, \n        such protection being a compelling government interest;\n            (3) while protecting the rights of parents, to acknowledge \n        that the rights involve responsibilities and specifically that \n        parents have the responsibility to see that their children are \n        educated, for the purposes of literacy and self-sufficiency, as \n        specified by the Supreme Court in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. \n        205 (1972);\n            (4) to preserve the common law tradition that allows \n        parental choices to prevail in a health care decision for a \n        child unless, by neglect or refusal, the\n         parental decision will result in danger to the child's life or \nresult in serious physical injury of the child;\n            (5) to fix a standard of judicial review for parental \n        rights, leaving to the courts the application of the rights in \n        particular cases based on the facts of the cases and law as \n        applied to the facts; and\n            (6) to reestablish a 4-step process to evaluate cases \n        concerning the right of parents described in paragraph (1) \n        that--\n                    (A) requires a parent to initially demonstrate \n                that--\n                            (i) the action in question arises from the \n                        right of the parent to direct the upbringing of \n                        a child; and\n                            (ii) a government has interfered with or \n                        usurped the right; and\n                    (B) shifts the burdens of production and persuasion \n                to the government to demonstrate that--\n                            (i) the interference or usurpation is \n                        essential to accomplish a compelling \n                        governmental interest; and\n                            (ii) the method of intervention or \n                        usurpation used by the government is the least \n                        restrictive means of accomplishing the \n                        compelling interest.\n\nSEC. 3.
