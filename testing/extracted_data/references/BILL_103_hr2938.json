FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) each year thousands of babies throughout the United \n        States are abandoned by their parents shortly after birth, such \n        as when a mother gives birth at a hospital under an assumed \n        name and address and then disappears afterwards, leaving the \n        baby behind, when the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, \n        and when babies are left to die in garbage dumpsters because \n        their mothers cannot care for them;\n            (2) babies who are abandoned during the formative months \n        occurring shortly after birth are denied the ability to bond \n        with a loving parent or parents;\n            (3) the process of attachment or bonding between a baby and \n        the same adults is essential to the development of a healthy \n        personality in the baby;\n            (4) the Inspector General of the Department of Health and \n        Human Services, in the February 1990 report entitled ``Crack \n        Babies'', states that legislation ``should reduce barriers to \n        placing drug exposed infants into foster care and adoptive \n        homes and establish `fast track' procedures to expedite child \n        welfare cases involving drug abuse''; and\n            (5) according to experts, current legal rules and agency \n        policies make it exceedingly difficult and time consuming to \n        terminate parental rights of those parents who truly abandon \n        their babies, and as a result very few of those abandoned \n        babies are available for adoption;\n            (6) the welfare of babies abandoned during the formative \n        months occurring shortly after birth is of such special \n        interest and concern to our society that if there are persons \n        desiring to adopt and parentally bond with such a baby, the \n        baby should be afforded the right to expeditious placement \n        with, and adoption by, such persons; and\n            (7) other steps should be taken to expedite the adoption of \n        babies who are abandoned during the formative months occurring \n        shortly after birth.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to require States to implement a system \nthat will expedite the initiation of the adoption process for babies \nabandoned at birth. In doing so, States shall appoint competent persons \nto be preadoptive parents for babies abandoned at birth in order to \nprovide a proper and loving home during the infants' formative months. \nThe preadoptive parents will also be responsible for initiating legal \nproceedings that could lead to the legal adoption of the infant. Once \nthe proceedings have been initiated, the State courts of proper \njurisdiction will continue to be responsible for the final decision, \ntaking into account the legal rights of all the parties involved, \nincluding the baby abandoned at birth, the natural parents, the \npreadoptive parents, and the State.\n\nSEC. 4. ADOPTION BY PREADOPTIVE PARENTS OF BABIES ABANDONED AT BIRTH.\n\n    (a) Certain State Laws Required as Condition of Approving State \nPlan for Foster Care and Adoption Assistance.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 471 of the Social Security Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 671) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c)(1) The Secretary shall not approve a State plan under this \npart unless there is in effect in the State laws and rules of law which \nprovide all of the following:\n            ``(A) Within 30 days after the State obtains custody of a \n        baby abandoned at birth, the State shall--\n                    ``(i) find 1 or more individuals to be the \n                preadoptive parents of the baby;\n                    ``(ii) designate such individual or individuals as \n                the preadoptive parents of the baby; and\n                    ``(iii) place the baby with such individual or \n                individuals.\n            ``(B)(i) During the 90-day period beginning on the date a \n        baby abandoned at birth is placed with the preadoptive parents \n        of the baby, the preadoptive parents shall have the right to \n        petition the courts of the State for an expedited hearing--\n                    ``(I) to terminate the parental rights of all other \n                persons with respect to the baby; and\n                    ``(II) to become the adoptive parents of the baby.\n            ``(ii) In determining whether to grant a petition described \n        in clause (i), the courts of the State shall not draw any \n        inference adverse to the interests of a petitioner by reason of \n        the present or former status of any petitioner as a foster \n        parent.\n            ``(C) If the preadoptive parents of a baby abandoned at \n        birth fail to file a petition described in subparagraph (B)(i) \n        during the 90-day period described in subparagraph (B)(i), the \n        State shall--\n                    ``(i) immediately revoke their designation as the \n                preadoptive parents of the baby; and\n                    ``(ii) within 30 days after the end of such 90-day \n                period--\n                            ``(I) find 1 or more individuals (other \n                        than the former preadoptive parents of the \n                        baby) to be the new preadoptive parents of the \n                        baby;\n                            ``(II) designate such individual or \n                        individuals as the preadoptive parents of the \n                        baby; and\n                            ``(III) place the baby with such individual \n                        or individuals.\n    ``(2) As used in this subsection:\n            ``(A) The term `baby abandoned at birth' means a child \n        who--\n                    ``(i) has been physically abandoned by the parents \n                or legal guardians of the child for a time during the \n                critical period; and\n                    ``(ii) has not attained the age of 18 months.\n            ``(B) The term `critical period' means, with respect to a \n        child, the period beginning with the date the child is born and \n        ending with--\n                    ``(i) a date which may be specified by State law, \n                if such date occurs not earlier than 3 months, and not \n                later than 6 months, after the date the child is born; \n                or\n                    ``(ii) the date the child attains the age of 6 \n                months, if State law fails to specify a date in \n                accordance with clause (i).\n    ``(3) The provisions and rules of State law that are enacted or \nadopted pursuant to this subsection shall not be construed to affect \nany provision or rule of State law with respect to the abandonment of \nchildren that is not so enacted or adopted, except to the extent that \nsuch provisions or rules of State law are in direct conflict.''.\n            (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 471(b) of such Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 671(b)) is amended by striking ``the provisions of \n        subsection (a) of this section'' and inserting ``subsections \n        (a) and (c)''.\n    (b) Babies Abandoned at Birth Treated as Children With Special \nNeeds for Purposes of Adoption Assistance Program.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 473 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 673) is \n        amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Notwithstanding subsection (c), for purposes of this section, \na child who is or was a baby abandoned at birth (as defined in section \n471(c)(2)(A)) shall be considered a child with special needs.''.\n            (2) Applicability.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n        shall not apply to any child who attains the age of 18 months \n        before the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.

For purposes of the previous sentence, in \nthe case of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of \nsuch session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the \nState legislature."
