PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to encourage the collaborative, science-\nbased ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes through a \nprocess that--\n            (1) encourages ecological, economic, and social \n        sustainability;\n            (2) leverages local resources with national and private \n        resources;\n            (3) facilitates the reduction of wildfire management costs, \n        including through reestablishing natural fire regimes and \n        reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire; and\n            (4) demonstrates the degree to which--\n                    (A) various ecological restoration techniques--\n                            (i) achieve ecological health objectives; \n                        and\n                            (ii) affect wildfire activity and \n                        management costs; and\n                    (B) the use of forest restoration byproducts can \n                offset treatment costs while benefitting rural \n                economies and improving forest health.\n\nSEC. 3.
