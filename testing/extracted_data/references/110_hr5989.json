FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) While the field of neuroscience is highly advanced, our \n        understanding of how the brain works still has many gaps and \n        our ability to repair damage remains limited.\n            (2) Nearly 100,000,000 Americans suffer from a brain or \n        nervous system disease, injury, or disorder, and the national \n        economic burden of such brain-related illnesses has reached \n        over $1,000,000,000,000 per year and is growing alarmingly due \n        to an aging population.\n            (3) Critical unmet medical needs exist in almost every area \n        of the brain and nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease, \n        addiction, anxiety, chronic pain, depression, epilepsy, hearing \n        loss, multiple sclerosis, obesity, Parkinson's disease, \n        schizophrenia, sleep, spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic \n        brain injury, and more.\n            (4) While the science of the brain is moving forward more \n        rapidly than any other science today, we must ensure these \n        discoveries quickly become tools to improve the human \n        condition.\n            (5) Neurotechnology holds the potential to transform nearly \n        every aspect of our lives from medicine to defense to education \n        to computing, as well as our conception of the human mind.\n            (6) A global race is underway to determine the country that \n        will lead the neurotechnology economy, which will have long-\n        lasting implications on employment, infrastructure development, \n        and regional competitiveness.\n            (7) Federal leadership is needed to accelerate and \n        coordinate the development of neurotechnology and bring the \n        benefits to those in need across the Nation.\n            (8) Therefore, it is in the national interest for the \n        Federal Government to increase investment and interagency \n        coordination of Federal neurotechnology research, development, \n        and commercialization programs.\n\nSEC. 3.
