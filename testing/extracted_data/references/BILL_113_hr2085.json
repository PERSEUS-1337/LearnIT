Nothing in this paragraph shall be \n                construed as authorizing the Secretary to reveal \n                proprietary information which is otherwise prohibited \n                from disclosure under law.\n    (b) Process for Assignment of Temporary Codes for Diagnostic \nTests.--The Secretary shall establish a process for application for the \nassignment of a temporary national HCPCS code to uniquely identify a \ndiagnostic test until a permanent national HCPCS code is available for \nassignment to that test. Assignments of a temporary national HCPCS code \nshall occur on a quarterly basis. The Secretary shall provide public \nnotice through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Web site of \napplications made for such temporary national HCPCS codes.

Taking into account the changes made by this \nsection, the Secretary shall identify further changes to improve the \naccuracy and appropriateness of resulting rates and the openness, \ntransparency, and predictability of the process. The Secretary shall \nexamine what and how many entities should perform gapfilling, under \ncontract or otherwise, and how to ensure that the process is informed \nby appropriate expertise and proceeds in a transparent and accountable \nmanner. The Secretary shall implement improvements in the process, \ninsofar as these are possible under the law through regulations, after \npublic notice and opportunity for comment. For changes the Secretary \ndetermines would require a change in law, the Secretary shall transmit \nrecommendations to the Speaker of the House and the President of the \nSenate not later than July 1, 2014.\n    (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n            (1) New clinical diagnostic laboratory tests.--The term \n        ``new clinical diagnostic laboratory test'' means a clinical \n        diagnostic laboratory test--\n                    (A) that is assigned a new or substantially revised \n                code on or after January 1, 2013; or\n                    (B) for which a temporary national HCPCS code is \n                granted under subsection (b) on or after January 1, \n                2014.\n            (2) Self-pay patient.--The term ``self-pay patient'' means, \n        with respect to a health care item or service, an individual \n        who pays out of pocket for such item or service and who does \n        not have health insurance coverage for such item or service.\n    (e) Effective Date.--\n            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), this section \n        shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act and \n        shall apply with respect to new clinical diagnostic laboratory \n        tests.\n            (2) Application of justifications to current rate \n        determinations.--Subsection (a)(3) shall apply to payment basis \n        and payment rate determinations made on or after January 1, \n        2013."
