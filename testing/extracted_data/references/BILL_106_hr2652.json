FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A fair business environment is necessary to advance \n        international trade, economic stability, and development \n        worldwide, is beneficial for American workers and businesses, \n        and is in the United States national interest.\n            (2) In some cases, mandated offset requirements can cause \n        economic distortions in international defense trade and \n        undermine fairness and competitiveness, and may cause \n        particular harm to small- and medium-sized businesses.\n            (3) The use of offsets may lead to increasing dependence on \n        foreign suppliers for the production of United States weapons \n        systems.\n            (4) The offset demands required by some purchasing \n        countries, including some close allies of the United States, \n        equal or exceed the value of the base contract they are \n        intended to offset, mitigating much of the potential economic \n        benefit of the exports.\n            (5) Offset demands often unduly distort the prices of \n        defense contracts.\n            (6) In some cases, United States contractors are required \n        to provide indirect offsets which can negatively impact \n        nondefense industrial sectors.\n            (7) Unilateral efforts by the United States to prohibit \n        offsets may be impractical in the current era of globalization \n        and would severely hinder the competitiveness of the United \n        States defense industry in the global market.\n            (8) The development of global standards to manage and \n        restrict demands for offsets would enhance United States \n        efforts to mitigate the negative impact of offsets.\n    (b) Declaration of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States \nto develop a system for monitoring the use of offsets in international \ndefense trade, to promote fairness in such trade, and to ensure that \nforeign participation in the production of United States weapons \nsystems does not harm the economy of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the executive branch should pursue efforts to address \n        trade fairness by establishing reasonable, business-friendly \n        standards for the use of offsets in international business \n        transactions between the United States and its trading partners \n        and competitors;\n            (2) the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and \n        the United States Trade Representative, or their designees, \n        should raise with other industrialized nations at every \n        suitable venue the need for transparency and reasonable \n        standards to govern the role of offsets in international \n        defense trade; and\n            (3) the United States Government should enter into \n        discussions regarding the establishment of multilateral \n        standards for the use of offsets in international defense trade \n        through the appropriate multilateral fora, including such \n        organizations as the Transatlantic Economic Partnership, the \n        Wassenaar Arrangement, the G-8, and the World Trade \n        Organization.\n\nSEC. 4.
