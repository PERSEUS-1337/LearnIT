FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Students who are chronically absent--meaning they miss \n        10 percent or more of the school year--are more likely to \n        experience hardships later in life and 68 percent less likely \n        than their peers to graduate.\n            (2) The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights \n        Data Collection found that over 6.8 million students were \n        chronically absent during the 2013-2014 school year. This makes \n        up 14 percent of all students.\n            (3) Chronically absent students are more likely to become \n        high school drop outs. This leaves them prone to living in \n        poverty, suffering from diminished health, and being involved \n        in the criminal justice system later in life. Nineteen percent \n        of high school students are chronically absent.\n            (4) The Department of Education has found that, ``Chronic \n        absenteeism is widespread'' and ``Research suggests the reasons \n        for chronic absenteeism are as varied as the challenges our \n        students and families face--including poor health, limited \n        transportation, and a lack of safety--which can be particularly \n        acute in disadvantaged communities and areas of poverty.''.\n            (5) A report by the Everyone Graduates Center found that \n        chronic absenteeism can stem from a wide range of often \n        overlapping internal and external factors. External factors \n        include homelessness, family dysfunction, and transportation; \n        while internal factors include health, fear of bullying, \n        concern for safety, and not valuing daily school attendance. \n        Therefore, it is critical to have cross-sector collaborations \n        and multifaceted strategies that incorporate parents, public-\n        private partnerships, and community partners.\n            (6) Students of color are disproportionately chronically \n        absent compared to their White peers. Latino students are 11 \n        percent more likely to be chronically absent, African-American \n        students are 36 percent more likely, and American Indian and \n        Pacific Islander students are over 65 percent more likely \n        according to the Department of Education's Office of Civil \n        Rights Data Collection.\n            (7) Studies have shown that mentors can help reduce chronic \n        absenteeism. Students who regularly meet with mentors are 52 \n        percent less likely than their peers to skip a day of school \n        and 37 percent less likely to skip a class. In one program, \n        previously chronically absent students in 2012-13 with \n        ``Success Mentors'' gained 51,562 additional days of school \n        compared to previously chronically absent students without \n        mentors at comparison schools; and 92,277 additional days \n        compared to comparison school students without mentors during \n        the 3-year initiative.\n            (8) A report on the impact of one mentoring program found \n        that it reduced school absenteeism by half. In another study, \n        youth showed a gain of more than a week of class attendance.\n            (9) Studies estimate that 9.4 million young people who are \n        at risk need a mentor.\n\nSEC. 3. INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM.\n\n    Section 4108(5) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 (20 U.S.C. 7118(5)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (H)(iii) by striking ``or'' at the end;\n            (2) in subparagraph (I), by striking the period at the end \n        and inserting ``;
