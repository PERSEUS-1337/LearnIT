FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The national policy of the United States declares that \n        pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever \n        feasible, prior to environmentally sound recycling, treatment, \n        or landfilling.\n            (2) There are significant opportunities for industry to \n        reduce or prevent pollution at the source through cost-\n        effective changes in production, operation, and raw materials \n        use.\n            (3) Such changes offer industry substantial savings in \n        reduced raw material, pollution control, and liability costs, \n        and help to protect the environment and reduce risks to worker \n        health and safety.\n            (4) Federal Government estimates indicate that businesses \n        can reduce their waste generation 33 percent to 50 percent by \n        implementing source reduction techniques, and private sector \n        studies suggest that some industry sectors can reduce their \n        waste by up to 80 percent through the use of such techniques.\n            (5) In most cases, source reduction and energy efficiency \n        techniques do not require the purchase of new equipment, but \n        merely a better understanding of how to use equipment currently \n        available.\n            (6) In fact, one recent study indicated that 25 percent of \n        all source reduction activities require no capital investment \n        for implementation and, of those that require capital, 50 \n        percent of the capital expenditures were recouped in savings \n        in, on average, less than 18 months.\n            (7) The private sector must take the lead in reducing the \n        production of waste by manufacturing companies and, in fact, \n        many large companies have contracted with consultants or \n        performed internal audits to find methods for reducing \n        pollution in their own processes.\n            (8) Source reduction is fundamentally different from, and \n        more desirable than, waste management and pollution control and \n        should be promoted by Federal agencies, particularly the \n        Department of Commerce in its role in assisting businesses.\n            (9) The Federal Government can assist small- and medium-\n        sized companies that often are unaware of the techniques \n        available for pollution prevention and the possible savings \n        from employing them, and such Government assistance will help \n        meet the dual goals of modernizing manufacturing and improving \n        the environment.\n            (10) The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department \n        of Energy can provide the Manufacturing Technology Centers with \n        technical expertise in this area.\n            (11) The Environmental Protection Agency has conducted over \n        200 source reduction assessments for manufacturers and the \n        Department of Energy has conducted over 4,100 energy audits \n        which have saved companies $419 million and 77 trillion Btu's \n        of energy.\n            (12) Assisting small- and medium-sized companies to reduce \n        the waste products created during the manufacturing process \n        will reduce the companies' costs, and thus improve the \n        competitiveness of such companies, by--\n                    (A) reducing their costs of disposal;\n                    (B) reducing their costs of complying with \n                environmental regulations;\n                    (C) reducing their raw material costs;\n                    (D) reducing liability costs associated with \n                transport and disposal; and\n                    (E) assisting these companies in identifying areas \n                where their production processes are inefficient.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to incorporate \nenvironmental concerns into technology programs established in the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nSEC. 3. DISSEMINATION OF SOURCE REDUCTION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY \n              TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n    The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. \n3701 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 23. DISSEMINATION OF SOURCE REDUCTION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY \n              TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Each Regional Center for the Transfer of \nManufacturing Technology established in section 25 of the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278k) shall \nconduct or assist in the conducting of energy efficiency and source \nreduction assessments of client companies of the Regional Centers and \nthe Manufacturing Outreach Centers established under subsection (c). \nThese assessments shall assist such client companies in identifying \nopportunities for energy efficiency conservation and source reduction \nthrough improvements in manufacturing processes or the purchase of new \nequipment.\n    ``(b) Training and Other Assistance.--In order to facilitate these \nenergy efficiency and source reduction assessments--\n            ``(1) at least one employee of each Regional Center (who \n        shall be designated by such Regional Center) shall receive \n        training from the Department of Energy and the Environmental \n        Protection Agency concerning the conducting of energy \n        efficiency and source reduction assessments; and\n            ``(2) not later than 12 months after the date of enactment \n        of this section, the National Institute of Standards and \n        Technology, in consultation with the Environmental Protection \n        Agency and the Department of Energy, shall make available a \n        software assessment package to the Regional Centers and the \n        Manufacturing Outreach Centers for the purpose of assisting \n        client companies in identifying opportunities for improved \n        energy efficiency and source reduction.\n    ``(c) Manufacturing Outreach Centers.--(1) Eligible government and \nprivate sector organizations that are engaged in technology or \nmanufacturing extension activities may apply to the Secretary for \ndesignation as Manufacturing Outreach Centers, in such form and manner \nas the Secretary may prescribe. Eligible organizations include Federal, \nState, and local government agencies, extension programs, universities, \nand laboratories; small business development centers; and professional \nsocieties, worker organizations, industrial organizations, nonprofit \norganizations, community development organizations, community colleges, \nand technical schools and colleges.\n    ``(2) The Secretary shall establish standards for designation of \nexisting technology or manufacturing extension programs and for \nqualification of start-up programs as Manufacturing Outreach Centers.\n    ``(d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term `source \nreduction' has the same meaning as in section 6603 of the Pollution \nPrevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13102).''."
