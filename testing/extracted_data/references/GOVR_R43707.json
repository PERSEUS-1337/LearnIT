    "content": "Congressional interest in the issue of elder abuse spans more than a quarter of a century with numerous hearings and reports concerning the need for a federal response to abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly. Prior to enactment of the Elder Justice Act as part of the ACA, Congress took a number of steps towards addressing elder abuse, including authorizing federal assistance to state Adult Protective Services (APS) programs through the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program and amendments to the Older Americans Act (OAA) to provide separate funding for elder abuse prevention and vulnerable elder rights protection activities, including establishment of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program (LTCOP). Provisions regarding elder justice were also incorporated in the OAA reauthorization of 2006 ( P.L. 109-365 ).  In 2002, the 107 th Congress first introduced the Elder Justice Act ( S. 2933 ) by then Senator John Breaux. After that, Elder Justice Act legislation was re-introduced in subsequent Congresses with Senate Finance Committee action on bills in the 108 th , 109 th , and 110 th Congresses. In the 111 th Congress, Senator Orrin Hatch introduced the Elder Justice Act of 2009 ( S. 795 ) which addressed public health and social services approaches to the issue. A separate bill ( H.R. 2006 ) was introduced in the House by Representative Peter T. King, which, in addition to the public health and social services provisions also included criminal justice provisions. The Senate bill ( S. 795 ) was incorporated into the Senate Finance Committee's health reform bill ( S. 1796 ) and subsequently adopted in the Senate health reform bill ( H.R. 3590 ) which became the ACA ( P.L. 111-148 ).  It is important to note that the elder justice provisions enacted under the ACA did not achieve the multidisciplinary approach (public health, social services, and criminal justice) fully envisioned in earlier versions of introduced legislation. Enactment of the Elder Justice Act under the ACA contains provisions that address certain public health and social services approaches to prevention, detection, and treatment of elder abuse primarily under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) authorities and administration. It does not include a criminal justice response which would address the prevention, detection, and prosecution of elder abuse crimes under various Department of Justice (DOJ) authorities and administration. Earlier versions of the Elder Justice Act included such a multidisciplinary approach that incorporated criminal justice provisions. With enactment of the Elder Justice Act under the ACA, criminal justice provisions have been subsequently introduced as separate stand-alone legislation. In the 114 th Congress, these bills included S. 3270 , the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act; S. 2747 / H.R. 5018 , the Elder Protection and Abuse Prevention Act; S. 1663 , the Robert Matava Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2015; and H.R. 4963 the Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2016. In addition, one bill was introduced to reauthorize the Elder Justice Act in the 114 th Congress. The Elder Justice Reauthorization Act ( H.R. 988 ), introduced by Representative Peter King would have extended the authorization of appropriations under the act through FY2019. None of these bills were enacted into law in the 114 th Congress. The Elder Justice Act provisions enacted under the ACA authorize entities and programs that address federal coordination of elder abuse and administration of new grant activities, as well as certain protections for residents of long-term care facilities, and other specified studies. The following describes these provisions in greater detail. Several of the Elder Justice provisions enacted under the ACA amended the Social Security Act (SSA) which incorporated Elder Justice into a renamed Title XX entitled Block Grants to States for Social Services and Elder Justice . The ACA subsequently reorganized the structure of SSA Title XX, by placing previously existing sections (i.e., Sections 2001-2007) under a new Subtitle A, Block Grants to States for Social Services , and adding a new Subtitle B, Elder Justice . Several SSA Elder Justice provisions address federal coordination and research activities. Specifically, SSA Title XX, Subtitle B establishes an Elder Justice Coordinating Council and an Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation. It also addresses research protections and awards grants to establish and operate stationary and mobile forensic centers. These provisions and any administrative or other actions to implement authorized programs or activities are further described below. The Elder Justice Act established the Elder Justice Coordinating Council at HHS. The Council includes the HHS Secretary as chair and the U.S. Attorney General as a permanent member, as well as the head of each federal department or agency, identified by the chair, as having administrative responsibility or administering programs related to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The Council is required to submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress within two years of enactment and every two years thereafter that describes its activities and challenges; and make recommendations for legislation, model laws, and other actions deemed appropriate. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as necessary to carry out the Council's functions. (See report section entitled \"Authorizations of Appropriations\" for further appropriations information.) On Oct. 11, 2012, the HHS Secretary convened the inaugural meeting of the Elder Justice Coordinating Council. The Council is a permanent group, anticipated to meet twice a year. The HHS Secretary has assigned responsibility for implementing the Council to the Administration for Community Living (ACL). The work of the Council is supported by a staff-level Elder Justice Interagency Working Group also led by ACL which was established prior to ACA. Since the inaugural meeting, the Council has convened several times. During these meetings Elder Justice Interagency Working Group members presented proposals for federal action and a summary of steps for federal involvement in the prevention, detection, and prosecution of elder abuse. The working group also coordinated a report of federal activities in elder justice since 2010. At the May 2014 meeting the Council agreed to a set of eight recommendations for increased federal involvement in addressing elder abuse (see text box \"Elder Justice Coordinating Council: Recommendations for Increased Federal Involvement in Elder Abuse\"). The Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation is established to create a short- and long-term multidisciplinary plan for development of the field of elder justice and make recommendations to the Elder Justice Coordinating Council. The Advisory Board must be composed of 27 members from the general public appointed by the Secretary and must have experience and expertise in prevention of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The Advisory Board is required to submit a report to the Elder Justice Coordinating Council and the appropriate committees of Congress within 18 months of enactment and annually thereafter that contains information on the status of federal, state, and local elder justice activities; and makes specified recommendations. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as necessary to carry out the functions of the Advisory Board. On July 14, 2010, HHS published a notice establishing the Advisory Board; however, no subsequent public announcement by HHS has been made about Board appointments or activities. (See report section entitled \"Authorizations of Appropriations\" for further appropriations information.) The HHS Secretary is required to promulgate guidelines to assist researchers working in the areas of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation with issues relating to human research subject protections. For the purposes of the application of certain specified federal regulations to research conducted under this subpart it defines \"legally authorized representative\" to mean, unless otherwise provided by law, the individual, or judicial or other body authorized under the applicable law to consent to medical treatment on behalf of another person. No public information on the status of guidance promulgated by HHS Secretary was found. (See report section \" Authorizations of Appropriations \" for further appropriations information.) To carry out the above functions of the Elder Justice Coordinating Council, (SSA Section 2021), Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation (SSA Section 2022), and research protection guidelines for human subjects (SSA Section 2023) a new SSA Section 2024, Authorization of Appropriations , authorizes to be appropriated $6.5 million for FY2011, and $7.0 million for each of FY2012 through FY2014. To date, Congress has not provided discretionary funding for these activities through the annual appropriations process. However, the Elder Justice Coordinating Council has convened several times, as previously mentioned. SSA Elder Justice provisions also added a section regarding establishment and support of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation forensic centers. This provision requires the HHS Secretary, in consultation with the U.S. Attorney General, to award grants to eligible entities to establish and operate both stationary and mobile forensic centers and to develop forensic expertise pertaining to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It authorizes to be appropriated $4 million for FY2011, $6 million for FY2012, and $8 million for each of FY2013 and FY2014 to carry out these activities. To date, Congress has not provided discretionary funding for these activities through the annual appropriations process. SSA Elder Justice provisions establish several grant programs and other activities to promote elder justice through various enhancements to the workforce and electronic health record technology, grants to adult protective services programs and training for long-term care ombudsman, among other activities. These provisions are described below. The Elder Justice Act required the HHS Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Labor, to carry out activities that provide incentives for individuals to train for, seek, and maintain employment providing direct care in long-term care (LTC). In doing so, the HHS Secretary is required to award grants to eligible entities to conduct programs that offer direct care employees continuing training and varying levels of certification.  The act further authorized the HHS Secretary to make grants to LTC facilities for specified activities that would assist such entities in offsetting costs related to purchasing, leasing, developing, and implementing certified electronic health records (EHR) technology designed to improve patient safety and reduce adverse events and health care complications resulting from medication errors. This section also requires the Secretary to adopt electronic standards for the exchange of clinical data by LTC facilities and, within 10 years of enactment, to have in place procedures to accept the optional electronic submission of clinical data by LTC facilities pursuant to such standards. The standards adopted must be compatible with standards established under current law, as specified, and with general health information technology standards.  The section authorizes to be appropriated $20.0 million for FY2011, $17.5 million for FY2012, and $15.0 million for each of FY2013 and FY2014 to carry out the activities under this section. To date, Congress has not provided discretionary funding for these activities through the annual appropriations process. Adult Protective Services (APS) programs are social services programs established through legislation enacted in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. APS programs serve seniors and adults with disabilities by offering a system for reporting and investigating abuse as well as providing social services to assist victims. State APS laws vary in the age of eligibility for APS assistance, definition of abuse, types of abuse covered, classification of the abuse as criminal or civil, mandatory reporting requirements, investigative procedures, and remedies for abuse. Prior to enactment of the Elder Justice Act, there was no dedicated federal funding authority for state APS programs. However, some states have used federal funding provided under the OAA and the Social Services Block Grant program to supplement state and local funding for APS programs.  Several SSA Elder Justice provisions addressed federal funding and additional resources for state APS programs. Specifically, SSA Title XX requires the HHS Secretary to ensure that the Department (1) provides authorized funding to state and local APS offices that investigate reports of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; (2) collects and disseminates data in coordination with DOJ; (3) develops and disseminates information on best practices regarding, and provides training on, carrying out APS; (4) conducts research related to the provision of APS; and (5) provides technical assistance to states and other entities that provide or fund APS. To carry out these functions, the section authorizes to be appropriated $3.0 million for FY2011 and $4 million for each of FY2012 through FY2014. Congress provided $4.0 million in discretionary funding for FY2015 and $8.0 million for FY2016 through the annual appropriations process for these activities. The HHS Secretary is also required to establish two grant programs. The first are grants to enhance APS programs provided by states and local governments. The second are grants to states for APS demonstration programs. Annual grants awarded to states to enhance APS programs are to be distributed to states based on a formula. For each of FY2011 through FY2014, the section authorizes to be appropriated $100.0 million for annual grants to enhance APS programs and $25.0 million for the APS demonstration grants. To date, Congress has not provided discretionary funding for these activities through the annual appropriations process. The Long-Term Care (LTC) Ombudsman Program is a consumer advocacy program that aims to improve the quality of care, as well as the quality of life, for residents in long-term care settings by investigating and resolving complaints made by, or on behalf of, such residents. Established under Title VII of the Older Americans Act (OAA), the Administration on Aging (AoA) within the Administration for Community Living (ACL) under HHS administers the nationwide program. As of 2010, there were 53 state LTC Ombudsman Programs operating in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico, and 578 local programs. States and territories receive an annual allotment for ombudsman activities based on a statutory funding formula. For FY2015, the total appropriated funding for the LTC Ombudsman Program was $15.9 million. SSA Elder Justice provisions require the HHS Secretary to award grants to eligible entities with relevant expertise and experience in abuse and neglect in LTC facilities or state LTC ombudsman programs to (1) improve the capacity of state LTC ombudsman programs to respond to and resolve abuse and neglect complaints; (2) conduct pilot programs with state or local LTC ombudsman offices; and (3) provide support for such state LTC ombudsman programs and such pilot programs. It authorizes to be appropriated $5 million for FY2011, $7.5 million for FY2012, and $10 million for each of FY2013 and FY2014. The section also requires the Secretary to establish programs to provide and improve ombudsman training with respect to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation for national organizations and state LTC ombudsman programs. It authorizes to be appropriated $10 million for each of FY2011 through FY2014. To date, Congress has not provided discretionary funding for these activities through the annual appropriations process. Provisions enacted under the Elder Justice Act establish (1) a National Training Institute for Surveyors and grants to state survey agencies; and (2) requirements for reporting crimes in federally funded LTC facilities.  As specified under SSA Titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid), each state has a licensing and certification agency that inspects long-term care facilities that participate in Medicare and/or Medicaid. These state agencies conduct standard surveys, extended surveys and, under certain circumstances, impose remedies for noncompliance. The surveys they conduct examine both the facility's processes for delivering care and the outcomes of residents' care to ensure the minimum standards are met. CMS' Survey & Certification Group provides some instruction and training to state and federal surveyors through classroom and web-based training applications.  The Elder Justice Act requires the HHS Secretary to enter into a contract to establish and operate the National Training Institute for federal and state surveyors to carry out specified activities that provide and improve training of surveyors investigating allegations of abuse, neglect, and misappropriation of property in programs and LTC facilities that receive payments under Medicare or Medicaid. It authorizes to be appropriated $12 million for the period of FY2011 through FY2014 to carry out these activities. The HHS Secretary is also required to award grants to state survey agencies that perform surveys of Medicare or Medicaid participating facilities to design and implement complaint investigation systems. It authorizes $5 million for each of FY2011 through FY2014 to carry out these activities. To date, Congress has not provided discretionary funding for these activities through the annual appropriations process. The Elder Justice Act amended SSA Title XI, Part A by adding a new Section 1150B, requiring the reporting of crimes occurring in LTC facilities that receive at least $10,000 in federal funds during the preceding year. It requires owners, operators, employees, managers, agents, or contractors of nursing facilities (covered individuals) to report any reasonable suspicion of a crime (as defined by the law of the applicable political subdivision) against a resident or individual receiving care from the facility to the appropriate entities. Failure to report suspicion of a crime would result in a civil monetary penalty and the Secretary may make a determination to exclude the covered individual from participation in any federal health care program. If an individual is classified as an \"excluded individual,\" a LTC facility that employs that person is not eligible to receive federal funds under the SSA.  Section 1150B also requires applicable nursing facilities to annually notify covered individuals that they are required to report any reasonable suspicion of a crime to the appropriate entities. It prohibits a LTC facility from retaliating against an employee for making a report. If retaliation occurs, the LTC facility may be subject to a civil money penalty or the HHS Secretary may exclude them from participation in any federal health care program for a period of two years, or both. In addition, each LTC facility is required to post conspicuously, in an appropriate location, a sign specifying the rights of employees under this section. In June 2011, CMS issued guidance to state survey agency directors describing the regulations related to the reporting of reasonable suspicion of a crime in applicable nursing facilities and provided responses to frequently asked questions. A 2014 report by the HHS Office of Inspector General found that 61% of nursing facilities (9,487 facilities) had documentation to support meeting both reporting requirements: (1) to annually notify covered individuals of their obligation to report reasonable suspicion of crime, and (2) to clearly post a sign specifying the rights of employees to make such reports.  Nurse aides generally work in nursing facilities under the direction of a nurse and provide the majority of direct care to residents, helping with activities of daily living (ADLs) (i.e., eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and mobility). They may also provide health-related and other housekeeping tasks such as administering medications, checking vital signs, assisting with medical equipment such as oxygen or a ventilator, making a resident's bed, or cleaning a resident's room. However, the scope of work performed by nurse aides can vary according to state licensing requirements and the provider. Federal regulations require each state and DC to establish and maintain a nurse aide registry of individuals who have completed training and are registered to work as nurse aides in that state. State-based nurse aide registries also must include individuals who have been prohibited from employment as nurse aides in LTC facilities due to substantiated findings of abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of property. Nurse aide registries are utilized by LTC providers to conduct background checks on potential employees as LTC facilities are required to check their state nurse aide registry and other state-based registries that are believed to include information on the potential employee. Such databases can be an effective resource in identifying individuals with a history of abuse. The HHS Secretary is required, in consultation with appropriate government agencies and private sector organizations, to conduct a study on establishing a national nurse aide registry. No later than 18 months after the date of enactment, the Secretary is required to submit a report to the Elder Justice Coordinating Council and appropriate congressional committees containing the findings and recommendations of the study. It authorizes to be appropriated such sums as necessary to carry these activities, with funding for the study not to exceed $500,000. To date, Congress has not provided discretionary funding for this activity through the annual appropriations process and no study has been completed or report submitted to these entities. To date, most programs and activities authorized under the Elder Justice Act have not received funding. For the first time, Congress appropriated $4 million for Elder Justice/Adult Protective Services activities in FY2015. Another $8 million was appropriated for these activities in FY2016. Prior to these annual appropriations, the President's budget request in each of fiscal years 2012 through 2014 requested funding for adult protective services grants. However, Congress did not provide discretionary funding for this activity through the annual appropriations process in these years.  Despite the lack of discretionary appropriations, in FY2012 and FY2013 some elder justice activities received funds transferred from mandatory appropriations to the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF; see Table 1 ). Under the ACA, Congress provided the PPHF with a permanent annual appropriation. PPHF funds are to be transferred by the HHS Secretary for prevention, wellness, and public health activities and are available on October 1, the beginning of each new fiscal year. For FY2012, the HHS Secretary transferred $6.0 million to ACL from the PPHF for new grants to states and tribes to test elder abuse prevention strategies (authorized under SSA Section 2042 and OAA Section 751). ACL awarded grants to states, tribal organizations, and for an evaluation of the state grantees under the Elder Abuse Prevention Interventions Program. Projects included using forensic accountants to prevent elder financial exploitation, increasing medication adherence to prevent elder self-neglect, and developing screening tools to identify elder abuse. In addition to grants to states, three tribal organizations received grant funding for the development of a multi-disciplinary team to address elder abuse in Indian Country; development and testing of culturally appropriate evidence based screening tools; and culturally appropriate train-the-trainer modules to improve skills on addressing and intervening with elder abuse issues. For FY2013, $2.0 million was transferred to ACL from the PPHF for elder justice activities which funded development of the National Adult Maltreatment Report System (see text box below). No PPHF or other funds were transferred to ACL for elder justice activities for FY2014 or subsequent fiscal years. To further assist state APS programs, ACL has also established the National Adult Protective Services Technical Assistance Resource Center (APS TARC) as well as Voluntary Consensus Guidelines for State APS Systems. These initiatives provide some assistance to states in developing efficient and effective state APS programs. In addition, in FY2015 and FY2016 funding was awarded to 24 state grantees to address innovations and improvements in the practice, services, data collection, and reporting under the State Grants to Enhance Adult Protective Services demonstration grant program. In FY2016, ACL established the Elder Justice Innovation Grants program, which funded eight competitive grants to various entities (e.g., higher education institutions, non-profit organizations, local government entities) to increase knowledge about effective ways to address prevention or intervention of abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older adults. Grants were awarded for forensic center innovation, to address abuse in Indian Country, to address abuse in guardianship, and to understand self-neglect. For FY2017, the President's budget requested $10 million in discretionary funding for Elder Justice/Adult Protective Services, which would be used to fund implementation of a nationwide Adult Protective Services data system, research, and evaluation activities. The 2017 budget request did not specify an intended transfer of funding from the PPHF to ACL for elder justice activities. For FY2017, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10.0 million for the Elder Justice Initiative in its FY2017 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $8.0 million in its FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill. Neither House nor Senate floor consideration of the bill occurred in the 114 th Congress. Since the start of the fiscal year (October 1, 2016), funding for LHHS programs and activities has been provided by two continuing resolutions (CR; P.L. 114-223 and P.L. 114-254 ). The second FY2017 CR provides continuing appropriations for LHHS appropriations through April 28, 2017, or until full year appropriations are enacted. The ACA created several new discretionary programs, including those authorized under the Elder Justice Act, and provided for each an authorization of appropriations. Most elder justice programs and activities have yet to receive funding through the annual congressional appropriations process limiting the administration's response to implementation. It is also anticipated that the 115 th Congress will consider legislation to change the ACA. While opposition to the law has primarily focused on changes to the private health insurance market and the expansion of the Medicaid program, the ACA included other health-related provisions such as those enacted under the Elder Justice Act. A broad repeal of the law could have a wide range of effects on the health care system, including eliminating federal authority to address prevention, detection, and treatment for elder abuse. In addition, the authorizations of appropriations for most Elder Justice Act provisions expired on September 30, 2014 (see Table A-1 of Appendix A for information on specific Elder Justice Act authorizations of appropriations). In the 114 th Congress, Representative Peter King introduced the Elder Justice Reauthorization Act ( H.R. 988 ), which would have extended the authorizations of appropriations under the act through FY2019. The bill was referred to the House Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, and Education and the Workforce Committees and saw no further action. In considering reauthorization of the Elder Justice Act, Congress faces a decision whether or not to extend the authorizations of appropriations associated with existing programs and activities. Some policymakers may consider new language to modify or delete existing authorities as well as authorize new programs or activities. Congress may also want to consider the relationship between Elder Justice Act authorities and other similar or related authorities in other statutes. For example, the OAA establishes the LTC Ombudsman Program, administered by AoA within ACL. The Elder Justice Act authorizes grants under the Social Security Act to improve capacity and provide assistance to state LTC Ombudsman Programs as well as provide training to ombudsman. As authorized these programs have different committees of jurisdiction responsible for program authorization and oversight.  In the context of these actions, policymakers may look to existing state and federal administrative activities for areas of continued legislative emphasis. A discussion of selected issues follows.  Congress first appropriated dedicated funding for Elder Justice activities in FY2015. This investment has been critical to the development of a national APS data collection system and the development of evidence-based research and programs. In addition, ACL has provided leadership in establishing federal resources for state APS systems, including the National APS Resource Center and voluntary consensus guidelines for state APS systems. However, the lack of full federal funding as authorized in the act has hampered the ability of the federal government to further its role in addressing the prevention, detection, and treatment of elder abuse. The OAA first called attention to the importance of federal leadership in the area of elder justice. Under the OAA, the AOA has primary responsibility for federal leadership in carrying out elder justice activities. However, similar to EJA, funding under the OAA for such activities has also been limited. According to GAO, the Elder Justice Act \"reaffirmed the importance of federal leadership of elder justice activities and provides a vehicle for establishing and implementing national priorities in this area.\" While the Elder Justice Coordinating Committee has appointed members and convened several times, an Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation tasked to put forth a plan to develop the field of elder abuse has yet to be established. Further federal efforts to develop objectives, priorities, policy, and a long-term planning on these issues may be limited by available funding. Federal efforts to collect data on elder abuse at the national level are compounded by variation in state statutory definitions of elder abuse that make it difficult to identify actions that constitute elder abuse, and by the absence of a uniform reporting system across states. A 2011 GAO report recommended the HHS Secretary conduct a pilot study to collect, compile, and disseminate APS administrative data. To this end, ACL has utilized Elder Justice Act funding to design, develop, and pilot test the National Adult Maltreatment Reporting System (NAMRS). Policymakers may have a continued interest in this initiative and further funding efforts to expand data collection activities to all states based on findings and recommendations from the administration. According to ACL, \"most communities do not have comprehensive elder abuse prevention efforts that engage a broad set of individuals and institutions that can play a role in combating abuse, such as health professionals, law enforcement and legal services agencies, social workers, clergy, and community organizations.\" To implement the Elder Justice Act, the ACL funded several grants to states and tribal organizations that test interventions designed to prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. These multidisciplinary models draw on prevention strategies from other family violence prevention programs and can assist in developing the evidence base for more widespread dissemination. ACL has invested in an evaluation of such grants. Based on findings from research, such initiatives could be disseminated more broadly to other states and entities through federally funded websites such as the National Center for Elder Abuse, federal technical assistance, and further funding opportunities. The Elder Justice Act represents one set of policies that exist in the broader context of domestic social policy to address the complex issue that is elder abuse. That is, as a federal legislative response, the Elder Justice Act may best serve as a catalyst for further federal coordination and action that can bring about greater public awareness and attention to the needs of a growing, and potentially vulnerable, aging population. According to GAO, the Elder Justice Act \"provides a vehicle for setting national priorities and establishing a comprehensive, multidisciplinary elder justice system in this country.\" Such a response touches on a range of domestic policy programs and issues that are not specific to one congressional committee's jurisdiction or area of expertise. Furthermore, congressional oversight into federal administration, implementation, and related activities must rely on different committees of jurisdiction as well as the experience of select committees such as the Senate Special Committee on Aging. According to subject matter experts, elder abuse is not an easy problem to address as it is a complex cluster of distinct but related phenomena involving health, legal, social service, financial, public safety, aging, disability, protective services, and victim services, aging services, policy, research, education, and human rights issues. It therefore requires a coordinated multidisciplinary, multi-agency, and multi-system response. Achieving such a response will likely require congressional interest in overseeing the range of elder justice programs and activities that currently exist across federal agencies. In addition, further research may assist policymakers to address areas where service delivery is either fragmented or lacks sufficient resources, or both. According to stakeholders, there are numerous challenges in responding to elder abuse, including lack of coordination, data, and resources. Addressing these challenges could assist in developing an informed strategic and coordinated federal response. Appendix A.
