SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program Designation of \nResponsibilities Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--\n            (1) Since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and \n        women have served the Nation in building its nuclear defense. \n        In the course of their work, they overcame previously \n        unimagined scientific and technical challenges. However, \n        thousands of these courageous Americans paid a high price for \n        their service, developing disabling or fatal illnesses as a \n        result of exposure to silica, beryllium, ionizing radiation, \n        and other hazards unique to nuclear weapons production and \n        testing.\n            (2) Too often, these workers were neither adequately \n        protected from, nor informed of, the occupational hazards to \n        which they were exposed.\n            (3) Over the past 20 years more than 2 dozen scientific \n        findings have emerged that indicate that Department of Energy \n        workers are experiencing increased risks of dying from cancer \n        and nonmalignant diseases at numerous facilities that provided \n        for the Nation's nuclear deterrent. Several of these studies \n        also establish a correlation between excess diseases and \n        exposure to silica, radiation, and beryllium.\n            (4) Federal workers' compensation programs have generally \n        not included these workers. Further, because of long latency \n        periods, the uniqueness of the hazards to which they were \n        exposed, and inadequate exposure data, many of these \n        individuals have been unable to obtain State workers' \n        compensation benefits. This problem has been exacerbated by the \n        past policy of the Department of Energy and its predecessors of \n        encouraging and assisting its contractors in opposing the \n        claims of workers who sought those benefits.\n            (5) The civilian men and women who performed duties \n        uniquely related to the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons \n        production program over the last 50 years should have \n        efficient, uniform, and adequate compensation for beryllium-\n        related health conditions, radiation-related health conditions, \n        and silica-related health conditions in order to assure \n        fairness and equity.\n            (6) The Federal Government should provide necessary \n        information and otherwise help employees of the Department of \n        Energy or its contractors to determine if their illnesses are \n        associated with conditions of their nuclear weapons-related \n        work. It should provide workers and their survivors with all \n        pertinent and available information necessary for evaluating \n        and processing claims. It should also ensure that this program \n        minimizes the administrative responsibilities to accomplish \n        these goals.\n            (7) This situation is sufficiently unique to the Department \n        of Energy's nuclear weapons production program that it is \n        appropriate for congressional action.\n\nSEC. 2. ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ADMINISTERING PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Secretary of Labor.--The Secretary of Labor shall have primary \nresponsibility for administering the Energy Employees Occupational \nIllness Compensation Program (hereinafter in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Program'') established under section 3611 of the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (as enacted by \nPublic Law 106-398; 114 Stat. 1654A-497) (hereinafter in this Act \nreferred to as the ``2000 Act'').
