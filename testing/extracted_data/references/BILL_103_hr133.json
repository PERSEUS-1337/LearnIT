VALUE ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL AGENCIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Federal agencies shall apply value engineering \nconsistent with subsection (b)(2) to, at a minimum, identify and \nimplement opportunities to reduce capital and operation costs and \nimprove and maintain optimum quality of construction, administrative, \nprogram, acquisition, and grant projects. The head of each Federal \nagency shall require senior management personnel to establish and \nmaintain value engineering procedures and processes. Such procedures \nand processes shall, at a minimum--\n            (1) utilize qualified value engineering personnel \n        consistent with paragraphs (1) and (4) of subsection (b);\n            (2) provide for the aggressive and systematic development \n        and maintenance of the most effective, efficient, and \n        economical arrangement for conducting the work of the agency; \n        and\n            (3) provide a sound basis for the reporting of \n        accomplishments to the Office of Management and Budget, the \n        President, the Congress, and the public.\n    (b) Agency Responsibilities.--To ensure that systemic value \nengineering improvements are achieved, each Federal agency shall, at a \nminimum, carry out the following:\n            (1) Designate a senior management official with a \n        significant, well-documented background in value engineering as \n        the value engineering manager within the agency, to oversee and \n        monitor value engineering efforts and to coordinate the \n        development of criteria and guidelines referred to in paragraph \n        (2).\n            (2) Develop criteria and guidelines for both agency \n        employees and contractor employees to identify programs, \n        projects, systems, and products with the greatest potential to \n        yield savings and benefits from the application of value \n        engineering methodology. The criteria and guidelines should \n        recognize that the potential savings are greatest during the \n        planning, design, and other early phases of program, project, \n        system, and product development. The criteria and guidelines \n        shall include the following:\n                    (A) Consideration of return on the Government's \n                investment in value engineering, determined by dividing \n                the Government's cost of performing the value \n                engineering function by the savings generated by the \n                function.\n                    (B) A dollar amount threshold for requiring the \n                application of value engineering. The threshold shall \n                be designed to ensure that value engineering is applied \n                to--\n                            (i) each program, project, system, and \n                        product of the agency that has a dollar value \n                        greater than the threshold; and\n                            (ii) programs, projects, systems, and \n                        products comprising in the aggregate 80 percent \n                        of the budget of the agency.\n                For purposes of applying such a threshold, the dollar \n                values of various programs, projects, systems, and \n                products of an agency that have individual values below \n                the threshold shall be aggregated if they utilize \n                equivalent planning or design elements, are jointly \n                administered, or are functionally equivalent.\n                    (C) Criteria under which the value engineering \n                manager of the agency may, on a case-by-case basis, \n                waive the requirement of this Act to conduct value \n                engineering studies, and procedures and requirements \n                for documenting and maintaining records of the \n                justification for each such waiver.\n            (3) Provide training (including practical experience) in \n        established value engineering methodology to agency staff \n        responsible for coordinating and monitoring value engineering \n        efforts and to staff responsible for developing, reviewing, \n        analyzing, carrying out, changing, and evaluating value \n        engineering proposals.\n            (4) Ensure that funds necessary for conducting agency value \n        engineering efforts are included in annual budget requests to \n        the Office of Management and Budget.\n            (5) Document and maintain records of--\n                    (A) programs, projects, systems, and products that \n                meet agency criteria for requiring the use of value \n                engineering techniques; and\n                    (B) determinations (including the reasons therefor) \n                that the recommendations resulting from a value \n                engineering review should not be implemented.\n            (6) Except when inconsistent with this Act, adhere to the \n        acquisition requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, \n        including the use of value engineering clauses in parts 48 and \n        52 for both prime and subcontractors.\n            (7) In the case of discretionary grants awarded by the \n        agency, establish value engineering requirements, such as \n        requiring grant applications to include a clause requiring the \n        use of value engineering methodology by qualified value \n        engineering personnel in the performance of the grant.\n            (8) Develop annual plans for using value engineering in the \n        agency, which, at a minimum, identify--\n                    (A) the agency and contractor projects, programs, \n                systems, and products to which value engineering \n                techniques will be applied in the next fiscal year; and\n                    (B) the estimated costs of such projects, programs, \n                systems, and products.\n            (9) Report annually to the Office of Management and Budget \n        on value engineering activities in accordance with subsection \n        (c).\n    (c) Reports to Office of Management and Budget.--\n            (1) In general.--The head of each Federal agency shall \n        submit to the Office of Management and Budget an annual report \n        on the results of using value engineering in the agency.
