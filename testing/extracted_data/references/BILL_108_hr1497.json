REAUTHORIZATION OF TITLE I OF SIKES ACT.\n\n    Section 108 of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670f) is amended by \nstriking ``fiscal years 1998 through 2003'' each place it appears and \ninserting ``fiscal years 2004 through 2008''.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of Defense maintains over 25,000,000 \n        acres of valuable fish and wildlife habitat on approximately \n        400 military installations nationwide.\n            (2) These lands contain a wealth of plant and animal life, \n        vital wetlands for migratory birds, and nearly 300 federally \n        listed threatened species and endangered species.\n            (3) Increasingly, land surrounding military bases are being \n        developed with residential and commercial infrastructure that \n        fragments fish and wildlife habitat and decreases its ability \n        to support a diversity of species.\n            (4) Comprehensive conservation plans, such as integrated \n        natural resource management plans under the Sikes Act (16 \n        U.S.C. 670 et seq.), can ensure that these ecosystem values can \n        be protected and enhanced while allowing these lands to meet \n        the needs of military operations.\n            (5) Section 107 of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670e-2) \n        requires sufficient numbers of professionally trained natural \n        resources management personnel and natural resources law \n        enforcement personnel to be available and assigned \n        responsibility to perform tasks necessary to carry out title I \n        of the Sikes Act, including the preparation and implementation \n        of integrated natural resource management plans.\n            (6) Managerial and policymaking functions performed by \n        Department of Defense on-site professionally trained natural \n        resource management personnel on military installations are \n        appropriate governmental functions.\n            (7) Professionally trained civilian biologists in permanent \n        Federal Government career managerial positions are essential to \n        oversee fish and wildlife and natural resource conservation \n        programs are essential to the conservation of wildlife species \n        on military land.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nSecretary of Defense should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure \nthat section 107 of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670e-2) is fully \nimplemented consistent with the findings made in subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4.
