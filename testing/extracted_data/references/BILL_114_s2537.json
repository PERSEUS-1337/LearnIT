FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Mission \n        office, representing the PLO, and by extension, the Palestinian \n        Authority, in Washington, DC, was opened in 1994 in order to \n        implement the Oslo Accords, which initiated direct negotiations \n        between the PLO and the Government of Israel.\n            (2) Section 1003 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 (Public \n        Law 100-204; 22 U.S.C. 5202), makes it unlawful to ``establish \n        or maintain an office, headquarters, premises, or other \n        facilities or establishments within the jurisdiction of the \n        United States at the behest or direction of, or with funds \n        provided by the Palestine Liberation Organization or any of its \n        constituent groups, any successor to any of those, or any \n        agents thereof''.\n            (3) Using various authorities, the Executive branch has \n        waived the provisions of section 1003 of the Anti-Terrorism Act \n        of 1987.\n            (4) Article XXXI, clause 7, of the Israeli-Palestinian \n        Interim Agreement on the Status of the West Bank and the Gaza \n        Strip (September 28, 1995) states that ``Neither side shall \n        initiate or take any step that will change the status of the \n        West Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the \n        permanent status negotiations''.\n            (5) In January 2009, the PLO sent a declaration to the \n        International Criminal Court under Article 12(3) of the Rome \n        Statute of the International Criminal Court on behalf of the \n        Palestinian Authority.\n            (6) On October 31, 2011, the United Nations Educational, \n        Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) voted to admit \n        the ``State of Palestine'' as its 195th full member. Since \n        being admitted, the Palestinians have used UNESCO to pass anti-\n        Israel rulings, including a recent proposal to have the Western \n        Wall classified as part of the Aqsa compound.\n            (7) On November 29, 2012, the United Nations General \n        Assembly voted to accord the ``State of Palestine'' status as a \n        nonmember observer state at the United Nations.\n            (8) On April 2, 2014, the PLO joined the Geneva Conventions \n        as well as 13 other organizations.\n            (9) On January 2, 2015, the PLO acceded to the Rome \n        Statute, and on January 16, 2015, the Prosecutor of the \n        International Criminal Court opened a ``preliminary examination \n        of the situation in Palestine'' after accepting jurisdiction of \n        the International Criminal Court ``over alleged crimes \n        committed in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East \n        Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014''.\n            (10) The PLO's decision to accede to the Rome Statute as \n        well as several international organizations is an attempt to \n        change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip outside \n        of direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n            (11) On January 7, 2015, the Department of State's Office \n        of the Spokesperson stated, ``we have made clear our opposition \n        to Palestinian action in seeking to join the Rome Statute of \n        the International Criminal Court. This step is counter-\n        productive, will damage the atmosphere with the very people \n        with whom Palestinians ultimately need to make peace, and will \n        do nothing to further the aspirations of the Palestinian people \n        for a sovereign and independent state.''.\n            (12) On February 23, 2015, a jury in a New York Federal \n        court found the PLO and the Palestinian Authority liable for \n        six terrorist attacks in Israel between 2002 and 2004 that \n        killed 33 people and injured more than 450 others, including \n        United States citizens among the victims.\n            (13) The Federal jury ordered the PLO and the Palestinian \n        Authority, both of which are headed by Mahmoud Abbas, to pay \n        $218,500,000 in reparations to the victims and their families \n        of these terror acts.\n            (14) On April 1, 2015, the ``State of Palestine'' \n        officially became a member of the International Criminal Court.\n            (15) The PLO continues to reward terrorists and their \n        families who commit terrorist attacks, providing a higher \n        reward to those with longer jail sentences.\n            (16) The PLO continues to refuse to disclose all of its \n        financial assets, including the multibillion-dollar Palestinian \n        National Fund (PNF) belonging to Mahmoud Abbas. The Fund is \n        estimated to have tens of billions of dollars, though its exact \n        amount is unknown. It is allegedly used by Abbas to fund \n        everything from his international campaign against Israel to \n        compensation to the families of Palestinian terrorists.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has failed \n        to live up to its commitment to a bilateral peace process with \n        Israel, renounce violence, accept Israel's right to exist, \n        honor previous diplomatic agreements made by the Palestinians, \n        and continues to circumvent a negotiated settlement with Israel \n        by seeking unilateral statehood at the United Nations and from \n        other countries, and continues to actively endorse terror;\n            (2) Mahmoud Abbas has purposefully blurred the lines \n        between the PLO and the Palestinian Authority in order to avoid \n        responsibility for violating previous agreements with Israel \n        while continuing to receive United States aid;\n            (3) the Palestinian initiation of an International Criminal \n        Court investigation, or active support for such an \n        investigation, that subjects Israeli nationals to an \n        investigation for alleged crimes against Palestinians, would \n        violate the Palestinians' commitment to not change the status \n        of the West Bank and Gaza Strip;\n            (4) only a solution negotiated directly between the \n        Israelis and Palestinians can result in a lasting peace, and \n        the Palestinians should not turn to outside parties, including \n        international organizations, to impose or otherwise influence a \n        solution between the parties;\n            (5) if the Palestinian Authority or any representation \n        thereof initiates or supports an investigation at the \n        International Criminal Court, the Secretary of State should \n        close the Palestine Liberation Organization Mission office in \n        the United States; and\n            (6) it is in the national security interests of the United \n        States to remove the PLO office from Washington, DC.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS REGARDING THE PLO UNDER THE ANTI-TERRORISM ACT OF \n              1987.\n\n    Section 1003 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5202) is \namended--\n            (1) by striking ``It shall be unlawful'' and inserting \n        ``(a) In General.--It shall be unlawful''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Waiver.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nincluding section 604 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, \nFiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228), the President may waive for a \nperiod of not more than 6 months the provisions of subsection (a) if \nthe President determines and certifies in writing to Congress, no less \nthan 45 days before the waiver is to take effect, that--\n            ``(1)(A) the Palestinians have not, on or after April 1, \n        2015, obtained in the United Nations or any specialized agency \n        thereof the same standing as member states or full membership \n        as a state outside an agreement negotiated between Israel and \n        the Palestinians;\n            ``(B) the Palestinians have officially ceased to be members \n        of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and have withdrawn \n        from the Rome Statute;\n            ``(C) any preliminary examination or ongoing investigation \n        against Israel, the Government of Israel, the Israeli Armed or \n        Security Forces, or any Israeli national initiated by, or on \n        behalf of, the Palestinians, or referred to the ICC by a state \n        party, the United Nations Security Council, or a Pre-Trial \n        Chamber has been withdrawn and terminated;\n            ``(D) the PLO and the Palestinian Authority no longer \n        provide any financial award, payment, or salary to Palestinian \n        terrorists imprisoned in Israel who have committed terrorist \n        attacks, or their families; and\n            ``(E) the PLO and the Palestinian Authority no longer \n        engage in a pattern of incitement against the United States or \n        Israel; or\n            ``(2) the Palestinians have entered into a final negotiated \n        peace agreement with, and have ceased all hostilities against, \n        Israel.\n    ``(c) Definition.--In subsection (b)(1)(E), the term `incitement' \nmeans--\n            ``(1) statements, media, communication, or other activities \n        against any religion, ethnicity, or nationality;\n            ``(2) advocacy, endorsement, or glorification of violence, \n        martyrdom, or terrorism; or\n            ``(3) endorsement, glorification, honor, or other \n        memorialization of any person or group that has advocated, \n        sponsored, or committed acts of terrorism, including the naming \n        after or dedication to such person or group of any school, \n        community center, camp, stadium, public square, street, land, \n        landmark, waterway, or other facility.''."
