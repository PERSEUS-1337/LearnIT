    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Cancer and Environmental \nResearch Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n        deaths among American women.\n            (2) More women in the United States are living with breast \n        cancer than any other cancer (excluding skin cancer). \n        Approximately 3,000,000 women in the United States are living \n        with breast cancer, 2,000,000 of which have been diagnosed and \n        an estimated 1,000,000 who do not yet know that they have the \n        disease.\n            (3) Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer \n        among women in the United States and worldwide (excluding skin \n        cancer). In 2001, it is estimated that 233,000 new cases of \n        breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United \n        States, 192,000 cases of which will involve invasive breast \n        cancer and 40,800 cases of which will involve ductal carcinoma \n        in situ (DCIS).\n            (4) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n        death for women in the United States. Approximately 40,000 \n        women in the United States die from the disease each year. \n        Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women in \n        the United States between the ages of 20 and 59, and the \n        leading cause of cancer death for women worldwide.\n            (5) A woman in the United States has a 1 in 8 chance of \n        developing invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. This risk \n        was 1 in 11 in 1975. In 2001, a new case of breast cancer will \n        be diagnosed every 2 minutes and a woman will die from breast \n        cancer every 13 minutes.\n            (6) All women are at risk for breast cancer. About 90 \n        percent of women who develop breast cancer do not have a family \n        history of the disease.\n            (7) The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer, a public \n        private partnership, has recognized the importance of expanding \n        the scope and breadth of biomedical, epidemiological, and \n        behavioral research activities related to the etiology of \n        breast cancer and the role of the environment.\n            (8) To date, there has been only a limited research \n        investment to expand the scope or coordinate efforts across \n        disciplines or work with the community to study the role of the \n        environment in the development of breast cancer.\n            (9) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous \n        potential for avenues of prevention, the Federal investment in \n        the role of the environment and the development of breast \n        cancer should be expanded.\n            (10) In order to understand the effect of chemicals and \n        radiation on the development of cancer, multi-generational, \n        prospective studies are probably required.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES; AWARDS FOR \n              DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF RESEARCH CENTERS REGARDING \n              ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS RELATED TO BREAST CANCER.\n\n    Subpart 12 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 285l et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 463B.
