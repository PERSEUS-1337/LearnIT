PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide rural school students in the \nUnited States with increased learning opportunities.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) While there are rural education initiatives identified \n        at the State and local level, no Federal education policy \n        focuses on the specific needs of rural school districts and \n        schools, especially those that serve poor students.\n            (2) Under Federal law, there is no consistent definition \n        for rural schools, rural school districts, or rural local \n        educational agencies.\n            (3) The National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) \n        reports that 46 percent of our Nation's public schools serve \n        rural areas.\n            (4) A critical problem for rural school districts involves \n        the hiring and retention of qualified administrators and \n        certified teachers (especially in science and mathematics). \n        Consequently, teachers in rural schools are almost twice as \n        likely to provide instruction in 3 or more subjects than \n        teachers in urban schools. Rural schools also face other tough \n        challenges, such as shrinking local tax bases, high \n        transportation costs, aging buildings, limited course \n        offerings, and limited resources.\n            (5) Data from the National Assessment of Educational \n        Progress (NAEP) consistently show large gaps between the \n        achievement of students in high-poverty schools and those in \n        other schools. High-poverty schools will face special \n        challenges in preparing their students to reach high standards \n        of performance on State and national assessments.\n\nSEC. 4.
