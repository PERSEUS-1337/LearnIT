FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) Protection of the environmental and ecological \n        qualities of Federal lands are important concerns for all \n        people.\n            (2) Reviewing the environmental impact of proposed \n        transmission facilities is a vital task which must be conducted \n        in a thorough and comprehensive manner.\n            (3) A thorough and comprehensive review of these effects \n        can be conducted in a timely manner without sacrificing the \n        quality of the review.\n            (4) There is currently no requirement that Federal agencies \n        complete environmental reviews for proposed transmission \n        facilities in a timely manner.\n            (5) The length of time for completion of these reviews \n        varies widely, with agencies taking as long as ten years to \n        complete these reviews.\n            (6) There are cases of Federal agencies conducting \n        environmental reviews in a subsequent, rather than concurrent, \n        manner and failing to coordinate their reviews with State \n        authorities and other Federal agencies.\n            (7) The electricity transmission grid must be expanded to \n        ensure reliable supplies of electricity.\n            (8) The Federal Government currently owns approximately 29 \n        percent of the land area of the United States including 90 \n        percent of Nevada, 70 percent of Arizona, and similarly large \n        percentages of other Western States.\n            (9) Because of the large Federal land holdings in the West, \n        transmission facilities must often be built on Federal lands.\n            (10) Appointment of a lead agency to coordinate the \n        environmental reviews of Federal agencies will lead to more \n        thorough, comprehensive and timely reviews.\n\nSEC. 2. CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.\n\n    The Constitutional authority on which this act rests are the powers \nof Congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the \nterritory or other property belonging to the United States as \nenumerated in article IV, section 3 and to make all laws which shall be \nnecessary and proper as enumerated in article I, section 8 of the \nUnited States Constitution.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL AND STATE COORDINATION OF PERMITTING FOR TRANSMISSION \n              FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) Lead Agency.--If an applicant, or prospective applicant, for \nFederal authorization related to an electricity transmission or \ndistribution facility so requests, the Department of Energy (DOE) shall \nact as the lead agency for purposes of coordinating all applicable \nFederal authorization and related environmental review of the facility. \nThe term ``Federal authorization'' shall mean any authorization \nrequired under Federal law in order to site a transmission or \ndistribution facility, including but not limited to such permits, \nspecial use authorizations, certifications, opinions, or other \napprovals as may be required, whether issued by a Federal or a State \nagency. To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary of Energy \nshall coordinate this Federal authorization and review process with any \nIndian tribes, multi-State entities, and State agencies that are \nresponsible for conducting any separate permitting and environmental \nreviews of the facility, to ensure timely and efficient review and \npermit decisions.\n    (b) Authority to Set Deadlines.--As lead agency, the Department of \nEnergy, in consultation with other Federal and, as appropriate, with \nIndian tribes, multi-State entities, and State agencies that are \nwilling to coordinate their own separate permitting and environmental \nreviews with the Federal authorization and environmental reviews, shall \nestablish prompt and binding intermediate milestones and ultimate \ndeadlines for the review of and Federal authorization decisions \nrelating to the proposed facility. Notwithstanding any other provision \nof law, the Secretary of Energy shall ensure that once an application \nhas been submitted with such data as the Secretary deems necessary, all \npermit decisions and related environmental reviews under all applicable \nFederal laws shall be completed within 1 year. The Secretary of Energy \nalso shall provide a speedy pre-application mechanism for prospective \napplicants to confer with the agencies involved to have each such \nagency determine and communicate to the prospective applicant within 60 \ndays of when the prospective applicant submits a request for such \ninformation concerning--\n            (1) the likelihood of approval for a potential facility; \n        and\n            (2) key issues of concern to the agencies and public.\n    (c) Consolidated Environmental Review and Record of Decision.--The \nSecretary of Energy shall prepare a single environmental review \ndocument, which shall be used as the basis for all decisions on the \nproposed project under Federal law. The document may be an \nenvironmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act if warranted, or such other form of \nanalysis as may be warranted. DOE and other agencies shall streamline \nthe review and permitting of transmission and distribution facilities \nwithin corridors designated under section 503 of the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. section 1763) by fully taking into \naccount prior analyses and decisions as to the corridors.\n    (d) Appeals.--In the event that any agency has denied a Federal \nauthorization required for a transmission or distribution facility, or \nhas failed to act by the deadline established by the Secretary pursuant \nto this section for deciding whether to issue the authorization, the \napplicant or any State in which the facility would be located may file \nan appeal with the Secretary of Energy, which shall review the denial \nor take action on the pending application. Based on the overall record \nand in consultation with the affected agency, the Secretary may then \neither issue the necessary authorization with or without appropriate \nconditions, or may deny the application. The Secretary shall issue its \ndecision within 90 days of the filing of the appeal.\n    (e) Conforming Regulations and Memoranda of Agreement.--Not later \nthan 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, the \nSecretary of Energy shall issue any regulations necessary to implement \nthe foregoing provisions. Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this section, the Secretary and the heads of all relevant \nFederal departments and non-departmental agencies shall, and interested \nIndian tribes, multi-State entities, and State agencies may, enter into \nMemoranda of Agreement to ensure the timely and coordinated review and \npermitting of electricity transmission and distribution facilities. The \nhead of each Federal department or non-departmental agency with \napproval authority shall designate a senior responsible official and \ndedicate sufficient other staff and resources to ensure that the DOE \nregulations and any Memoranda are fully implemented.\n    (f) Miscellaneous.--Each Federal authorization for an electricity \ntransmission or distribution facility shall be issued for a duration, \nas determined by the Secretary of Energy, commensurate with the \nanticipated use of the facility and with appropriate authority to \nmanage the right-of-way for reliability and environmental protection. \nFurther, when such authorizations expire, they shall be reviewed for \nrenewal taking fully into account reliance on such electricity \ninfrastructure, recognizing its importance for public health, safety \nand economic welfare and as a legitimate use of Federal lands.\n    (g) Maintaining and Enhancing the Transmission Infrastructure.--In \nexercising the responsibilities under this section, the Secretary of \nEnergy shall consult regularly with the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) and FERC-approved Regional Transmission Organizations \nand Independent System Operators on changes to the national grid that \nwill improve reliability, relieve congestion, and enhance the \ncapability of the grid to deliver electricity."
