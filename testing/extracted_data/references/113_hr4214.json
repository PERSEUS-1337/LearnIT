FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress established the unique status of Native \n        American languages and distinctive policies supporting their \n        use as a medium of education in the Native American Languages \n        Act (Public Law 101-477).\n            (2) Reports from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal, \n        public, charter, and private schools and colleges that use \n        primarily Native American languages to deliver education, have \n        indicated that students from these schools have generally had \n        high school graduation and college attendance rates above the \n        norm for their peers.\n            (3) The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \n        U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) includes policy barriers to schools taught \n        through Native American languages and a lack of adequate \n        funding to support such opportunities.\n            (4) There is a critical need that requires immediate action \n        to support education through Native American languages to \n        preserve these languages.\n\nSEC. 3.
