PUBLIC SCHOOL REPAIR AND RENOVATION.\n\n    Title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \nU.S.C. 8501 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:\n\n            ``TITLE XII--PUBLIC SCHOOL REPAIR AND RENOVATION\n\n``SEC. 12001. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds as follows:\n            ``(1) The General Accounting Office estimated in 1995 that \n        it would cost $112,000,000,000 to bring our Nation's school \n        facilities into good overall condition.\n            ``(2) The General Accounting Office also found in 1995 that \n        60 percent of the Nation's schools, serving 28,000,000 \n        students, reported that 1 or more building features, such as \n        roofs and plumbing, needed to be extensively repaired, \n        overhauled, or replaced.\n            ``(3) The National Center for Education Statistics reported \n        that the average age for a school building in 1998 was 42 years \n        and that local educational agencies with relatively high rates \n        of poverty tend to have relatively old buildings.\n            ``(4) School condition is positively correlated with \n        student achievement, according to a number of research studies.\n            ``(5) The results of a recent survey indicate that the \n        condition of schools with large proportions of students living \n        on Indian lands is particularly poor.\n            ``(6) While school repair and renovation are primarily a \n        State and local concern, some States and communities are not, \n        on their own, able to meet the burden of providing adequate \n        school facilities for all students, and the poorest communities \n        have had the greatest difficulty meeting this need. It is, \n        therefore, appropriate for the Federal Government to provide \n        assistance to high-need communities for school repair and \n        renovation.\n\n``SEC. 12002. PURPOSE.\n\n    ``The purpose of this title is to assist high-need local \neducational agencies in making urgent repairs and renovations to public \nschool facilities in order to--\n            ``(1) reduce health and safety problems, including \n        violations of local or State fire codes, faced by students; and\n            ``(2) improve the ability of students to learn in their \n        school environment.\n\n``SEC. 12003. AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--A recipient of a grant or loan under this title \nshall use the grant or loan funds to carry out the purpose of this \ntitle by--\n            ``(1) repairing or replacing roofs, electrical wiring or \n        plumbing systems;\n            ``(2) repairing, replacing, or installing heating, \n        ventilation, or air conditioning systems;\n            ``(3) ensuring that repairs and renovations under this \n        title comply with the requirements of section 504 of the \n        Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities \n        Act of 1990 relating to the accessibility of public school \n        programs to individuals with disabilities; and\n            ``(4) making other types of school repairs and renovations \n        that the Secretary may reasonably determine are urgently \n        needed, particularly projects to correct facilities problems \n        that endanger the health and safety of students and staff such \n        as violations of State or local fire codes.\n    ``(b) Limitation.--The Secretary shall not approve an application \nfor a grant or loan under this title unless the applicant demonstrates \nto the Secretary's satisfaction that the applicant lacks sufficient \nfunds, from other sources, to carry out the repairs or renovations for \nwhich the applicant is requesting assistance.\n\n``SEC. 12004.
