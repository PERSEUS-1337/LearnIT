FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Most parents work and have limited time to volunteer at \n        the schools their children attend.\n            (2) A parent's first responsibility is to the health, \n        safety, and stability of their children.\n            (3) Nearly one-third of children in the United States ages \n        12 to 17 have used illicit drugs.\n            (4) According to the American Lung Association, \n        approximately 4,000 children between the ages of 12 and 17 will \n        smoke their first cigarette, and adolescents who reported \n        smoking cigarettes in the last 30 days were more likely to use \n        alcohol, smoke marijuana, and use cocaine during the same \n        period.\n            (5) Accidents, homicides, and suicides are the leading \n        causes of adolescent deaths. Most of these deaths are connected \n        to alcohol and drug use.\n            (6) The Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that \n        early action from friends, parents, or loved-ones of a teen who \n        has started using drugs could help the teen stop before \n        treatment may be needed.\n            (7) In response to concerns about youth violence and drug, \n        tobacco, and alcohol use by youth, the White House unveiled the \n        Parents Corps, a 3 year initiative operating in 9 States to \n        bring together citizenship, service, and responsibility to \n        empower parents to keep their children, schools, and \n        communities drug-free.\n\nSEC. 3.
