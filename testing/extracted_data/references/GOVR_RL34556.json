    "content": "Congressional hearings and press coverage critical of the medical care received by noncitizens in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have increased congressional interest in the subject, including the introduction of legislation related to detainee health care. An overarching debate on this issue concerns the appropriate standard of health care that should be provided to foreign nationals in immigration detention. The medical care required to be provided to detainees is outlined in ICE's National Detention Standards, and the Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS), which is detailed from the U.S. Public Health Service to ICE is ultimately responsible for the health care of noncitizens detained by ICE. However, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center has reported that problems with access to medical care is one of the chief complaints of aliens in detention. Similarly, the National Immigrant Justice Center states that complaints about access to medical care are a constant theme in conversations with detained aliens. In addition, the U.S. government recently admitted negligence in the death of Francisco Castaneda, a former ICE detainee. Thus, although standards exist, one of the questions raised is are the standards being followed? This report begins with an overview of noncitizen detention and then examines the procedures and policies related to the provision of health care to detainees. The report concludes with a discussion of the issues surrounding detainee health care. The report does not investigate the veracity of claims of substandard medical care made in the press or ICE's rebuttals. The law provides broad authority to detain aliens while awaiting a determination of whether they should be removed from the United States, and mandates that certain categories of aliens are subject to mandatory detention (i.e., the aliens must be detained) by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Aliens not subjected to mandatory detention can be paroled, released on bond, or continue to be detained. Any alien can be detained while DHS determines whether the alien should be removed from the United States. Although some detainees are criminal aliens, others are asylum seekers who have not committed a crime, and others are aliens who are present without status (illegal aliens) who, while in violation of their immigration status and immigration law, have not committed a criminal offense. In addition, some of the criminal alien detainees are legal permanent residents who have resided in the United States for many years. Other detained aliens include those who arrive at a port-of-entry without proper documentation (e.g., fraudulent or invalid visas, or no documentation), but most of these aliens are quickly returned to their country of origin through a process known as expedited removal . The majority of aliens arriving without proper documentation who claim asylum are held until their \"credible fear hearing\" and then released; however, some asylum seekers are held until their asylum claims have been adjudicated. Although noncitizens in immigration detention are in the custody of ICE, only a minority are detained at facilities owned or fully contracted by ICE. In October 2007, 65% of noncitizen detainees were detained at state and local prisons, 19% at contract facilities, 14% at Service Processing Centers (SPCs) owned and operated by ICE, and 2% at Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities. Notably, all facilities housing immigration detainees must comply with ICE's National Detention Standards (discussed below). On an average day, up to 33,000 immigration detainees are in ICE's custody in more than 300 facilities nationwide. The average stay is 37.5 days. For FY2008, as of December 31, 2007, the average daily detained population was 31,244. In FY2008, approximately 311,000 aliens were detained by ICE. As of April 30, 2007, ICE reported that, cumulatively, 25% of all detained aliens were removed within four days, and 90% within 85 days. Nonetheless, in FY2006, more than 7,000 aliens were in detention longer than six months. For FY2006, approximately 48% of the aliens in detention were criminal aliens. (For a more detailed discussion of the detention population, see Appendix A .) Currently, ICE contracts with Creative Corrections, L.L.C., to perform the annual inspections of detention facilities. ICE also contracts with another company, the Nakamoto Group Inc., to serve as on-site, full-time quality assurance inspectors at the 40 largest detention facilities. The Detention Facilities Inspection Group (DFIG) within the ICE's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) is primarily responsible for oversight of detention facilities. The DFIG, which began in February 2007, provides oversight and independent validation of the annual detention facility inspection program (done by Creative Corrections). DFIG also conducts investigations of serious incidents involving detainees. Lastly, DRO's Detention Standards Compliance Unit is tasked with ensuring that facilities that detain aliens comply with ICE's National Detention Standards. The press has reported that a DHS Inspector General's 2008 draft report finds that previous oversight has not been effective in identifying serious problems at the facilities. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) is responsible for ensuring safe and humane conditions of confinement for detained aliens in federal custody, including the provision of reliable, consistent, appropriate and cost-effective health services. \u2014Immigration and Customs Enforcement In 2000, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) created National Detention Standards for aliens in detention, which are published in the Detention Operations Manual. In late 2008, ICE\u2014reportedly with input from detention experts, non-governmental organizations, and DHS' Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office\u2014published new Detention Standards in a performance-based format. The standards specify the detention conditions appropriate for immigration detainees. In most cases, the standards mirror American Correctional Association (ACA) standards, though some of ICE's Detention Standards provide more specificity or are unique to the needs of alien detainees. The Detention Standards, however, do not have the force of law, thus detainees do not have legal recourse for violations of the standards. The Detention Operations Manual contains a section on health services, which addresses standards for medical care; hunger strikes; suicide prevention and intervention; and terminal illness, advanced directives, and death. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Immigration Law Center have complained about the standards. They note that ICE lacks written guidelines for how to rate a facility's adherence to the Detention Standards, and that ICE notifies the facilities 30-days before their annual reviews, giving facilities opportunities to prepare for the reviews. In addition, they note that annual reviews do not require detainee interviews and are only observational reviews of the facilities and files. In 2007, the Assistant Secretary of ICE directed that ICE's Office of Detention and Removal (DRO) report semiannually on agency-wide adherence with the National Detention Standards. The semiannual reports explain the standards used to rate the detention facilities. The first report under this directive was issued in May 2008. According to ICE's Detention Operations Manual the Detention Standards ensure, \"that detainees have access to emergent, urgent or non-emergent medical, dental, and mental health care that are within the scope of services provided by the DIHS, so that their health care needs are met in a timely and efficient manner.\" According to the Detention Operations Manual, every facility has to provide detainees with initial medical screening, primary medical care, and emergency care. The ICE Officer in Charge (OIC) must arrange for specialized health care, mental heath care, and hospitalization within the local community. All facilities are required to employ a medical staff large enough to provide basic exams and treatments to all detainees. Medical care at facilities ranges from small clinics with contract staff to facilities with on-site medical staff and diagnostic equipment. The facilities are required to have a mechanism (normally paper request slips) that allows detainees to request health care services provided by a physician or other qualified medical officer in a clinical setting. The facilities are required to have regularly scheduled times, known as sick call , when medical personnel are available to see detainees who have requested medical services. All detainees, without exception, have access to sick call, and the facilities have to have procedures in place that ensure that all sick call requests are received and triaged by medial personnel within 48 hours after the detainee submits the request. ICE detainee policy requires that all detainees receive an initial health screening immediately upon arrival at the detention facility to determine the appropriate necessary medical, mental health, and dental treatment. In addition to the initial screening, ICE policy also requires that detainees receive a health appraisal and physical examination within 14 days of arrival to identify medical conditions that require monitoring or treatment. In addition, all detainees are supposed to receive a mental health screening within 12 hours of admission. Detainees also receive a mental status evaluation during their physical examination, which is required to take place within 14 days of admission. According to ICE, a detainee with a medical condition will be scheduled for as many follow-up appointments as necessary. In addition, detainees have access to sick call (i.e., the opportunity to request non-emergeny health care provided by a health service provider during scheduled times at the detention facility). In addition, the manual states that an initial dental screening exam should be performed within 14 days of the detainee's arrival, and if an on-site dentist is not available, the initial dental screening may be performed by a physician, physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner. All detainees are afforded authorized emergency dental treatment. Aliens detained for more than six months are eligible for routine dental treatment. Detainees' dental care, reportedly, is often limited to extractions, and care for painful dental conditions is often delayed or denied. Dentures are not provided, nor are eyeglasses, unless the glasses were broken while the alien was in detention. In addition, detainees may not use their own money to get medical or dental care. Under the Medical Standards, detainees also have access to medication from an on-site pharmacy or a pharmacy in the community. Detainees may get medicine from their family members, provided that the medicine can be verified as appropriate for the detainee to take and is not contraband. There have been reports, however, of detainees having problems getting medications even when their families have been willing to provide them. The Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS), which is indefinitely detailed from the U.S. Public Health Service to ICE, is ultimately responsible for the provision of health care to noncitizens detained by ICE. At 15 of over 300 detention facilities, DIHS provides on-site health care, while in the others, mostly for detainees in local prisons and jails, health care is provided by contract workers who are not affiliated with DIHS. The amount of care available on-site at detention facilities is variable. Some facilities have full-time, on-site medical staff, while other facilities make use of local providers. Notably, DIHS is responsible for the approval of any off-site medical care, regardless of where the alien is detained. Some immigration advocates maintain that since the Detention Standards do not have the force or law or regulation, DIHS policy exercises the largest influence over the provision of medical care to detainees. Although the medical care that is supposed to be received is detailed in the Detention Standards Manual, one stated concern is that the procedures and standards are not followed. Another concern focuses on the covered benefits package (discussed below) and whether that and the Detention Standards allow for the provision of adequate services to the detained populations. DIHS is a stand-alone medical unit consisting of U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) Officers and contract medical professionals who work under DIHS supervision. DIHS serves as the medical authority for ICE. Prior to October 1, 2007, ICE received the medical services of DIHS through the Department of Health and Human Services's (HHS's) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). In other words, HRSA oversaw DIHS, including the U.S. Public Health Service Officers assigned to DIHS. According to DHS, ICE was interested in greater administrative control over DIHS for a variety of reasons, including HRSA's inability to fill DIHS vacancies in a timely manner and unwillingness to provide Public Health Service (PHS) Officers to support ICE law enforcement missions. In October 2007, DIHS was detailed indefinitely to ICE. The detail of the PHS Officers in DIHS was accomplished via a memorandum of agreement (MOA), which also covers the assignment of PHS resources elsewhere within DHS. Since the detail became effective, ICE has provided both administrative support to DIHS and oversight of the administration of DIHS. Under the MOA, DHS is responsible for the day-to-day conduct of PHS Officers under its detail and assumes liability for their negligence or malpractice. Lawyers in the DHS Office of Health Affairs (OHA) handle such claims. In addition, beginning on October 1, 2007, ICE has stated that it has been collaboratively working with OHA on a variety of improvement initiatives, including selecting a new Director for DIHS at the appropriate rank; implementing aggressive hiring strategies to address staffing needs; identifying and implementing a new electronic medical records system; and reviewing (or changing, if necessary) the process by which Treatment Authorization Requests (TARS) are approved. ICE is also working with OHA to develop an enhanced process for TAR appeals. ICE has established a covered benefits package that delineates the health care services available to detainees in ICE custody, in addition to the minimum scope of services provided by the detention facilities. This package, known as the DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package (CSP), primarily provides health care services for emergency care, which is defined as \"a condition that is threatening to life, limb, hearing or sight,\" rather than elective or non-emergency conditions. The CSP states that: [accidental] or traumatic injuries incurred while in the custody of ICE or BP [Border Patrol] and acute illnesses will be reviewed for appropriate care. Other medical conditions which the physician believes, if left untreated during the period of ICE/BP custody, would cause deterioration of the detainee's health or uncontrolled suffering affecting his/her deportation status will be assessed and evaluated for care.... Elective, non-emergent care requires prior authorization.... Requests for pre-existing, non-life threatening conditions, will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Detainees who require non-emergency medical care beyond that which can be provided at the detention facilities must get preauthorization. They submit a Treatment Authorization Request (TAR), which is evaluated by the DIHS Managed Care Program. The TAR must be approved before the detainee may receive care. According to ICE, more than 40,000 TARs are submitted each year; the average turn-around time is 1.4 days, and 90% are approved. Nonetheless, some detainees have described waiting weeks or months to get basic care. In addition, reportedly, detainees have been told that biopsies were \"elective surgery\" and, as such, have had trouble getting the diagnostic test. According to a 2007 GAO report, officials at several detention facilities reported difficulties obtaining approval for outside medical and mental health care. TAR reviews for care are conducted by DIHS nurses in Washington, DC, who review the paperwork submitted by physicians. These nurses are known as Managed Care Coordinators (MCCs). The nurses are on duty Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m to 4 p.m. Regardless of where the alien is held, approval from DIHS is required for diagnostic testing, speciality care, or surgery. However, when an ICE detainee is hospitalized, the hospital assumes medical decision-making authority, including the patient's drug regimen, lab tests, X-rays, and treatments. Off-site medical care for people in the custody of the U.S. Marshals service is handled in a similar manner. According to ICE, DIHS has a formal appeals process that is similar to industry standards and comparable to that of the Bureau of Prisons for declined Treatment Authorization Requests (TARs). Facilities and individual detainees have the right to appeal denial determinations. TARs denied for lack of medical necessity may be resubmitted for reconsideration to the Managed Care Coordinator (MCC) (i.e., the DIHS nurses in Washington DC). If a TAR is denied for lack of timely submission, the medical records are forwarded to the Managed Care Coordinator (MCC) Branch Chief for review. According to DIHS Standard Operating Procedure, the Managed Care Review Committee (MCRC) conducts a second level review for all appeals which are upheld by the MCC. The MCRC is comprised of the DIHS Medical Director, appropriate medical, dental, or mental health consultants, and MCC(s). Decisions of the MCRC are made in writing within three working days of the appeal. ICE, DIHS, and OHA are working to develop a more independent appeal body outside of DIHS and ICE. The preauthorization (also called pre-certification of medical necessity) requirement is similar to those of many managed care/health insurers. Nonetheless, some contend that this procedure can prevent detainees from getting the necessary care, and note that off-site nurses have the ability to deny care that was requested by on-site medical personnel. Reportedly, the DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package (CSP) has been amended several times since 2005, to limit the scope of medical care for detainees. A repeating theme in press reports and congressional testimony concerned difficulties getting biopsies when there is a concern about cancer. The ACLU is involved in a class action suit regarding inadequate medical care for immigration detainees at the San Diego Correctional Facility, and contends that there are serious deficiencies in the CSP which should be fixed to ensure that detainees receive adequate medical care consistent with the ICE Detention Standards on Medical Care. The CSP primarily provides health care services for emergencies only. According to the ACLU, as recently as August 2005, the CSP did not extend to pre-existing conditions. In his testimony, Tom Jawetz of the ACLU argued that there is a disconnect between ICE's Detention Standards and the CSP. In addition, he contends that \"the standard is inconsistent with established principles of constitutional law and basic notions of decency.\" Representative Zoe Lofgren also stated in a question to ICE at the October 2007 hearing that there seems to be an inconsistency between the CSP and the Detention Standards because the CSP states that medical conditions will be evaluated for treatment based on the criteria that, \"if left untreated during the period of ICE/BP custody [the medical condition] would cause deterioration of the detainee's health or uncontrolled suffering affecting his/her deportation status [emphasis added],\" (i.e., the detainees health issues would have to jeopardize the ability of ICE to remove the alien before treatment would be rendered.) ICE responded that it disagrees that the Detention Standards and CSP are inconsistent. ICE contends that all detainees receive medical treatment when DIHS determines that care is required, \"regardless of whether the alien is about to be deported or not.\" There have been reports of problems with detainees being transferred without their medical records. ICE does not have a system to track the transfer of medication and medical records of detainees. Some lawyers described difficulties getting access to medical records on their client's behalf. Other detainees have complained about problems with getting interpreters during medical treatment. Female detainees have also reported not getting regular gynecological or needed obstetric care. The following section synthesizes the finding in three U.S. government reports that examined selected detention facilities' compliance with all or some of the National Detention Standards. All three reports examined compliance with the Medical Care standard. The reports are as follows: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Detention and Removal (DRO), Semiannual Report on Compliance with ICE National Detention Standards: January\u2014June 2007 , May 9, 2008. Government Accountability Office (GAO), Alien Detention Standards: Telephone Access Problems Were Pervasive at Detention Facilities; Other Deficiencies Did Not Show a Pattern of Noncompliance, GAO-07-875, July 2007. Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Inspector General (DHS OIG), Treatment of Immigration Detainees Housed at Immigration and Customs Enforcement Facilities , OIG-07-01, December 2006.  Table 1 presents the time period of the reviews, the number of facilities reviewed, and the total number of standards evaluated for the studies discussed. In May 2008, ICE released its first semiannual report on compliance with the National Detention Standards. The report covers reviews conducted during the first six months of 2007 and includes the inspections of more than 175 facilities. The report rated the facilities on the Detention Standards as either \"acceptable\" or \"deficient.\" Overall, on the medical care standard, 98% of the facilities were rated acceptable, while 2% were rated deficient. Of the evaluated Service Processing Centers (SPCs) owned and operated by ICE, 80% were rated acceptable, while 20% were rated deficient. In July 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released an audit of 23 detention facilities. GAO found a lack of adherence to the medical care standards at 3 of the 23 facilities, including failing to administer the mandatory physical exams within 14 days of admission and failure to administer medical screening immediately after admission. In addition, GAO found that concerns about medical care were common reasons for aliens to file complaints. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit of compliance with selected detention standards at five facilities used to house immigration detainees. Of the five facilities reviewed, DIHS managed and administered health care at two facilities. At the other three facilities, DIHS was responsible for approving off-site care, but the on-site care was administered by contractors at those facilities. The OIG identified instances of non-compliance with the medical care standards at four of the five detention facilities, including failure to provide timely initial medical care. The one facility found to be in full compliance with the standards for initial medical screening and physical examination was Krome SPC, where medical care is provided by DIHS. The OIG stated in its review that the Detention Standards on sick calls do not clearly define what is considered a timely response to a non-emergency sick call request. Thus, the report found that in the absence of standards, local detention facilities have established differing policies regarding response time to non-emergency care. Nonetheless, at three of the detention facilities (two local prisons and one contract facility), 196 out of 481 detainee non-emergency medical requests were not responded to in the time-frame specified by the facility. As a result, the OIG recommended that ICE develop specific criteria to define a reasonable time for medical treatment. ICE responded to the recommendation, concurring in part and promising to examine the merits of the issue, but contending that its medical program provides adequate detainee care and is consistent with industry standards. ICE also stated that it \"must rely on its service providers to make medical decisions regarding the provision of medical care and any criteria to be established that would determine timeliness.\" Reports of inadequate care being provided to detainees raise several policy issues pertaining to the health care provided to the detained noncitizen population. First, the detention population, both in funded bed space and in the total detention population, increased between FY2003 and FY2007 raising interest in spending on detainee medical care, and concerns that spending has not increased in the same proportion as the detained population. In addition, ICE has the authority to release aliens due to medical and psychological problems, elevating interest in the existing guidelines and practices for medical release, and their adequacy. Similarly, due to the likely special needs of asylum seekers in detention, another policy issue focuses on whether proper care is and can be provided to this population within a detention setting. While every death is regrettable, preventable deaths of aliens in detention who are reliant on the government for medical care heighten concerns about the quality of health care. Doubts about the propriety of the number of deaths in detention as a reliable measure of standard of care, lead to the policy question of which measures would provide insight into the adequacy and quality of care. Finally, an overarching debate on this issue concerns the appropriate standard of health care that should be provided to foreign nationals in immigration detention. This debate is especially emotional because of the balancing act between basic human rights and the cost of health care when U.S. citizens also face barriers in accessing health care. Concerns about the adequacy of health care for detained aliens has increased interest in funding for detainee medical care. As shown in Table 2 , from FY2003 to FY2007, the total amount spent on detainee medical care increased by 83%, from $50 million to $92 million. During that same time period, the total amount of funded bed space increased by 41%. The total amount of funds spent on ICE detainee health care increased between FY2003 and FY2004. Between FY2004 and FY2006, the total expenditures on detainee health care fluctuated but remained between $70 and $74 million. Between FY2006 and FY2007, the total expenditures increased from $74 million to $92 million. Most of the increase in total spending on detainee health care was from increases in program operations, not in medical claims, which are for services rendered by an off-site health care provider to detainees. The total amount of money spent on detainee health care program operations doubled between FY2003 and FY2007. However, the funds expended for medical claims increased between FY2003 and FY2004, then decreased between FY2004 and FY2005. Between FY2005 and FY2007, expenditures on medical claims remained almost constant. During the same time, the funded amount of bed space increased by 49%. ICE has the authority to release aliens due to medical and psychological problems; however, how often this authority is exercised and whether it is used effectively is unknown. ICE has prosecutorial discretion in determining custody for aliens with humanitarian (including medical) concerns. The alien may be released into an Alternatives to Detention program, released on an Order of Supervision, or released on his or her own recognizance. These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, \"whenever a medical or psychiatric evaluation makes the alien's detention problematic and/or removal [from the United States] unlikely.\" ICE does not keep track of how often this discretion is exercised. While there is general debate about the merits of detaining asylum seekers, asylum seekers often have medical and psychological issues and it is not clear how well-equipped the detention health care system is to deal with the specific physical and psychological needs of asylum seekers. As discussed, aliens in expedited removal must be detained, and thus aliens in expedited removal who claim asylum are detained while their \"credible fear\" cases are pending, and they may then be detained while their case is decided. In FY2006, 5,761 asylum seekers were detained, and 1,559 (27%) were detained for more than 180 days. Notably, some claim that the practice of detaining asylum seekers has helped reduced the number of fraudulent asylum claims. However, the position of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees is that detaining asylum seekers is \"inherently undesirable.\" It argues that detention may be psychologically damaging to an already fragile population such as those who are escaping from imprisonment and torture in their countries. Often, the asylum seeker does not understand why he or she is being detained, which can increase psychological stress. In addition, asylum seekers may have unusual medical conditions resulting from the imprisonment and torture suffered in their home countries. Nonetheless, ICE reports that it routinely provides medical care for life-threatening conditions, such as cardiac arrest, kidney disease, HIV/AIDS, hypertension, and diabetes. As discussed earlier in the report, according to ICE detainees receive dental care, physical exams, sick call visits, prescription drugs, and mental health services. ICE states that staff are trained to spot detainees who may be at risk of suicide, and to use prevention and intervention techniques to assist such detainees. Between May 2007 and May 2008, psychologists and social workers have managed a daily population of over 1,350 seriously mentally ill detainees without a single suicide. Thus, current ICE procedures may adequately address the health care needs of detained asylum seekers. Two policy issues become highlighted when a detainee dies in custody. The first issue concerns the quality of oversight when a death occurs and whether there is enough oversight to identify possible cases of inadequate care. Secondly, while a detainee's death may heighten concerns about the quality of health care, there are doubts about the propriety of using deaths in detention as a reliable measure of standard of care. What follows is a discussion of these two issues. Although there is a system to report the death of a detainee, some question whether there is effective oversight when a death occurs in detention. Current ICE procedure dictates that when a detainee dies while in the custody of ICE's Detention and Removal Office (DRO), the death is to be reported to ICE headquarters via a system known as the Significant Event Notification (SEN) system. Under its proceedures, DRO is also supposed to report detainee deaths to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) and to the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) so that they can conduct independent reviews of the incident. In addition, deaths are referred to the local medical examiner's office, which decides whether to perform an autopsy. The OIG is also notified of the death by the Joint Intake Center (JIC), which is notified by the SEN system and sends all records regarding the death (including those from the local medical examiner) to the OIG. The OIG may accept the case for investigation or may decline and refer the case back to the JIC for referral to the Office of Professional Responsibility. ICE has reported a decline in the number of deaths of aliens in detention between 2004 and 2008. Some, however, question whether mortality rates should be used in appraising health care in a transitional population, and truly reflect the quality of care provided to detainees. In May 2008, ICE published a fact sheet reporting that there were 71 deaths in immigration detention facilities from calendar year 2004 (inclusive) through May 2, 2008 (see Table 3 ). ICE reported a decline in the number of detainee deaths between 2004 and 2008, a period when the detainee population increased. ICE also asserted that the mortality rate in its facilities is lower than in U.S. prisons and jails and the general U.S. population. A critical analysis of the death rates was published by physicians at the New York University School of Medicine, who commented that ICE's comparisons were not valid because, among other things, the respective mortality rates had not been adjusted for age or for length of detention. These doctors stated that mortality is an imprecise method for appraising health care in a transitional population, and that morbidity which refers to sickness or having a disease would be a better measure of ICE healthcare. They also stated that, in their calculations, the length-adjusted mortality rate for detainees increased between 2006 and 2007. In addition, critics of the reported death rates stated that those who die outside the facilities but whose deaths were precipitated by their time in detention are not included in the mortality rates. There is debate about the appropriate standard of care that should be provided to aliens in detention. Many U.S. citizens lack health insurance and face barriers in accessing health care, and there are issues of patient safety in many medical settings, not just in correctional facilities. In addition, a proportion of aliens are in detention who are not authorized to be in the country. The cost of care for aliens in detention is paid by the American taxpayer. Reportedly, the health care provided to detained aliens tends to be similar to that provided to those in criminal incarceration. According to a press report, ICE has argued that some aliens are getting better health care in detention than they would in their home countries and that they had received earlier in their lives. Assistant Secretary of ICE, Julie Myers testified that in FY2007, 34% of detainees screened were diagnosed with and treated for preexisting chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), and many of these detainees would not have known of their medical condition or received treatment if it were not for the comprehensive health screening they obtained when entering the detention system. In addition, some health care decisions need to be made with the consideration that the alien is going to be removed to a country where he or she may not be able to get any follow-up care. Some contend that despite ICE's acknowledgment of the substantial burden of chronic diseases among the detained population, the ICE health plan focuses on an acute care model, and is not crafted for a population with significant chronic medical or mental health needs. Some aliens in detention, especially long-term residents, do have health insurance but are unable to use it. Some further allege that officers frequently view ICE detainees as criminals, even when they do not have a criminal record, and as such are sometimes quick to assume that the detainees are faking their illnesses, and sometimes slow to get the aliens care. Appendix A. Detention Statistics On an average day, up to 33,000 immigration detainees are in ICE's custody in more than 300 facilities nationwide. The average stay is 37.5 days. In FY2007, a total of 311,213 aliens were detained by ICE. As of April 30, 2007, ICE reported that, cumulatively, 25% of all detained aliens were removed within four days, 50% within 18 days, 75% within 44 days, 90% within 85 days, 95% within 126 days, and 98% within 210 days (see Table A -1 ). For FY2006, approximately 48% of the aliens in detention were criminal aliens. As Figure A -1 shows, the average daily detained population increased between FY2003 and FY2004 and then decreased between FY2004 and FY2006. The daily average detained population increased significantly between FY2006 and FY2007, from 20,594 to 30,295 detainees. As of December 31, 2007, the average daily detention population for FY2008 was larger than the FY2007 average daily population. For FY2008, as of December 31, 2007, the average daily detained population was 31,244. As illustrated in Figure A -1 , the total number of aliens detained by ICE during the fiscal year was fairly consistent between FY2003 and FY2005, and then increased in both FY2006 and FY2007. In FY2007, ICE detained 79,713 (34%) more noncitizens than in FY2003. Some of the increase in the total annual detention population was due to the expansion of expedited removal. Aliens in expedited removal are mandatorily detained but tend to be in detention for shorter periods of time than other aliens because they are not entitled to the same judicial review as aliens who are not subject to expedited removal (i.e., who are in removal proceedings under INA \u00a7241). Appendix B. Legislation in the 110 th Congress The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 110 - 329 ) appropriated $2 million for the Office of Professional Responsibility to undertake an immediate comprehensive review of the medical care provided to ICE detainees. The Act also directed ICE to immediately implement the Government Accountability Office's recommendation to improve medical services. The Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008, H.R. 5950 , was introduced by Representative Zoe Lofgren on May 1, 2008. The companion bill, S. 3005 , was introduced by Senator Robert Menendez on May 12, 2008. The bills would have required the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish procedures for the timely and effective delivery of medical and mental health care to immigration detainees, designed to ensure continuity of care throughout the alien's detention. The procedures would have been required to address all health needs, including but not limited to primary care, emergency care, prenatal care, dental care, eye care, and mental health care. The procedures would have to have been designed to ensure that each detainee received a comprehensive medical and mental health screening upon intake; each detainee received a comprehensive medical and mental health examination and assessment within 14 days after arrival at the detention facility; each detainee taking prescribed medications was allowed to continue taking such medications on schedule and without interruption; and each detainee with a serious medical or mental condition, subject to immigration laws, been given priority consideration for release on parole, bond, or an alternative to detention program. The procedures would also have been required to ensure that medical records are accessible by the detainee or his or her designate, and were transferred if the detainee was moved to another detention facility. Also, H.R. 5950 / S. 3005 would have required the procedures to include \"discharge planning\" for aliens with serious medical or mental health conditions to ensure continuity of care, for a reasonable period of time, upon removal or release from detention. The bills would also have required the Secretary of DHS to establish an administrative appeals process for denials of medical or mental health care. The process would have included the opportunity to appeal the denial of services to an impartial board. H.R. 5950 / S. 3005 would have required that the Secretary report to the Inspector Generals of the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice information regarding a detainee's death no later than 48 hours after the death of the detainee. The bills would have also require an annual report to Congress detailing any detainee deaths during the previous fiscal year."
