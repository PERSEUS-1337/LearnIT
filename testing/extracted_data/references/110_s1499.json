    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Marine Vessel Emissions Reduction \nAct of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) emissions of air pollutants from marine vessels \n        contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution in many \n        areas in the United States;\n            (2) current levels of control on those emissions are not \n        adequate to protect air quality and public health;\n            (3) to protect air quality and public health, efforts by \n        State and local governments to control emissions from marine \n        vessels must be augmented by the Federal Government;\n            (4) although the Environmental Protection Agency may \n        require additional controls on domestic and international \n        marine vessels entering United States ports, significant \n        emission reductions must be achieved in the near future; and\n            (5) it is urgent and necessary to require the Administrator \n        of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish standards \n        to reduce emissions of air pollutants from marine vessels in a \n        sufficient period of time to allow all areas in the United \n        States to meet air quality standards in accordance with \n        applicable deadlines.\n\nSEC. 3. MARINE VESSEL FUEL SULFUR.\n\n    Section 211 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating the first subsection (r) (relating to \n        fuel and fuel additive importers and importation) as subsection \n        (u) and moving that subsection so as to appear at the end of \n        the section; and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (o) the following:\n    ``(p) Marine Vessel Fuel Sulfur.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (3), not later than \n        December 15, 2008, the Administrator shall promulgate \n        regulations that, effective beginning on December 31, 2010, \n        require marine vessels described in paragraph (2) to use fuel \n        that contains not more than 1,000 parts per million of sulfur \n        in the main and auxiliary engines of the vessels.\n            ``(2) Applicability.--The regulations promulgated pursuant \n        to paragraph (1) shall apply to all marine vessels, including \n        any vessel flagged in a country other than the United States, \n        at any time at which the vessels are, on entering or leaving a \n        port or offshore terminal of the United States--\n                    ``(A) within 200 miles of the west coast of the \n                continental United States; and\n                    ``(B) within such distance of the east coast or \n                Gulf coast of the United States, or the shoreline of \n                the Great Lakes or St. Lawrence Seaway, as the \n                Administrator determines to be appropriate for the \n                purpose of protecting public health and the \n                environment.\n            ``(3) Interim requirement.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding the requirement \n                of paragraph (1), the Administrator may promulgate \n                regulations under that paragraph that permit marine \n                vessel fuel sulfur content in excess of 1,000 parts per \n                million if the Administrator determines that compliance \n                with the requirement of paragraph (1) is not \n                technically feasible by December 31, 2010.\n                    ``(B) Regulations.--If the Administrator makes a \n                determination described in subparagraph (A), the \n                Administrator shall promulgate regulations that require \n                marine vessels--\n                            ``(i) beginning on December 31, 2010, to \n                        use fuel that contains--\n                                    ``(I) the lowest quantity of sulfur \n                                that is technically feasible by that \n                                date; and\n                                    ``(II) in no event a quantity of \n                                sulfur in excess of 2,000 parts per \n                                million; and\n                            ``(ii) to achieve compliance with the \n                        requirement of paragraph (1) on the earliest \n                        practicable date by which compliance is \n                        technically feasible.\n            ``(4) Alternative compliance mechanism.--The Administrator \n        may provide for an alternative mechanism of compliance under \n        this subsection for a marine vessel if the Administrator \n        determines that--\n                    ``(A) the vessel employs a control technology that \n                reduces emissions from the vessel of sulfur oxides and \n                particulate matter to at least the same degree as the \n                reduction that would be achieved by the vessel through \n                compliance with the applicable fuel sulfur content \n                limitation under this subsection; and\n                    ``(B) the emission reductions achieved as described \n                in subparagraph (A) are in addition to any reductions \n                required to achieve compliance with an applicable \n                engine emission standard issued by the Administrator or \n                the head of another Federal agency.\n            ``(5) No effect on other authority.--Nothing in this \n        subsection limits or otherwise affects any authority of the \n        Administrator to regulate fuels or fuel additives for use in \n        marine vessels or any other nonroad vehicle or engine under \n        this Act or any other provision of law.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
