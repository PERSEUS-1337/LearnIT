    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Neotropical Migratory Bird \nConservation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n        (1) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the United \n    States, approximately 500 migrate among countries, and the large \n    majority of those species, the neotropical migrants, winter in \n    Latin America and the Caribbean;\n        (2) neotropical migratory bird species provide invaluable \n    environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits to \n    the United States, as well as to the Western Hemisphere;\n        (3)(A) many neotropical migratory bird populations, once \n    considered common, are in decline, and some have declined to the \n    point that their long-term survival in the wild is in jeopardy; and\n        (B) the primary reason for the decline in the populations of \n    those species is habitat loss and degradation (including pollution \n    and contamination) across the species' range; and\n        (4)(A) because neotropical migratory birds range across \n    numerous international borders each year, their conservation \n    requires the commitment and effort of all countries along their \n    migration routes; and\n        (B) although numerous initiatives exist to conserve migratory \n    birds and their habitat, those initiatives can be significantly \n    strengthened and enhanced by increased coordination.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n        (1) to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory \n    birds;\n        (2) to assist in the conservation of neotropical migratory \n    birds by supporting conservation initiatives in the United States, \n    Latin America, and the Caribbean; and\n        (3) to provide financial resources and to foster international \n    cooperation for those initiatives.\n\nSEC. 4.
