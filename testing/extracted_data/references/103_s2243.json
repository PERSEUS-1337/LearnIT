    "title": "A bill to amend the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 to permit reimbursement of fishermen for fees required by a foreign government to be paid in advance in order to navigate in the waters of that foreign country whenever the United States considers that fee to be inconsistent with international law, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) customary international law and the United Nations \n        Convention on the Law of the Sea guarantee the right of \n        passage, including innocent passage, to vessels through the \n        waters commonly referred to as the ``Inside Passage'' off the \n        Pacific Coast of Canada;\n            (2) Canada has recently announced that it will require all \n        commercial fishing vessels of the United States to pay 1,500 \n        Canadian dollars to obtain a ``license which authorizes \n        transit'' through the Inside Passage off the Pacific Coast of \n        Canada;\n            (3) this action is inconsistent with international law, \n        including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \n        and in particular Article 26 of that Convention, which \n        specifically prohibits such fees, and threatens the safety of \n        United States commercial fishermen who may seek to avoid the \n        fee by traveling in less protected waters;\n            (4) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 provides for the \n        reimbursement of vessel owners who are forced to pay a license \n        fee to secure the release of a vessel which has been seized, \n        but does not permit reimbursement of a fee paid by the owner in \n        advance in order to prevent a seizure;\n            (5) Canada has announced that the license fee may only be \n        paid in two ports on the Pacific Coast of Canada, and must be \n        paid in person or in advance by mail;\n            (6) significant expense and delay would be incurred by a \n        commercial fishing vessel of the United States that had to \n        travel from the point of seizure back to one of those ports in \n        order to pay the license fee required by Canada, and the costs \n        of that travel and delay cannot be reimbursed under the \n        Fishermen's Protective Act as presently enacted;\n            (7) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 should be \n        amended to permit vessel owners to be reimbursed for fees \n        required by a foreign government to be paid in advance in order \n        to navigate in the waters of that foreign country, provided the \n        United States considers that fee to be inconsistent with \n        international law;\n            (8) the Secretary of State should seek to recover from \n        Canada any amounts paid by the United States to reimburse \n        vessel owners who paid the transit license fee;\n            (9) the United States should review its current policy with \n        respect to anchorage by commercial fishing vessels of Canada in \n        waters of the United States off Alaska, including waters in and \n        near the Dixon Entrance, and should accord such vessels the \n        same treatment that commercial fishing vessels of the United \n        States are accorded for anchorage in the waters of Canada off \n        British Columbia;\n            (10) the President should ensure that, consistent with \n        international law, the United States Coast Guard has available \n        adequate resources in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska to \n        provide for the safety of United States citizens, the \n        enforcement of United States law, and to protect the rights of \n        the United States and keep the peace among vessels operating in \n        disputed waters;\n            (11) the President should continue to review all agreements \n        between the United States and Canada to identify other actions \n        that may be taken to convince Canada that continuation of the \n        transit license fee would be against Canada's long-term \n        interests, and should immediately implement any actions which \n        the President deems appropriate until Canada rescinds the fee;\n            (12) the President should immediately convey to Canada in \n        the strongest terms that the United States will not now, nor at \n        any time in the future, tolerate any action by Canada which \n        would impede or otherwise restrict the right of passage of \n        vessels of the United States vessels in a manner inconsistent \n        with international law; and\n            (13) the United States should redouble its efforts to seek \n        expeditious agreement with Canada on appropriate fishery \n        conservation and management measures that can be implemented \n        through the Pacific Salmon Treaty to address issues of mutual \n        concern.\n\nSEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT.\n\n    The Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (P.L. 90-482), as amended, \nis further amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n    ``Sec. 11. (a) In any case on or after June 15, 1994, in which a \nvessel of the United States exercising its right of passage is charged \na fee by the government of a foreign country to engage in transit \npassage between points in the United States (including a point in the \nexclusive economic zone or in an area over which jurisdiction is in \ndispute), and such fee is regarded by the United States as being \ninconsistent with international law, the Secretary of State shall \nreimburse the vessel owner for the amount of any such fee paid under \nprotest.\n    ``(b) In seeking such reimbursement, the vessel owner shall \nprovide, together with such other information as the Secretary of State \nmay require--\n            ``(1) a copy of the receipt for payment;\n            ``(2) an affidavit attesting that the owner or the owner's \n        agent paid the fee under protest; and\n            ``(3) a copy of the vessel's certificate of documentation.\n    ``(c) Requests for reimbursement shall be made to the Secretary of \nState within 120 days of the date of payment of the fee, or within 90 \ndays of the date of enactment of this section, whichever is later.\n    ``(d) Such funds as may be necessary to meet the requirements of \nthis section may be made available from the unobligated balances of \npreviously appropriated funds remaining in the Fishermen's Guaranty \nFund established under section 7 and the Fishermen's Protective Fund \nestablished under section 9. To the extent that requests for \nreimbursement under this section exceed such funds, there are \nauthorized to be appropriated such sums as may be needed for \nreimbursements authorized under subsection (a).\n    ``(e) The Secretary of State shall take such action as the \nSecretary deems appropriate to make and collect claims against the \nforeign country imposing such fee for any amounts reimbursed under this \nsection.\n    ``(f) For purposes of this section, the term `owner' includes any \ncharterer of a vessel of the United States.\n    ``(g) The provisions of this section shall remain in effect until \nOctober 1, 1995.''.\n\nSEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n    (a) Section 7(c) of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (22 \nU.S.C. 1977(c)) is amended by striking ``The amount fixed by the \nSecretary shall be predicated upon at least 33\\1/3\\ per centum of the \ncontribution by the Government.''.\n    (b) Section 7(e) of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (22 \nU.S.C. 1977(e)) is amended by striking ``October 1, 1993'' and \ninserting in lieu thereof ``October 1, 2000''.\n\nSEC. 4. TECHNICAL CORRECTION.\n\n    (a) Section 15(a) of Public Law 103-238 is amended by striking \n``April 1, 1994,'' and inserting ``May 1, 1994.''.\n    (b) The amendment made by subsection (a) shall be effective on and \nafter April 30, 1994.\n\n            Passed the Senate July 1 (legislative day, June 7), 1994.\n\n            Attest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Secretary."
