    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Science and Mathematics Early Start \nGrant Program Act of 1995''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) preschoolers from low-income families have very limited \n        opportunities to be exposed to science and mathematics \n        activities;\n            (2) preschoolers from low-income families need basic, age-\n        appropriate science and mathematics experiences in order to \n        develop educationally at a normal rate;\n            (3) most preschool teachers have little experience with \n        simple science and mathematics activities;\n            (4) attainment of the National Education Goal that calls \n        for United States students to be first in the world in \n        mathematics and science achievement will require a \n        comprehensive, age-appropriate science and mathematics program \n        for preschoolers from low-income families;\n            (5) long-term efforts to train preschool teachers to use \n        science and mathematics activities have been limited in number; \n        and\n            (6) the long-term efforts to train preschool teachers to \n        use science and mathematics activities that have been \n        implemented have shown significant positive results.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide Head Start \nteachers with training programs directed toward the use of age-\nappropriate science and mathematics activities in order to increase \ntheir students' interest in and familiarity with science and \nmathematics. All students should have a basic exposure to science and \nmathematics activities in order to move the Nation toward the National \nGoal that United States students will be first in the world in \nmathematics and science achievement.\n\nSEC. 3.
