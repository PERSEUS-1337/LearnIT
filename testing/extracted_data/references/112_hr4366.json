    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Project Ready STEM Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Minorities are seriously underrepresented in the \n        science and engineering workforce in the United States, with \n        only 4 percent of the Black population and slightly over 4 \n        percent of the Hispanic population participating in the STEM \n        workforce.\n            (2) The number of degrees awarded in the fields of science, \n        technology, engineering, and math (referred to in this Act as \n        ``STEM'') in the United States is stagnant even though \n        employment projections forecast a 17-percent growth in STEM \n        fields over the next decade.\n            (3) Twenty percent of Black college students enter college \n        with STEM majors, but only 15 percent actually receive a \n        bachelor's degree in a STEM major.\n            (4) Nearly \\1/4\\ of Black public school students are \n        interested in STEM, but are not proficient in math.\n            (5) Since 1990, mathematic scores on the assessments \n        conducted by the National Assessment of Education Progress have \n        increased for all students, but White students have average \n        scores 26 points higher than Black and Hispanic students.\n            (6) After school programs play an important role in \n        addressing the achievement gap in underserved communities. \n        Studies demonstrate that STEM learning during the school day is \n        necessary but not sufficient for life-long STEM literacy.\n            (7) As many as 8,400,000 students are enrolled in after \n        school programs. Ethnic minority children are more likely than \n        non-minority children to participate in after school programs. \n        While 15 percent of all students are enrolled in after school \n        programs, 24 percent of Black students and 21 percent of \n        Hispanic students are enrolled in such programs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to prepare middle school \nand secondary school students to be ready for opportunities in the STEM \nfields in college and in careers through strong after school, summer, \nand weekend programs that focus on STEM education.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO ESEA FOR STEM GRANTS.\n\n    Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1964 (20 \nU.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) in the heading, by inserting ``and stem grants'' after \n        ``partnerships'';\n            (2) by inserting after the heading of part B the following:\n\n             ``Subpart 1--Math and Science Partnerships'';\n\n        and\n            (3) by inserting after section 2203 the following new \n        subpart:\n\n                        ``Subpart 2--STEM Grants\n\n``SEC. 2211.
