FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) program is \n        the most common path for undergraduates to become United States \n        military officers.\n            (2) The inclusion of both public and private undergraduate \n        institutions in the ROTC program insures a more racially, \n        ethnically, and socially diverse pool for leadership in the \n        higher ranks of the Armed Forces.\n            (3) The majority of both minority officers and female \n        officers in the Armed Forces are acquired through undergraduate \n        ROTC programs.\n            (4) The presence of ROTC programs on college campuses \n        benefits even those students who are not enrolled by making \n        them aware of the presence and role of the United States \n        military.\n            (5) Land-grant colleges received land from the United \n        States on the condition that they offer some military \n        instruction in addition to their regular curriculum, forming \n        the basis for the Nation's tradition of college and university \n        acceptance of responsibility to contribute to the Nation's \n        readiness.\n            (6) The Armed Forces face a constant challenge in \n        recruiting top-quality personnel that ROTC programs are ideally \n        suited to meet.\n            (7) Military recruiters should have access to college \n        campuses and to college students equal in quality and scope to \n        that provided all other employers.\n            (8) If any college or university discriminates against ROTC \n        programs or military recruiters, then under current law that \n        college or university becomes ineligible for certain Federal \n        taxpayer support, especially funding for many military and \n        defense programs.\n            (9) The personnel and programs of the Department of \n        Homeland Security and the Department of Energy are mutually \n        dependent upon a high caliber of well-educated, professional \n        leadership in the Armed Forces in order to protect the people \n        and territory of the United States.\n            (10) In order to more fully promote the ability of the \n        Nation's Armed Forces to recruit on college campuses and to \n        facilitate the ability of students to participate in ROTC \n        programs on campus, the laws to prevent discrimination against \n        ROTC and military recruiters should be updated.\n\nSEC. 3. CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH ROTC ACCESS PROVISIONS.\n\n    Subsection (a) of section 983 of title 10, United States Code, is \namended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``No funds'';\n            (2) by striking ``prevents--'' and inserting ``prevents, \n        either (or both) of the following:'';\n            (3) by striking ``(1) the'' and inserting ``(A) The'';\n            (4) by striking ``; or'' and inserting a period;\n            (5) by striking ``(2) a'' and inserting ``(B) A''; and\n            (6) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(2)(A) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of \nthe ROTC and Military Recruiter Equal Access to Campus Act of 2004 and \nannually thereafter, the Secretary of Defense shall request from each \ninstitution of higher education that has students participating in a \nSenior Reserve Officer Training Corps program during the then-current \nacademic year of that institution a certification that such \ninstitution, during the next academic year of the institution, will--\n            ``(i) permit the Secretary of each military department to \n        maintain a unit of the Senior Officer Training Corps (in \n        accordance with subsection (a)) at that institution (or any \n        subelement of that institution), should such Secretary elect to \n        maintain such a unit; and\n            ``(ii) if the Secretary of the military department \n        concerned elects not to establish or maintain a unit of the \n        Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps at that institution, \n        permit a student of that institution (or any subelement of that \n        institution) to enroll in a unit of the Senior Reserve Officer \n        Training Corps at another institution of higher education.\n    ``(B) Any certification under subparagraph (A) shall be made by the \npresident of the institution (or equivalent highest ranking \nadministrative official) and shall be submitted to the Secretary of \nDefense no later than 90 days after receipt of the request from the \nSecretary.\n    ``(C) In the case of any institution from which a certification is \nrequested under subparagraph (A), if the Secretary of Defense does not \nreceive a certification in accordance with subparagraph (B), or if the \ncertification does not state that the university will comply with both \nclauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) during its next academic year, \nthe Secretary shall make a determination under paragraph (1) as to \nwhether the institution has a policy or practice described in that \nparagraph.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
