    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Turning Around Low-Performing Public \nHigh Schools Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Only 70 percent of United States students graduate on \n        time with a regular diploma and about 1,200,000 students drop \n        out regularly. Almost 50 percent of public high school students \n        in the 50 largest cities of the United States fail to graduate.\n            (2) Only 50 percent of all Black students and 53 percent of \n        Hispanic students graduate from high school. Males fare even \n        worse, with only 43 percent of Black male students and 48 \n        percent of Hispanic male students graduating.\n            (3) High school dropouts are more likely to live in \n        poverty, join gangs, and use drugs. They are more than 8 times \n        as likely to be in jail as a person with a diploma. This \n        results in a lifetime cost for a dropout who moves to a life of \n        crime and drugs of $1,700,000 to $2,300,000.\n            (4) High school turnaround requires a systematic and \n        comprehensive approach that addresses changes in instructional \n        improvement and structural changes in the school organization.\n            (5) Effective turnaround organizations that partner with \n        low-performing local educational agencies and schools can build \n        the capacity of the agencies and schools to reform services and \n        systems.\n            (6) Turnaround partner organizations with experience and \n        expertise at the high school level that have the capacity and \n        flexibility to work nationally are in short supply.\n            (7) Although the funds made available under section 14006 \n        of division A of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n        2009 are designed to help States reform low-performing schools, \n        not all States will qualify to receive the funds, even though \n        they contain low-performing high schools.\n            (8) Not all failing high schools are eligible to receive \n        school improvement grants under section 1003 of the Elementary \n        and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n            (9) The challenge of high school turnaround exceeds the \n        capacity of many local educational agencies, requiring the \n        expertise of external partnership organizations.\n            (10) Alternative turnaround strategies that do not involve \n        charter schools or were not addressed in the American Recovery \n        and Reinvestment Act of 2009 turnaround model are needed to be \n        able reach all low-performing public high schools.\n\nSEC. 3. HIGH SCHOOL TURNAROUND.\n\n    (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n            (1) to turn around low-performing high schools and increase \n        graduation rates and college readiness for poor and minority \n        graduating high school students;\n            (2) to improve teacher and principal quality in high \n        schools that serve students at risk of dropping out of school;\n            (3) to provide support and assistance to organizations that \n        serve as high school turnaround partners for schools and local \n        educational agencies that may not be eligible to receive funds \n        made available under section 14006 of division A of the \n        American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in order to \n        improve secondary school graduation, postsecondary program \n        attendance, and postsecondary completion rates for low-income \n        students; and\n            (4) to promote the establishment of new programs to \n        implement high school turnaround that do not involve charter \n        schools or were not addressed in the American Recovery and \n        Reinvestment Act of 2009 turnaround model.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Comprehensive high school turnaround model.--The term \n        ``comprehensive high school turnaround model'' means a \n        research-based high school turnaround model that--\n                    (A) defines and guides school turnaround, enabling \n                schools to develop strategies for school design that \n                are customized to meet the unique needs of schools and \n                local educational agencies;
