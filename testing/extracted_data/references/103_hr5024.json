    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Training Center for \nMinority Museum, Archives, and Historic Preservation Professionals \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) By a law enacted in 1980, the National Afro-American \n        History and Culture Commission was established to develop plans \n        for the construction and operation of the National Center for \n        the Study of Afro-American History and Culture (now known as \n        the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center).\n            (2) The Museum was constructed at Wilberforce, Ohio, and \n        opened to the public in April 1988.\n            (3) It was the intent of Congress, and the understanding of \n        the State of Ohio, that the Federal Government would assist the \n        State by providing funds for construction and development of \n        the Museum as a joint Federal-State project, yet this \n        partnership was not clarified in the original legislation.\n            (4) The State of Ohio has assumed almost exclusive \n        financial responsibility for the Museum thus far.\n            (5) There is a gross underrepresentation of minority \n        museum, archives, and historic preservation professionals in \n        our Nation's museums, archives, and historic preservation \n        offices, which results in the failure to preserve important \n        artifacts, manuscripts, and sites related to minority history \n        and culture.\n            (6) The State of Ohio has gone as far as it can without \n        tangible Federal assistance and needs Federal funds for \n        construction of a center at the Museum to be used to train \n        minority museum, archives, and historic preservation \n        professionals for our Nation's museums, archives, and historic \n        preservation offices.\n            (7) Public Law 101-628 instructs the National Park Service \n        to develop a range of concepts to preserve, interpret and \n        commemorate the Underground Railroad story. During the 19th \n        Century, the State of Ohio and its citizens played major roles \n        in helping escaped slaves to freedom via the Underground \n        Railroad. Wilberforce, Ohio was an important station among a \n        network of stations in Ohio.\n    (b) Purposes.--In order to meet the charge of the original \nlegislation, the purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to authorize the appropriation of funds for \n        construction and maintenance of the National Training Center at \n        the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center at \n        Wilberforce, Ohio;\n            (2) to authorize the establishment of a Board of Governors \n        of the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center \n        jointly with the State of Ohio; and\n            (3) to authorize an interpretative and research center to \n        preserve, interpret and commemorate the Underground Railroad \n        story.\n\nSEC. 3.
