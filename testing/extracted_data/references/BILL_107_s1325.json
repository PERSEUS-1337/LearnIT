FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n        (1) Adak Island is an isolated island located 1,200 miles \n    southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, between the Pacific Ocean and the \n    Bering Sea. The Island, with its unique physical and biological \n    features, including a deep water harbor and abundant marine-\n    associated wildlife, was recognized early for both its natural and \n    military values. In 1913, Adak Island was reserved and set aside as \n    a Preserve because of its value to seabirds, marine mammals, and \n    fisheries. Withdrawals of portions of Adak Island for various \n    military purposes date back to 1901 and culminated in the 1959 \n    withdrawal of approximately half of the Island for use by the \n    Department of the Navy for military purposes.\n        (2) By 1990, military development on Adak Island supported a \n    community of 6,000 residents. Outside of the Adak Naval Complex, \n    there was no independent community on Adak Island.\n        (3) As a result of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act \n    of 1990 (104 Stat. 1808), as amended, the Adak Naval Complex has \n    been closed by the Department of Defense.\n        (4) The Aleut Corporation is an Alaskan Native Regional \n    Corporation incorporated in the State of Alaska pursuant to the \n    Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), as amended (43 U.S.C. \n    1601, et seq.). The Aleut Corporation represents the indigenous \n    people of the Aleutian Islands who prior to the Russian exploration \n    and settlement of the Aleutian Islands were found throughout the \n    Aleutian Islands which includes Adak Island.\n        (5) None of Adak Island was available for selection by The \n    Aleut Corporation under section 14(h)(8) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. \n    1613(h)(8)) because it was part of a National Wildlife Refuge and \n    because the portion comprising the Adak Naval Complex was withdrawn \n    for use by the United States Navy for military purposes prior to \n    the passage of ANCSA in December 1971.\n        (6) The Aleut Corporation is attempting to establish a \n    community on Adak and has offered to exchange ANCSA land selections \n    and entitlements for conveyance of certain lands and interests \n    therein on a portion of Adak formerly occupied by the Navy.\n        (7) Removal of a portion of the Adak Island land from refuge \n    status will be offset by the acquisition of high quality wildlife \n    habitat in other Aleut Corporation selections within the Alaska \n    Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, maintaining a resident human \n    population on Adak to control caribou, and making possible a \n    continued United States Fish and Wildlife Service presence in that \n    remote location to protect the natural resources of the Aleutian \n    Islands Unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.\n        (8) It is in the public interest to promote reuse of the Adak \n    Island lands by exchanging certain lands for lands selected by The \n    Aleut Corporation elsewhere in the Alaska Maritime National \n    Wildlife Refuge. Experience with environmental problems associated \n    with formerly used defense sites in the State of Alaska suggests \n    that the most effective and efficient way to avoid future \n    environmental problems on Adak is to support and encourage active \n    reuse of Adak.\n\nSEC. 2. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT.\n\n    The document entitled the ``Agreement Concerning the Conveyance of \nProperty at the Adak Naval Complex'' (hereinafter ``the Agreement''), \nand dated September 20, 2000, executed by The Aleut Corporation, the \nDepartment of the Interior and the Department of the Navy, together \nwith any technical amendments or modifications to the boundaries that \nmay be agreed to by the parties is hereby ratified, confirmed, and \napproved and the terms, conditions, procedures, covenants, \nreservations, indemnities and other provisions set forth in the \nAgreement are declared to be obligations and commitments of the United \nStates and The Aleut Corporation: Provided, That modifications to the \nmaps and legal descriptions of lands to be removed from the National \nWildlife Refuge System within the military withdrawal on Adak Island \nset forth in Public Land Order 1949 may be made only upon agreement of \nall Parties to the Agreement and notification given to the Committee on \nResources of the United States House of Representatives and the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate: \nProvided further, That the acreage conveyed to the United States by The \nAleut Corporation under the Agreement, as modified, shall be at least \n36,000 acres.\n\nSEC. 3.

The public easements for access to \npublic lands and waters reserved pursuant to the Agreement are deemed \nto satisfy the requirements and purposes of section 17(b) of the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act.\n\nSEC. 5. REACQUISITION OF LANDS.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire by purchase \nor exchange, on a willing seller basis only, any land conveyed to The \nAleut Corporation under the Agreement and this Act. In the event any of \nthe lands are subsequently acquired by the United States, they shall be \nautomatically included in the Refuge System. The laws and regulations \napplicable to Refuge lands shall then apply to these lands and the \nSecretary shall then adjust the boundaries accordingly.\n\nSEC. 6. GENERAL.\n\n    (a) Nothwithstanding the Federal Property and Administrative \nServices Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 483-484) and the Defense \nBase Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended (10 U.S.C. 2687), \nand for the purposes of the transfer of property authorized by this \nAct, Department of Navy personal property that remains on Adak Island \nis deemed related to the real property and shall be conveyed by the \nDepartment of the Navy to The Aleut Corporation at no additional cost \nwhen the related real property is conveyed by the Department of the \nInterior.\n    (b) The Secretary of the Interior shall convey to The Aleut \nCorporation those lands identified in the Agreement as the former \nlandfill sites without charge to The Aleut Corporation's entitlement \nunder the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.\n    (c) Any property, including, but not limited to, appurtenances and \nimprovements, received pursuant to this Act shall, for purposes of \nsection 21(d) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended, \nand section 907(d) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation \nAct, as amended, be treated as not developed until such property is \nactually occupied, leased (other than leases for nominal consideration \nto public entities) or sold by The Aleut Corporation, or, in the case \nof a lease or other transfer by The Aleut Corporation to a wholly owned \ndevelopment subsidiary, actually occupied, leased, or sold by the \nsubsidiary.\n    (d) Upon conveyance to The Aleut Corporation of the lands described \nin Appendix A of the Agreement, the lands described in Appendix C of \nthe Agreement will become unavailable for selection under ANCSA.\n    (e) The maps included as part of Appendix A to the Agreement depict \nthe lands to be conveyed to The Aleut Corporation.
