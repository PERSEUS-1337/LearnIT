NATIONAL UNIFORMITY FOR FOOD.\n\n    (a) National Uniformity.--Section 403A of the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343-1) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(4), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n            (2) in subsection (a)(5), by striking the period and \n        inserting ``, or'';\n            (3) in subsection (a), by inserting after paragraph (5) the \n        following:\n            ``(6) any requirement for a food described in section \n        402(a)(1), 402(a)(2), 402(a)(6), 402(a)(7), 402(c), 404, 406, \n        409, 512, or 721(a), that is not identical to the requirement \n        of such section.''; and\n            (4) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c)(1) For purposes of subsection (a)(6) and section 403B, the \nterm `identical' means that the language under the laws of a State or a \npolitical subdivision of a State is substantially the same language as \nthe comparable provision under this Act and that any differences in \nlanguage do not result in the imposition of materially different \nrequirements. For purposes of subsection (a)(6), the term `any \nrequirement for a food' does not refer to provisions of this Act that \nrelate to procedures for Federal action under this Act.\n    ``(2) For purposes of subsection (a)(6), a State or political \nsubdivision of a State may enforce a State law that contains a \nrequirement that is identical to a requirement in a section of Federal \nlaw referred to in subsection (a)(6) if the Secretary has promulgated a \nregulation or adopted a final guidance relating to the requirement and \nthe State applies the State requirement in a manner that conforms to \nthe regulation or guidance.\n    ``(3) If the Secretary has not promulgated a regulation or adopted \nfinal guidance relating to a requirement in a section of Federal law \nreferred to in subsection (a)(6), a State or political subdivision of a \nState may enforce a policy, such as a State regulation or an \nadministrative decision, that is based on a State law that contains a \nrequirement that is identical to a requirement in a section of Federal \nlaw referred to in subsection (a)(6).\n    ``(4) If the Secretary has considered a proposal for a regulation \nor final guidance relating to a requirement in a section of Federal law \nreferred to in subsection (a)(6) and has, after soliciting public \ncomment, made a determination not to promulgate such regulation or \nadopt such guidance, which determination is published in the Federal \nRegister, a State or political subdivision of a State may not enforce \nany requirements in State law that are policies rejected by the \nSecretary through such determination.''.\n    (b) Uniformity in Food Safety Warning Notification Requirements.--\nChapter IV of such Act (21 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating sections 403B and 403C as sections \n        403C and 403D, respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 403A the following new \n        section:\n\n``SEC. 403B.
