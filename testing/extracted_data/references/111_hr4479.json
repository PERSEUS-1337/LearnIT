If in its \n        Sequestration Report, OMB estimates that any sequestration is \n        required, the President shall issue an order fully implementing \n        without change all sequestrations required by the OMB \n        calculations set forth in that report. This order shall be \n        effective on issuance.\n            (2) CBO.--Ten days after the end of session, CBO shall \n        issue a discretionary sequestration report.\n            (3) Special rule.--If the date specified for the submission \n        of a Presidential order under paragraph (1) falls on a Sunday \n        or legal holiday, such order shall be issued on the following \n        day.\n    (b) Effects of Sequestration.--The effects of sequestration shall \nbe as follows:\n            (1) Budgetary resources sequestered from any account shall \n        be permanently cancelled, except as provided in paragraph (5).\n            (2) Except as otherwise provided, the same percentage \n        sequestration shall apply to all programs, projects, and \n        activities within a budget account (with programs, projects, \n        and activities as delineated in the appropriation Act or \n        accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering that \n        account).\n            (3) Administrative regulations or similar actions \n        implementing a sequestration shall be made within 120 days of \n        the sequestration order. To the extent that formula allocations \n        differ at different levels of budgetary resources within an \n        account, program, project, or activity, the sequestration shall \n        be interpreted as producing a lower total appropriation, with \n        the remaining amount of the appropriation being obligated in a \n        manner consistent with program allocation formulas in \n        substantive law.\n            (4) Except as otherwise provided, obligations or budgetary \n        resources in sequestered accounts shall be reduced only in the \n        fiscal year in which a sequester occurs.\n            (5) Budgetary resources sequestered in special fund \n        accounts and offsetting collections sequestered in \n        appropriation accounts shall not be available for obligation \n        during the fiscal year in which the sequestration occurs, but \n        shall be available in subsequent years to the extent otherwise \n        provided in law.\n    (c) Submission and Availability of Reports.--Each report required \nby this section shall be submitted, in the case of CBO, to the House of \nRepresentatives, the Senate, and OMB and, in the case of OMB, to the \nHouse of Representatives, the Senate, and the President on the day it \nis issued.
