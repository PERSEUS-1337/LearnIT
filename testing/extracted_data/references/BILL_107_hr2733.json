FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Over 90 percent of United States companies engaged in \n    manufacturing are small- and medium-sized businesses.\n        (2) Most of these manufacturers produce goods for assemblage \n    into products of large companies.\n        (3) The emergence of the World Wide Web and the promulgation of \n    international standards for product data exchange greatly \n    accelerated the movement toward electronically integrated supply \n    chains during the last half of the 1990's.\n        (4) European and Asian countries are investing heavily in \n    electronic enterprise standards development, and in preparing their \n    smaller manufacturers to do business in the new environment. \n    European efforts are well advanced in the aerospace, automotive, \n    and shipbuilding industries and are beginning in other industries \n    including home building, furniture manufacturing, textiles, and \n    apparel. This investment could give overseas companies a major \n    competitive advantage.\n        (5) The National Institute of Standards and Technology, because \n    of the electronic commerce expertise in its laboratories and \n    quality program, its long history of working cooperatively with \n    manufacturers, and the nationwide reach of its manufacturing \n    extension program, is in a unique position to help United States \n    large and smaller manufacturers alike in their responses to this \n    challenge.\n        (6) It is, therefore, in the national interest for the National \n    Institute of Standards and Technology to accelerate its efforts in \n    helping industry develop standards and enterprise integration \n    processes that are necessary to increase efficiency and lower \n    costs.\n\nSEC. 3. ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION INITIATIVE.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Director shall establish an initiative for \nadvancing enterprise integration within the United States. In carrying \nout this section, the Director shall involve, as appropriate, the \nvarious units of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nincluding the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nlaboratories (including the Building and Fire Research Laboratory), the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership program established under sections \n25 and 26 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 \nU.S.C. 278k and 278l), and the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality \nProgram. This initiative shall build upon ongoing efforts of the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology and of the private \nsector, shall involve consortia that include government and industry, \nand shall address the enterprise integration needs of each United \nStates major manufacturing industry at the earliest possible date.\n    (b) Assessment.--For each major manufacturing industry, the \nDirector may work with industry, trade associations, professional \nsocieties, and others as appropriate, to identify enterprise \nintegration standardization and implementation activities underway in \nthe United States and abroad that affect that industry and to assess \nthe current state of enterprise integration within that industry. The \nDirector may assist in the development of roadmaps to permit supply \nchains within the industry to operate as an integrated electronic \nenterprise. The roadmaps shall be based on voluntary consensus \nstandards.\n    (c) Reports.--Within 180 days after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act, and annually thereafter, the Director shall submit to the \nCommittee on Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report on the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology's activities under \nsubsection (b).\n    (d) Authorized Activities.--In order to carry out this Act, the \nDirector may work with industry, trade associations, professional \nsocieties, and others as appropriate--\n        (1) to raise awareness in the United States, including \n    awareness by businesses that are majority owned by women, \n    minorities, or both, of enterprise integration activities in the \n    United States and abroad, including by the convening of \n    conferences;\n        (2) on the development of enterprise integration roadmaps;\n        (3) to support the development, testing, promulgation, \n    integration, adoption, and upgrading of standards related to \n    enterprise integration including application protocols; and\n        (4) to provide technical assistance and, if necessary, \n    financial support to small- and medium-sized businesses that set up \n    pilot projects in enterprise integration.\n    (e) Manufacturing Extension Program.--The Director shall ensure \nthat the Manufacturing Extension Program is prepared to advise small- \nand medium-sized businesses on how to acquire the expertise, equipment, \nand training necessary to participate fully in supply chains using \nenterprise integration.\n\nSEC. 4.
