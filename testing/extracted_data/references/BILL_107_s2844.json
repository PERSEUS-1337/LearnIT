FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) An estimated 2,000,000 new teachers will be needed over \n        the next decade.\n            (2) Under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, States must \n        recruit qualified teachers by 2006, yet schools in rural areas \n        and public schools with high poverty have trouble attracting \n        and retaining teachers.\n            (3) Fourteen percent of America's school children attend \n        rural schools, and according to the Rural School and Community \n        Trust 2000 report, ``Why Rural Matters'', rural education is \n        crucial or very important to overall education performance in \n        25 States, so recruitment and retention of teachers is \n        essential.\n            (4) A 2000 study by the Education Trust reports that high \n        poverty schools are twice as likely not to have teachers \n        certified in their fields than other schools, which highlights \n        that high poverty schools will need special help to meet the \n        goals of No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.\n            (5) The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards \n        was founded in 1987, as a follow up to the landmark 1983 \n        report, ``A Nation at Risk'', by the Carnegie Task Force on \n        Teaching. The National Board for Professional Teaching \n        Standards is an independent, nonprofit, and nonpartisan \n        organization the mission of which is to establish high and \n        rigorous standards for what accomplished teachers should know \n        and be able to do.\n            (6) Over 16,000 teachers from all 50 States and the \n        District of Columbia have completed certification by the \n        National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, which \n        certification is a rigorous assessment process for teachers.\n            (7) Recent data from the Accomplished Teaching Validation \n        Study have demonstrated that teachers who are certified by the \n        National Board for Professional Teaching Standards \n        significantly outperform their peers who are not National Board \n        certified on 11 of 13 key measures of teaching expertise.\n            (8) Teacher salaries have remained stagnant over the past \n        decade, according to a study by the National Education \n        Association, and \\2/3\\ of the States do not meet the national \n        average of $40,582 for teacher salaries.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To encourage teachers, through a refundable tax credit, \n        to work in public elementary and secondary schools located in \n        rural areas or schools with high poverty.\n            (2) To provide an additional tax credit to teachers who \n        achieve certification from the National Board for Professional \n        Teaching Standards in order to recruit and retain highly \n        qualified teachers in public elementary and secondary schools.\n\nSEC. 3. REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR INDIVIDUALS TEACHING IN ELEMENTARY \n              AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS LOCATED IN HIGH POVERTY OR RURAL \n              AREAS AND CERTIFIED TEACHERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to refundable credits) \nis amended by redesignating section 35 as section 36 and by inserting \nafter section 34 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 35.
