The right to refuse to perform \nsuch a duty shall be in addition to any other right to refuse to \nperform hazardous work that is afforded to employees by this Act, by \nstandards or regulations issued pursuant to this Act, by contract, or \nby other applicable law.\n    ``(d)(1) Any employer notified of an order under subsection (a) or \nany affected employees or representative of affected employees notified \nof the issuance, modification, or termination of such an order may \napply to the Commission within 30 days of such notification for \nreinstatement, modification or vacation of such order.
