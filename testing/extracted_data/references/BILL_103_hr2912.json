FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The free exchange of ideas and information through \n        modern, reliable telecommunications equipment fosters the \n        development of democratic institutions, the promotion of free \n        market economic reforms, and the facilitation of international \n        commerce.\n            (2) Exports of advanced telecommunications equipment and \n        technology contribute to United States economic competitiveness \n        and high-skill, high-wage jobs in the United States.\n            (3) Export restrictions on telecommunications equipment and \n        technology are outdated, controlling the export of equipment \n        and technology that is more than 10 years old and has over 15 \n        times less capacity than similar equipment and technology in \n        use today in the United States.\n            (4) Foreign availability of telecommunications equipment \n        and technology exists both from countries that do not belong to \n        or cooperate with the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral \n        Export Controls, and from within countries to which exports of \n        such equipment and technology are controlled by agreement of \n        the Coordinating Committee.\n\nSEC. 2.
