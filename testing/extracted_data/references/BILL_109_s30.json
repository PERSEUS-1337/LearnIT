FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Justice is served when all parties to litigation are \n        represented by experienced diligent counsel.\n            (2) Protecting attorney-client privileged communications \n        from compelled disclosure fosters voluntary compliance with the \n        law.\n            (3) To serve the purpose of the attorney-client privilege, \n        attorneys and clients must have a degree of confidence that \n        they will not be required to disclose privileged \n        communications.\n            (4) The ability of an organization to have effective \n        compliance programs and to conduct comprehensive internal \n        investigations is enhanced when there is clarity and \n        consistency regarding the attorney-client privilege.\n            (5) Prosecutors, investigators, enforcement officials, and \n        other officers or employees of Government agencies have been \n        able to, and can continue to, conduct their work while \n        respecting attorney-client and work product protections and the \n        rights of individuals, including seeking and discovering facts \n        crucial to the investigation and prosecution of organizations.\n            (6) Despite the existence of these legitimate tools, the \n        Department of Justice and other agencies have increasingly \n        employed tactics that undermine the adversarial system of \n        justice, such as encouraging organizations to waive attorney-\n        client privilege and work product protections to avoid \n        indictment or other sanctions.\n            (7) An indictment can have devastating consequences on an \n        organization, potentially eliminating the ability of the \n        organization to survive post-indictment or to dispute the \n        charges against it at trial.\n            (8) Waiver demands and other tactics of Government agencies \n        are encroaching on the constitutional rights and other legal \n        protections of employees.\n            (9) The attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, \n        and payment of counsel fees shall not be used as devices to \n        conceal wrongdoing or to cloak advice on evading the law.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to place on each agency \nclear and practical limits designed to preserve the attorney-client \nprivilege and work product protections available to an organization and \npreserve the constitutional rights and other legal protections \navailable to employees of such an organization.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE OR ADVANCEMENT OF \n              COUNSEL FEES AS ELEMENTS OF COOPERATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 201 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by inserting after section 3013 the following:\n``Sec. 3014.
