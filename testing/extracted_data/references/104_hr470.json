    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Ireland Fair Employment \nPractices Act of 1995''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Currently, overall unemployment in Northern Ireland is \n        approximately 13 percent, as compared to 9 percent in the rest \n        of the United Kingdom.\n            (2) Unemployment in the minority community in Northern \n        Ireland is 22.8 percent, and in some portions of the minority \n        community unemployment has historically exceeded 70 percent.\n            (3) The British Government Fair Employment Commission \n        (F.E.C.), formerly the Fair Employment Agency (F.E.A.), has \n        consistently reported that a member of the minority community \n        is two times more likely to be unemployed than a member of the \n        majority community.\n            (4) The Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC), \n        Washington, District of Columbia, lists 80 publicly held United \n        States companies doing business in Northern Ireland, which \n        employ approximately 11,000 individuals.\n            (5) The religious minority population of Northern Ireland \n        is subject to discriminatory hiring practices by some United \n        States businesses which have resulted in a disproportionate \n        number of minority individuals holding menial and low-paying \n        jobs.\n            (6) The MacBride Principles are a nine point set of \n        guidelines for fair employment in Northern Ireland which \n        establishes a corporate code of conduct to promote equal access \n        to regional employment but does not require disinvestment, \n        quotas, or reverse discrimination.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON IMPORTS.\n\n    An article from Northern Ireland may not be entered, or withdrawn \nfrom warehouse for consumption, in the customs territory of the United \nStates unless there is presented at the time of entry to the customs \nofficer concerned documentation indicating that the enterprise which \nmanufactured or assembled such article was in compliance at the time of \nmanufacture with the principles described in section 5.\n\nSEC. 4. COMPLIANCE WITH FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRINCIPLES.\n\n    (a) Compliance.--Any United States person who--\n            (1) has a branch or office in Northern Ireland, or\n            (2) controls a corporation, partnership, or other \n        enterprise in Northern Ireland,\nin which more than twenty people are employed shall take the necessary \nsteps to ensure that, in operating such branch, office, corporation, \npartnership, or enterprise, those principles relating to employment \npractices set forth in section 5 are implemented and this Act is \ncomplied with.\n    (b) Report.--Each United States person referred to in subsection \n(a) shall submit to the Secretary--\n            (1) a detailed and fully documented annual report, signed \n        under oath, on showing compliance with the provisions of this \n        Act; and\n            (2) such other information as the Secretary determines is \n        necessary.\n\nSEC. 5. MACBRIDE PRINCIPLES.\n\n    The principles referred to in section 4 are the MacBride \nPrinciples, which are as follows:\n            (1) Increasing the representation of individuals from \n        underrepresented religious groups in the work force including \n        managerial, supervisory, administrative, clerical, and \n        technical jobs.--A workforce that is severely unbalanced may \n        indicate prima facie that full equality of opportunity is not \n        being afforded all segments of the community in Northern \n        Ireland. Each signatory to the MacBride Principles must make \n        every reasonable lawful effort to increase the representation \n        of underrepresented religious groups at all levels of its \n        operations in Northern Ireland.\n            (2) Adequate security for the protection of minority \n        employees both at the workplace and while travelling to and \n        from work.--While total security can be guaranteed nowhere \n        today in Northern Ireland, each signatory to the MacBride \n        Principles must make reasonable good faith efforts to protect \n        workers against intimidation and physical abuse at the \n        workplace. Signatories must also make reasonable good faith \n        efforts to ensure that applicants are not deterred from seeking \n        employment because of fear for their personal safety at the \n        workplace or while travelling to and from work.\n            (3) The banning of provocative religious or political \n        emblems from the workplace.--Each signatory to the MacBride \n        Principles must make reasonable good faith efforts to prevent \n        the display of provocative sectarian emblems at their plants in \n        Northern Ireland.\n            (4) All job openings should be advertised publicly and \n        special recruitment efforts made to attract applicants from \n        underrepresented religious groups.--Signatories to the MacBride \n        Principles must exert special efforts to attract employment \n        applications from the sectarian community that is substantially \n        underrepresented in the workforce. This should not be construed \n        to imply a diminution of opportunity for other applicants.\n            (5) Layoff, recall, and termination procedures should not \n        in practice favor a particular religious group.--Each signatory \n        to the MacBride Principles must make reasonable good faith \n        efforts to ensure that layoff, recall, and termination \n        procedures do not penalize a particular religious group \n        disproportionately. Layoff and termination practices that \n        involve seniority solely can result in discrimination against a \n        particular religious group if the bulk of employees with \n        greatest seniority are disproportionately from another \n        religious group.\n            (6) The abolition of job reservations, apprenticeship \n        restrictions, and differential employment criteria which \n        discriminate on the basis of religion.--Signatories to the \n        MacBride Principles must make reasonable good faith efforts to \n        abolish all differential employment criteria whose effect is \n        discrimination on the basis of religion. For example, job \n        reservations, and apprenticeship regulations that favor \n        relatives of current or former employees can, in practice, \n        promote religious discrimination if the company's workforce has \n        historically been disproportionately drawn from another \n        religious group.\n            (7) The development of training programs that will prepare \n        substantial numbers of current minority employees for skilled \n        jobs, including the expansion of existing programs and the \n        creation of new programs to train, upgrade, and improve the \n        skills of minority employees.--This does not imply that such \n        programs should not be open to all members of the workforce \n        equally.\n            (8) The establishment of procedures to assess, identify, \n        and actively recruit minority employees with potential for \n        further advancement.--This section does not imply that such \n        procedures should not apply to all employees equally.\n            (9) The appointment of a senior management staff member to \n        oversee the company's affirmative action efforts and the \n        setting up of timetables to carry out affirmative action \n        principles.--In addition to the above, each signatory to the \n        MacBride Principles is required to report annually to an \n        independent monitoring agency on its progress in the \n        implementation of these Principles.\n\nSEC. 6. WAIVER OF PROVISIONS.\n\n    (a) Waiver of Provisions.--In any case in which the President \ndetermines that compliance by a United States person with the \nprovisions of this Act would harm the national security of the United \nStates, the President may waive those provisions with respect to that \nUnited States person. The President shall publish in the Federal \nRegister each waiver granted under this section and shall submit to the \nCongress a justification for granting each such waiver. Any such waiver \nshall become effective at the end of ninety days after the date on \nwhich the justification is submitted to the Congress unless the \nCongress, within that ninety-day period, adopts a joint resolution \ndisapproving the waiver. In the computation of such ninety-day period, \nthere shall be excluded the days on which either House of Congress is \nnot in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a \nday certain or because of an adjournment of the Congress sine die.\n    (b) Consideration of Resolutions.--\n            (1) Any resolution described in subsection (a) shall be \n        considered in the Senate in accordance with the provisions of \n        section 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and \n        Arms Export Control Act of 1976.\n            (2) For the purpose of expediting the consideration and \n        adoption of a resolution under subsection (a) in the House of \n        Representatives, a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n        such resolution after it has been reported by the appropriate \n        committee shall be treated as highly privileged in the House of \n        Representatives.\n\nSEC. 7.
