FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Chinookan people have--\n                    (A) lived in the Columbia-Pacific region for over \n                6,000 years;\n                    (B) developed a wealthy and vibrant culture from \n                the abundance of the Columbia River and the \n                sophisticated trade economy of the people; and\n                    (C) established cultural centers in Chinook, \n                Washington, and Seaside, Oregon;\n            (2) early European explorers, including Heceta, Vitus \n        Bering, Sir Francis Drake, and Captain Cook, began to explore \n        and chart the region in search of the Great River of the West, \n        the last remaining major land feature mapped by Europeans;\n            (3) many people travel from around the world to the \n        Columbia-Pacific region to--\n                    (A) experience the rich historical culture of the \n                region; and\n                    (B) search for new business opportunities in the \n                region;\n            (4) in 1792 Boston-based Captain Robert Gray was the first \n        to bring a sailing ship into the River, naming the River after \n        his ship, the COLUMBIA REDIVIVA;\n            (5) Gray's trip through the Columbia River opened up the \n        River to trade with east coast cities, European countries, and \n        Asian kingdoms;\n            (6) during the 13 years before the Lewis and Clark Corps of \n        Discovery arrived overland, more than 88 ships entered the \n        Columbia River as part of a sophisticated global trade network \n        that became known as the ``Golden Round'', which stimulated the \n        economy of the newly freed colonies and accelerated the \n        development of the international fur trade;\n            (7) ports and communities along the Columbia River continue \n        to support the traditional industries of fishing, seafood \n        processing, timber harvesting, and trade;\n            (8) in 1805 Lewis and Clark, seeking an all water route to \n        the Pacific Ocean for commerce to expand the American claim to \n        the Pacific Ocean, arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River \n        where the group built a fort to spend the winter;\n            (9) the legacy of Lewis and Clark continues to be available \n        to the public at the newly expanded units of the Lewis and \n        Clark National Historical Park;\n            (10) in 1811 John Jacob Astor established a permanent \n        settlement for commerce at the mouth of the Columbia River \n        known as ``Astoria'', which became the first American city west \n        of the Rocky Mountains;\n            (11) Astoria was sold to the Hudson Bay Company and during \n        the period from 1812 to 1828, was a British territory;\n            (12) Astoria was ultimately returned to the United States \n        making Astoria the only city in the United States to become the \n        territory of another country and then revert back to the United \n        States;\n            (13) for several thousand years the approaches to the mouth \n        of the Columbia River have served as the original homeland \n        defense system as the Chinookan people established villages on \n        headlands and promontories of the River in order to watch the \n        traffic entering, leaving, and traveling on the River;\n            (14) with the start of the Civil War, the native villages \n        were replaced with forts operated by the United States Army;\n            (15) the Army forts at Cape Disappointment, Fort Columbia, \n        and Fort Stevens were in continuous operation through the end \n        of World War II;\n            (16) the United States Coast Guard maintains a large \n        homeland security operation through Group Astoria with the Cape \n        Disappointment Motor Lifeboat Station, Astoria Air Station, 2 \n        cutters operating out of Astoria, and the Tongue Point \n        maintenance yard;\n            (17) through the United States Coast Guard operations, the \n        Columbia River continues to serve as the guard post for the \n        protection of international commerce of the largest river \n        transport system on the west coast;\n            (18) the water offshore Clatsop County, Oregon, and Pacific \n        County, Washington, is known as the ``Graveyard of the \n        Pacific'', because thousands of vessels and lives have been \n        lost in the water, with survivors struggling ashore and seeking \n        refuge in the historic beach communities of Cannon Beach, \n        Seaside, Gearhart, Seaview, Long Beach, Ocean Park, and \n        Oysterville;\n            (19) shipwrecks and storm waters are still a threat to \n        commercial and recreational boaters in the area;\n            (20) modern navigation aids include lighthouses, \n        lightships, and lifesaving stations;\n            (21) the United States Coast Guard continues to operate the \n        Cape Disappointment Lifesaving Station and the National Motor \n        Lifeboat School;\n            (22) members of the United States Coast Guard from \n        throughout the United States are sent to the ``Top Gun'' \n        training center to--\n                    (A) challenge some of the most dangerous waters in \n                the world; and\n                    (B) prepare for service at stations throughout the \n                United States;\n            (23) the Columbia River is home to 1 of the most abundant \n        commercial and sport fisheries in the world;\n            (24) for centuries, the people in the Columbia-Pacific \n        region have made a living from the Columbia River, including--\n                    (A) the Chinookan people, who developed a \n                sophisticated and vibrant culture using the resources \n                of the River; and\n                    (B) beginning in the 1840's, American settlers and \n                European and Asian immigrants, who developed a vibrant \n                economy around the salmon fisheries;\n            (25) the communities of Astoria, Warrenton, Hammond, \n        Chinook, and Ilwaco--\n                    (A) have their roots in the development of the \n                early fishing industry; and\n                    (B) continue to support both commercial and sport \n                fisheries that--\n                            (i) provide--\n                                    (I) economic opportunities for \n                                residents;
