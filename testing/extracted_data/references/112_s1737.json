    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Sensible Accounting to Value Energy \nAct of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n            (1) Covered agency.--The term ``covered agency''--\n                    (A) means--\n                            (i) an executive agency, as that term is \n                        defined in section 102 of title 31, United \n                        States Code; and\n                            (ii) any other agency of the Federal \n                        Government; and\n                    (B) includes any enterprise, as that term is \n                defined under section 1303 of the Federal Housing \n                Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 \n                (12 U.S.C. 4502).\n            (2) Covered loan.--The term ``covered loan'' means a loan \n        secured by a home that is issued, insured, purchased, or \n        securitized by a covered agency.\n            (3) Homeowner.--The term ``homeowner'' means the mortgagor \n        under a covered loan.\n            (4) Mortgagee.--The term ``mortgagee'' means--\n                    (A) an original lender under a covered loan or the \n                holder of a covered loan at the time at which that \n                mortgage transaction is consummated;\n                    (B) any affiliate, agent, subsidiary, successor, or \n                assignee of an original lender under a covered loan or \n                the holder of a covered loan at the time at which that \n                mortgage transaction is consummated;\n                    (C) any servicer of a covered loan; and\n                    (D) any subsequent purchaser, trustee, or \n                transferee of any covered loan issued by an original \n                lender.\n            (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Housing and Urban Development.\n            (6) Servicer.--The term ``servicer'' means the person or \n        entity responsible for servicing of a covered loan (including \n        the person or entity who makes or holds such a loan if such \n        person or entity also services the loan).\n            (7) Servicing.--The term ``servicing'' has the meaning \n        given the term in section 6(i) of the Real Estate Settlement \n        Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2605(i)).\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) energy costs for homeowners are a significant and \n        increasing portion of their household budgets;\n            (2) household energy use can vary substantially depending \n        on the size and efficiency of the house;\n            (3) expected energy costs are important to the value of the \n        house;\n            (4) the current test for loan affordability used by most \n        covered agencies, commonly called the ``debt to income'' test, \n        is inadequate because it does not assess the expected energy \n        costs for the homeowner; and\n            (5) another loan limitation, commonly called the ``loan to \n        value'' test, is tied to the appraisal, which often does not \n        adjust for efficiency features of houses.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to improve the accuracy of mortgage underwriting under \n        Federal mortgage agencies by ensuring that energy costs are \n        included in the underwriting process as described below, and \n        thus to reduce the amount of energy consumed by homes and to \n        facilitate the creation of energy efficiency retrofit and \n        construction jobs;\n            (2) to require covered agencies to include the expected \n        energy utility costs of a homeowner as a regular expense in the \n        tests, such as the debt to income test, used to determine the \n        ability of the loan applicant to afford the cost of \n        homeownership for all loan programs;\n            (3) to require covered agencies to include the value of \n        energy savings with the appraised home value in the loan to \n        value metric so that loan amounts can reflect the value home \n        buyers place on the energy efficiency of a house, taking \n        precautions to avoid double-counting and to support safe and \n        sound lending; and\n            (4) to direct the covered agencies to make the necessary \n        credit policy decisions to adjust the maximum permitted debt \n        amounts or debt to income ratios for eligibility to accommodate \n        inclusion of expected energy costs.\n\nSEC. 4. ENHANCED ENERGY EFFICIENCY UNDERWRITING CRITERIA.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Secretary shall develop and issue guidelines for all \ncovered agencies to implement enhanced loan eligibility requirements, \nfor use when testing the ability of a loan applicant to repay a covered \nloan, that account for the expected costs of energy for a loan \napplicant at the subject property, in the manner set forth in \nsubsections (b) and (c).\n    (b) Requirements To Account for Energy Costs.--The enhanced loan \neligibility requirements required under subsection (a) shall include a \nrequirement that for all covered loans, the covered agency and the \nmortgagee shall take into consideration the estimated energy costs \nexpected for the owner of the subject property in determining whether \nthe loan applicant has sufficient income to service the mortgage debt \nplus other regular expenses. To the extent that a covered agency uses a \ntest such as a debt-to-income test that includes certain regular \nexpenses, such as hazard insurance and property taxes, the expected \nenergy costs shall be included as such an expense, and the maximum \npermitted amounts or ratios for eligibility shall be adjusted to \naccommodate the average expected energy costs. Energy costs to be \nassessed include the cost of electricity, natural gas, oil, and any \nother fuel regularly used to supply energy to the subject property.\n    (c) Determination of Estimated Energy Costs.--\n            (1) In general.--The regulations to be issued by the \n        Secretary under subsection (a) shall include instructions for \n        the covered agency to calculate estimated energy costs, using \n        the following approach:\n                    (A) If no energy efficiency report for the subject \n                property, as described under paragraph (2), is provided \n                to the mortgagee, then the mortgagee shall determine \n                the estimated energy costs for the subject property \n                based upon the size of the subject property and an \n                average per square foot energy cost for properties of \n                that building type in that region. The most current \n                version of the Residential Energy Consumption Survey of \n                the Energy Information Administration, as such survey \n                is authorized under section 205(k) of the Department of \n                Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7135(k)), may be \n                used as the basis for the average per square foot \n                energy cost, or the Secretary may approve use of \n                another source.\n                    (B) If an energy efficiency report is provided to \n                the mortgagee, then the findings in such report shall \n                be used in determining the estimated energy costs of \n                the subject property, and shall be provided to the \n                appraiser for use in estimating the energy efficiency \n                of the house and potential adjustments for energy \n                efficiency.\n                    (C) Additional sources of information may be \n                incorporated into the method for determining expected \n                energy costs, as determined by the Secretary.\n            (2) Report requirements.--In order for an energy efficiency \n        report to be valid and acceptable for the purposes of paragraph \n        (1)(B), such report shall--\n                    (A) estimate the expected energy costs specific to \n                the subject property, based on specific information \n                about the property;\n                    (B) be prepared in accordance with rules and \n                guidelines to be issued by the Secretary under \n                subsection (a); and\n                    (C) be prepared--\n                            (i) in accordance with the Residential \n                        Energy Service Network's Home Energy Rating \n                        System (also known as ``HERS'') by an \n                        individual certified by the network, unless the \n                        Secretary finds that such method does not \n                        further the purposes of this Act; or\n                            (ii) by other methods approved by the \n                        Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary \n                        of Energy and other stakeholders, including \n                        State energy offices, for use under this Act, \n                        which in all cases shall include a third-party \n                        quality assurance procedure.\n    (d) Required Disclosure to Consumer.--If an energy efficiency \nreport is used under subsection (c)(1)(B), the rules to be issued by \nthe Secretary under subsection (a) shall require the mortgagee to--\n            (1) inform the loan applicant of the expected energy costs \n        as estimated in the report, in a manner and at a time as \n        prescribed by the Secretary, and if practicable, in the \n        documents delivered at the time of loan application; and\n            (2) include such report in the documentation for the loan \n        provided to the borrower.\n    (e) Limitations.--A covered agency shall not--\n            (1) modify existing underwriting criteria or adopt new \n        underwriting criteria that intentionally negate or reduce the \n        impact of the requirements or resulting benefits that are set \n        forth or otherwise derived from the enhanced loan eligibility \n        requirements required under this section; or\n            (2) impose greater buy back requirements, credit overlays, \n        insurance requirements, including private mortgage insurance, \n        or any other material costs, impediments, or penalties on \n        covered loans merely because the loan uses an energy efficiency \n        report or the enhanced loan eligibility requirements required \n        under this section.\n    (f) Applicability and Implementation Date.--Not later than 3 years \nafter the date of enactment of this Act, and before January 1, 2015, \nthe enhanced loan eligibility requirements required under this section \nshall be implemented by each covered agency to--\n            (1) apply to any covered loan for the sale, or refinancing \n        of any loan for the sale, of any home;\n            (2) be available on any residential real property \n        (including individual units of condominiums and cooperatives) \n        that qualifies for a covered loan; and\n            (3) provide prospective mortgagees with sufficient guidance \n        and applicable tools to implement the required underwriting \n        methods.\n\nSEC. 5. ENHANCED ENERGY EFFICIENCY UNDERWRITING VALUATION GUIDELINES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, in \nconsultation with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination \nCouncil, develop and issue guidelines for how covered agencies shall \ndetermine the maximum permitted loan amount based on the value of the \nproperty for all covered loans made on properties with an energy \nefficiency report as defined in section 4(c)(2). In addition, the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Energy, within one year of enactment of this Act, \nissue regulations for covered agencies to determine the estimated \nenergy savings for properties with an energy efficiency report as \nrequired by subsection (c).\n    (b) Requirements.--The enhanced energy efficiency underwriting \nvaluation guidelines required under subsection (a) shall include the \nfollowing:\n            (1) A requirement that if an energy efficiency report that \n        meets the requirements of section 4(c)(2) is provided to the \n        mortgagee, then such report shall be used by the mortgagee or \n        covered agency to determine the estimated energy savings of the \n        subject property.\n            (2) A requirement that the estimated energy savings of the \n        subject property be added by a mortgagee or covered agency to \n        the appraised value for the purpose of determining the loan-to-\n        value ratio of the subject property, unless the appraisal \n        indicates it includes the value of the overall energy \n        efficiency of the property, using methods to be established by \n        the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in regulations \n        required under subsection (a).\n    (c) Determination of Estimated Energy Savings.--The amount of \nestimated energy savings shall be determined by calculating the \ndifference between the estimated energy costs for the average \ncomparable house, as determined in rules to be issued by the Secretary \nof Housing and Urban Development under subsection (a), and the \nestimated energy costs for the subject property, using the energy \nefficiency report, as determined under section 4(c)(2). The period of \nthe savings shall be based upon the estimated life of the applicable \nequipment, consistent with the rating system used to produce the energy \nreport in section 4(c)(2). The present value of the future savings \nshall be discounted using the average interest rate on conventional 30-\nyear mortgages, in the manner directed by guidelines issued by the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development under subsection (a).\n    (d) Ensuring Consideration of Energy-Efficient Features.--Section \n1110 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement \nAct of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3339), is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (3), by striking the period at the end and \n        inserting ``; and''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(4) that State-certified appraisers have timely access, \n        whenever practicable, to information from the lender relevant \n        to an appraisal of the energy and water efficiency or \n        conserving improvements or features of a property, such as \n        labels or ratings of buildings and installed appliances, \n        blueprints, construction costs, incentives regarding energy- \n        and water-efficient components and systems installed in a \n        property, and third-party verifications or representations of \n        energy and water efficiency performance of a property, \n        observing all financial privacy requirements adhered to by \n        certified and licensed appraisers, including section 501 of the \n        Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6801), unless the property \n        owner consents to the lender, an appraiser shall not have \n        access to the commercial or financial information of the owner \n        that is privileged or confidential.''.\n    (e) Transactions Requiring State Certified Appraisers.--Section \n1113 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement \nAct of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3342), as amended by section 1473(e)(2) of the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, is \namended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting before the semicolon the \n        following: ``, or any real property on which the appraiser \n        makes adjustments using an energy efficiency report''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (2) by inserting after ``atypical'' the \n        following: ``, or an appraisal on which the appraiser makes \n        adjustments using an energy efficiency report.''.\n    (f) Protections.--\n            (1) Authority to impose limitations.--The guidelines to be \n        issued under subsection (a) shall include such limitations and \n        conditions determined by the Secretary to be necessary to \n        protect against meaningful under or over valuation of energy \n        savings or duplicative counting of energy efficiency features \n        or energy savings in the valuation of any subject property used \n        to determine a loan amount.\n            (2) Additional authority.--At the end of the 7-year period \n        following the implementation of the program established under \n        this Act, the Secretary may modify or apply additional \n        exceptions to the approach described in subsection (b), where \n        the Secretary finds that the unadjusted appraisal will reflect \n        an accurate market value of the efficiency of the subject \n        property.\n    (g) Applicability and Implementation Date.--Each covered agency \nshall, within 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and \nbefore January 1, 2015, implement the guidelines required under this \nsection, which shall--\n            (1) apply to any covered loan for the sale, or refinancing \n        of any loan for the sale, of any home; and\n            (2) be available on any residential real property \n        (including individual units of condominiums and cooperatives) \n        that qualifies for a covered loan.\n\nSEC. 6. MONITORING.\n\n    Not later than 1 year after the date on which the enhanced \neligibility and underwriting valuation requirements are implemented \nunder this Act, and each year thereafter, each covered agency with \nrelevant activity shall issue and make available to the public a report \nthat enumerates the number of covered loans of each such agency that \nused enhanced loan eligibility requirements, for which there was an \nenergy efficiency report, and that used enhanced energy efficiency \nappraisal guidelines. Such report shall include the default rates and \nrates of foreclosures for each category of loan.\n\nSEC. 7. RULEMAKING.\n\n    The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this Act, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Energy and stakeholders, including \nState energy offices. Such regulations may contain such \nclassifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide \nfor such proper implementation and appropriate treatment of different \ntypes of transactions, as in the judgment of the Secretary are \nnecessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this Act, to prevent \ncircumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance \ntherewith.\n\nSEC. 8. ADDITIONAL STUDY.\n\n    Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Secretary shall establish an advisory group with the purpose of \nadvising the Secretary on the implementation of the enhanced energy \nefficiency underwriting criteria established in sections 4 and 5. The \nadvisory group shall provide recommendations to the Secretary on any \nrevisions or additions to the enhanced energy efficiency underwriting \ncriteria deemed necessary by the group, which may include additional \nfactors to account for substantial and regular costs of homeownership \nsuch as location-based transportation costs and water costs. The \nSecretary shall forward any legislative recommendations from the \nadvisory group to Congress for its consideration."
