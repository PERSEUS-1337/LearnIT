FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In the United States, there are an estimated 1,181 \n        inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Among these facilities is \n        a small group of inpatient rehabilitation institutions that are \n        contributing to the future of rehabilitation care medicine, as \n        well as to patient recovery, scientific innovation, and quality \n        of life.\n            (2) This unique category of inpatient rehabilitation \n        institutions treats the most complex patient conditions, such \n        as traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, \n        childhood disease, burns, and wartime injuries.\n            (3) These leading inpatient rehabilitation institutions are \n        all not-for-profit or Government-owned institutions and serve a \n        high volume of Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries.\n            (4) These leading inpatient rehabilitation institutions \n        have been recognized by the Federal Government for their \n        contributions to cutting-edge research to develop solutions \n        that enhance quality of care, improve patient outcomes, and \n        reduce health care costs.\n            (5) These leading inpatient rehabilitation institutions \n        help to improve the practice and standard of rehabilitation \n        medicine across the Nation in urban, suburban, and rural \n        communities by training physicians, medical students, and other \n        clinicians, and providing care to patients from all 50 States.\n            (6) It is vital that these leading inpatient rehabilitation \n        institutions are supported so they can continue to lead the \n        Nation's efforts to--\n                    (A) advance integrated, multidisciplinary \n                rehabilitation research;\n                    (B) provide cutting-edge medical care to the most \n                complex rehabilitation patients;\n                    (C) serve as education and training facilities for \n                the physicians, nurses, and other health professionals \n                who serve rehabilitation patients;\n                    (D) ensure Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries \n                receive state-of-the-art, high-quality rehabilitation \n                care by developing and disseminating best practices and \n                advancing the quality of care utilized by post-acute \n                providers in all 50 States; and\n                    (E) support other inpatient rehabilitation \n                institutions in rural areas to help ensure access to \n                quality post-acute care for patients living in these \n                communities.\n\nSEC. 3.
