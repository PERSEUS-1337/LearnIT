FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) International markets are vital to intellectual \n        property industries in the United States, providing a strong \n        export base that sustains jobs in the United States. This \n        sector of the United States economy is threatened due to \n        widespread patent and trademark infringement and the \n        unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and sale of \n        copyrighted works created in the United States.\n            (2) The United States is the world's largest creator, \n        producer, and exporter of copyrighted materials, accounting for \n        more than 5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the \n        United States and adding billions of dollars to the United \n        States economy annually.\n            (3) International markets are vital to creative industries \n        in the United States, providing a strong export base that \n        sustains jobs in the United States. This sector of the United \n        States economy is threatened due to widespread piracy--the \n        unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and sale of works \n        created in the United States.\n            (4) Global piracy affecting the motion picture industry is \n        estimated as amounting to $3,500,000,000 annually, not \n        including illegal downloading. Globally, 2 in 5 music \n        recordings are pirated copies, with annual world-wide sales of \n        pirated music estimated at from $4,000,000,000 to \n        $5,000,000,000. The software industry estimates losses of more \n        than $13,000,000,000 in 2002 due to worldwide piracy.\n            (5) The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has been \n        charged with identifying countries that deny adequate and \n        effective protection of intellectual property rights. The \n        effective use of trade tools by the USTR, including the \n        negotiation of bilateral free trade agreements, serves an \n        essential role in protecting abroad the intellectual property \n        rights of United States persons.\n            (6) The Office of the USTR has more than 20 offices \n        dedicated to specific areas of expertise, but does not include \n        an office solely dedicated to the protection abroad of the \n        intellectual property rights of United States persons. \n        Currently, the Office of the Assistant United States Trade \n        Representative for Services, Investment and Intellectual \n        Property has a substantially large workload, given that \n        services and investment account for more than 50 percent of the \n        United States economy.\n            (7) The USTR's ability to meet its mandate to protect \n        abroad the intellectual property rights of United States \n        persons should be enhanced by establishing a separate office \n        dedicated exclusively to intellectual property matters, headed \n        by an Assistant United States Trade Representative for \n        Intellectual Property Rights. The resources dedicated to \n        securing high standards of protection in trade agreements and \n        enforcing those provisions vigorously should likewise be \n        enhanced.\n\nSEC. 3. ASSISTANT U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \n              RIGHTS.\n\n    Section 141(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2171(c)) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(6)(A) There shall be in the Office the position of Assistant \nUnited States Trade Representative for Intellectual Property Rights. \nThe Assistant United States Trade Representative for Intellectual \nProperty Rights shall be appointed by the United States Trade \nRepresentative.\n    ``(B) The Assistant United States Trade Representative for \nIntellectual Property Rights shall have primary responsibility for--\n            ``(i) intellectual property matters relating to bilateral \n        and multilateral trade agreements, including--\n                    ``(I) enforcement of, and any modifications to, the \n                Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \n                Property Rights referred to in section 101(d)(15) of \n                the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n                3511(d)(15)); and\n                    ``(II) the negotiation and enforcement of \n                intellectual property provisions of any other bilateral \n                or multilateral trade agreement to which the United \n                States is a party;\n            ``(ii) the identification of countries under paragraphs (1) \n        and (2) of section 182(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n        2242(a)(1) and (2)), and any investigations under chapter 1 of \n        title III of that Act (19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.) arising from \n        such identification or other actions of a foreign country \n        described in section 182(a)(1) of that Act; and\n            ``(iii) monitoring the extent to which the trading partners \n        of the United States protect and enforce intellectual property \n        rights of United States persons.\n    ``(C) At least 6 professional staff members shall be assigned to \nassist the Assistant United States Trade Representative for \nIntellectual Property Rights in carrying out his or her functions, of \nwhich 3 shall be assigned to matters relating to enforcement.\n    ``(D) The Assistant United States Trade Representative should \ndirect and coordinate all interagency activities, including in \nconsultation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual \nProperty and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office \nand the Register of Copyrights, on trade-related intellectual property \nmatters and serve as the primary contact in the executive branch for \nall matters described in subparagraph (B).\n    ``(E) The Assistant United States Trade Representative for \nIntellectual Property Rights shall receive compensation at the rate of \npay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule under section 5315 \nof title 5, United States Code.''.\n\nSEC. 4. CONSTRUCTION.\n\n     Nothing in this Act or the amendment made by this Act shall be \nconstrued to limit the powers and duties of the United States Patent \nand Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office."
