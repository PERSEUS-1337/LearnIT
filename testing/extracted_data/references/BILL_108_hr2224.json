In this action--\n                    (A) an entry of default was entered against \n                defendants on September 25, 2002; and\n                    (B) the factual and legal submissions for a \n                judgment by the court, including detailed sworn \n                affidavits as to Iraq's brutal torture, were submitted \n                to the court on March 31, 2003.\n        Those sworn affidavits show shocking brutality directed against \n        the United States prisoners of war by Iraq.\n            (10) The Congress determined, in enacting section \n        1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code, permitting suit \n        against terrorist states for personal injury or death caused by \n        an act of torture, which was the legal basis for this historic \n        action against Iraq by the tortured United States prisoners of \n        war, that substantial civil damages are an important additional \n        deterrent against such acts of torture directed against \n        nationals of the United States.\n            (11) The Republic of Iraq and its agencies, \n        instrumentalities, and controlled entities had approximately \n        $1,730,000,000 in blocked assets in the United States at the \n        start of the Second Gulf War.\n            (12) Those assets were vested by the Executive Order 13290 \n        of March 20, 2003, for the purpose of assisting in the \n        reconstruction of Iraq.\n            (13) Approximately $300,000,000 of the blocked assets were \n        initially set aside for the satisfaction of civil judgments \n        obtained by United States hostages held in Iraq during the \n        First Gulf War, but no amount of the blocked assets was set \n        aside for those plaintiffs who were United States prisoners of \n        war and who, at that time, already had an entry of default \n        against Iraq.\n            (14) The plaintiffs in the historic case against Saddam \n        Hussein and Iraq who were United States prisoners of war have \n        established a nonprofit Foundation for the assistance of United \n        States and Allied prisoners of war and those missing in action \n        and their families, and have pledged to the court that a \n        substantial amount of any noncompensatory damages realized from \n        the case will be donated to the new Foundation.\n            (15) The Republic of Iraq has great national wealth, with \n        proven oil reserves of at least 110,000,000,000 barrels, second \n        only to Saudi Arabia, and 3 times those of the United States, \n        and when its reserves are fully developed they may even exceed \n        those of Saudi Arabia.\n            (16) Other nations have not absolved Iraq of its state \n        obligations under the Third Geneva Convention arising from the \n        First Gulf War and other sources, and the torture and inhuman \n        treatment of United States prisoners of war during the First \n        Gulf War are, in any event, a ``non-absolvable liability'' of \n        the state of Iraq.\n            (17) Iraq has not accounted for one of the United States \n        prisoners of war held by Iraq during the First Gulf War.\n            (18) In the Second Gulf War, Iraq is in violation of the \n        Third Geneva Convention by subjecting United States prisoners \n        of war to coerced propaganda videotapes, and there are \n        disturbing reports of the willful killing and mistreatment of \n        United States prisoners of war by Iraq, violations condemned in \n        Senate Concurrent Resolution 31, which passed on April 9, 2003, \n        by a vote of 99-0, and in House Concurrent Resolution 118, \n        which passed on March 27, 2003, by a vote of 419-0.\n            (19) The United States has a critical national interest in \n        ensuring the protection of United States prisoners of war, \n        enhancing compliance with the Third Geneva Convention, and in \n        taking immediate decisive action that could contribute to the \n        protection of United States prisoners of war.\n\nSEC. 3.
