FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In February 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention released data indicating that--\n                    (A) the occurrence of autism spectrum disorders \n                (ASD) increased between 1996 and 2006 from an estimated \n                1 in 500 to an estimated 1 in 150; and\n                    (B) the behaviors of children who were classified \n                as suffering from ASD were consistent with the DSM-IV-\n                TR criteria for Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, \n                and Pervasive Developmental Disorder--Not Otherwise \n                Specified.\n            (2) Autism is a complex neurological disorder that affects \n        individuals in the areas of social interaction and \n        communication. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, it \n        affects each individual differently and to varying degrees of \n        severity.\n            (3) People afflicted with autism process and respond to \n        information in unique ways. In some cases, coexisting medical \n        issues may be present and aggressive or self-injurious behavior \n        may occur.\n            (4) The increased number of children diagnosed with autism \n        is a growing and urgent concern for families, healthcare \n        professionals, and educators. Health and education systems \n        struggle to respond to the needs of the autistic population in \n        a comprehensive manner.\n            (5) The prevalence of autism in developing countries is \n        growing rapidly. Health and education systems in these \n        countries are particularly ill-equipped to deal with the issues \n        surrounding this growth. According to expert estimates, there \n        are approximately 2,500,000 people with an autism spectrum \n        disorder in China and approximately 2,000,000 with such \n        disorder in India. Although reliable statistics are difficult \n        to come by, a large number of these people are believed to be \n        children.\n            (6) Children with autism who receive intensive and \n        appropriate educational services before 5 years of age often \n        make significant functional improvements. In the United States, \n        significant efforts are being pursued to expand early diagnosis \n        and the provision of these services.\n            (7) In a November 2007 report on the identification, \n        evaluation, and management of children with autism, the \n        American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all children \n        should be screened twice for autism before 2 years of age, even \n        if the children have no recognizable symptoms.\n            (8) Early screening and services for autism are sorely \n        lacking in most of the developing world. United States \n        expertise could be used to significantly aid children and \n        families in developing countries for relatively small costs.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTISM DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``autism'' means all conditions consistent \nwith the autism spectrum disorders described in section 2(1).\n\nSEC. 4.
