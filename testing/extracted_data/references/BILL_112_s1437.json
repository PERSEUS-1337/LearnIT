FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Teenage pregnancy is one of the most critical issues \n        facing the Nation today. The United States has the highest \n        teenage pregnancy rate of any developed nation, with nearly \n        750,000 teenage girls between the ages of 15 and 19 becoming \n        pregnant each year, and 82 percent of those pregnancies \n        unplanned.\n            (2) For the first time in more than a decade, between 2005 \n        and 2006, the teenage pregnancy rate in the United States rose \n        3 percent. The decrease in teenage pregnancy rates in the 1990s \n        was overwhelmingly the result of more and better use of \n        contraceptives.\n            (3) Nationally, teenage pregnancy has significant fiscal \n        implications, costing taxpayers at least $10,900,000,000 \n        annually.\n            (4) Communities of color are disproportionately affected by \n        teenage pregnancy. Fifty-two percent of Latinas and 50 percent \n        of African-American girls will become pregnant at least once \n        before they turn 20. In comparison, only 19 percent of non-\n        Hispanic white teenage girls under the age of 20 become \n        pregnant.\n            (5) Between 2007 and 2009, the teen birth rate decreased \n        for most communities of color, however the birth rates for \n        Hispanic, African-American, and Native American teenagers \n        continue to be much higher than other racial and ethnic groups.\n            (6) Research shows that starting a family too soon may have \n        significant social, educational, and financial impacts on the \n        lives of young people. Less than half of teenage mothers finish \n        high school and less than 2 percent go on to finish college, \n        making it difficult to find and maintain a job.\n            (7) Research also shows that teenage dating violence and \n        abuse are serious public health problems and are associated \n        with higher levels of teenage pregnancy and unplanned \n        pregnancy. Adolescent girls in physically abusive relationships \n        are 3 times more likely to become pregnant than non-abused \n        girls.\n            (8) Promoting and building healthy relationships are \n        fundamental to preventing teenage pregnancies and unplanned \n        pregnancies.\n\nSEC. 3. PROGRAMS TO REDUCE TEENAGE PREGNANCIES.\n\n    Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n            ``PART W--PROGRAMS TO REDUCE TEENAGE PREGNANCIES\n\n``SEC. 399OO.
