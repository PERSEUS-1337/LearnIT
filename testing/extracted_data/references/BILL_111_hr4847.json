FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States and the territories of the United \n        States contain 169 hazardous volcanoes;\n            (2) since 1980, eruptions have claimed many lives and cost \n        billions of dollars in property damage in the United States;\n            (3) ash eruptions pose a hazard to high-flying jet \n        aircraft, including the more than 20,000 passengers who travel \n        on jets over Alaska every day;\n            (4) in 1989, an eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska, caused \n        in-flight failure of all 4 engines of a passenger Boeing 747 \n        aircraft;\n            (5) international flights over the Commonwealth of the \n        Northern Mariana Islands and the intense domestic air traffic \n        of the Pacific Northwest also face potential engine failure in \n        the event of an eruption;\n            (6) mudflows from ice-clad Cascade volcanoes of the States \n        of Washington, Oregon, and California pose a serious hazard to \n        cities and transportation arteries in the Pacific Northwest;\n            (7) lava flows, toxic gas emissions, and explosions impact \n        residents and visitors to Hawaii and have the potential to \n        cause catastrophic property damage;\n            (8) frequent seismic unrest requires careful monitoring in \n        the Mammoth Lakes area of California and Yellowstone National \n        Park in the States of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho;\n            (9) modern technology, in the form of geophysical \n        monitoring networks on the ground and the use of near-real time \n        satellite data, makes possible warnings before eruptions, \n        giving emergency response agencies and the public time to \n        prepare, which minimizes potential damage to property and loss \n        of life;\n            (10) the efficacy of monitoring is being demonstrated by \n        the forecast and subsequent tracking of explosive eruptions of \n        Redoubt Volcano by the Alaska Volcano Observatory, a \n        partnership of the United States Geological Survey, the \n        University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Alaska Division of \n        Geological and Geophysical Surveys;\n            (11) the United States Geological Survey and the university \n        and State partners of the United States Geological Survey \n        operate--\n                    (A) the Alaska Volcano Observatory located in \n                Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska;\n                    (B) the Cascades Volcano Observatory located in \n                Vancouver, Washington;\n                    (C) the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory located in \n                Hawaiian Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii;\n                    (D) the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory located in \n                Yellowstone National Park in the State of Wyoming, \n                Montana, and Idaho; and\n                    (E) the Long Valley Observatory, located in Mammoth \n                Lakes and Menlo Park, California; and\n            (12) a detailed survey of the volcanoes in the United \n        States and the monitoring status of those volcanoes has \n        revealed a serious monitoring gap, leaving the United States \n        exposed to preventable damage from large volcanic eruptions.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United \n        States Geological Survey.\n            (2) System.--The term ``System'' means the National Volcano \n        Early Warning and Monitoring System established under section \n        4(a)(1).\n\nSEC. 4.
