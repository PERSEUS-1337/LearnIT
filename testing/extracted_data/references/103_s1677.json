FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Approximately 40,000,000 people, over 75 percent \n        civilians, died as a result of civil and international wars \n        fought with conventional weapons during the 45 years of the \n        cold war, demonstrating that conventional weapons can in fact \n        be weapons of mass destruction.\n            (2) Conflict has actually increased in the post cold war \n        era, with 26 wars in progress during 1992.\n            (3) War is both a human tragedy and an ongoing economic \n        disaster affecting the entire world, including the United \n        States and its economy, because it decimates both local \n        investment and potential export markets.\n            (4) International trade in conventional weapons increases \n        the risk and impact of war in an already over-militarized \n        world, creating far more costs than benefits for the United \n        States economy through increased United States defense and \n        foreign assistance spending and reduced demand for United \n        States civilian exports.\n            (5) The newly established United Nations Register of \n        Conventional Arms can be an effective first step in support of \n        limitations on the supply of conventional weapons to developing \n        countries and compliance with its reporting requirements by a \n        foreign government can be an integral tool in determining the \n        worthiness of such government for the receipt of United States \n        military assistance and arms transfers.\n            (6) It is in the national security and economic interests \n        of the United States to reduce dramatically the \n        $1,000,000,000,000 that all countries spend on armed forces \n        every year, $200,000,000,000 of which is spent by developing \n        countries, an amount equivalent to 4 times the total bilateral \n        and multilateral foreign assistance such countries receive \n        every year.\n            (7) According to the Congressional Research Service, the \n        United States supplies more conventional weapons to developing \n        countries than all other countries combined, averaging \n        $15,600,000,000 a year in agreements to supply such weapons to \n        developing countries since the end of the cold war, compared to \n        $7,000,000,000 a year in such agreements prior to the \n        dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n            (8) In recent years the vast majority of United States arms \n        transfers to developing countries are to countries with an \n        undemocratic form of government whose citizens, according to \n        the Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights \n        Practices do not have the ability to peaceably change their \n        form of government.\n            (9) Although a goal of United States foreign policy should \n        be to work with foreign governments and international \n        organizations to reduce militarization and dictatorship and \n        therefore prevent conflicts before they arise, during 3 recent \n        deployments of United States Armed Forces--to the Republic of \n        Panama, the Persian Gulf, and Somalia--such Armed Forces faced \n        conventional weapons that had been provided or financed by the \n        United States to undemocratic governments.\n            (10) The proliferation of conventional arms and conflicts \n        around the globe are multilateral problems, and the fact that \n        the United States has emerged as the world's primary seller of \n        conventional weapons, combined with the world leadership role \n        of the United States, signifies that the United States is in a \n        position to seek multilateral restraints on the competition for \n        and transfers of conventional weapons.\n            (11) Congress has the constitutional responsibility to \n        participate with the executive branch in decisions to provide \n        military assistance and arms transfers to a foreign government, \n        and in the formulation of a policy designed to reduce \n        dramatically the level of international militarization.\n            (12) A decision to provide military assistance and arms \n        transfers to a government that is undemocratic, does not \n        adequately protect human rights, is currently engaged in acts \n        of armed aggression, or is not fully participating in the \n        United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, should require a \n        higher level of scrutiny than does a decision to provide such \n        assistance and arms transfers to a government to which these \n        conditions do not apply.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide clear policy guidelines and \ncongressional responsibility for determining the eligibility of foreign \ngovernments to be considered for United States military assistance and \narms transfers.\n\nSEC. 4.
