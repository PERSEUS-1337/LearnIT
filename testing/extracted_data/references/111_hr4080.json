    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act of \n2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A total of 2,200,000 American adults are incarcerated \n        in State and local prisons and jails, a rate of about 1 out of \n        every 100 adults.\n            (2) State spending on corrections has increased over the \n        last 20 years from approximately $12,600,000,000 in 1988 to \n        more than $52,000,000,000 in 2008. According to ``Public \n        Safety, Public Spending: Forecasting America's Prison \n        Population 2007-2011'', State and Federal prison populations \n        are expected to increase by 192,000 over that 5-year period, at \n        an additional cost of $27,500,000,000.\n            (3) Between 2000 and 2008, jail populations increased from \n        approximately 621,000 to 785,000 inmates. The 3,300 jails \n        nationwide process approximately 13,500,000 inmates each year, \n        4,000,000 of whom are repeat offenders.\n            (4) The number of persons on probation and parole in State \n        correctional systems has been increasing. Approximately \n        5,000,000 Americans, or 1 out of every 45 adults, are on \n        probation or parole, an increase of nearly 300 percent since \n        1980.\n            (5) Policymakers have insufficient access to detailed, \n        data-driven explanations about changes in crime, arrest, \n        conviction, and prison and jail population trends.\n            (6) In the face of ever-increasing correctional costs, with \n        bipartisan leadership, governors and legislative leaders in \n        Texas, Kansas, Rhode Island, Vermont, and other States around \n        the country have initiated data-driven criminal justice \n        reinvestment strategies that increase public safety, hold \n        offenders accountable, and control corrections spending.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE AND DEFINITION.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide grants for \ncriminal justice reinvestment strategies.\n    (b) Criminal Justice Reinvestment.--In this Act, the term \n``criminal justice reinvestment'' refers to a data-driven program \nthat--\n            (1) analyzes criminal justice trends to understand what \n        factors are driving the growth in prison and jail populations;\n            (2) develops and implements policy options to manage the \n        growth in corrections populations and increase the \n        effectiveness of current spending and investment to increase \n        public safety and improve individual and system accountability; \n        and\n            (3) measures the impact of the policy changes and \n        reinvestment resources and holds policymakers accountable for \n        projected results.\n\nSEC. 4.
