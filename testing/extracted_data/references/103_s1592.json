FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Federal legislation and regulatory requirements impose \n        burdens on State and local resources to implement federally \n        mandated programs without fully evaluating the costs to State \n        and local governments associated with compliance with those \n        requirements and oftentimes without provision of adequate \n        Federal financial assistance. Such Federal legislative and \n        regulatory initiatives--\n                    (A) force State and local governments to utilize \n                scarce public resources to comply with Federal \n                mandates;\n                    (B) prevent these resources from being available to \n                meet local needs; and\n                    (C) detract from the ability of State and local \n                governments to establish local priorities for use of \n                local public resources.\n            (2) Federal legislation and regulatory programs can result \n        in inefficient utilization of economic resources, thereby \n        reducing the pool of resources available--\n                    (A) to enhance productivity, and increase the \n                quantity and quality of goods and services produced by \n                the American economy; and\n                    (B) to enhance international competitiveness.\n            (3) In implementing Congressional policy, Federal agencies \n        should, consistent with the requirements of Federal law, seek \n        to implement statutory requirements, to the maximum extent \n        feasible, in a manner that minimizes--\n                    (A) the inefficient allocation of economic \n                resources;\n                    (B) the burden that such requirements impose on use \n                of local public resources by State and local \n                governments; and\n                    (C) the adverse economic effects of such \n                regulations on productivity, economic growth, full \n                employment, creation of productive jobs, and \n                international competitiveness of American goods and \n                services.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) assist Congress in consideration of proposed \n        legislation establishing or revising Federal programs so as to \n        assure that, to the maximum extent practicable, legislation \n        enacted by Congress will--\n                    (A) minimize the burden of such legislation on \n                expenditure of scarce local public resources by State \n                and local governments;\n                    (B) minimize inefficient allocation of economic \n                resources; and\n                    (C) reduce the adverse effect of such legislation--\n                            (i) on the ability of State and local \n                        governmental entities to use local public \n                        resources to meet local needs and to establish \n                        local priorities for local public resources; \n                        and\n                            (ii) on allocation of economic resources, \n                        productivity, economic growth, full employment, \n                        creation of productive jobs, and international \n                        competitiveness; and\n            (2) require Federal agencies to exercise discretionary \n        authority and to implement statutory requirements in a manner \n        that, consistent with fulfillment of each agency's mission and \n        with the requirements of other laws, minimizes the impact \n        regulations affecting the economy have on--\n                    (A) the ability of State and local governmental \n                entities to use local public resources to meet local \n                needs; and\n                    (B) the allocation of economic resources, \n                productivity, economic growth, full employment, \n                creation of productive jobs, and international \n                competitiveness of American goods and services.\n\n                      TITLE I--LEGISLATIVE REFORM\n\nSEC. 101.
