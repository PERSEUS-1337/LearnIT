The certified access specialist shall provide consultation to the local agency, permit applicants, and members of the public on compliance with state construction-related accessibility standards with respect to inspections of a place of public accommodation that relate to permitting, plan checks, or new construction, including, but not limited to, inspections relating to tenant improvements that may impact access.

A CASp inspection pursuant to subdivision (a) by a building inspector who is a certified access specialist shall be treated equally for legal and evidentiary purposes as an inspection conducted by a private CASp.

The remaining moneys shall be placed by the city, county, or city and county in a special fund established by the city, county, or city and county, to be known as the \u201cCASp Certification and Training Fund.\u201d The fees collected in a CASp Certification and Training Fund shall be used for increased certified access specialist training and certification in that local jurisdiction and to facilitate compliance with construction-related accessibility requirements. The highest priority shall be given to the training and retention of certified access specialists to meet the needs of the public in the jurisdiction as provided in Section 55.53 of the Civil Code.\n(c) On and after January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019, the remaining 10 percent of all fees collected under this section, and on and after January 1, 2020, the remaining 30 percent of all fees collected under this section, shall be transmitted on a quarterly basis to the Division of the State Architect for deposit in the Disability Access and Education Revolving Fund established under Sections 4465 and 4470.
