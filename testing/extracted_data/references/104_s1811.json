FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the beach, shore, and coastal resources of the United \n        States--\n                    (A) are critical assets that must be protected, \n                conserved, and restored; and\n                    (B) provide economic and environmental benefits \n                that are of national significance;\n            (2) a network of healthy and nourished beaches is essential \n        to the economy, competitiveness in world tourism, and safety of \n        coastal communities of the United States;\n            (3)(A) the coasts of the United States are an economic \n        asset, supporting 34 percent of national employment, or \n        28,000,000 jobs; and\n            (B) the 413 coastal communities of the United States \n        generate $1,300,000,000,000, or \\1/3\\, of the gross domestic \n        product;\n            (4)(A) travel and tourism--\n                    (i) is the second largest sector of the economy of \n                the United States; and\n                    (ii) contributed over $746,000,000,000 to the gross \n                domestic product in 1995;\n            (B) the health of the beaches and shoreline of the United \n        States contributes to this economic benefit, since the leading \n        tourist destinations in the United States are beaches; and\n            (C) 85 percent of all tourism-generated revenue in the \n        United States derives from coastal communities;\n            (5)(A) the value of the coastline of the United States lies \n        not only in the jobs and revenue that the coastline generates, \n        but also in the families, homes, and businesses that the \n        coastline protects from hurricanes, typhoons, and tropical and \n        extratropical storms;\n            (B) almost 50 percent of the total United States population \n        lives in coastal communities; and\n            (C) beaches provide protection to prevent the destruction \n        of life and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of property;\n            (6) shoreline protection projects can provide ecological \n        and environmental benefits by providing for, or by restoring, \n        marine and littoral habitat;\n            (7)(A) the coastline of the United States is a national \n        treasure, visited by millions of Americans and foreign tourists \n        every year;\n            (B) over 90,000,000 Americans spend time boating or fishing \n        along the coast each year; and\n            (C) the average American spends 10 recreational days per \n        year on the coast; and\n            (8) since shoreline protection projects generate positive \n        economic, recreational, and environmental outcomes that benefit \n        the United States as a whole, Federal responsibility for \n        preserving this valuable resource should be maintained.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for a Federal \nrole in shore protection projects, including projects involving the \nreplacement of sand, for which the economic and ecological benefits to \nthe locality, region, or Nation exceed the costs.\n\nSEC. 3. SHORE PROTECTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The first section of the Act entitled ``An Act \nauthorizing Federal participation in the cost of protecting the shores \nof publicly owned property'', approved August 13, 1946 (33 U.S.C. \n426e), is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)--\n                    (A) by striking ``damage to the shores'' and \n                inserting ``damage to the shores and beaches''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``the following provisions'' and \n                all that follows through the period at the end and \n                inserting the following: ``this Act, to promote shore \n                protection projects and related research that encourage \n                the protection, restoration, and enhancement of sandy \n                beaches, including beach restoration and periodic beach \n                nourishment, on a comprehensive and coordinated basis \n                by the Federal Government, States, localities, and \n                private enterprises.
