FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 system is \n        designed--\n                    (A) to ensure universal access for individuals in \n                need of employment and training systems; and\n                    (B) to equip workers with those skills that \n                contribute to lifelong education.\n            (2) The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 system is designed \n        to recognize and reinforce the link between economic \n        development and workforce development to meet the joint demands \n        of employers and workers.\n            (3) The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 system should \n        address the ongoing shortage of essential skills in the United \n        States workforce in sectors with economic growth to ensure the \n        United States remains competitive in the global economy.\n            (4) Immigrants accounted for over 50 percent of the growth \n        in the civilian workforce between 1990 and 2001, and assuming \n        today's levels of immigration remain constant, immigrants will \n        account for half of the growth in the working age population \n        between 2006 and 2015.\n            (5) The growth of the United States workforce and the \n        competitiveness of the United States economy is directly linked \n        to immigrants, some of whom are limited English proficient.\n            (6) The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 system may be \n        significantly strengthened by funding the development of an \n        employer centered integrated workforce training program for \n        adults with limited English proficiency, taking into account \n        the needs of the local and regional economy and the linguistic, \n        social, and cultural characteristics of the individual.\n\nSEC. 3.
