FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) United States border security agencies are presently \n        overwhelmed with more than 400 million visits across our \n        borders each year and safeguards need to be put in place to \n        make our borders more secure.\n            (2) Current border entry and exit systems are woefully \n        inadequate and the provisions included in the USA PATRIOT Act \n        will greatly enhance the Nation's border security so that \n        Americans know with greater certainty who is entering and \n        exiting the United States.\n            (3) Most of the nineteen terrorists who hijacked planes and \n        attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, are believed \n        to have entered the United States with approved visas and had \n        not been identified by the Immigration and Naturalization \n        Service as being in violation of the terms of their visa.\n            (4) Afghanistan harbors terrorist organizations and is host \n        to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network.\n            (5) Terrorist organizations are operating in Algeria, \n        Lebanon, Somalia, and the United Arab Emirates, and their \n        members pose a threat to the people of the United States.\n            (6) Terrorist organizations continue to secretly operate in \n        Egypt and six of the individuals on the Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation's most wanted terrorists list are Egyptians \n        wanted in connection with attacks on the United States.\n            (7) An Egyptian, Mohamed Atta, believed to be the organizer \n        of the September 11, 2001, attacks, was able to enter and exit \n        the United States several times prior to the attacks despite \n        being on our Nation's terrorist watch list.\n            (8) Nearly half of the nineteen terrorists who hijacked \n        planes on September 11, 2001, were citizens of Saudi Arabia and \n        entered the United States on approved visas.\n            (9) Most of the suspects in the June 25, 1996, bombing on \n        United States Air Force Khobar Towers barracks at Dhahran Air \n        Base in Saudi Arabia are citizens of Saudi Arabia.\n            (10) The United States Department of State has designated \n        Yemen a haven for terrorists and operatives of Osama bin Laden \n        operating in Yemen were responsible for the 1999 attack on the \n        USS Cole which killed 17 and injured 39 United States sailors.\n\nSEC. 3.
