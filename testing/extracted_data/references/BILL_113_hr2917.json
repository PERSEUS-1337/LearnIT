FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The personal savings rate reached historic lows in the \n        past decade, and a lack of personal savings was a major \n        contributor to the depth and severity of the recession of 2007-\n        2009.\n            (2) Households continue to lack the savings or structures \n        to meet short-term and long-term needs, as evidenced by the \n        following:\n                    (A) According to the Employee Benefit Research \n                Institute, among full-time, full-year wage and salary \n                workers ages 21-64, only 54.5 per cent participated in \n                a retirement plan in 2010.\n                    (B) According to the Federal Deposit Insurance \n                Corporation's 2011 Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked \n                Households, an estimated 8.2 percent of United States \n                households, approximately 10 million households, are \n                unbanked. These households do not have a checking or \n                savings account. In total, 29.3 percent of households \n                do not have a savings account.\n                    (C) More than 1 in 4 American households lives in \n                ``asset poverty'', meaning they lack the savings or \n                other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to \n                what could be purchased with a poverty level income) \n                for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads \n                to loss of income. If assets that cannot easily be \n                converted to cash, are excluded, such as a home or a \n                business, as many as 4 in 10 households live in \n                ``liquid asset poverty'', meaning they lack the cash \n                savings to survive three months at the poverty line.\n            (3) Savings make families more resilient to financial \n        shocks and more upwardly mobile, as evidenced by the following:\n                    (A) Even small sums of savings, $2,000 or less, \n                have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence \n                of negative financial or material outcomes, such as \n                foregoing adequate nutrition.\n                    (B) Children born to low-income, high saving \n                parents are much more likely (71 percent) to move up \n                the economic ladder than children born to low-income, \n                low-saving parents (50 percent) over a generation.\n            (4) Successful pilot programs have been run in cities as \n        diverse as Houston, Texas; Newark, New Jersey; New York City, \n        New York; San Antonio, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma. These \n        programs, run through Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites \n        serving only a fraction of potentially eligible tax filers in \n        each city, have shown that tax filers with low incomes can and \n        will save when presented with the right incentive at the right \n        moment.\n            (5) It is in the economic interests of the United States to \n        promote savings among all members of society, regardless of \n        income.\n\nSEC. 3.
