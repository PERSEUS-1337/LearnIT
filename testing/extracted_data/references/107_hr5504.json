    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as ``Anton's Law''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) It is the policy of the Department of Transportation that \n    all child occupants of motor vehicles, regardless of seating \n    position, be appropriately restrained in order to reduce the \n    incidence of injuries and fatalities resulting from motor vehicle \n    crashes on the streets, roads, and highways.\n        (2) Research has shown that very few children between the ages \n    of 4 to 8 years old are in the appropriate restraint for their age \n    when riding in passenger motor vehicles.\n        (3) Children who have outgrown their child safety seats should \n    ride in a belt-positioning booster seat until an adult seat belt \n    fits properly.\n        (4) Children who were properly restrained when riding in \n    passenger motor vehicles suffered less severe injuries from \n    accidents than children not properly restrained.\n\nSEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF SAFETY OF CHILD RESTRAINTS IN PASSENGER MOTOR \n              VEHICLES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation (hereafter \nreferred to as the ``Secretary'') shall initiate a rulemaking \nproceeding to establish performance requirements for child restraints, \nincluding booster seats, for the restraint of children weighing more \nthan 50 pounds.\n    (b) Elements for Consideration.--In the rulemaking proceeding \nrequired by subsection (a), the Secretary shall--\n        (1) consider whether to include injury performance criteria for \n    child restraints, including booster seats and other products for \n    use in passenger motor vehicles for the restraint of children \n    weighing more than 50 pounds, under the requirements established in \n    the rulemaking proceeding;\n        (2) consider whether to establish performance requirements for \n    seat belt fit when used with booster seats and other belt guidance \n    devices;\n        (3) consider whether to address situations where children \n    weighing more than 50 pounds only have access to seating positions \n    with lap belts, such as allowing tethered child restraints for such \n    children; and\n        (4) review the definition of the term ``booster seat'' in \n    Federal motor vehicle safety standard No. 213 under section 571.213 \n    of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, to determine if it is \n    sufficiently comprehensive.\n    (c) Completion.--The Secretary shall complete the rulemaking \nproceeding required by subsection (a) not later than 30 months after \nthe date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT OF ANTHROPOMORPHIC TEST DEVICE SIMULATING A 10-YEAR \n              OLD CHILD.\n\n    (a) Development and Evaluation.--Not later than 24 months after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall develop and \nevaluate an anthropomorphic test device that simulates a 10-year old \nchild for use in testing child restraints used in passenger motor \nvehicles.\n    (b) Adoption by Rulemaking.--Within 1 year following the \ndevelopment and evaluation carried out under subsection (a), the \nSecretary shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding for the adoption of an \nanthropomorphic test device as developed under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 5. REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTALLATION OF LAP AND SHOULDER BELTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 24 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall complete a rulemaking \nproceeding to amend Federal motor vehicle safety standard No. 208 under \nsection 571.208 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, relating to \noccupant crash protection, in order to--\n        (1) require a lap and shoulder belt assembly for each rear \n    designated seating position in a passenger motor vehicle with a \n    gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less, except that \n    if the Secretary determines that installation of a lap and shoulder \n    belt assembly is not practicable for a particular designated \n    seating position in a particular type of passenger motor vehicle, \n    the Secretary may exclude the designated seating position from the \n    requirement; and\n        (2) apply that requirement to passenger motor vehicles in \n    phases in accordance with subsection (b).\n    (b) Implementation Schedule.--The requirement prescribed under \nsubsection (a)(1) shall be implemented in phases on a production year \nbasis beginning with the production year that begins not later than 12 \nmonths after the end of the year in which the regulations are \nprescribed under subsection (a). The final rule shall apply to all \npassenger motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 \npounds or less that are manufactured in the third production year of \nthe implementation phase-in under the schedule.\n\nSEC. 6. EVALUATION OF INTEGRATED CHILD SAFETY SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) Evaluation.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall initiate an evaluation of \nintegrated or built-in child restraints and booster seats. The \nevaluation should include--\n        (1) the safety of the child restraint and correctness of fit \n    for the child;\n        (2) the availability of testing data on the system and vehicle \n    in which the child restraint will be used;\n        (3) the compatibility of the child restraint with different \n    makes and models;\n        (4) the cost-effectiveness of mass production of the child \n    restraint for consumers;\n        (5) the ease of use and relative availability of the child \n    restraint to children riding in motor vehicles; and\n        (6) the benefits of built-in seats for improving compliance \n    with State child occupant restraint laws.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on Energy \nand Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report of this \nevaluation.\n\nSEC. 7.
