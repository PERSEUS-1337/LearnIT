SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) children are dependent on the adults in their lives, \n        including parents, extended family, teachers, health care \n        providers, and others in their community, to ensure their \n        safety and well-being;\n            (2) data from the Administration on Children and Families \n        for 2012 indicate that 678,810 children in the United States \n        were reported as being victims of child abuse or neglect, and \n        11,539 of those children died as a result of such abuse or \n        neglect;\n            (3) regardless of whether an adult is legally required to \n        report child abuse and neglect, every adult who suspects or \n        knows about child abuse or neglect has a moral duty to report \n        such concerns to the appropriate authorities; and\n            (4) establishing a Federal standard for the classes of \n        individuals that State law establishes as mandated reporters \n        will protect children and ensure greater consistency among the \n        laws of States, while allowing States the flexibility to \n        establish additional classes of individuals as mandated \n        reporters.\n\nSEC. 3.
