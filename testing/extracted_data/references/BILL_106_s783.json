FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are \n        facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly weaponry, \n        body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;\n            (2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the \n        interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;\n            (3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise \n        affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls \n        over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to \n        control this traffic within their own borders through the \n        exercise of their police power;\n            (4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco \n        Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers of \n        body armor and a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, \n        California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects \n        outfitted in body armor, demonstrate the serious threat to \n        community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor during \n        the commission of a violent crime;\n            (5) of the approximately 1,200 officers killed in the line \n        of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been saved \n        by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times \n        higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;\n            (6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent \n        of State and local police are not issued body armor;\n            (7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local \n        police departments access to body armor that is no longer \n        needed by Federal agencies; and\n            (8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n        clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n        States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce \n        that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.\n\nSEC. 3.

AMENDMENT OF SENTENCING GUIDELINES WITH RESPECT TO BODY ARMOR.\n\n    (a) Sentencing Enhancement.--The United States Sentencing \nCommission shall amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to provide an \nappropriate sentencing enhancement, increasing the offense level not \nless than 2 levels, for any offense in which the defendant used body \narmor.\n    (b) Applicability.--No amendment made to the Federal Sentencing \nGuidelines pursuant to this section shall apply if the Federal offense \nin which the body armor is used constitutes a violation of, attempted \nviolation of, or conspiracy to violate the civil rights of any person \nby a law enforcement officer acting under color of the authority of \nsuch law enforcement officer.\n\nSEC. 5.
