Increasing use of coastal and marine resources is driving proposals for Congress and the Administration to alter current relationships between environmental protection and sustainable resource management. Recent reports note declines in marine resources and shortcomings in what are perceived as fragmented and limited approaches to resource protection and management in federal and state waters. A further concern is the increasing pressures and conflicts that arise from economic activity associated with continued human population growth in coastal areas. A common concern is habitat loss or alteration, due both to natural processes, such as climate variation, and to development, changes in land management practices, competition from invasive species, and other factors, nearly all related to economic, political, or social interests. Congress faces the issue of how to balance these diverse interests (which may fall on various sides of any given controversy) while promoting the sustainable management of fishery and other marine resources and protection of the marine environment. Congress last reauthorized and extensively amended the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) in the 109 th Congress ( P.L. 109-479 ); the current funding authorization expires on September 30, 2013. The Marine Mammal Protection Act was last reauthorized in 1994 by P.L. 103-238 , and funding authorization expired on September 30, 1999. Historically, coastal states managed marine sport and commercial fisheries in nearshore waters, where most seafood was caught. However, as fishing techniques improved, fishermen ventured farther offshore. Before 1950, the federal government assumed limited responsibility for marine fisheries, responding primarily to international fishery concerns and treaties (by enacting implementing legislation for treaties, e.g., the Northern Pacific Halibut Act in 1937) as well as to interstate fishery conflicts (by consenting to interstate fishery compacts, e.g., the Pacific Marine Fisheries Compact in 1947). In the late 1940s and early 1950s, several Latin American nations proclaimed marine jurisdictions extending 200 miles or further offshore. This action was denounced by those within the United States and other distant-water fishing nations who sought to preserve access for far-ranging fishing vessels. Beginning in the 1950s (Atlantic) and 1960s (Pacific), increasing numbers of foreign fishing vessels steamed into U.S. offshore waters to catch the substantially unexploited seafood resources. Since the United States then claimed only a 3-mile jurisdiction (in 1964, P.L. 88-308 prohibited fishing by foreign-flag vessels within 3 miles of the coast; in 1966, P.L. 89-658 proclaimed an expanded 12-mile exclusive U.S. fishery jurisdiction), foreign vessels could fish many of the same stocks caught by U.S. fishermen. U.S. fishermen deplored this \"foreign encroachment\" and alleged that overfishing was causing stress on, or outright depletion of, fish stocks. Protracted Law of the Sea Treaty negotiations in the early and mid-1970s as well as actions by other coastal nations provided impetus for unilateral U.S. action. The enactment of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act (FCMA); later renamed the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and more recently the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801 et seq.), ushered in a new era of federal marine fishery management. The FCMA was signed into law on April 13, 1976, after several years of debate. On March 1, 1977, marine fishery resources within 200 miles of all U.S. coasts, but outside state jurisdiction, came under federal jurisdiction, and an entirely new multifaceted regional management system began allocating fishing rights, with priority given to domestic enterprise. Primary federal management authority was vested in the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS, also popularly referred to as NOAA Fisheries) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The 200-mile fishery conservation zone was superseded by a 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), proclaimed by President Reagan on March 10, 1983 (Presidential Proclamation 5030). Eight Regional Fishery Management Councils were created by the FCMA. Council members are appointed by the Secretary of Commerce from lists of candidates knowledgeable about fishery resources, provided by coastal state governors. The councils prepare fishery management plans (FMPs) for those fisheries that they determine require active federal management. After public hearings, revised FMPs are submitted to the Secretary of Commerce for approval. Approved plans are implemented through regulations published in the Federal Register . Together these councils and NMFS have developed and implemented 40 FMPs for various fish and shellfish resources, with 9 additional plans in various stages of development. Some plans are created for an individual species or a few related ones (e.g., FMPs for red drum by the South Atlantic Council and for shrimp by the Gulf of Mexico Council). Others are developed for larger species assemblages inhabiting similar habitats (e.g., FMPs for Gulf of Alaska groundfish by the North Pacific Council and for reef fish by the Gulf of Mexico Council). Many of the implemented plans have been amended (one over 30 times), and three have been developed and implemented jointly by two or more councils. The MSFCMA was reauthorized in the final hours of the 109 th Congress by P.L. 109-479 , the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006. The authorization of appropriations in Section 7 of the act expires at the end of FY2013. Today, individual states manage marine fisheries in inshore and coastal waters, generally within 3 miles of the coast. Interstate coordination occurs through three regional interstate marine fishery commissions (Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific) created by congressionally approved compacts. Beyond state waters, out to 200 miles, the federal government manages fish and shellfish resources for which FMPs have been developed under the MSFCMA. Individual states manage fishermen operating state-registered vessels under state regulations consistent with any existing federal FMP when fishing in inshore state waters and, in the absence of a federal FMP, wherever they fish. Under initial FCMA authority, a substantial portion of the fish catch from federal offshore waters was allocated to foreign fishing fleets. However, the 1980 American Fisheries Promotion Act (Title II of P.L. 96-561 ) and other FCMA amendments orchestrated a decrease in foreign catch allocations as domestic fishing and processing industries expanded. Foreign catch from the U.S. EEZ declined from about 3.8 billion pounds in 1977 to zero since 1992. Commensurate with the decline of foreign catch, domestic offshore catch in federal EEZ waters increased dramatically, from about 1.6 billion pounds (1977) to more than 6.3 billion pounds in 1986-1988. Since this peak, annual landings have hovered around 6 billion pounds ( Figure 1 ). In 2009, U.S. commercial fishermen landed slightly more than 6.0 billion pounds of edible, unprocessed fish and shellfish from combined state, federal, and international waters, worth more than $3.7 billion at the dock. Imports of mostly processed products supplied 5.2 billion pounds, worth $13.1 billion. U.S. consumers spent an estimated $75.5 billion on edible seafood in 2009, with $50.3 billion of that amount spent in restaurants and other food service establishments. In addition, marine recreational anglers caught an estimated 391 million fish in 2009, of which the retained catch was about 212 million pounds. In 2006, a nationwide survey estimated that recreational anglers spent more than $40 billion each year pursuing their sport. NMFS reports annually on the status of fish stocks managed under the MSFCMA. For 2009, NMFS made determinations for 250 fish stocks and complexes, finding that 38 (15%) of them were subject to overfishing and 212 (85%) were not. In addition, NMFS made determinations for 203 stocks and complexes, finding that 46 (23%) were overfished and 157 (77%) were not. These numbers reflect a slight decline in the overfishing percentage compared to 2008 (when 16% were subject to overfishing) as well as a stable overfished percentage compared to that year (when 23% were overfished). In addition, NMFS developed a Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI) in 2005 as a performance measure to evaluate progress nationwide in addressing overfishing. Out of a possible maximum FSSI of 920, this index of success in curbing overfishing has increased from 481.5 (third quarter of calendar year 2005) to 580.5 (second quarter of calendar year 2010). The MSFCMA was reauthorized in the 109 th Congress in 2006 by P.L. 109-479 , the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006. Some of the major issues addressed by this comprehensive measure included modifying requirements for the appointment and training of members of regional councils as well as the conduct of business by regional council committees and panels to enhance transparency of the regional council process; setting a firm deadline to end overfishing by 2011 and modifying how depleted fisheries are to be rebuilt; increasing the consideration of economic and social impacts in fishery management; modifying research programs and improving data collection and management; increasing protection for deep sea corals and bottom habitat; implementing a pilot program of ecosystem-based management; promoting new gear technologies to further reduce bycatch; establishing national guidelines for individual fishing quota (limited access privilege) programs; modifying regional council fishery management plan procedures, including better coordinating environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321, et seq.); and strengthening the role of science in fishery management decision-making. NMFS has summarized various tasks associated with implementing P.L. 109-479 . On January 13, 2009, NMFS released its first report to Congress on implementing Title IV of P.L. 109-479 , relating to better control of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. On January 15, 2009, NMFS issued final guidance amending the guidelines for National Standard 1, designed to end overfishing in response to provisions in P.L. 109-479 providing new requirements for annual catch limits and other accountability measures. Section 602 of P.L. 111-281 amended the American Fisheries Act to modify provisions for vessel rebuilding and replacement, vessel exemptions, and fishery cooperative exemptions. P.L. 111-335 authorized a single fisheries cooperative for the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands longline catcher processor subsector for Pacific cod. P.L. 111-348 amended the MSFCMA to (1) modify language related to prohibiting shark finning, and (2) allow the United States-Canada Transboundary Resource Sharing Understanding to be considered an international agreement to create an exemption allowing federal fisheries managers to extend stock rebuilding deadlines for certain New England fisheries. On October 27, 2009, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held an oversight hearing on implementation of the MSFCMA. The House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held two hearings on catch shares (1) as a fishery management option (March 16, 2010) and (2) regarding the community perspective (April 22, 2010). In addition, the 111 th Congress considered several bills that would have amended the MSFCMA: H.R. 1584 and S. 1255 would have amended the MSFCMA to extend the authorized time period for rebuilding certain overfished populations. S. 3594 and H.R. 6316 would have amended the MSFCMA to (1) modify conditions under which certain fish may be harvested in a multispecies fishery where other species are overfished, (2) establish an economic assistance program for recreational and commercial fishery participants, fishing industries, and fishing communities significantly affected by a prohibition on the retention of stocks to end or prevent overfishing or rebuild overfished stocks, (3) clarify emergency authority, and (4) require additional fishery studies and reports. H.R. 3307 and S. 3046 would have directed the Secretary of Commerce to study the South Atlantic red snapper fishery and limited the Secretary's authority to promulgate any interim rule that prohibits fishing in this fishery. H.R. 4723 and S. 3045 would have directed the Secretary of Commerce to study the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery and limited the Secretary's authority to promulgate any interim rule that prohibits fishing in this fishery. Section 704 of H.R. 3534 would have prohibited regional fishery management councils from implementing offshore aquaculture through fishery management plans and their amendments and invalidated any such action already taken. On September 16-17, 2009, and June 30, 2010, the House Committee on Natural Resources held hearings on this measure. On July 28, 2010, the House Committee on Natural Resources reported (amended) this measure ( H.Rept. 111-575 ). The House passed this measure on July 30, 2010, after amending this bill to remove the aquaculture provision. H.R. 4634 would have limited the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to implement certain fishery closures unless the Secretary certified that closure is the only option available for maintaining a fishery at a sustainable level. H.R. 5668 would have amended the MSFCMA to require sums received as fines, penalties, and forfeitures of property for violations of that act or other marine resource laws to be used to reduce the federal deficit and debt. H.R. 6075 would have amended the MSFCMA to require payment of costs, fees, and expenses incurred by prevailing parties in proceedings under the MSFCMA from sums received as fines, penalties, and forfeitures. H.R. 5155 would have prohibited the Secretary of Commerce from regulating incidental fisheries by catch until a report on aerial assessment of sea turtle populations was submitted to Congress. S. 918 / H.R. 3270 would have amended the MSFCMA to add New York to the New England Fishery Management Council. H.R. 1379 would have prohibited the commercial harvesting of Atlantic striped bass in coastal waters and the EEZ. H.R. 5180 would have established an ombudsman office within NMFS; the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held a hearing on this bill on July 27, 2010. Section 4 of H.R. 5863 would have prohibited the approval of oil and gas exploration and/or development/production plans unless the Secretary certifies MSFCMA compliance; in addition, Section 5 would have required consultation for any of these oil and gas activities for their potential effect on fish habitat in federal waters. Section 3 of S. 3826 would have required congressional review of any agency rulemaking that establishes, modifies, opens, closes, or conducts a regulatory program for a commercial activity related to fishing. H.R. 6316 would have amended the MSFCMA to mitigate the economic impact of transition to sustainable fisheries on fishing communities. S. 4014 would have provided for the replacement or rebuilding of a vessel for the non-American Fisheries Act trawl catcher-processors that comprise the Amendment 80 fleet. Steelhead trout and five species of salmon spawn in Pacific coastal rivers and lakes, after which juveniles migrate to North Pacific ocean waters where they mature before returning to the same freshwater rivers and lakes to spawn. Management is complicated because these fish may cross several state and national boundaries during their life spans, and their different subpopulations/stocks intermingle on fishing grounds. In addition to natural environmental fluctuations, threats to salmon include hydropower dams that block rivers and create reservoirs, sport and commercial harvests, habitat modification by competing resource industries and other human development, and hatcheries seeking to supplement natural production but sometimes unintentionally causing genetic or developmental concerns. In response to declining salmon populations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California, discrete population units have been listed as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. On September 13, 2006, a San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Agreement was announced, ending an 18-year legal dispute over the operation of Friant Dam in California. This agreement provides for river channel improvements and water flow to sustain Chinook salmon upstream (south) from the confluence of the Merced River tributary while reducing or avoiding adverse water supply impacts to Friant Division long-term water contractors that may result from restoration flows provided in the agreement. To address some of their concerns about Pacific salmon management, the United States and Canada negotiated a bilateral agreement on Pacific salmon in 1985. However, by the mid-1990s, controversy stalled renegotiations to adjust cooperative management of these fish. This deadlock was resolved in June 1999 when a new accord was concluded. Annex IV of this bilateral agreement outlines, in detail, the fishery regimes to be followed by Canada and the United States in cooperatively managing the six species of anadromous Pacific salmon and steelhead trout. Annex IV was recently renegotiated and took effect on January 1, 2009. Language in the \"construction\" account for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in P.L. 111-8 permanently rescinded all unobligated balances under the authority of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act. Title X, Subtitle A, of P.L. 111-11 authorized the implementation of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement providing for the reintroduction of Chinook salmon. The 111 th Congress considered several additional bills relating to Pacific salmon: H.R. 1080 would have amended the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act to strengthen enforcement mechanisms to stop illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; on March 19, 2009, the House Natural Resources, Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held a hearing on this bill, and on July 24, 2009, the House Committee on Natural Resources reported this measure, amended ( H.Rept. 111-228 ). The House passed H.R. 1080 (amended) on September 22, 2009. S. 2870 would have amended the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985 and the Northern Pacific Anadromous Stocks Act of 1992 to deter and combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. On December 17, 2010, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported S. 2870 ( S.Rept. 111-388 ). Section 603(e) of S. 2971 , as reported (amended) by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on September 23, 2010, would have authorized that as much as $15 million annually from appropriations for \"International Fisheries Commissions\" be used to fulfill U.S. Pacific Salmon Treaty obligations to Canada ( S.Rept. 111-301 ). H.R. 1672 and S. 668 would have directed county marine resources committees to assist in identifying local implications, needs, and strategies associated with the recovery of Puget Sound salmon. On October 20, 2009, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held a hearing on H.R. 1672 . On October 21, 2009, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported (amended) S. 668 ( S.Rept. 111-90 ). On December 7, 2009, the House Committee on Natural Resources reported (amended) H.R. 1672 ( H.Rept. 111-354 ), and the House subsequently passed this measure (amended). On March 31, 2009, the House Committee on Natural Resources held an oversight hearing on the California drought and actions by federal and state agencies to address impacts on lands, fisheries, and water users. H.R. 2977 would have directed the Bureau of Reclamation to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to study sustainable water and environmental management in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California. H.R. 3794 would have amended the Central Valley Project Improvement Act to assist in efforts to avoid losses of juvenile anadromous fish. S. 817 and H.R. 2055 would have established a Salmon Stronghold Partnership program to protect wild Pacific salmon; on June 16, 2009, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held a hearing on H.R. 2055 .

On November 17, 2010, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported S. 817 ( S.Rept. 111-348 ). Section 201 of H.R. 4347 would have amended Title IV of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act relating to funding agreements with the Hoopa Valley Tribe for restoring the Trinity River fishery and with the Quinault Indian Nation for the National Salmon Hatchery located on the Quinault Reservation. H.R. 3503 would have required a scientific analysis of federal salmon recovery efforts by the National Academy of Sciences and authorized removal of the four lower Snake River dams by the Army Corps of Engineers. H.R. 3999 would have directed the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation to initiate ESA consultations on the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project. Section 1886 of P.L. 111-5 broadened the basis for determining import increases relating to trade adjustment assistance for fishing and aquaculture to include wild-caught fish and seafood in addition to farm-raised fish and seafood. Several other bills in the 111 th Congress dealt with assistance to the fishing industry: S. 533 and H.R. 2548 would have amended the Coastal Zone Management Act to establish a grant program to ensure waterfront access for aquaculture operators and commercial fishermen. On October 20, 2009, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held a hearing on H.R. 2548 .

On November 4, 2009, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held a hearing on this measure. Section 208 of S. 2731 would have required a report to Congress providing information on economic injury disaster declarations under Section 7(b)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(b)(2)) based on a fishery resource disaster declaration from the Secretary of Commerce. S. 3337 and Section 10 of S. 3763 would have provided technical assistance grants to fisheries organizations for assisting individuals and businesses affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to file claims. H.R. 1983 would have recodified Title 53 (Small Business) of the U.S. Code, including disaster assistance programs applicable to commercial fishermen and aquaculture operations.

Aquaculture is broadly defined as the farming or husbandry of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic animals and plants, usually in a controlled or selected environment. The diversity of aquaculture is typified by such activities as fish farming, usually applied to freshwater commercial aquaculture operations (e.g., catfish and trout farms); shellfish and seaweed culture; net-pen culture, used by the salmon industry, wherein fish remain captive throughout their lives in marine pens built from nets; and ocean ranching, used by the Pacific Coast salmon industry, whereby juvenile salmon are cultured, released to mature in the open ocean, and caught when they return as adults to spawn. Fish hatcheries can be either publicly or privately operated to raise fish for recreational and commercial stocking as well as to mitigate aquatic resource and habitat damage. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has characterized aquaculture as one of the world's fastest-growing food production activities. World aquaculture production more than doubled in 10 years, from about 10 million metric tons in 1984 to 25.5 million metric tons in 1994; by 2002, global aquaculture production had reached almost 40 million metric tons. By mid-2006, FAO estimated that 43% of all fish consumed by humans came from aquaculture. FAO has projected that aquaculture will surpass wild-harvested seafood as the source of more than half of global seafood consumption in 2008. In addition, FAO predicts that world aquaculture production could exceed 130 million metric tons by 2030. U.S. aquaculture, until recently and with a few exceptions, has been considered a minor industry. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's 2005 Census of Aquaculture reported that U.S. sales of aquaculture products had reached nearly $1.1 billion, with more than half this value produced in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Despite considerable growth, the domestic aquaculture industry faces strong competition from imports of foreign aquacultural products, from the domestic poultry and livestock industries, and from wild harvests. With growth, however, aquaculture operations face increasing scrutiny for habitat destruction, pollution, and other concerns. The major statute affecting U.S. aquaculture is the National Aquaculture Act of 1980, as amended (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2801 et seq.). The purpose of this act is to ensure coordination of various federal programs and policies affecting the aquaculture industry, and to promote and support aquaculture research and development. In October 2007, NOAA released a 10-year plan for its marine aquaculture program. Legislation to modify the regulatory environment and promote the development of U.S. offshore, open-ocean aquaculture was introduced in the 110 th and 111 th Congresses, but was never considered by either chamber. P.L. 111-5 contained language in (1)\u00a0Section 103(d) providing as much as $50 million in total assistance to aquaculture producers for losses associated with high feed input costs during the 2008 calendar year; and (2)\u00a0Section 1886 broadening the basis for determining import increases relating to trade adjustment assistance for fishing and aquaculture to include wild-caught fish and seafood in addition to farm-raised fish and seafood. P.L. 111-205 became law after Senate action deleted a provision that would have provided emergency disaster assistance to aquaculture producers for losses associated with high feed input costs during the 2009 calendar year. Section 1501 of P.L. 111-240 amended the Small Business Act to authorize certain disaster assistance to aquaculture enterprises that are small businesses.  A number of additional measures were introduced but not enacted. S. 533 and H.R. 2548 would have amended the Coastal Zone Management Act to establish a grant program to ensure waterfront access for aquaculture operators and commercial fishermen; on October 20, 2009, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held a hearing on H.R. 2548 .

H.R. 1983 would have recodified Title 53 (Small Business) of the U.S. Code, including disaster assistance programs applicable to commercial fishermen and aquaculture operations. Section 205 of S. 2731 would have deleted aquaculture from the definition of \"agricultural enterprises\" for Small Business Administration disaster recovery funds. H.R. 4177 and S. 2810 contained language that would have directed the Secretary of Agriculture to provide assistance to any applicant that produces catfish. S. 3337 and Section 10 of S. 3763 would have provided technical assistance grants to certain aquaculture organizations for assisting individuals and businesses affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to file claims.  P.L. 111-5 contained language including National Fish Hatcheries as eligible for $165 million in resource management funding as well as $115 million in construction funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  A number of additional measures were introduced but not enacted. Section 8 of S. 313 / H.R. 1065 would have addressed the relationship between the Department of the Interior and the White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) for the operation and maintenance of the Alchesay-Williams Creek National Fish Hatchery Complex and the WMAT Fishery Center; on January 21, 2010, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs reported (amended) S. 313 , eliminating the hatchery provisions while authorizing the WMAT Settlement Fund for use in fish production, including hatcheries ( S.Rept. 111-119 ). On January 12, 2010, the House Committee on Natural Resources reported (amended) H.R. 1065 , eliminating the hatchery provisions while authorizing the WMAT Settlement Fund for use in fish production, including hatcheries ( H.Rept. 111-391 ); the House passed this amended measure on January 21, 2010.

P.L. 111-80 provided $3.9 million for regional aquaculture centers, $6.56 million for aquaculture pest and disease management (including $5.188 million for viral hemorrhagic septicemia), and $13.913 million in congressionally directed appropriations for aquaculture research and development (including $1.238 million for viral hemorrhagic septicemia and $465,000 for cormorant control) for FY2010.  Additional measures were introduced but not enacted. S. 3606 , reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations on July 15, 2010 ( S.Rept. 111-221 ), would have provided $3.928 million for regional aquaculture centers, $6.57 million for aquaculture pest and disease management, and $4.245 million in congressionally directed appropriations for aquaculture research and development (including $500,000 for viral hemorrhagic septicemia and $465,000 for cormorant control) for FY2011. As reported (amended) by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on September 20, 2010 ( S.Rept. 111-298 ), Section 4 of S. 3119 would have authorized aquaculture of suspension-feeding shellfish or algae for a nutrient bioextraction pilot project in Long Island Sound.

S. 2273 and Section 2001(a)(194) of H.R. 4380 proposed to extend the temporary suspension of duty on oysters (other than smoked), prepared or preserved. H.R. 4022 , S. 2735 , and S. 2752 would have prohibited additional requirements for the control of Vibrio vulnificus applicable to the post-harvest processing of oysters; in addition, S. 2752 would have required an education campaign to increase awareness of the risks associated with consuming raw oysters.  Section 901(c) of P.L. 111-281 authorized the U.S. Coast Guard to issue waivers to permit nonqualified vessels to perform aquaculture support operations relating to treating or protecting aquaculture fish from disease, parasitic infestation, or other threats to their health when no suitable U.S. vessel is available.  P.L. 111-307 amended the Lacey Act to add bighead carp to the list of injurious species that are prohibited from being imported or shipped interstate. P.L. 111-353 , included provisions (1) directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to update the Fish and Fisheries Products Hazards and Control Guidance to take into account advances in technology and (2) requiring a report by the Food and Drug Administration on the post-harvest processing of raw oysters. Additional measures were introduced but not enacted.

Section 4 of H.R. 856 would have authorized the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a cooperative agreement with the state of California to establish a fish hatchery program for Delta smelt in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. In 1972, Congress enacted the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1361 et seq.), due in part to the high level of dolphin mortality (estimated at more than 400,000 animals per year) in the eastern tropical Pacific tuna purse-seine fishery. While some critics assert that the MMPA is scientifically irrational because it identifies one group of organisms for special protection unrelated to their abundance or ecological role, supporters note that the MMPA has accomplished much by way of promoting research and increased understanding of marine life as well as encouraging attention to incidental bycatch mortalities of marine life by the commercial fishing and other maritime industries. The MMPA established a moratorium on the \"taking\" of marine mammals in U.S. waters and by U.S. nationals on the high seas. It also established a moratorium on importing marine mammals and marine mammal products into the United States. The MMPA protected marine mammals from \"clubbing, mutilation, poisoning, capture in nets, and other human actions that lead to extinction.\" It also expressly authorized the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits for the \"taking\" of marine mammals for certain purposes, such as scientific research and public display. Under the MMPA, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through NMFS, is responsible for the conservation and management of whales, dolphins, and porpoises (cetaceans), and seals and sea lions (pinnipeds). The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), is responsible for walruses, sea and marine otters, polar bears, manatees, and dugongs. This division of authority derives from agency responsibilities as they existed when the MMPA was enacted. Title II of the MMPA established an independent Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) and its Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals to oversee and recommend actions necessary to meet the requirements of the MMPA. Prior to passage of the MMPA, states were responsible for marine mammal management on lands and in waters under their jurisdiction. The MMPA shifted marine mammal management authority to the federal government. It provides, however, that management authority, on a species-by-species basis, could be returned to states that adopt conservation and management programs consistent with the purposes and policies of the MMPA. It also provides that the moratorium on taking can be waived for specific purposes, if the taking will not disadvantage the affected species or population. Permits may be issued to take or import any marine mammal species, including depleted species, for scientific research or to enhance the survival or recovery of the species or stock. The MMPA allows U.S. citizens to apply for and obtain authorization for taking small numbers of mammals incidental to activities other than commercial fishing (e.g., offshore oil and gas exploration and development) if the taking would have only a negligible impact on any marine mammal species or stock, provided that monitoring requirements and other conditions are met. The MMPA moratorium on taking does not apply to any Native American (Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo) who resides in Alaska near the coast of the North Pacific (including the Bering Sea) or Arctic Ocean (including the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas), if such taking is for subsistence or for creating and selling authentic Native articles of handicrafts and clothing, and is not done wastefully. The MMPA also authorizes the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations. In 1988, most U.S. commercial fish harvesters were exempted from otherwise applicable rulemaking and permit requirements for a five-year period, pending development of an improved system to govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations. This exemption expired at the end of FY1993, and was extended several times until new provisions were enacted in 1994 by P.L. 103-238 , which reauthorized the MMPA through FY1999. The eastern tropical Pacific tuna fishery was excluded from the incidental take regimes enacted in 1988 and 1994. Instead, the taking of marine mammals incidental to that fishery is governed by separate provisions of the MMPA, and was substantially amended in 1997 by P.L. 105-42 , the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act. Section 319 of P.L. 108-136 amended the MMPA to provide a broad exemption for \"national defense\" activities. This section also amended the definition of \"harassment\" of marine mammals, as it applies to military readiness activities, to require greater scientific evidence of harm, and the consideration of impacts on military readiness in the issuance of permits for incidental takings. The Navy's use of mid-frequency sonar and its possible effects on marine mammals has been the focus of much controversy and litigation. The MMPA was reauthorized by P.L. 103-238 , the Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of 1994; the authorization for appropriations expired on September 30, 1999. The 1994 amendments indefinitely authorized the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations and provided for assessing marine mammal stocks in U.S. waters, for developing and implementing take-reduction plans for stocks that have been reduced or are being maintained below their optimum sustainable population levels due to interactions with commercial fisheries, and for studying pinniped-fishery interactions. A December 2008 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that limitations in information available make it difficult for NMFS to accurately determine which marine mammal stocks meet the statutory requirements for establishing take reduction teams. GAO found that NMFS did not have a human-caused mortality estimate or a maximum removal level for 39 of 113 marine mammal stocks, making it impossible to determine their strategic status in accordance with MMPA requirements. For the remaining 74 stocks, NMFS data have significant limitations that call into questions their accuracy. NMFS contends that funding constraints limit their ability to gather sufficient data. In addition, NMFS has not established take reduction teams for 14 marine mammal stocks for which NMFS data show them to be strategic and interacting significantly with commercial fisheries. In 111 th Congress on April 27, 2010, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held an oversight hearing on marine mammals in captivity and what constitutes meaningful public education. No bills were introduced in the 111 th Congress to reauthorize the MMPA. In the 111 th Congress, a number of bills were introduced proposing to amend the MMPA: H.R. 1054 and S. 1395 would have amended the MMPA to allow imports of polar bear trophies taken in sport hunts in Canada before the date the polar bear was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act; on September 22, 2009, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held a hearing on H.R. 1054 . H.R. 1055 would have amended the MMPA to allow imports of polar bear trophies taken in sport hunts in Canada. Section 4 of H.R. 5863 would have prohibited the approval of oil and gas exploration and/or development/production plans unless the Secretary certifies MMPA compliance; Section 6 of this measure would have required the Secretary to consider cumulative effects on marine mammal stocks and their subsistence use. Section 101 of H.R. 5899 would have declared that the draft OCS leasing program for 2010-2015 fully complies with the MMPA. H.R. 4914 and S. 3528 would have promoted coastal jobs creation in activities including cooperative research to collect data to improve, supplement, or enhance marine mammal stock assessments. On July 27, 2010, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held a hearing on H.R. 4914 .

H.R. 843 would have amended the MMPA to repeal the long-term goal for reducing the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals to zero in commercial fishing operations, and to modify the goal of take reduction plans for reducing such takings. Section 30 of H.R. 1108 would have directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish regional OCS Joint Permitting Offices, with expertise in MMPA consultations and preparation of documents. H.R. 6394 would have amended the MMPA to allow transport, purchase, sale, and export of pelts of Southcentral and Southeast Alaska northern sea otters that are taken for subsistence. H.R. 2029 would have authorized the Marine Mammal Commission to establish a national research program to fund basic and applied research on marine mammals.

H.R. 2955 would have amended the Whaling Convention Act of 1949 to require that the United States Commissioner to the International Whaling Commission be a federal employee. H.R. 4137 would have authorized the Secretary of the Interior to provide preservation and interpretation assistance to the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park in Massachusetts. H.Res. 1390 would have expressed the sense of the House that the United States should use its position of global leadership to strengthen whale conservation efforts and to ensure that commercial, scientific, and other lethal whaling does not occur for any purpose other than aboriginal subsistence.  S. 1252 would have amended and reauthorized the Oceans and Human Health Act through FY2014; on September 20, 2010, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported (amended) this measure ( S.Rept. 111-296 ). S. 3584 and H.R. 6292 would have directed NOAA to research oil spill prevention and response in the Arctic waters, including assessment of impacts on Arctic marine mammals. In addition, H.R. 6292 , along with S. 3597 and Title VI of S. 3663 , sought to improve the ability of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Coast Guard, and coastal states to sustain healthy ocean and coastal ecosystems relative to oil spills; the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported S. 3597 (amended) on December 17, 2010.

On February 1, 2010, the Obama Administration released its FY2011 budget request, including about $973 million for NMFS. (See Table 1 .) The FY2011 request for NMFS funding within NOAA's Operations, Research, and Facilities (OR&F) Account was $3.238 million (+0.4%) more than funding enacted for FY2010. Total NMFS funding was proposed to decrease by $11.412 million (-1.2%) from that enacted for FY2010, primarily due to a proposed reduction of $15 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. On February 24, 2010, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held an oversight hearing on NOAA's FY2011 budget request. On March 3, 2010, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard held an oversight hearing on NOAA's FY2011 budget request. On July 22, 2010, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3636 , recommending about $909 million for NMFS within NOAA's OR&F Account for FY2011 ( S.Rept. 111-229 ); the Senate Committee recommendation is $4.49 million (+0.5%) more than the FY2010 appropriation and $1.252 million (+0.1%) more than the FY2011 Administration request. The Senate Committee recommended that total NMFS funding be increased by $4.84 million (+0.5%) from that enacted for FY2010. As FY2011 began, a number of enactments provided continued funding at FY2010 levels, including P.L. 111-242 (through December 3, 2010), P.L. 111-290 (through December 18, 2010), and P.L. 111-322 (through March 4, 2011). On June 12, 2009, the House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 2847 , recommending FY2010 appropriations of almost $916 million for NMFS ( H.Rept. 111-149 ). The House recommendation was about 4.2% greater than the FY2009 enacted level and about 0.5% larger than the FY2010 Administration request. The House passed this measure on June 18, 2009. On June 25, 2009, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported (amended) H.R. 2847 , recommending FY2010 appropriations of more than $952 million for NMFS ( S.Rept. 111-34 ). The Senate recommendation was about 8.4% greater than the FY2009 enacted level, about 4.5% more than the FY2010 Administration request, and about 4.0% larger than the House FY2010 recommendation. The Senate passed H.R. 2847 (amended) on November 5, 2009. A conference report on H.R. 3288 (an omnibus measure including the material formerly in H.R. 2847 ) was filed on December 8, 2009 ( H.Rept. 111-366 ), including more than $984 million for NMFS and related programs. President Obama signed P.L. 111-117 into law on December 16, 2009. P.L. 111-212 (emergency supplemental appropriations; H.R. 4899 ) provided (1) $5 million for expenses related to commercial fishery failures as determined by the Secretary of Commerce in January 2010; (2) $13 million for responding to economic impacts on fishermen and fishery-dependent businesses; (3) $7 million for scientific investigations and sampling as a result of the incidents related to the discharge of oil and the use of oil dispersants in 2010 after the explosion and sinking of the mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon; (4) $15 million for fisheries disaster relief under Section 312 of the MSFCMA related to a fishery resource disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that resulted from the Deepwater Horizon oil discharge; (5) $10 million to conduct an expanded stock assessment of the fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico; and (6) $1 million for the National Academy of Sciences to study of the long-term ecosystem service impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil discharge. The FWS budget account for \"fisheries and aquatic resource conservation\" includes funding for the National Fish Hatchery operations, aquatic invasive species programs, and marine mammal programs. These programs employ about 800 individuals, located at 70 National Fish Hatcheries, 65 Fish and Wildlife Conservation Offices, one historic National Fish Hatchery, nine Fish Health Centers, and seven Fish Technology Centers. On February 1, 2010, the Obama Administration released its detailed budget request for FY2011, including about $142.5 million for FWS fisheries and aquatic resource conservation programs, which is about $5.7 million (-3.9%) less than was enacted for FY2010. Most of the reductions in funding occur in the line items for National Fish Hatchery operations and aquatic invasive species. Table 2 summarizes recent fisheries and aquatic resource conservation funding for FWS. On March 4, 2010, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held an oversight hearing on the FY2011 FWS budget. As FY2011 began, a number of enactments provided continued funding at FY2010 levels, including P.L. 111-242 (through December 3, 2010), P.L. 111-290 (through December 18, 2010), and P.L. 111-322 (through March 4, 2011)."
