FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant \n        ecological and public health concern;\n            (2) exposure to mercury occurs largely by consumption of \n        contaminated fish, and children and women of childbearing age \n        who consume large quantities of fish are at high risk of \n        suffering adverse effects;\n            (3) it is estimated that more than 630,000 children born \n        each year in the United States are exposed to elevated methyl \n        mercury in the womb and are at risk of impaired neurological \n        development;\n            (4) 8 percent of women in the United States of childbearing \n        age have blood mercury levels in excess of values determined to \n        be safe by the Environmental Protection Agency;\n            (5) as of 2004, fish consumption advisories due to mercury \n        contamination have been issued for 44 States, including 21 \n        statewide advisories for freshwater and 12 statewide advisories \n        for coastal water;\n            (6) those advisories represent more than 52,000 square \n        kilometers of lakes and 1,230,000 kilometers of rivers;\n            (7) fish and shellfish are an important source of dietary \n        protein, and a healthy fishing resource is important to the \n        economy of the United States;\n            (8) the extent of fish consumption advisories underscores \n        the extensive human and ecological health risk posed by mercury \n        pollution;\n            (9) the interaction of mercury with the environment and \n        bioaccumulation in biota are not fully understood;\n            (10) computer models and other assessment tools predict \n        varying effectiveness in reducing mercury concentrations in \n        fish, and no broad-scale data sets exist to test model \n        predictions;\n            (11) in September 2003, the Society of Environmental \n        Toxicology and Chemistry convened a workshop of 32 mercury \n        scientists to develop a system to measure and document changes \n        resulting from reductions in mercury emissions in the United \n        States;\n            (12) on January 1, 2005, an article entitled ``Monitoring \n        the Response to Changing Mercury Deposition''--\n                    (A) was published in the periodical Environmental \n                Science and Technology; and\n                    (B) proposed a ``holistic, multimedia, long-term \n                mercury monitoring program'';\n            (13) many regulations limiting mercury emissions have taken \n        effect or will soon be promulgated, but scientists are not \n        adequately measuring the environmental benefits of reduced \n        mercury emissions;\n            (14) on May 18, 2005, the Administrator of the \n        Environmental Protection Agency, using results generated by a \n        computer model that were not peer reviewed or verified by \n        actual measurements, finalized the Clean Air Mercury Rule (70 \n        Fed. Reg. 28606 (May 18, 2005));\n            (15) as governments advance proposals for the regulation of \n        mercury and mercury emissions, the governments should document \n        whether regulations already or soon to be in effect achieve the \n        desired results;\n            (16) on May 15, 2006, the Office of Inspector General of \n        the Environmental Protection Agency issued a report entitled, \n        ``Monitoring Needed to Assess Impact of EPA's Clean Air Mercury \n        Rule (CAMR) on Potential Hotspots'', and numbered 2006-P-0025, \n        that states, in part--\n                    (A) ``Without field data from an improved \n                monitoring network, EPA's ability to advance mercury \n                science will be limited and `utility-attributable' \n                hotspots that pose health risks may occur and go \n                undetected''; and\n                    (B) ``We recommend that EPA develop and implement a \n                mercury monitoring plan to (1) assess the impact of \n                CAMR, if adopted, on mercury deposition and fish \n                tissue; and (2) evaluate and refine mercury estimation \n                tools and models'';\n            (17) on January 9, 2007, numerous individuals published a \n        paper in the journal entitled ``BioScience'' that identified \n        the location of biological mercury hotspots in the northeastern \n        region of the United States and the southeastern region of \n        Canada, including--\n                    (A) David Evers and Wing Goodale of the \n                BioDiversity Research Institute in Gorham, Maine;\n                    (B) Charles Driscoll of Syracuse University;\n                    (C) Kathleen Fallon Lambert of the Hubbard Brook \n                Research Foundation in Hanover, New Hampshire;\n                    (D) Neil Kamman of the Vermont Department of \n                Environmental Conservation; and\n                    (E) other concerned individuals;\n            (18) on January 9, 2007, Charles Driscoll and other \n        concerned individuals published a paper in the journal entitled \n        ``BioScience'' that established a link between--\n                    (A) mercury contamination in forest and freshwater \n                ecosystems located in the northeastern region of the \n                United States; and\n                    (B) mercury emissions generated by electric \n                utilities, incinerators, and industrial processes; and\n            (19) those papers published in the journal entitled \n        ``BioScience''--\n                    (A) demonstrated the importance of the use of \n                mercury measurements in addition to modeling results; \n                and\n                    (B) indicated the need for a comprehensive \n                nationwide mercury monitoring program.\n\nSEC. 3.
