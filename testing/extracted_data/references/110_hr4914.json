    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Global HIV/AIDS Food Security and \nNutrition Support Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The spread of HIV/AIDS is exacerbated by poverty, and \n        economic and social vulnerability, disempowerment, and \n        inequality.\n            (2) Food insecurity has a direct detrimental impact on \n        prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS.\n            (3) Programming for HIV/AIDS must address the underlying \n        factors that contribute to the spread of the disease in order \n        to be effective and sustainable.\n            (4) The World Food Program estimates that 6,400,000 people \n        affected by HIV will need nutritional support by 2008.\n            (5) The highest rates of HIV infections are in countries \n        with significant rates of malnutrition, especially in sub-\n        Saharan Africa.\n            (6) People living with HIV/AIDS are less productive due to \n        illness, which contributes to food insecurity for such \n        individuals and their households through loss of wages and/or \n        decreased agricultural production.\n            (7) People caring for HIV-infected persons are often less \n        productive because of the demands of caring for those persons, \n        which in turn can lead to food insecurity for the infected \n        person and the entire household.\n            (8) Adequate nutrition can extend the time that people \n        infected with HIV are able to work and be productive.\n            (9) Food insecurity is often cited by people living with \n        HIV/AIDS as their number one concern.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) malnutrition, especially for people living with and \n        affected by HIV/AIDS, is a clinical health issue with wider \n        nutrition, health, and social implications for HIV-infected \n        individuals, their families, and communities that must be \n        addressed by United States HIV/AIDS prevention, care, \n        treatment, and support programs;\n            (2) international guidelines established by the World \n        Health Organization should serve as the reference standard for \n        HIV/AIDS food and nutrition activities supported by the \n        President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR);\n            (3) the Coordinator of United States Government Activities \n        to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally (commonly known as the ``Global \n        AIDS Coordinator'') should make it a priority to work with \n        other United States Government departments and agencies, \n        donors, and multilateral institutions to increase the \n        integration of food and nutrition support and livelihood \n        activities into prevention, care, and treatment activities \n        funded by the United States and other governments and \n        organizations;\n            (4) for the purposes of determining which HIV-infected \n        individuals should be provided with nutrition and food support, \n        a patient with a body mass index of 18.5 or less should be \n        considered ``malnourished'' and should be given priority for \n        nutrition and food support;\n            (5) programs funded by the United States Government should \n        include therapeutic and supplementary feeding, food, and \n        nutrition support and should include strong links to \n        development programs that focus on support for livelihoods; and\n            (6) the inability of HIV-infected individuals to access \n        food for themselves or their families should not be allowed to \n        impair or erode the therapeutic status of such individuals with \n        respect to HIV or related comorbidities.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to--\n            (1) address the food and nutrition needs of HIV-infected \n        and affected individuals, including orphans and vulnerable \n        children;\n            (2) fully integrate food and nutrition support into care, \n        treatment, and support programs carried out under the United \n        States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \n        Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-25; 22 U.S.C. 7601 et seq.);\n            (3) ensure that--\n                    (A) care, treatment, and support providers and \n                healthcare workers are adequately trained such that \n                they can provide accurate and informed information \n                regarding food and nutrition support to patients \n                enrolled in treatment and care programs and those \n                affected by HIV; and\n                    (B) HIV-infected individuals identified as food \n                insecure, as well as their households, are provided \n                with adequate food and nutrition support; and\n            (4) effectively link food and nutrition support to HIV-\n        infected individuals and their households and communities \n        provided under Public Law 108-25 to other food security and \n        livelihood programs funded by the United States Government and \n        other donors and multilateral agencies.\n\nSEC. 5. INTEGRATION OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION ACTIVITIES INTO HIV/\n              AIDS PREVENTION, CARE, TREATMENT, AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES.\n\n    Section 301 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-25; 22 U.S.C. \n7631) is amended by striking subsection (c) and inserting the \nfollowing:\n    ``(c) Integration of Food Security and Nutrition Activities Into \nPrevention, Care, Treatment, and Support Activities.--\n            ``(1) Statement of policy.--Congress declares that food \n        security and nutrition directly impact a patient's \n        vulnerability to HIV infection, the progression of HIV to AIDS, \n        a patient's ability to begin an anti-retroviral medication \n        treatment regimen, the efficacy of an anti-retroviral \n        medication treatment regimen once a patient begins such a \n        regimen, and the ability of communities to effectively cope \n        with the HIV/AIDS epidemic and its impacts.\n            ``(2) Requirements.--Consistent with the statement of \n        policy in paragraph (1), the Global AIDS Coordinator shall--\n                    ``(A) ensure that--\n                            ``(i) an assessment, using validated \n                        criteria, of the food security and nutritional \n                        status of each patient enrolled in anti-\n                        retroviral medication treatment programs \n                        supported with funds authorized under this Act \n                        or any amendment made by this Act is carried \n                        out;
