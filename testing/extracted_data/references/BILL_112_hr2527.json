FINDINGS.\n    The Congress finds the following:\n        (1) On June 12, 1939, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and \n    Museum opened in Cooperstown, New York. Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, \n    Christy Mathewson, Babe Ruth, and Honus Wagner comprised the \n    inaugural class of inductees. This class set the standard for all \n    future inductees. Since 1939, just one percent of all Major League \n    Baseball players have earned induction into the National Baseball \n    Hall of Fame.\n        (2) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is dedicated \n    to preserving history, honoring excellence, and connecting \n    generations through the rich history of our national pastime. \n    Baseball has mirrored our Nation's history since the Civil War, and \n    is now an integral part of our Nation's heritage.\n        (3) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum chronicles \n    the history of our national pastime and houses the world's largest \n    collection of baseball artifacts, including more than 38,000 three \n    dimensional artifacts, 3,000,000 documents, 500,000 photographs, \n    and 12,000 hours of recorded media. This collection ensures that \n    baseball history and its unique connection to American history will \n    be preserved and recounted for future generations.\n        (4) Since its opening in 1939, more than 14,000,000 baseball \n    fans have visited the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum to \n    learn about the history of our national pastime and the game's \n    connection to the American experience.\n        (5) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is an \n    educational institution, reaching 10,000,000 Americans annually. \n    Utilizing video conference technology, students and teachers \n    participate in interactive lessons led by educators from the \n    National Baseball Hall of Fame Museum. These award-winning \n    educational programs draw upon the wonders of baseball to reach \n    students in classrooms nationwide. Each educational program uses \n    baseball as a lens for teaching young Americans important lessons \n    on an array of topics, including mathematics, geography, civil \n    rights, women's history, economics, industrial technology, arts, \n    and communication.\nSEC. 3.
