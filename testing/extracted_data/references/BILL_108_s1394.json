FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In his budget for fiscal year 2004, President George W. \n        Bush proposes a ``Money Follows the Person'' rebalancing \n        initiative under the medicaid program to help States rebalance \n        their long-term services support systems more evenly between \n        institutional and community-based services.\n            (2) The President, by proposing this initiative, and \n        Congress, recognize that States have not fully developed the \n        systems needed to create a more equitable balance between \n        institutional and community-based services spending under the \n        medicaid program.\n            (3) While a few States have been successful at achieving \n        this balance, nationally, approximately 70 percent of the \n        medicaid funding spent for long-term services is devoted to \n        nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for the \n        mentally retarded. Only 30 percent of such funding is spent for \n        community-based services.\n            (4) As a result, there are often long waiting lists for \n        community-based services and supports.\n            (5) In the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, \n        Congress found that individuals with disabilities continue to \n        encounter various forms of discrimination, including \n        segregation, and that discrimination persists in such critical \n        areas as institutionalization.\n            (6) In 1999, the Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. LC (527 \n        U.S. 581 (1999)) that needless institutionalization is \n        discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n        1990, noting that institutional placement of people who can be \n        served in the community ``perpetuates unwarranted assumptions \n        that persons so isolated are unworthy of participating in \n        community life.'' (Id. at 600). The Court further found that \n        ``confinement in an institution severely diminishes the \n        everyday life activities of individuals, including family \n        relations, social contacts, work options, economic \n        independence, educational advancement, and cultural \n        enrichment.'' (Id. at 601).\n            (7) Additional resources would be helpful for assisting \n        States in rebalancing their long-term services support system \n        and complying with the Olmstead decision.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT MEDICAID DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Community-based services and supports.--The term \n        ``community-based services and supports'' means, with respect \n        to a State, any items or services that are an allowable \n        expenditure for medical assistance under the State medicaid \n        program, or under a waiver of such program and that the State \n        determines would allow an individual to live in the community.\n            (2) Individual's representative;

   community-based long-term services support systems \n                within the State to enable individuals with \n                disabilities to live and participate in community life, \n                particularly with respect to those practices that will \n                ensure the successful transition of such individuals \n                from medicaid long-term care facilities into the \n                community.\n                    (B) Design and implement a long-term services \n                support system in the State that prevents individuals \n                from entering

within the \n                State to rebalance expenditures for long-term services \n                under the State medicaid program through administrative \n                actions that reduce reliance on institutional forms of \n                service and build up more community capacity.\n                    (D) Address the needs of populations that have been \n                underserved with respect to the availability of \n                community services or involve individuals or entities \n                that have not previously participated in the efforts of \n                the State to increase access to community-based \n                services.\n                    (E) Actively engage in collaboration between public \n                housing agencies, the State medicaid agency, \n                independent living centers, and other agencies and \n                entities in order to coordinate strategies for \n                obtaining community integrated housing and supportive \n                services for an individual who participates in the \n                demonstration project, both with respect to the period \n                during which such individual participates in the \n                project and after the individual's participation in the \n                project concludes, in order to enable the individual to \n                continue to reside in the community.\n                    (F) Develop and implement policies and procedures \n                that allow the State medicaid agency to \n                administratively transfer or integrate funds from the \n                State budget accounts that are obligated for \n                expenditures for medicaid long-term care facilities to \n                other accounts for obligation for the provision of \n                community-based services and supports (including \n                accounts related to the provision of such services \n                under a waiver approved under section 1915 of the \n                Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396n)) when an \n                individual transitions from residing in such a facility

this section an amount \n        for each quarter occurring during the period described in \n        paragraph (2) equal to 100 percent of the State's expenditures \n        in the quarter for providing community-based services and \n        supports to individuals participating in the demonstration \n        project.\n            (2) Period described.--The period described in this \n        paragraph is the 12-month period that begins on the date on \n        which an individual first receives community-based services and \n        supports under the demonstration project in a setting that is \n        not a medicaid long-term care facility and is selected by the \n        individual.\n    (f) Reports.--\n            (1) In general.--Each State conducting a demonstration \n        project under this section shall submit a report to the \n        Secretary that, in addition to such other requirements as the \n        Secretary may require, includes information regarding--\n
