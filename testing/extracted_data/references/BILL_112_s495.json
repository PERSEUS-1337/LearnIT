FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One in 6 people in the United States lives with a \n        neurological disease or condition that can often result in \n        disability, and which may require the individual to seek \n        assistance in carrying out the activities of daily living. \n        Neurological diseases or conditions such as multiple sclerosis \n        (MS), early-onset Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain \n        injury (TBI) often affect younger adults in the middle of their \n        lives.\n            (2) Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling \n        disease that attacks the central nervous system with symptoms \n        ranging from numbness in limbs to paralysis and loss of vision. \n        Most individuals with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 \n        and 50. It is estimated that more than 400,000 individuals in \n        the United States are living with MS. Individuals living with \n        MS who experience more severe forms of the disease are likely \n        to require either home care or nursing home placement, though \n        the vast majority would prefer to remain at home to receive the \n        care they need. Where home care is concerned, approximately 80 \n        percent of such care is provided by informal, unpaid, \n        caregivers who are generally family members.\n            (3) Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive \n        neurological disease. The 4 primary symptoms of Parkinson's \n        disease are tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, and \n        face; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; \n        bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural \n        instability, or impaired balance and coordination. It is \n        estimated that nearly 1,000,000 individuals live with \n        Parkinson's disease and, of those individuals, 5 to 10 percent \n        are diagnosed with the disease before age 60 and deemed \n        ``early-onset''.\n            (4) Traumatic brain injury is a neurological condition that \n        typically results from a blow or jolt to the head or a \n        penetrating head injury and that can impact one or more parts \n        of the brain, thereby temporarily or permanently disrupting \n        normal brain function. The Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention estimates that 1,400,000 new cases of TBI occur \n        annually, resulting in disabilities affecting up to 90,000 \n        individuals among a broad range of age groups. Traumatic brain \n        injury is a serious issue that affects military service \n        members. Estimates in prior military conflicts, indicate that \n        TBI was present in 14 to 20 percent of surviving casualties.\n            (5) Family caregivers are a crucial source of support and \n        assistance for individuals suffering with disabilities. Family \n        caregivers, the majority of whom are women, provide an \n        estimated $306,000,000,000 in unpaid services annually. The \n        current pool of potential family caregivers is dwindling, from \n        11 potential caregivers for each individual needing care today \n        to a projected ratio of 4 potential caregivers for each such \n        individual by 2050.\n            (6) Recent studies indicate that the total estimated cost \n        to employers for full-time employees with intensive caregiving \n        responsibilities is $17,100,000,000 annually. The total \n        estimated cost to employers for all full-time, employed \n        caregivers is $33,600,000,000 annually.\n            (7) Adult day programs can offer services, including \n        medical care, rehabilitation therapies, dignified assistance \n        with the activities of daily living, nutrition therapy, health \n        monitoring, social interaction, stimulating activities, and \n        transportation to seniors, individuals with disabilities, and \n        younger adults with chronic diseases.\n            (8) Adult day programs geared toward individuals living \n        with neurological diseases or conditions such as MS, \n        Parkinson's disease, TBI, or other similar diseases or \n        conditions, provide an important response to the needs of \n        individuals living with these conditions and the caregivers of \n        such individuals. Adult day programs can help to ameliorate \n        symptoms, reduce dependency, provide important socialization \n        opportunities, and maintain quality of life.\n            (9) Adult day programs have been shown to provide a range \n        of documented benefits, including improvements in functional \n        status, social support, and reductions in fatigue, depression, \n        and pain. Adult day programs also reduce ongoing medical care \n        and hospital costs and decrease admissions to nursing home \n        facilities, which can be costly for many families, by allowing \n        individuals to receive health and social services while \n        continuing to live at home.\n            (10) There are currently few adult day programs focused on \n        younger adult populations in the United States. As a result, \n        the majority of individuals living with neurological diseases \n        are unable to access this important opportunity for maximizing \n        their health and wellness. Although individuals living with \n        neurological diseases or conditions may be able to access other \n        existing adult day programs, such programs are not typically \n        intended for younger adults living with chronic diseases or \n        conditions, and may not provide the appropriate services to \n        meet the age-related or disability status of these individuals.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ADULT DAY PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Survey of Existing Adult Day Programs.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this section, the Assistant Secretary for \n        Aging shall initiate a comprehensive survey of current adult \n        day programs that provide care and support to individuals \n        living with neurological diseases or conditions, including \n        multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain \n        injury, and any other similar disease or condition.\n            (2) Survey elements.--In carrying out the survey under \n        paragraph (1), the Assistant Secretary for Aging may utilize \n        existing publicly available research on adult day programs, and \n        shall--\n                    (A) identify ongoing successful adult day programs, \n                including by providing a brief description of how such \n                programs were initially established and funded;\n                    (B) develop a set of best practices to help guide \n                the establishment and replication of additional \n                successful adult day programs, including--\n                            (i) program guidelines;\n                            (ii) recommendations on the scope of \n                        services that should be provided (which may \n                        include rehabilitation therapy, psychosocial \n                        support, social stimulation and interaction, \n                        and spiritual, educational, or other such \n                        services); and\n                            (iii) performance goals and indicators to \n                        measure and analyze the outcomes generated by \n                        the services provided and to evaluate the \n                        overall success of the program; and\n                    (C) evaluate the extent to which the Administration \n                on Aging supports adult day programs, either directly \n                or indirectly, through current Federal grant programs.\n            (3) Report.--Not later than 180 days after initiating the \n        survey under paragraph (1), the Assistant Secretary for Aging \n        shall prepare and make publicly available a summary report on \n        the results of the survey. Such report shall include each of \n        the elements described in paragraph (2).\n    (b) Establishment of Grant Program.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after producing the \n        report required by subsection (a)(3), the Assistant Secretary \n        for Aging shall establish within the Administration on Aging a \n        competitive grant program for awarding grants annually to \n        eligible entities, based on the best practices developed under \n        subsection (a), to fund adult day programs.\n            (2) Eligible entities.--In order to be eligible for a grant \n        under this subsection, an entity shall demonstrate the \n        following:\n                    (A) Understanding of the special needs of \n                individuals living with neurological diseases or \n                conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's \n                disease, traumatic brain injury, or other similar \n                diseases or conditions, including the functional \n                abilities of such individuals and the potential \n                complications across all types of cases and stages of \n                such diseases or conditions.\n                    (B) Understanding of the issues experienced by \n                family caregivers who assist a family member with a \n                neurological disease or condition such as multiple \n                sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, \n                or other similar disease or condition.\n                    (C) A capacity to provide the services recommended \n                by the best practices developed under subsection (a).\n            (3) Additional selection requirement.--The Assistant \n        Secretary for Aging shall not award a grant to an entity under \n        this subsection if the amount of the award would constitute \n        more than 40 percent of the operating budget of the entity in \n        the fiscal year for which funds for the grant are authorized to \n        be expended. For purposes of this subsection, the fair market \n        value of annual in-kind contributions of equipment or services \n        shall be considered as part of the operating budget of the \n        entity.\n            (4) Selection of grant recipients.--Not later than 90 days \n        after establishing the grant program under this subsection, the \n        Assistant Secretary for Aging shall award the first annual \n        series of grants under the program.
