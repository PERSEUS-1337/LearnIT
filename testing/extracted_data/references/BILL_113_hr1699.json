PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a consistent \nand enforceable standard for labeling of foods produced using genetic \nengineering, including fish, thereby providing consumers with knowledge \nof how their food is produced.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the process of genetically engineering food organisms \n        results in material changes to food derived from those \n        organisms;\n            (2) the Food and Drug Administration requires the labeling \n        of more than 3,000 ingredients, additives, and processes;\n            (3) individuals in the United States have a right to know \n        if their food was produced with genetic engineering for a \n        variety of reasons, including health, economic, environmental, \n        religious, and ethical;\n            (4) more than 60 countries, including the United Kingdom \n        and all other countries of the European Union, South Korea, \n        Japan, Brazil, Australia, India, China, and other key United \n        States trading partners have laws or regulations mandating \n        disclosure of genetically engineered food on food labels;\n            (5) in 2011, Codex Alimentarius, the food standards \n        organization of the United Nations, adopted a text that \n        indicates that governments can decide on whether and how to \n        label foods produced with genetic engineering; and\n            (6) mandatory identification of food produced with genetic \n        engineering can be a critical method of preserving the economic \n        value of exports or domestically sensitive markets with \n        labeling requirements for genetically engineered foods.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(z)(1) If it is a food that has been genetically engineered or \ncontains 1 or more genetically engineered ingredients, unless such \ninformation is clearly disclosed, as determined by the Secretary.\n    ``(2) This paragraph does not apply to food that--\n            ``(A) is served in restaurants or other similar eating \n        establishments, such as cafeterias and carryouts;\n            ``(B) is a medical food (as defined in section 5(b) of the \n        Orphan Drug Act);\n            ``(C) is a food that would be subject to this paragraph \n        solely because it was produced using a genetically engineered \n        vaccine;
