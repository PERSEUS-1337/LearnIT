FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An educated workforce is crucial to the success of the \n        United States economy. Access to higher education for all \n        students is critical to maintaining an educated workforce. More \n        than 80 percent of the 23,000,000 jobs that will be created in \n        the next 10 years will require postsecondary education. Only 36 \n        percent of all 18- to 24-year olds are currently enrolled in \n        postsecondary education.\n            (2) Workers with bachelor's degrees earn on average $17,000 \n        more annually than workers with only high school diplomas. \n        Workers who earn bachelor's degrees can be expected to earn \n        $1,000,000 more over a lifetime than those who only finished \n        high school.\n            (3) The ACT recommends that schools--\n                    (A) provide student guidance to engage students in \n                college and career awareness; and\n                    (B) ensure that students enroll in a rigorous \n                curriculum to prepare for postsecondary education.\n            (4) The Department of Education reports that the average \n        student-to-counselor ratio in high schools is 315:1. This falls \n        far above the ratio recommended by the American School \n        Counselor Association, which is 250:1. While school counselors \n        at private schools spend an average of 58 percent of their time \n        on postsecondary education counseling, counselors in public \n        schools spend an average of 25 percent of their time on \n        postsecondary education counseling.\n            (5) While just 57 percent of students from the lowest \n        income quartile enroll in college, 87 percent of students from \n        the top income quartile enroll. Of students who were in eighth \n        grade in 2000, only 20 percent of the lowest-income students \n        are projected to attain a bachelor's degree by 2012, compared \n        to 68 percent of the highest income group, according to the \n        Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance in 2006.\n            (6) A recent report by the Consortium on Chicago School \n        Research found that only 41 percent of Chicago public school \n        students who aspire to go to college took the steps necessary \n        to apply to and enroll in a 4-year institution of higher \n        education. The report also reveals that only \\1/3\\ of Chicago \n        students who want to attend a 4-year institution of higher \n        education enroll in a school that matches their qualifications. \n        Even among students qualified to attend a selective college, 29 \n        percent enrolled in a community college or did not enroll at \n        all.\n            (7) The Consortium found that many Chicago public school \n        students do not complete the Free Application for Federal \n        Student Aid, even though students who apply for Federal \n        financial aid are 50 percent more likely to enroll in college. \n        Sixty-five percent of public secondary school counselors at \n        low-income schools believe that students and parents are \n        discouraged from considering college as an option due to lack \n        of knowledge about financial aid.\n            (8) Low-income and first-generation families often \n        overestimate the cost of tuition and underestimate available \n        aid; students from these backgrounds have access to fewer \n        college application resources and financial aid resources than \n        other groups, and are less likely to fulfill their \n        postsecondary plans as a result.\n            (9) College preparation intervention programs can double \n        the college-going rates for at-risk youth, can expand students' \n        educational aspirations, and can boost college enrollment and \n        graduation rates.\n\nSEC. 3.
