FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that, in carrying out title I of the \nClean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (referred to in this Act as the \n``Administrator'') has failed to--\n            (1) adequately consider alternative programs to centralized \n        vehicle emission testing programs, as required by section \n        182(c)(3)(C)(vi) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7511a(c)(3)(C)(vi)); \n        and\n            (2) provide adequate credit to States for the alternative \n        programs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to require the \nAdministrator to--\n            (1) reassess the determinations of the Administrator with \n        respect to the equivalency of centralized and decentralized \n        programs under section 182(c)(3)(C)(vi) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n        7511a(c)(3)(C)(vi)); and\n            (2) issue new regulations governing the programs that--\n                    (A) result in minimum disruption to the ability of \n                States to comply with other requirements of such Act \n                (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); and\n                    (B) provide States a reasonable opportunity to \n                comply with the new regulations and implement \n                decentralized testing programs.\n\nSEC. 102. IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCED VEHICLE INSPECTION PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a \nState shall not be required to implement an enhanced vehicle inspection \nand maintenance program under section 182(c)(3)(42 U.S.C. 7511a(c)(3)) \nor section 184 (42 U.S.C. 7511c) of the Clean Air Act before the date 2 \nyears after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Reassessment of Regulations.--\n            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall--\n                    (A) immediately rescind the regulations issued on \n                November 5, 1992 (57 Fed. Reg. 52950), relating to \n                operation of the program described in subsection (a) on \n                a centralized basis; and\n                    (B) during the period beginning on the date of \n                enactment of this Act and ending 2 years thereafter--\n                            (i) reassess the determinations made by the \n                        Administrator with respect to operation of the \n                        program described in subsection (a) on a \n                        centralized basis, taking into consideration \n                        comments submitted by States; and\n                            (ii) issue new regulations relating to \n                        operation of the program described in \n                        subsection (a) on a centralized basis.\n            (2) Requirements.--The regulations issued under paragraph \n        (1)(B)(ii) shall--\n                    (A) in accordance with the intent of section \n                182(c)(3)(C)(vi) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n                7511a(c)(3)(C)(vi)) and section 184 of that Act (42 \n                U.S.C. 7511c)--\n                            (i) make reasonably available to States the \n                        option of operation of the program described in \n                        subsection (a) on a decentralized basis; and\n                            (ii) establish criteria that a State must \n                        meet in order to demonstrate that a \n                        decentralized program of the State is equally \n                        effective as a centralized program; and\n                    (B)(i) provide each State a reasonable opportunity \n                to submit (at the option of the State) a new revision \n                to a plan under section 182(c)(3) (42 U.S.C. \n                7511a(c)(3)) or 184 (42 U.S.C. 7511c) of such Act based \n                on the new regulations, which revision shall replace \n                any revision to a plan previously submitted by the \n                State under section 182(c)(3) or 184 of such Act; and\n                    (ii) include a schedule that provides States a \n                reasonable opportunity to implement any new revisions \n                to plans that they submit.\n            (3) Judicial review.--Notwithstanding section 706 of title \n        5, United States Code, or any other provision of law, if the \n        regulations issued pursuant to paragraph (1)(B)(ii) are \n        reviewed by a court, the court shall hold unlawful and set \n        aside the regulations if the regulations are found to be \n        unsupported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n    (c) Prohibition on Imposition of Sanctions.--Until such time as the \nAdministrator has carried out subsection (b)(1)--\n            (1) the Administrator may not issue a finding, disapproval, \n        or determination under section 179(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 7509(a)), or apply a sanction specified in section \n        179(b) of such Act, to a State with respect to a failure to \n        implement a program described in subsection (a), or any portion \n        of such a program; and\n            (2) the Administrator and the Administrator of the Federal \n        Highway Administration of the Department of Transportation may \n        not take any adverse action, against a State with respect to a \n        failure described in paragraph (1), under\n                    (A) section 176 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n                7506);\n                    (B) chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code;\n                    (C) subpart T of part 51, or subpart A of part 93, \n                of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (commonly \n                known as the ``transportation conformity rule''); or\n                    (D) part 6, 51, or 93 of title 40, Code of Federal \n                Regulations (commonly known as the ``general conformity \n                rule'').\n    (d) Full Credit for Decentralized Programs.--Until such time as the \nAdministrator has carried out subsection (b)(1), for the purpose of the \nattainment demonstration and the reasonable further progress \ndemonstration required under section 182(c)(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 \nU.S.C. 7511a(c)(2)), the Administrator shall consider the operation of \nthe program described in subsection (a) on a decentralized basis as \nequivalent to the operation of the program on a centralized basis in \nany case in which a State demonstrates that a determination of such an \nequivalency is reasonable.\n    (e) Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance in Ozone Transport \nRegions.--Section 184(b)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n7511c(b)(1)(A)) is amended by striking ``182(c)(2)(A)(pertaining to \nenhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs)'' and inserting \n``182(b)(4)(relating to motor vehicle inspection and maintenance) or, \nin the case of an area classified as serious, severe, or extreme, \nsection 182(c)(3)(A)(relating to enhanced vehicle inspection and \nmaintenance programs)''.\n\n              TITLE II--REDESIGNATION OF ATTAINMENT AREAS\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) The year 1988 was a climatological anomaly, with data \n        collection revealing unparalleled, frequent, and high \n        temperatures.\n            (2) The frequency and persistence of high temperature days \n        are the most significant factors in causing ambient ozone air \n        pollution episodes.\n            (3) The number of ambient ozone air pollution exceedance \n        days on a national average (excluding the State of California) \n        was 607 days in 1988, compared to 104 days in 1993, and 93 days \n        in 1994.\n            (4) In a 3-year measurement of ozone which included 1988 \n        data, the Environmental Protection Agency found 98 regions as \n        ozone nonattainment under the Clean Air Act.\n            (5) In a 3-year average of ozone measurement excluding 1988 \n        data, the Environmental Protection Agency found 41 of the 98 \n        previously designated nonattainment regions registering ozone \n        attainment under the Clean Air Act for the consecutive years \n        1991, 1992, 1993.\n\nSEC. 202. REDESIGNATION AS ATTAINMENT.\n\n    Section 107(d)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7407(d)(3)(B)) \nis amended by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(B)'', and adding the following \nnew clause (ii) at the end thereof:\n            ``(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n        paragraph, if the Governor submits a redesignation of an \n        appropriate area, or portion thereof, from nonattainment to \n        attainment, and such designation is based upon the attainment \n        of the relevant National Ambient Air Quality Standard for 3 \n        consecutive years, such redesignation shall become effective \n        immediately upon receipt by the Administrator.''."
