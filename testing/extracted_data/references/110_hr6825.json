    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Drought, population increases, and environmental needs \n        are exacerbating water supply issues across the western United \n        States, including on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation in \n        southwestern Colorado.\n            (2) A report of the General Accounting Office from 2006 \n        identified significant issues with the Pine River Indian \n        Irrigation Project, including that key facilities of the Pine \n        River Indian Irrigation Project are severely deteriorated and \n        barely, if at all, operable.\n            (3) Operations and maintenance fees are not sufficient to \n        address the Pine River Indian Irrigation Project's condition, \n        even though the Bureau of Indian Affairs has sought to double \n        those fees, from $8.50 to $17.00, in recent years.\n            (4) The 2006 General Accounting Office report also notes \n        that a prior study done by the Bureau of Reclamation found that \n        water users could not even afford to pay the lower operations \n        and maintenance fees of $8.50 and operate a profitable farming \n        operation.\n            (5) The benefits of rehabilitating and repairing the Pine \n        River Indian Irrigation Project's irrigation infrastructure \n        include--\n                    (A) water conservation;\n                    (B) extending available water supply;\n                    (C) increasing agricultural production;\n                    (D) economic benefits;\n                    (E) safer facilities; and\n                    (F) preserving the culture of the Southern Ute \n                Indian Tribe.\n            (6) While the Pine River Indian Irrigation Project is \n        currently managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Southern \n        Ute Indian Tribe also receives water from facilities owned or \n        operated by the Bureau of Reclamation.\n            (7) Rehabilitation and repair of the Pine River Indian \n        Irrigation Project's infrastructure by the Bureau of \n        Reclamation would improve--\n                    (A) overall water management; and\n                    (B) the ability of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe \n                and the Bureau of Reclamation to address potential \n                water conflicts.\n\nSEC. 2.
