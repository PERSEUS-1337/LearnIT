FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Genomic science promises a revolution in the \n        development of new and effective genomic technologies and other \n        innovations, and it is in the national interest to speed the \n        development and deployment of these new technologies through \n        policies that promote innovation in the field of genomic \n        science and technology.\n            (2) While Federal innovation policies can help stimulate \n        innovation by attracting capital investment to the development \n        of commercial products, such policies can also inhibit basic \n        research and hinder sharing of information that is the basis of \n        scientific progress, thereby slowing the innovation process.\n            (3) Intellectual property policies for genomic science and \n        technology products are being implemented without an adequate \n        understanding and consideration of the net impact of such \n        policies on the innovation process.\n            (4) Decisions about intellectual property policy being made \n        now are likely to have significant impacts on basic research \n        and the development of genomic technology for decades to come.\n            (5) The Office of Science and Technology Policy is uniquely \n        positioned to lead the development of a coordinated, \n        interagency policy to promote innovation in genomic science and \n        technology. A definitive study coordinated by the Office of \n        Science and Technology Policy that identifies the impacts of \n        Federal innovation policy on the innovation pipeline for \n        genomic technology and includes recommendations for policies, \n        including any statutory changes needed to optimize the genomic \n        technology innovation pipeline, would contribute significantly \n        to the development of the policy.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY.\n\n    (a) Requirement.--The Director of the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy shall conduct, or may contract with the National \nAcademy of Sciences to conduct, a study that assesses the impact of \nFederal policies, including intellectual property policies, on the \ninnovation process for genomic technologies.\n    (b) Consultation.--In conducting the study, the Director of the \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy shall consult with the National \nScience and Technology Council, the National Science Foundation, the \nSecretary of Energy, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, and other agencies or divisions of agencies the \nDirector considers appropriate.\n    (c) Advisory Committee.--In conducting the study, the Director of \nthe Office of Science and Technology Policy shall consult with an \nadvisory committee, organized as a subcommittee of the President's \nCommittee of Advisors on Science and Technology, that shall include \nbalanced membership from research universities and other nonprofit \nresearch institutions, industry, economists, legal experts, \nbioethicists, clinicians and clinical scientists, genetic \npractitioners, and advocacy groups.\n    (d) Contents.--The study shall--\n            (1) identify and quantify, to extent possible, the actual \n        and reasonably expected effects of innovation policy on genomic \n        science and technology innovation;\n            (2) explicitly consider various alternative levels of \n        intellectual property protection genomic materials may receive \n        and the likely impact of the various levels of protection on \n        each element of the innovation pipeline, including--\n                    (A) fundamental genomic research carried out at \n                universities and other nonprofit research institutions;\n                    (B) commercial genomic research at universities, \n                nonprofit research institutions, and for-profit \n                institutions, including the expected effects on \n                intracompany investment and external private capital;\n                    (C) development of commercial genomic technologies, \n                including the expected effects on investment capital; \n                and\n                    (D) access to genomic technologies and processes; \n                and\n            (3) include an assessment of the net impact of Federal \n        innovation policies on innovation for genomic technologies, \n        including an assessment of--\n                    (A) researchers' access to genomic materials;\n                    (B) the rate of innovation;\n                    (C) the quality of innovation;\n                    (D) the cost of new genomic technologies brought to \n                market;\n                    (E) the impact of restricted access to genomic \n                diagnostics on evaluation, improvement, and clinical \n                utilization;\n                    (F) the cost and availability of innovative \n                technology;\n                    (G) whether Federal innovation policies create \n                barriers to research through denial of use of a \n                research tool, increased costs of licensing, legal and \n                litigation costs, transaction costs, or the perception \n                of increased legal liability, or hinder the access of \n                researchers to genomic materials and to databases of \n                genomic sequence information;\n                    (H) whether Federal innovation policies affect the \n                choice of area of research conducted by researchers or \n                institutions or provide positive benefits to such \n                research, including additional funding from private \n                sector partners; and\n                    (I) the range of incentives providing motivation \n                for genetics research and technology development other \n                than intellectual property protection.\n\nSEC. 4.
