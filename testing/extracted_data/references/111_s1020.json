    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Patient-Focused Critical Care \nEnhancement Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to optimize the delivery of critical \ncare medicine and expand the critical care workforce.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Based on the Health Resources and Services Administration's May \n2006 Report to Congress, The Critical Care Workforce: A Study of the \nSupply and Demand for Critical Care Physicians, Congress makes the \nfollowing findings:\n            (1) In 2000, an estimated 18,000,000 inpatient days of ICU \n        care were provided in the United States through approximately \n        59,000 ICU beds in 3,200 hospitals.\n            (2) Patient outcomes and the quality of care in the ICU are \n        related to who delivers that care and how care is organized.\n            (3) The demand in the United States for critical care \n        medical services is rising sharply and will continue to rise \n        sharply largely as a result of the following 3 factors:\n                    (A) There is strong evidence demonstrating \n                improvements in outcomes and efficiency when intensive \n                care services are provided by nurses and intensivist \n                physicians who have advanced specialty training in \n                critical care medicine.\n                    (B) The Leapfrog Group, health care payors, and \n                providers are encouraging greater use of such personnel \n                in intensive care settings.\n                    (C) Critical care services are overwhelmingly \n                consumed by patients over the age of 65 and the aging \n                of the United States population is driving demand for \n                these services.\n            (4) The future growth in the number of critical care \n        physicians in ICU settings will be insufficient to keep pace \n        with growing demand.\n            (5) This growing shortage of critical care physicians \n        presents a serious threat to the quality and availability of \n        health care services in the United States.\n            (6) This shortage will disproportionately impact rural and \n        other areas of the United States that already often suffer from \n        a suboptimal level of critical care services.\n\nSEC. 4. RESEARCH.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nthrough the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, shall conduct \nresearch to assess--\n            (1) the standardization of critical care protocols, \n        intensive care unit layout, equipment interoperability, and \n        medical informatics;\n            (2) the impact of differences in staffing, organization, \n        size, and structure of intensive care units on access, quality, \n        and efficiency of care; and\n            (3) coordinated community and regional approaches to \n        providing critical care services, including approaches whereby \n        critical care patients are assessed and provided care based \n        upon intensity of services required.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality shall submit a report to Congress, that, based on the review \nunder subsection (a), evaluates and makes recommendations regarding \nbest practices in critical care medicine.\n\nSEC. 5. INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO CRITICAL CARE SERVICES.\n\n    The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall undertake the \nfollowing demonstration projects:\n            (1) Optimization of critical care services.--\n                    (A) In general.--The Administrator of the Centers \n                for Medicare & Medicaid Services shall solicit \n                proposals submitted by inpatient providers of critical \n                care services who propose to demonstrate methods to \n                optimize the provision of critical care services to \n                Medicare beneficiaries through innovations in such \n                areas as staffing, ICU arrangement, and utilization of \n                technology.\n                    (B) Funding of proposals.--The Administrator of the \n                Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services shall fund not \n                more than 5 proposals, not less than 1 of which shall \n                focus on the training of hospital-based physicians in \n                rural or community, or both, hospital facilities in the \n                provision of critical care medicine. Such projects \n                shall emphasize outcome measures based on the Institute \n                of Medicine's following 6 domains of quality care:\n                            (i) Care should be safe.\n                            (ii) Care should be effective.\n                            (iii) Care should be patient-centered.\n                            (iv) Care should be timely.\n                            (v) Care should be efficient.\n                            (vi) Care should be equitable.\n            (2) Family assistance programs for the critically ill.--\n                    (A) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n                Services shall solicit proposals and make an award to \n                support a consortium consisting of 1 or more providers \n                of inpatient critical care services and a medical \n                specialty society involved in the education and \n                training of critical care providers.\n                    (B) Measurement and evaluation.--A provider that \n                receives support under subparagraph (A) shall measure \n                and evaluate outcomes derived from a ``family-\n                centered'' approach to the provision of inpatient \n                critical care services that includes direct and \n                sustained communication and contact with beneficiary \n                family members, involvement of family members in the \n                critical care decisionmaking process, and \n                responsiveness of critical care providers to family \n                requests. Such project shall evaluate the impact of a \n                family-centered, multiprofessional team approach on, \n                and the correlation between--\n                            (i) family satisfaction;\n                            (ii) staff satisfaction;\n                            (iii) length of patient stay in an \n                        intensive care unit; and\n                            (iv) cost of care.\n                    (C) Outcome measures.--A provider that receives \n                support under subparagraph (A) shall emphasize outcome \n                measures based on the Institute of Medicine's following \n                6 domains of quality care:\n                            (i) Care should be safe.\n                            (ii) Care should be effective.\n                            (iii) Care should be patient-centered.\n                            (iv) Care should be timely.\n                            (v) Care should be efficient.\n                            (vi) Care should be equitable.\n\nSEC. 6.
