    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Commonwealth of \nAustralia Free Trade Agreement Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Economic growth in the United States has been \n        considerably enhanced by bilateral agreements to lower barriers \n        for United States exports.\n            (2) Increased trade and economic growth are not ends in \n        themselves. Trade and economic growth should encourage \n        sustainable development, raise living standards, promote higher \n        labor standards, and enhance the welfare and quality of life of \n        all citizens of the United States and the Commonwealth of \n        Australia.\n            (3) It is inappropriate to encourage trade by relaxing \n        domestic environmental laws or domestic labor laws.\n            (4) Countries that open their domestic markets, remove \n        barriers to foreign direct investment, and promote free \n        enterprise, empower their citizens to alleviate poverty and \n        maintain social and environmental values.\n            (5) The Commonwealth of Australia has participated fully in \n        World Trade Organization programs and policies that promote \n        open trade.\n            (6) At the 1996 World Trade Organization Ministerial in \n        Singapore, the Commonwealth of Australia reaffirmed its \n        commitment to internationally recognized core labor standards.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY WITH RESPECT TO TRADE.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to seek the elimination of \ntariff and nontariff barriers in order to achieve more open market \naccess, on a reciprocal basis, to internationally traded goods and \nservice, through bilateral free trade agreements with like-minded \ncountries. Such agreements should address the following:\n            (1) National treatment and market access for agricultural \n        and industrial products.\n            (2) Rules for determining which goods originate in the \n        territory of the United States and the Commonwealth of \n        Australia.\n            (3) Customs procedures that facilitate trade and collection \n        of trade statistics, while ensuring the validity of claims for \n        preferential treatment.\n            (4) Science-based, nondiscriminatory sanitary, \n        phytosanitary, and technical standards, including voluntary \n        standards.\n            (5) Safeguard provisions for industries that have \n        sustained, or are threatened with, serious economic injury from \n        import surges.\n            (6) Government procurement procedures.\n            (7) National treatment and rights of establishment for \n        foreign direct investors.\n            (8) National treatment and market access for traded \n        services, including consumption of services abroad, cross-\n        border provision of services, rights of establishment of \n        commercial presence, and the movement of natural persons.\n            (9) Protection of intellectual property.\n            (10) Transparency of legal and regulatory regimes.\n            (11) Measures to promote electronic commerce.\n            (12) Trade-related environmental measures, and the \n        potential for both favorable and adverse environmental impacts.\n            (13) Adherence to internationally recognized core labor \n        standards.\n\nSEC. 4. NEGOTIATION OF A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH COMMONWEALTH OF \n              AUSTRALIA.\n\n    Subject to section 5, the President is authorized to enter into an \nagreement with Commonwealth of Australia consistent with the policy \ndescribed section 3, and the provisions of section 151(c) of the Trade \nAct of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 219 1(c)) shall apply with respect to a bill to \nimplement such agreement.\n\nSEC. 5.
