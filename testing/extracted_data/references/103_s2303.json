    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Anaktuvuk Pass Land Exchange and \nWilderness Redesignation Act of 1994''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 \n        U.S.C. 460hh et seq.), enacted on December 2, 1980, established \n        the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and the \n        Gates of the Arctic Wilderness.\n            (2) The village of Anaktuvuk Pass, located in the highlands \n        of the central Brooks Range, is virtually surrounded by such \n        national park and wilderness area.\n            (3) Unlike most other Alaska Native communities, the \n        village of Anaktuvuk Pass is not located on a major river, \n        lake, or coastline that can be used as a means of access.\n            (4) The residents of Anaktuvuk Pass have relied \n        increasingly on snow machines in winter and all-terrain \n        vehicles in summer as their primary means of access to pursue \n        caribou and other subsistence resources.\n            (5) In a land exchange agreement in 1983, linear easements \n        were reserved by the Inupiat Eskimo people for use of all-\n        terrain vehicles across certain national park lands, mostly \n        along stream and river banks.\n            (6) Such linear easements proved unsatisfactory, because \n        such easements provided inadequate access to subsistence \n        resources and caused excessive environmental impact from \n        concentrated use.\n            (7) Officials of the National -P-a-r-k -S-e-r-v-i-c-e \n        -a-n-d -t-h-e Park Service and Nunamiut Corporation initiated \n        discussions in 1985 to address concerns over the use of all-\n        terrain vehicles on park and wilderness land.\n            (8) Such discussions resulted in an agreement, originally \n        executed in 1992, and subsequently amended in 1993 and 1994, \n        between the National -P-a-r-k -S-e-r-v-i-c-e -a-n-d -t-h-e Park \n        Service and Nunamiut Corporation and the city of Anaktuvuk \n        Pass, -A-l-a-s-k-a-, -a-n-d -t-h-e Alaska, and Arctic Slope \n        Regional Corporation.\n            (9) The full effectuation of the agreement, by its terms, \n        described in paragraph (7) requires the approval and \n        ratification by Congress.\n\nSEC. 3.
