FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There is a pressing and increasing need for rental \n        housing for rural families and senior citizens, as evidenced by \n        the fact that--\n                    (A) two-thirds of extremely low-income and very \n                low-income rural households do not have access to \n                affordable rental housing units;\n                    (B) more than 900,000 rural rental households (10.4 \n                percent) live in either severely or moderately \n                inadequate housing; and\n                    (C) substandard housing is a problem for 547,000 \n                rural renters, and approximately 165,000 rural rental \n                units are overcrowded.\n            (2) Many rural United States households live with serious \n        housing problems, including a lack of basic water and \n        wastewater services, structural insufficiencies, and \n        overcrowding, as shown by the fact that--\n                    (A) 28 percent, or 10,400,000, rural households in \n                the United States live with some kind of serious \n                housing problem;\n                    (B) approximately 1,000,000 rural renters have \n                multiple housing problems; and\n                    (C) an estimated 2,600,000 rural households live in \n                substandard housing with severe structural damage or \n                without indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity.\n            (3) In rural America--\n                    (A) one-third of all renters pay more than 30 \n                percent of their income for housing;\n                    (B) 20 percent of rural renters pay more than 50 \n                percent of their income for housing; and\n                    (C) 92 percent of all rural renters with \n                significant housing problems pay more than 50 percent \n                of their income for housing costs, and 60 percent pay \n                more than 70 percent of their income for housing.\n            (4) Rural economies are often less diverse, and therefore, \n        jobs and economic opportunity are limited because--\n                    (A) factors that exist in rural environments, such \n                as remoteness and low population density, lead to \n                limited access to many forces driving the economy, such \n                as technology, lending, and investment; and\n                    (B) local expertise is often limited in rural areas \n                where the economies are focused on farming or natural \n                resource-based industries.\n            (5) Rural areas have less access to credit than \n        metropolitan areas since--\n                    (A) banks and other investors that look for larger \n                projects with lower risk seek metropolitan areas for \n                loans and investment;\n                    (B) credit that is available is often insufficient, \n                leading to the need for interim or bridge financing; \n                and\n                    (C) credit in rural areas is often more expensive \n                and available at less favorable terms than in \n                metropolitan areas.\n            (6) The Federal Government investment in rural rental \n        housing has dropped during the last 10 years, as evidenced by \n        the fact that--\n                    (A) Federal spending for rural rental housing has \n                been cut by 73 percent since 1994; and\n                    (B) rural rental housing unit production financed \n                by the Federal Government has been reduced by 88 \n                percent since 1990.\n            (7) To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, the \n        Federal Government must work in partnership with State and \n        local governments, private financial institutions, private \n        philanthropic institutions, and the private sector, including \n        nonprofit organizations.\n\nSEC. 3.
