FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The consumption of beverage alcohol by underage youth \n        is an ongoing national concern. About 10.8 million Americans \n        between the ages of 12 to 20--for whom alcohol is illegal--\n        report current alcohol use, approximately 29 percent of that \n        age group. (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n        Administration; 2004 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.)\n            (2) Despite the seriousness of the problem that exists, \n        significant declines have been noted over the past decade among \n        8th, 10th and 12th graders. Since 1991, ``binge drinking'' has \n        declined by 19 percent for 8th graders; 8 percent for 10th \n        graders; and 6 percent for 12th graders, and ``past month \n        drinking'' has declined by 32 percent for 8th graders; 22 \n        percent for 10th graders; and 13 percent for 12th graders (2005 \n        Monitoring the Future Survey).\n            (3) However, 42 percent of college students report having \n        five or more drinks in a row at least once in the past two \n        weeks. Sixty-eight percent report drinking alcohol within the \n        past month. Consumption patterns in this category have remained \n        flat over the last decade. (Johnson, et al., 2004 Monitoring \n        the Future Study.)\n            (4) Sixty-five percent of underage youth who drink obtain \n        alcohol from family and friends. Seven percent of youth report \n        they obtained alcohol from retailers who failed to check for \n        identification (Teenage Research Unlimited, Omnibus 2003).\n            (5) Data from the National Academy of Sciences/Institute of \n        Medicine, the Federal Trade Commission and the American Medical \n        Association show that most youth who drink obtain alcohol \n        primarily through non-commercial sources, such as family and \n        friends.\n            (6) In 2000, an estimated $71 million of federally \n        appropriated funding was dedicated to the prevention of \n        underage drinking. Many Federal agencies have program \n        activities that include the prevention of underage drinking, \n        but for which agency officials have not isolated funding \n        specific to alcohol. For example, $769 million in funding was \n        used for activities that addressed the prevention of alcohol \n        and other drug use that targeted either youth or both youth and \n        the broader community. (GAO-01-503, Underage Drinking, \n        Information on Federal Funds Targeted at Prevention, 2001.)\n            (7) The Department of Health and Human Services/Substance \n        Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration stated that \n        programs that have not been rigorously evaluated cannot be \n        assumed to be effective. Programs that are funded by the \n        Federal Government should have evidence of effectiveness (A \n        Comprehensive Plan for Preventing and Reducing Underage \n        Drinking, 2006).\n            (8) Based upon evidence of effectiveness, existing Federal \n        funding should be reallocated to programs and grants to States \n        with effective measures to prevent and reduce underage \n        drinking.\n\nSEC. 3. ADMINISTRATION; CONSULTATION.\n\n    (a) Administration.--This Act shall be carried out by the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services on behalf of the Interagency Coordinating \nCommittee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking (referred to in this \nAct as ``ICCPUD'').\n    (b) Consultation With Nonfederal Entities.--In carrying out this \nAct, the Secretary shall consult with States, public and private \nentities, including colleges and universities; public health and \nconsumer organizations; and the beverage alcohol industry.\n\nSEC. 4. EVALUATION OF FEDERAL UNDERAGE DRINKING PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall in accordance with subsection \n(b) evaluate programs that are carried out in whole or in part with \nFederal funds and are intended to prevent and reduce the consumption of \nbeverage alcohol by minors (referred to in this Act as ``underage \ndrinking'').\n    (b) Certain Requirements.--In carrying out subsection (a), the \nSecretary shall--\n            (1) identify Federal underage drinking programs--\n                    (A) that primarily make awards of grants, \n                cooperative agreements, or contracts to States or local \n                governments; and\n                    (B) that primarily make such awards to private \n                entities;\n            (2) determine the cost of each of the programs, with \n        allocations specific to Federal, State, local, and private \n        expenditures; and\n            (3) evaluate all programs and require grantees to build the \n        evaluation costs into grant proposals.\n    (c) Certain Requirements.--With respect to evaluations under \nsubsection (a):\n            (1) The Secretary shall work jointly with the funded entity \n        to develop evaluation criteria appropriate to each program.\n            (2) The Secretary shall determine that all evaluations are \n        properly completed in a timely fashion.\n            (3) Programs that do not receive a score that demonstrates \n        effectiveness will have to be modified or will not be eligible \n        for future funding.\n    (d) Report to Congress.--The Secretary shall complete the \nevaluations under subsection (a) and submit to the Congress a report \nsummarizing the results of the evaluations. The report shall include \nthe information pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) and recommendations \nfor reallocating Federal funding for underage drinking prevention and \nreduction programs toward the incentive grant created in section 5 or \nto programs deemed to be effective and evidence-based. The list of \nevaluated and evidence-based programs should be made available online \nand should be evaluated on a revolving basis.\n\nSEC. 5. INCENTIVE GRANTS TO STATES REGARDING MEASURES TO PREVENT OR \n              REDUCE UNDERAGE DRINKING.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary may make grants to eligible States \nfor the purpose of carrying out activities to prevent, and reduce \nunderage drinking by reallocating funding from grants and programs \ndeemed ineffective in section 4.\n    (b) Eligible States.--A State is an eligible State for purposes of \nthis section if the State has implemented not fewer than five of the \nfollowing ten policies with respect to underage drinking:\n            (1) The State has demonstrated coordination among agencies, \n        including public health, alcohol beverage control and law \n        enforcement, to prevent and reduce underage drinking and abuse \n        by providing prevention and treatment as well as enforcing laws \n        regarding the illegal purchase, attempt to purchase, \n        possession, consumption, furnishing, and provision of beverage \n        alcohol to minors.\n            (2) The appropriate agencies referred to in paragraph (1) \n        have conducted a review to identify and catalog state and local \n        underage drinking prevention and reduction programs online and \n        have evaluated programs consistent with criteria pursuant to \n        section 4.\n            (3) The State has implemented a comprehensive plan to \n        improve enforcement and adjudication of existing laws to \n        prevent and reduce underage drinking and to report the results \n        of these efforts.\n            (4) The State has--\n                    (A) penalties for adults who knowingly and \n                illegally provide alcohol to minors in violation of \n                State law;\n                    (B) penalties for minors who purchase, attempt to \n                purchase, possess or consume beverage alcohol in \n                violation of State law, including driver's license \n                penalties; and\n                    (C) penalties that escalate with repeat offenses.\n            (5) The State has monetary fines resulting from the \n        imposition of such penalties outlined in paragraph (4) that are \n        used to provide funding for programs to prevent and reduce \n        underage drinking in the States in which the violation \n        occurred.\n            (6) The State requires parental notification for minors who \n        seek to fraudulently acquire beverage alcohol in violation of \n        State law.\n            (7) The State publicizes its laws and penalties regarding \n        underage drinking, including penalties for individuals who \n        illegally provide or furnish beverage alcohol to minors in \n        violation of State laws.\n            (8) The State has established mechanisms for effective \n        collaboration between licensed retailers, including retailers \n        owned or operated by or on behalf of the State or its agency, \n        and law enforcement authorities to detect and stop the use of \n        false or fraudulent identification.\n            (9) The State has established incentives for such retailers \n        as defined in paragraph (8)--\n                    (A) to regularly train employees who serve or sell \n                alcohol; and\n                    (B) to utilize age verification in the serving and \n                selling of alcohol.\n            (10) The State has developed and implemented evidence-based \n        programs designed to educate parents about underage drinking \n        and how to address the issue.\n\nSEC. 6. FUNDING.\n\n    (a) Certain Transfers.--With respect to Federal underage drinking \nprevention and reduction programs that are determined by the Secretary \nthrough evaluations under section 4 to be ineffective, the Secretary \nmay terminate such programs and transfer the Federal amounts involved \nfor use for--\n            (1) programs determined under the evaluations to be \n        effective in preventing or reducing underage drinking;\n            (2) evidence-based programs to prevent or reduce underage \n        drinking; and\n            (3) incentive grants to states regarding measures to \n        prevent or reduce underage drinking.\n    (b) State Funding Levels.--Once the Secretary has submitted the \nreport under section 4 to Congress, States will retain and manage their \nFederal funds and will have an initial two-year grace period to either \nmodify or sunset ineffective programs and reallocate Federal resources. \nThereafter, unused funds must be obligated before the fiscal year ends \nin order to be carried over to the next fiscal year. Once obligated, \nthe funds can be used within a four-year period.\n\nSEC. 7. IMPROVED COLLECTION AND REPORTING.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Reporting in consistent manner.--ICCPUD, as part of its \n        ongoing efforts to improve Federal data collection, shall \n        require that federally funded surveys collect and report data \n        in a consistent manner that allows users of this data to \n        compare the results of these surveys. In these efforts, the \n        surveys shall report demographic categories that represent the \n        cohort of those under the age of 21. In order to facilitate \n        more useful data analysis, the following age categories shall \n        be established, where cohorts are available and used in those \n        activities described in subsection (b):\n                    (A) Early teens--persons 12 to 14 years of age.\n                    (B) Teens--persons 15 to 17 years of age.\n                    (C) Underaged adults--persons 18 to 20 years of \n                age.\n            (2) Additional requirements.--With respect to the age \n        groupings under paragraph (1):\n                    (A) The grouping shall not preclude the use of \n                other age groups or the use of a comprehensive age \n                grouping of people between the ages of 12 to 20.\n                    (B) The groups shall include gender, ethnic and \n                other specific demographic data.\n    (b) Use of Certain National Surveys.--Activities under subsection \n(a) shall include the collection and reporting of relevant data from--\n            (1) national surveys funded by the Secretary, including but \n        not limited to Monitoring the Future Survey and National Survey \n        on Drug Use and Health; and\n            (2) State data available from research conducted or \n        supported by the States, which wholly or partially use Federal \n        funds.\n\nSEC. 8.
