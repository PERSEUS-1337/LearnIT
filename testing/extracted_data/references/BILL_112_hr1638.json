(COMEX) of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. and maintain the \nvalue of the United States dollar at this level.\n    (b) Target.--In regulating the value of the United States dollar, \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall not conduct \nopen market operations indirectly, as in the current practice of \ntargeting the Federal Funds rate.\n    (c) Promotion of Stable and Effective Financial Markets.--The Board \nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall use the banking and \nbank regulatory powers of the Board to maintain and promote stable and \neffective financial markets during and after the transition to a \ndefined value for the United States dollar.\n\nSEC. 4. TAX DEPRECIATION.\n\n    Effective January 1, 2011, all entities that depreciate capital \nassets for tax purposes shall be entitled to 100 percent expensing of \nall capital investment for tax purposes in the year that the investment \nis made.\n\nSEC. 5. DIRECTIVE TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE.\n\n    In addition to the scoring that the Congressional Budget Office \nwill do of the tax changes provided in this Act in the normal course of \nevents, the Congressional Budget Office shall also calculate the impact \non Federal revenues on a present value basis. This calculation shall be \ndone in the manner that such calculations are done by the Social \nSecurity Trustees, and shall take into account the following:\n            (1) That first year expensing of capital investment \n        accelerates, but does not change the total amount of the \n        depreciation that taxpayers take based upon their investments.\n            (2) Capital investments by businesses have historically \n        earned much higher returns than the interest rate on government \n        bonds.\n\nSEC. 6. CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISION.\n\n    In the event that any provisions of this Act are found to be in \nconflict with those of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of \n1978, the provisions of this Act shall supersede the provisions of such \nAct to the extent of the conflict.\n\nSEC. 7. REMOVAL OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AUTHORITY TO PAY EARNINGS ON \n              RESERVES.\n\n    Section 19(b)(12) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(12)) \nis amended--\n            (1) in the heading of such paragraph, by striking \n        ``Earnings'' and inserting ``No earnings'';\n            (2) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``may receive earnings \n        to be paid by the Federal Reserve bank at least once each \n        calendar quarter, at a rate or rates not to exceed the general \n        level of short-term interest rates'' and inserting ``may not \n        receive earnings paid by the Federal Reserve bank'';\n            (3) by striking subparagraph (B); and\n            (4) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (B)."
