FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n        perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n        sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \n        victim, known as hate crimes or crimes motivated by bias, poses \n        a serious national problem.\n            (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n        communities and is deeply divisive.\n            (3) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated \n        by bias is that it not only devastates the actual victim and \n        the family and friends of the victim, but also frequently \n        ravages the community sharing the traits that caused the victim \n        to be selected.\n            (4) According to data obtained by the Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation, the incidence of such violence increased in \n        2015, the most recent year for which data is available, in \n        comparison to prior years.\n            (5) The Hate Crimes Statistics Act (Public Law 101-275; 28 \n        U.S.C. 534 note) and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. \n        Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E of Public Law 111-84; \n        123 Stat. 2835) have enabled Federal authorities to understand \n        and, where appropriate, investigate and prosecute hate crimes.\n            (6) However, a complete understanding of the national \n        problem posed by hate crimes is hindered by incomplete data \n        from Federal, State, and local jurisdictions obtained through \n        the Uniform Crime Reports program authorized under section 534 \n        of title 28, United States Code, and administered by the \n        Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n            (7) Increased implementation of the National Incident-Based \n        Reporting System will enable the Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation to obtain more detailed and accurate information \n        on many crimes, including violence motivated by the actual or \n        perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n        sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \n        victim.\n            (8) State-run hotlines that direct victims or witnesses of \n        hate crimes to law enforcement or local support services will \n        allow State and local law enforcement agencies, as well as \n        local community-based service providers, to understand hate \n        crimes more fully and to act accordingly.\n            (9) A Federal private right of action provides an \n        additional option of recourse for individuals who are targeted \n        for violence based on actual or perceived race, color, \n        religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender \n        identity, or disability.\n            (10) Many perpetrators of crimes motivated by bias may \n        benefit from educational programming or volunteer service \n        conducted in conjunction with, under the guidance of, or with \n        the input of the community targeted by the hate crime.\n            (11) Federal financial assistance with regard to certain \n        violent crimes motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and \n        local authorities to work together as partners in the \n        investigation and prosecution of such crimes.\n            (12) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n        sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n        to warrant Federal financial assistance to States and local \n        jurisdictions.\n\nSEC. 3. REPORTING OF HATE CRIMES.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n            (1) the term ``hate crime'' means a criminal offense \n        against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by \n        an offender's bias against a race, color, religion, national \n        origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or \n        disability; and\n            (2) the term ``Uniform Crime Reports'' means the reports \n        authorized under section 534 of title 28, United States Code, \n        and administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that \n        compile nationwide criminal statistics for use--\n                    (A) in law enforcement administration, operation, \n                and management; and\n                    (B) to assess the nature and type of crime in the \n                United States.\n    (b) Implementation Grants.--\n            (1) In general.--The Attorney General may make grants to \n        States and units of local government to assist the State or \n        unit of local government in implementing the National Incident-\n        Based Reporting System, including to train employees in \n        identifying and classifying hate crimes in the National \n        Incident-Based Reporting System.\n            (2) Priority.--In making grants under paragraph (1), the \n        Attorney General shall give priority to States and units of \n        local government with larger populations.\n    (c) Reporting.--\n            (1) Compliance.--\n                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph \n                (B), in each fiscal year beginning after the date that \n                is 3 years after the date on which a State or unit of \n                local government first receives a grant under \n                subsection (b), the State or unit of local government \n                shall provide to the Attorney General, through the \n                Uniform Crime Reporting system, information pertaining \n                to hate crimes committed in that jurisdiction during \n                the preceding fiscal year.\n                    (B) Extensions; waiver.--The Attorney General--\n                            (i) may provide a 120-day extension to a \n                        State or unit of local government that is \n                        making good faith efforts to comply with \n                        subparagraph (A); and\n                            (ii) shall waive the requirements of \n                        subparagraph (A) if compliance with that \n                        subparagraph by a State or unit of local \n                        government would be unconstitutional under the \n                        constitution of the State or of the State in \n                        which the unit of local government is located, \n                        respectively.\n            (2) Failure to comply.--If a State or unit of local \n        government that receives a grant under subsection (b) fails to \n        substantially comply with paragraph (1) of this subsection, the \n        State or unit of local government shall repay the grant in \n        full, plus reasonable interest and penalty charges allowable by \n        law or established by the Attorney General.\n\nSEC. 4.
