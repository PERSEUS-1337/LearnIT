FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On August 17, 1998, two United States embassies in \n        Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, were destroyed \n        by simultaneously exploding bombs. The resulting explosions \n        killed 220 persons and injured more than 4,000 others. Twelve \n        Americans and 40 Kenyan and Tanzanian employees of the United \n        States Foreign Service were killed in the attack.\n            (2) The United States personnel in both Dar Es Salaam and \n        Nairobi showed leadership and personal courage in their \n        response to the attacks. Despite the havoc wrecked upon the \n        embassies, staff in both embassies provided rapid response in \n        locating and rescuing victims, providing emergency assistance, \n        and quickly restoring embassy operations during a crisis.\n            (3) The bombs are believed to have been set by individuals \n        associated with Osama bin Laden, leader of a known \n        transnational terrorist organization. In February of 1998 Bin \n        Laden issued a directive to his followers that called for \n        attacks against American interests anywhere in the world.\n            (4) Following the bombings, additional threats have been \n        made against United States diplomatic facilities.\n            (5) A review board was convened following the bombings, as \n        required by Public Law 99-399. The panel was chaired by Admiral \n        William J. Crowe, United States Navy (Ret).\n            (6) The conclusions of the Crowe panel are strikingly \n        similar to those stated by the Inman Commission, which issued \n        an extensive embassy security report more than 14 years ago.\n            (7) Admiral Crowe's panel issued a report setting out the \n        following two striking problems:\n                    (A) The United States has devoted inadequate \n                resources towards security against terrorist attacks.\n                    (B) The United States Government places too low a \n                priority on security concerns. The result has been a \n                failure to take adequate steps to prevent tragedies \n                such as the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.\n            (8) The Crowe panel found that there was an institutional \n        failure on the part of the Department of State and embassies \n        under its direction, to recognize threats posed by \n        transnational terrorism and vehicular bombs.\n            (9) Responsibility for obtaining adequate resources for \n        security programs is widely shared throughout the United States \n        Government, including Congress. Unless the vulnerabilities \n        identified in the Crowe report are addressed in a sustained and \n        financially realistic manner, the lives and safety of United \n        States employees in diplomatic facilities will continue to be \n        at risk from further terrorist attacks.\n            (10) Although service in the Foreign Service or other \n        Government positions in foreign countries can never be \n        completely without risk, the United States must ensure that the \n        risks are kept to a minimum.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC FACILITY DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``United States diplomatic facility'' means \nany embassy, chancery, legation, consulate or other office building or \nstructure used by a United States diplomatic mission or consular post \nor by any agency of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4.
