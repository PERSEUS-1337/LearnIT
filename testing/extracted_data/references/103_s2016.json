FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with \n        disabilities are to ensure equality of opportunity, full \n        participation, independent living, and economic self-\n        sufficiency for such individuals;\n            (2) the vast changes underway in the workplace, information \n        technologies, and other aspects of society have been \n        insufficiently studied for the opportunities and hazards such \n        changes present for individuals with disabilities;\n            (3) the Federal Government has created many programs to \n        serve the needs of individuals with disabilities, including \n        programs that provide financial assistance, medical care, \n        education, vocational rehabilitation, housing, transportation, \n        legal assistance, and rehabilitation research and training, but \n        many of these programs operate in a manner that is inconsistent \n        with the Nation's goals, work at cross-purposes with each \n        other, are outdated, or could otherwise be improved, and new \n        programs to serve individuals with disabilities may need to be \n        established;\n            (4) there are Federal programs that are not viewed as \n        disability programs, yet serve significant numbers of \n        individuals with disabilities, and the impact and value of such \n        programs for individuals with disabilities have received \n        insufficient attention;\n            (5) the Nation is not well informed about the increasing \n        number of Americans with disabilities, and disability is a \n        health and social welfare issue of growing proportions, for \n        which the Nation is ill prepared; and\n            (6) it is incumbent upon the Federal Government to examine \n        its programs that serve individuals with disabilities to ensure \n        they are consistent with the Nation's goals, reflect the best \n        use of its resources, and properly anticipate societal and \n        technological change.\n\nSEC. 3.
