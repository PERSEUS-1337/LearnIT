FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) Advances in medicine depend on clinical trial research \n    conducted at public and private research institutions across the \n    United States.\n        (2) The challenges associated with enrolling participants in \n    clinical research studies are especially difficult for studies that \n    evaluate treatments for rare diseases and conditions (defined by \n    the Orphan Drug Act as a disease or condition affecting fewer than \n    200,000 Americans), where the available number of willing and able \n    research participants may be very small.\n        (3) In accordance with ethical standards established by the \n    National Institutes of Health, sponsors of clinical research may \n    provide payments to trial participants for out-of-pocket costs \n    associated with trial enrollment and for the time and commitment \n    demanded by those who participate in a study. When offering \n    compensation, clinical trial sponsors are required to provide such \n    payments to all participants.\n        (4) The offer of payment for research participation may pose a \n    barrier to trial enrollment when such payments threaten the \n    eligibility of clinical trial participants for Supplemental \n    Security Income and Medicaid benefits.\n        (5) With a small number of potential trial participants and the \n    possible loss of Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid benefits \n    for many who wish to participate, clinical trial research for rare \n    diseases and conditions becomes exceptionally difficult and may \n    hinder research on new treatments and potential cures for these \n    rare diseases and conditions.\nSEC. 3. EXCLUSION FOR COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN CLINICAL TRIALS \nFOR RARE DISEASES OR CONDITIONS.\n    (a) Exclusion From Income.--Section 1612(b) of the Social Security \nAct (42 U.S.C. 1382a(b)) is amended--\n        (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (24);\n        (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (25) and \n    inserting ``; and''; and\n        (3) by adding at the end the following:\n        ``(26) the first $2,000 received during a calendar year by such \n    individual (or such spouse) as compensation for participation in a \n    clinical trial involving research and testing of treatments for a \n    rare disease or condition (as defined in section 5(b)(2) of the \n    Orphan Drug Act), but only if the clinical trial--\n            ``(A) has been reviewed and approved by an institutional \n        review board that is established--\n                ``(i) to protect the rights and welfare of human \n            subjects participating in scientific research; and\n                ``(ii) in accord with the requirements under part 46 of \n            title 45, Code of Federal Regulations; and\n            ``(B) meets the standards for protection of human subjects \n        as provided under part 46 of title 45, Code of Federal \n        Regulations.''.\n    (b) Exclusion From Resources.--Section 1613(a) of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1382b(a)) is amended--\n        (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (15);\n        (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (16) and \n    inserting ``; and''; and\n        (3) by inserting after paragraph (16) the following:\n        ``(17) any amount received by such individual (or such spouse) \n    which is excluded from income under section 1612(b)(26) (relating \n    to compensation for participation in a clinical trial involving \n    research and testing of treatments for a rare disease or \n    condition).''.\n    (c) Medicaid Exclusion.--\n        (1) In general.--Section 1902(e) of the Social Security Act (42 \n    U.S.C. 1396a(e)), is amended by adding at the end the following:\n        ``(14) Exclusion of compensation for participation in a \n    clinical trial for testing of treatments for a rare disease or \n    condition.--The first $2,000 received by an individual (who has \n    attained 19 years of age) as compensation for participation in a \n    clinical trial meeting the requirements of section 1612(b)(26) \n    shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the income \n    eligibility of such individual for medical assistance under the \n    State plan or any waiver of such plan.''.\n        (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 1902(a)(17) of such Act (42 \n    U.S.C. 1396a(a)(17)) is amended by inserting ``(e)(14),'' before \n    ``(l)(3)''.\n    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take \neffect on the date that is the earlier of--\n        (1) the effective date of final regulations promulgated by the \n    Commissioner of Social Security to carry out this section and such \n    amendments; or\n        (2) 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (e) Sunset Provision.--This Act and the amendments made by this Act \nare repealed on the date that is 5 years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act.\nSEC. 4.
