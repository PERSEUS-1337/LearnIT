FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The proportion of the population of the United States \n        age 60 years or older will drastically increase in the next 30 \n        years as more than 76,000,000 Baby Boomers approach retirement \n        and old age.\n            (2) Each year, anywhere between 500,000 and 5,000,000 \n        seniors in the United States are abused, neglected, or \n        exploited.\n            (3) Senior abuse, neglect, and exploitation have no \n        boundaries, and cross all racial, social class, gender, and \n        geographic lines.\n            (4) Millions of individuals in the United States are \n        victims of financial exploitation, including mail, \n        telemarketing, and Internet fraud, each year. Many of those who \n        fall prey to these crimes are seniors.\n            (5) It is difficult to estimate the prevalence of fraud \n        targeting seniors because cases are severely underreported and \n        national statistics on senior fraud do not exist.\n            (6) The Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that senior \n        Americans are less likely to report fraud because they do not \n        know to whom to report, they are ashamed to have been a victim \n        of fraud, or they do not know that they have been a victim of \n        fraud. In some cases, a senior victim of fraud may not report \n        the crime because he or she is concerned that relatives may \n        come to the conclusion that the victim no longer has the mental \n        capacity to take care of his or her own financial affairs.\n            (7) Perpetrators of mail, telemarketing, and Internet fraud \n        frequently target seniors because seniors are often vulnerable \n        and trusting people.\n            (8) As victims of such fraudulent schemes, many seniors \n        have been robbed of their hard-earned life savings and \n        frequently pay an emotional cost, losing not only their money, \n        but also their self-respect and dignity.\n            (9) Perpetrators of fraud targeting seniors often operate \n        outside the United States, reaching their victims through the \n        mail, telephone lines, and the Internet.\n            (10) The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act \n        increased the power of the United States Postal Service to \n        protect consumers against persons who use deceptive mailings, \n        such as those featuring games of chance, sweepstakes, skill \n        contests, and facsimile checks.\n            (11) During fiscal year 2007, analysts prepared more than \n        27,000 letters and informative postcards in response to mail \n        fraud complaints. During that same year, postal inspectors \n        investigated 2,909 mail fraud cases in the United States, and \n        arrested 1,236 mail fraud suspects, of whom 1,118 were \n        convicted. Postal inspectors also reported 162 telemarketing \n        fraud investigations, with 83 arrests and 61 convictions \n        resulting from such investigations.\n            (12) In 2000, the United States Senate Special Committee on \n        Aging reported that, each year, consumers lose approximately \n        $40,000,000,000 to telemarketing fraud, and estimated that \n        approximately 10 percent of the Nation's 14,000 telemarketing \n        firms were fraudulent. Some researchers estimate that only one \n        in 10,000 fraud victims reports the crime to the authorities.\n            (13) A 2003 report by AARP found that the crime of \n        telemarketing fraud is grossly underreported among senior \n        victims, but that those who are properly counseled by trained \n        peer volunteers are less likely to fall victim to fraudulent \n        practices.\n            (14) The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that the \n        threat of fraud to seniors is growing and changing. Many \n        younger Baby Boomers have considerable computer skills, and \n        criminals are modifying their targeting techniques by using not \n        only traditional telephone calls and mass mailings, but also \n        online scams like phishing and e-mail spamming.\n            (15) The IC3 is a partnership between the National White \n        Collar Crime Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n        that serves as a vehicle to receive, develop, and refer \n        criminal complaints regarding cyber crime. The IC3 processed \n        more than 219,553 complaints of Internet crime in 2007. From \n        these submissions, the IC3 referred 90,008 complaints of \n        Internet crime, representing a total dollar loss of \n        $239,090,000, to Federal, State, and local law enforcement \n        agencies in the United States for further consideration.\n            (16) Consumer awareness is the best protection from fraud.\n\nSEC. 3.
