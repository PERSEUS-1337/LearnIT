PETROLEUM PRODUCT RESERVE.\n\n    Section 154(a) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. \n6234(a)) is amended by striking ``1 billion barrels of petroleum \nproducts'' and inserting ``1,000,000,000 barrels of petroleum products \n(including refined petroleum products)''.\n\nSEC. 4. SALE OF OIL FROM THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE AND \n              ACQUISITION OF REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCT.\n\n    (a) Initial Petroleum Sale and Replacement.--\n            (1) Authority.--Notwithstanding section 161 of the Energy \n        Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6241), the Secretary may \n        sell, in the amounts and on the schedule described in \n        subsection (b), petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n        and acquire refined petroleum product.\n            (2) Proceeds.--If the Secretary acts pursuant to paragraph \n        (1), the Secretary shall--\n                    (A) deposit the cash proceeds from sales under \n                subparagraph (A) into the SPR Petroleum Account \n                established under section 167 of the Energy Policy and \n                Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6247); and\n                    (B) from the cash proceeds deposited pursuant to \n                paragraph (2), withdraw the amount necessary to pay for \n                the direct administrative and operational costs of the \n                sale and acquisition, including for acquisition and \n                maintenance of, and improvements to, storage \n                facilities.\n    (b) Amounts and Schedule.--\n            (1) In general.--The sale and acquisition described in \n        subsection (a) may require the offer for sale of a total \n        quantity of no more than 30,000,000 barrels of petroleum from \n        the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The sale may commence within \n        180 days after the date of enactment of this Act and may end \n        not later than 3 years after such date of enactment. In no \n        event shall the Secretary sell barrels of oil under subsection \n        (a) that would result in a Strategic Petroleum Reserve that \n        contains fewer than 90 percent of the total amount of barrels \n        in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as of the date of enactment \n        of this Act.\n            (2) Acquisitions.--If the Secretary acts pursuant to \n        subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall acquire refined \n        petroleum product under this section--\n                    (A) beginning no sooner than 180 days after the \n                date of enactment of this Act;\n                    (B) ending no later than 5 years after the date of \n                enactment of this Act; and\n                    (C) in a manner so as to minimize both the cost to \n                the Federal Government and market disruption associated \n                with the acquisition.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    Not later than 18 months after the commencement of any sale \nauthorized pursuant to section 4, the Secretary shall transmit to \nCongress a report--\n            (1) describing the amounts and types of petroleum sold and \n        refined petroleum product acquired under section 4;\n            (2) describing the actions taken for the storage of refined \n        petroleum product acquired under section 4, and identifying any \n        requirements for additional facilities;\n            (3) describing efforts the Department of Energy has taken \n        to ensure that distributors and importers are not discouraged \n        from maintaining and increasing supplies of refined petroleum \n        products;\n            (4) describing actions that the Department of Energy has \n        taken and plans to take to ensure quality of refined petroleum \n        product in the Reserve, including the rotation of product \n        stored; and\n            (5) analyzing the effects that activities under section 4 \n        have had on oil markets.\n\nSEC. 6.
