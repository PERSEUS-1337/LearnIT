FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to 2001 statistics from the American Hospital \n        Association, 126,000 nurses are currently needed to fill \n        vacancies at our nation's hospitals. Today, fully 75 percent of \n        all hospital personnel vacancies are for nurses.\n            (2) According to the Journal of the American Medical \n        Association (2000), the U.S. will experience a 20 percent \n        shortage in the number of nurses needed in the U.S. health care \n        system by the year 2020. This translates into a shortage of \n        more than 400,000 registered nurses nationwide.\n            (3) Research indicates that there is a greater need for \n        health care services, especially hospitals and prescription \n        drugs, but there continues to be a 28 percent decrease in \n        national licensure examination for all entry-level registered \n        nurses.\n            (4) The U.S. Department of Labor projects a 21 percent \n        increase in the need for nurses nationwide from 1998 to 2008, \n        compared with a 14 percent increase for all other occupations.\n            (5) The General Accounting Office estimates that 40 percent \n        of all registered nurses will be older than age 50 by the year \n        2010.\n            (6) Of those registered nurses in 2000, an estimated 18 \n        percent have chosen to pursue other career paths.\n            (7) According to a 2001 issue of Health Affairs, many \n        nurses report they are dissatisfied with their current \n        position. One out of every 3 hospital nurses under the age of \n        30 are planning to leave their current job in the next year.\n\nSEC. 3.
