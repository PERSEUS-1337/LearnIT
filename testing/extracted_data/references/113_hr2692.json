FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) Pollination services are a vital part of agricultural \n        production, valued at over $125,000,000,000 globally and worth \n        $20,000,000,000 to $30,000,000,000 in agricultural production \n        annually in the United States.\n            (2) One-third of food produced in North America depends on \n        pollination by honey bees, including nearly 95 varieties of \n        fruits such as almonds, avocados, cranberries, and apples.\n            (3) Over the past several years, documented incidents of \n        colony collapse disorder have been at a record high, with some \n        beekeepers repeatedly losing 100 percent of their operations.\n            (4) During the winter beginning in 2012 and ending in 2013, \n        United States beekeepers, on average, lost 45.1 percent of the \n        colonies they operate.\n            (5) According to scientists of the Department of \n        Agriculture, current estimates of the survivorship of honey bee \n        colonies show they are too low to be able to meet the \n        pollination demands of United States agricultural crops.\n            (6) Scientists have linked the use of systemic \n        neonicotinoid insecticides to the rapid decline of pollinators \n        and to the deterioration of pollinator health.\n            (7) Neonicotinoids cause sublethal effects including \n        impaired foraging and feeding behavior, disorientation, \n        weakened immunity, delayed larval development, and increased \n        susceptibility to viruses, diseases, and parasites and numerous \n        studies have also demonstrated acute, lethal effects from the \n        application of neonicotinoid insecticides.\n            (8) Recent science has demonstrated that a single corn \n        kernel coated with a neonicotinoid is toxic enough to kill a \n        songbird.\n            (9) In June 2013, over 50,000 bumblebees were killed as a \n        direct result of exposure to a neonicotinoid applied to Linden \n        trees for cosmetic purposes.\n            (10) In January 2013, the European Food Safety Authority \n        determined that the most widely used neonicotinoids pose \n        unacceptable hazards to bees, prompting the European Union to \n        suspend their use on agricultural crops.\n\nSEC. 3. URGENT REGULATORY RESPONSE FOR HONEY BEE AND POLLINATOR \n              PROTECTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency shall suspend the registration of imidacloprid, \nclothianidin, thiamethoxam, dinotafuran, and any other members of the \nnitro group of neonicotinoid insecticides to the extent such \ninsecticide is registered, conditionally or otherwise, under the \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et \nseq.) for use in seed treatment, soil application, or foliar treatment \non bee attractive plants, trees, and cereals until the Administrator \nhas made a determination that such insecticide will not cause \nunreasonable adverse effects on pollinators based on--\n            (1) an evaluation of the published and peer-reviewed \n        scientific evidence on whether the use or uses of such \n        neonicotinoids cause unreasonable adverse effects on \n        pollinators, including native bees, honey bees, birds, bats, \n        and other species of beneficial insects; and\n            (2) a completed field study that meets the criteria \n        required by the Administrator and evaluates residues, including \n        residue build-up after repeated annual application, chronic \n        low-dose exposure, cumulative effects of multiple chemical \n        exposures, and any other protocol determined to be necessary by \n        the Administrator to protect managed and native pollinators.\n    (b) Conditions on Certain Pesticides Registrations.--\nNotwithstanding section 3 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136a), for purposes of the protection of \nhoney bees, other pollinators, and beneficial insects, the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall not issue \nany new registrations, conditional or otherwise, for any seed \ntreatment, soil application, and foliar treatment on bee attractive \nplants, trees, and cereals under such Act until the Administrator has \nmade the determination described in subsection (a), based on an \nevaluation described in subsection (a)(1) and a completed field study \ndescribed in subsection (a)(2), with respect to such insecticide.\n    (c) Monitoring of Native Bees.--The Secretary of the Interior, in \ncoordination with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, shall, for purposes of protecting and ensuring the long-term \nviability of native bees and other pollinators of agricultural crops, \nhorticultural plants, wild plants, and other plants--\n            (1) regularly monitor the health and population status of \n        native bees, including the status of native bees in \n        agricultural and non-agricultural habitats and areas of \n        ornamental plants, residential areas, and landscaped areas;\n            (2) identify the scope and likely causes of unusual native \n        bee mortality; and\n            (3) beginning not later than 180 days after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act and each year thereafter, submit to \n        Congress, and make available to the public, a report on such \n        health and population status."
