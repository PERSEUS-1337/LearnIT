FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n            (1) The United States has a distinct legal, treaty, and \n        trust obligation to provide for the education, healthcare, \n        safety, social welfare, and other needs of Native children.\n            (2) Native children are the most at-risk population in the \n        United States, confronting serious disparities in education, \n        health, and safety, with 37 percent of Native children living \n        in poverty.\n            (3) Teens who do not participate in those programs are \n        nearly 3 times more likely to use marijuana or other drugs, and \n        more likely to drink alcohol. 22.9 percent of Native children \n        aged 12 and older report alcohol use, 16 percent report \n        substance dependence or abuse, 35.8 percent report tobacco use, \n        and 12.5 percent report illicit drug use.\n            (4) Protective factors against youth suicide include \n        opportunities to participate in and contribute to school and/or \n        community projects/activities. Suicide is the second leading \n        cause of death of Native youth aged 15 through 24 at a rate of \n        2.5 percent--this is twice the national rate of non-Native \n        youth of the same age.\n            (5) Nationally, American Indian and Alaska Native students \n        have the lowest college enrollment rates. At-risk youth who \n        have a mentor are more likely to pursue higher education after \n        high school in a four-year, two-year, or vocational program \n        than their at-risk peers who do not have a mentor. (45 percent \n        compared to 29 percent).\n            (6) Students who are engaged in extracurricular \n        (afterschool and summer learning) activities have better \n        attendance records, higher levels of academic achievement, and \n        more interest in pursuing higher education after graduation.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a grant \nprogram for Indian tribes and eligible tribal entities for \nextracurricular programs--\n            (1) to support and encourage the educational and cultural \n        growth of Indian and Alaska Native students;\n            (2) to provide access to mentors and resources that promote \n        emotional and mental resilience in Native youth;\n            (3) to ensure Native children receive consistent access to \n        nutritional meals; and\n            (4) to increase the availability of safe and useable \n        educational infrastructures in Native communities and on tribal \n        land.\n    (b) Purpose of Grants.--The funds awarded under the grant program \nestablished under section 366 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural \nDevelopment Act (as added by section 4(a)) shall be used for--\n            (1) culturally appropriate before school, afterschool, and \n        summer school programs that include activities designed to \n        reinforce and complement the academic program of participating \n        students, such as--\n                    (A) development and extracurricular activities; and\n                    (B) programs relating to--\n                            (i) substance abuse and violence \n                        prevention;\n                            (ii) counseling;\n                            (iii) physical fitness and wellness;\n                            (iv) Native culture and language;\n                            (v) agriculture and nutrition;\n                            (vi) technology education; and\n                            (vii) character education;\n            (2) funds to build or upgrade facilities for before school, \n        afterschool, and summer school programs; and\n            (3) access to federally funded meal programs.\n\nSEC. 4.
