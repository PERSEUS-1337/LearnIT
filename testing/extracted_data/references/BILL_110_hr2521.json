FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On February 26, 2003, a fire at a Hartford, \n        Connecticut, nursing facility without an automatic fire \n        sprinkler system claimed the lives of 16 patients, and on \n        September 27, 2003, a fire at a Nashville, Tennessee, nursing \n        home without an automatic fire sprinkler system claimed the \n        lives of 15 patients.\n            (2) The National Fire Protection Association finds no \n        record of a multiple death fire in a nursing facility equipped \n        with an automatic fire sprinkler system.\n            (3) An estimated 1.5 million Americans reside in \n        approximately 16,300 nursing facilities nationwide, an \n        estimated 20 to 30 percent of which lack an automatic fire \n        sprinkler system.\n            (4) Many nursing facilities lack the financial capital to \n        install sprinklers on their own and must consider closure as an \n        alternative to taking on large loans or other financing options \n        in order to install sprinklers.\n            (5) In a July 2004 report, the GAO found that ``the \n        substantial loss of life in the Hartford and Nashville fires \n        could have been reduced or eliminated by the presence of \n        properly functioning automatic sprinkler systems'' and that \n        ``Federal oversight of nursing home compliance with fire safety \n        standards is inadequate''.\n            (6) Recognizing that automatic fire sprinkler systems \n        greatly improve the chances of survival for older adults in the \n        event of a fire, the National Fire Protection Association, with \n        the support of the American Health Care Association, the fire \n        safety community, and the nursing facility profession, recently \n        adopted requirements for automatic sprinklers in all existing \n        nursing facilities.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) within five years, every nursing facility in America \n        should be equipped with automatic fire sprinklers in order to \n        ensure patient, resident, and staff safety; and\n            (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this Act \n        referred to as the ``Secretary''), acting through the \n        Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n        should--\n                    (A) adopt a requirement that all nursing facilities \n                be fully sprinklered with the support of the nursing \n                facility industry; and\n                    (B) ensure that skilled nursing facilities \n                participating in the Medicare program comply with fire \n                safety standards, such as those developed by the \n                National Fire Protection Association in the 2006 Life \n                Safety Code.\n\nSEC. 3. DIRECT LOANS FOR FIRE SPRINKLERS RETROFITS.\n\n    (a) Authority.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \nestablish a program of direct loans to existing nursing facilities to \nfinance the retrofit of the facilities with an automatic fire sprinkler \nsystem. Such loans shall be made under terms and conditions specified \nby the Secretary.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section $200,000,000 for fiscal year \n2008, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, $75,000,000 for fiscal year \n2010, $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2011, and $25,000,000 for fiscal year \n2012.\n\nSEC. 4. SPRINKLER RETROFIT ASSISTANCE GRANTS.\n\n    (a) Authority.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \nestablish a program to award grants to nursing facilities for the \npurposes of retrofitting them with an automatic fire sprinkler system. \nSuch grants shall be awarded under terms and conditions specified by \nthe Secretary.\n    (b) Priority.--In awarding grants under this section, the Secretary \nshall give a priority to applications that demonstrate a need or \nhardship. In determining hardship, the Secretary may take into account \nfactors such as the number of Medicare and Medicaid patients, the age \nand condition of the facility, and the need for nursing facility beds \nin the community involved.\n    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section $20,000,000 for each fiscal \nyears 2008 through 2012.\n\nSEC. 5. CONSULTATION AND EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES.\n\n    (a) Consultation.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \nconsult with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to \ndetermine if there are loan programs or other funds available for \nretrofitting nursing facilities with an automatic fire sprinkler system \nin addition to the loans and grants authorized in this Act.\n    (b) Evaluation of Alternative Remedial Actions.--The Secretary may \nevaluate, in unique circumstances, where a nursing facility may not \nhave an adequate structure to retrofit the entire facility with an \nautomatic fire sprinkler system within a reasonable timeframe. In such \nan instance, the Secretary shall work with representatives of the \nfacility to identify other remedial actions that may include \nretrofitting a majority of the facility with such a system, \nconstruction timeframes for a new or remodeled facility, or other \nactions."
