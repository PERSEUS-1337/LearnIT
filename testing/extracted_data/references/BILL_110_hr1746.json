FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Holocaust, an event in which millions of people \n        endured enormous suffering through torture and other violence, \n        including the murder of 6,000,000 Jews and millions of others, \n        the destruction of families and communities, and the theft of \n        their assets, was one of the most heinous crimes in human \n        history.\n            (2) Before and during World War II, millions of people \n        purchased insurance policies to safeguard family assets, plan \n        for retirement, provide for a dowry, or save for their \n        children's education.\n            (3) When Holocaust survivors or heirs of Holocaust victims \n        presented claims to insurance companies after World War II, \n        many were rejected because they did not have death certificates \n        or physical possession of policy documents that had been \n        confiscated by the Nazis or lost in the devastation of the \n        Holocaust.\n            (4) In many instances, insurance company records and \n        records in government archives are the only proof of the \n        existence of insurance policies belonging to Holocaust victims.\n            (5) Holocaust survivors and heirs have been attempting for \n        decades to persuade insurance companies to settle unpaid \n        insurance claims.\n            (6) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \n        Insurance Claims (in this section referred to as the \n        ``ICHEIC'') was established by the National Association of \n        Insurance Commissioners in cooperation with several European \n        insurance companies, European regulators, the Government of \n        Israel, and non-governmental organizations with the promise \n        that it would expeditiously address the issue of unpaid \n        insurance policies issued to Holocaust victims.\n            (7) On July 17, 2000, the United States and Germany signed \n        an Executive Agreement in support of the German Foundation \n        ``Remembrance, Responsibility, and the Future'', which \n        designated the ICHEIC to resolve all Holocaust-era insurance \n        policies issued by German companies and their subsidiaries.\n            (8) On January 17, 2001, the United States and Austria \n        signed an Executive Agreement, which designated the ICHEIC to \n        resolve all Holocaust-era insurance policies issued by Austrian \n        companies and their subsidiaries.\n            (9) Between 1998 and the closing of the ICHEIC claims \n        deadline on December 31, 2003, few names of the Jewish policy \n        holders from Eastern Europe were published, though more than \n        two-thirds of the Jewish population of the territory occupied \n        by the Nazis and their allies were from Eastern Europe.\n            (10) The ICHEIC is scheduled to close in 2007 without the \n        disclosure of thousands of names of policies sold to Jewish \n        residents of Europe prior to World War II as of February of \n        2007.\n            (11) With the ICHEIC process essentially completed, \n        companies holding Holocaust-era insurance policies continue to \n        withhold names of owners and beneficiaries of thousands of \n        insurance policies sold to Jewish customers prior to World War \n        II.\n            (12) Experts estimate that the value in 2006 of unpaid \n        life, annuity, endowment, and dowry insurance theft from \n        European Jewry from the Holocaust and its aftermath ranges \n        between $17,000,000,000 and $200,000,000,000.\n            (13) As of the latest report by the ICHEIC on February 20, \n        2007, the value of claims paid in recognition of victims' \n        policies was approximately $250,000,000 and fewer than 5 \n        percent of the policies estimated to have been sold to Jews at \n        the beginning of World War II have been paid through ICHEIC.\n            (14) As of 2006, ICHEIC has not provided the State \n        Department with the information required by paragraphs (3) \n        through (7) of section 704(a) of the Foreign Relations \n        Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228), which \n        requires the Secretary of State to report to the appropriate \n        congressional committees on the status of the implementation of \n        the Executive Agreement between Germany and the United States.\n            (15) In American Insurance Association, Inc., v. Garamendi, \n        the United States Supreme Court held that under the supremacy \n        clause of the Constitution of the United States, executive \n        agreements and Federal Government policy calling for insurance \n        claims against German and Austrian companies to be handled \n        within ICHEIC preempted State laws authorizing State insurance \n        commissioners to subpoena company records and require \n        publication of the names of Holocaust era policy holders.\n            (16) In the Garamendi case, the Supreme Court stated that \n        Congress, which has the power to regulate international \n        commerce, and prescribe Federal Court jurisdiction, had not \n        addressed disclosure and restitution of Holocaust victims' \n        insurance policies.\n            (17) Subsequent court decisions have dismissed survivors' \n        suits against Assicurazioni Generali, S.p.A., even though there \n        is no executive agreement between the United States and Italy.\n            (18) Congress believes that United States courts do \n        currently have jurisdiction to entertain actions by Holocaust \n        victims and heirs of Holocaust victims to recover insurance \n        proceeds sold to their families before the Holocaust.\n            (19) Due to lower court interpretations of the Garamendi \n        case, this Act expresses the intent of Congress to legislate to \n        the maximum extent allowed by the Constitution regarding the \n        rights of Holocaust survivors and the heirs and beneficiaries \n        of Holocaust victims to obtain information from insurers and to \n        bring actions in United States courts to recover unpaid funds \n        from entities that participated in the theft of family \n        insurance assets or the affiliates of such entities.\n            (20) The ICHEIC either chose not to pursue or did not put \n        forth sufficient effort to investigate or obtain restitution \n        for forms of insurance other than life, annuity, endowment, or \n        dowry insurance sold to Holocaust victims, despite \n        documentation that other forms of insurance benefits such as \n        property and casualty insurance, disability insurance, health \n        insurance, transport insurance, and marine insurance were also \n        improperly withheld from Jews, nor did the ICHEIC make \n        sufficient effort to investigate the records of reinsurers who \n        provided coverage for Jews' policies prior to World War II, \n        despite evidence that reinsurers and reinsurance played a \n        significant role in the theft of the family assets of Holocaust \n        victims.\n            (21) Disclosures in 2006 concerning the vast Nazi archives \n        at Bad Arolsen Germany, which have been closed to direct access \n        by Holocaust survivors, families of Holocaust victims, and \n        researchers since 1955, underscores the necessity a \n        comprehensive opening of all archival sources of information \n        for Holocaust victims and their families.\n            (22) Insurance payments should be expedited to the victims \n        of the most heinous crime of the 20th Century to ensure that \n        justice is served.\n            (23) States should be allowed to collect Holocaust-era \n        insurance information from any insurance companies that want to \n        do business in such States.\n            (24) Tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors around the \n        world, including in the United States, live below or near the \n        poverty level, and cannot meet their basic day-to-day needs for \n        food, medicine, shelter, and other necessities.\n            (25) This Act will enable survivors, heirs, and \n        beneficiaries to obtain compensation commensurate with the real \n        monetary value of their losses, and to penalize unjustly \n        enriched insurers for their fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair \n        practices, which continue to the present day, and to deter such \n        conduct in the future.\n            (26) Holocaust victims and their families should be able to \n        recover claims arising from Holocaust era insurance policies \n        and the Federal Government should be able to recover for the \n        unjust enrichment of insurers in Federal court when they \n        consider it necessary to seek redress through the judicial \n        system.\n            (27) Under the circumstances faced by Holocaust victims and \n        their families, the courts of the United States should be open \n        to Holocaust victims and their families for a reasonable number \n        of years after enactment of this Act, without regard to any \n        other statutes of limitation.\n\nSEC. 3.
