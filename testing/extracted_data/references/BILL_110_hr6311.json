PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a risk assessment process \nto prevent the introduction into, and establishment in, the United \nStates of nonnative wildlife species that will cause or are likely to \ncause economic or environmental harm or harm to human or animal \nspecies' health.\n\nSEC. 3. RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS FOR IMPORTATION OF NONNATIVE WILDLIFE \n              SPECIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service, shall promulgate regulations \nthat establish a process for assessing the risk of all nonnative \nwildlife species proposed for importation into the United States, other \nthan nonnative wildlife species that are included in the list of \napproved species issued under section 4.\n    (b) Factors To Be Considered.--Regulations under this section shall \nprovide that in assessing the risk of a nonnative wildlife species the \nSecretary shall consider at a minimum--\n            (1) the identity of the organism to the species level, \n        including to the extent possible more specific information on \n        its subspecies and genetic identity;\n            (2) the geographic source of the species and the conditions \n        under which it was captured or bred;\n            (3) whether the species has established or spread, or \n        caused harm to the economy or the environment or the health of \n        humans or of wildlife, in ecosystems that are similar to those \n        in the United States but are located outside the United States;\n            (4) the likelihood that environmental conditions suitable \n        for the establishment or spread of the species exist anywhere \n        in the United States;\n            (5) the likelihood of establishment of the species in the \n        United States;\n            (6) the likelihood of spread of the species in the United \n        States;\n            (7) the likelihood that the species would harm wildlife \n        resources in the United States;\n            (8) the likelihood that the species would harm rare, \n        threatened, or endangered species in the United States;\n            (9) the likelihood that the species would harm habitats or \n        ecosystems in the United States;\n            (10) the likelihood that pathogenic species, parasitic \n        species, or free-living species may accompany the species \n        proposed for importation; and\n            (11) other factors important to the risks associated with \n        the species.\n    (c) Consultation.--In promulgating the regulations, the Secretary \nshall consult with States, Indian tribes, other stakeholders, the \nAquatic Nuisance Species Task Force, and the Invasive Species Council.\n    (d) Transparency.--The Secretary shall ensure that the risk \nassessment process established by the regulations is scientifically \ncredible and is consistent with sections 4 and 5.\n    (e) Deadlines.--The Secretary shall--\n            (1) propose regulations under subsection (a) and an initial \n        list under section 4(b), by not later than 2 years after the \n        date of the enactment of this Act;\n            (2) publish in the Federal Register final regulations under \n        subsection (a), an initial list under section 4(b), and a \n        notice of the prohibitions under this Act, by not later than 30 \n        days before the date on which the Secretary begins assessing \n        risk under the regulations; and\n            (3) begin assessing risk under the regulations by not later \n        than 37 months after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (f) Animals Imported Prior to Prohibition of Importation.--This Act \nand regulations issued under this Act shall not interfere with the \nability of any person to possess an individual animal of a species that \nwas imported legally, even if such species is later prohibited from \nbeing imported under the regulations issued under this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. LIST OF APPROVED SPECIES.\n\n    (a) Requirement To Issue List.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 36 months after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish in the \n        Federal Register a list of nonnative wildlife species approved \n        for importation.\n            (2) Exclusion of certain species.--The Secretary shall not \n        include in the list--\n                    (A) any species included in the list of prohibited \n                species under section 5; or\n                    (B) any species, the importation of which is \n                prohibited by any other law or regulation.\n            (3) Revision.--The Secretary may revise the list issued \n        under this subsection.\n    (b) Initial List.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall include in the initial \n        list under this section nonnative wildlife species that the \n        Secretary finds--\n                    (A) based on the best scientific and commercial \n                data available, are not harmful to the United States' \n                economy, the environment, or human or other animal \n                species' health; or\n                    (B) may be harmful in some respects, but already \n                are so widespread in the United States that future \n                import prohibitions or restrictions would have no \n                practical utility.\n            (2) Proposals for inclusion in initial list.--The \n        Secretary--\n                    (A) shall, by not later than 60 days after the date \n                of enactment of this Act, publish in the Federal \n                Register and make available on the Internet a request \n                for submission, by persons that import or that intend \n                to import nonnative wildlife species, of proposals of \n                nonnative wildlife species to be included in the \n                initial list under this subsection and supporting \n                documentation for such proposals;\n                    (B) shall accept such proposals for 10 months after \n                the date the Secretary publishes the request for \n                submissions;
