FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The free exercise of religion is an inalienable right, \n        protected by the First Amendment of the United States \n        Constitution.\n            (2) Congress reaffirmed this right in the Religious Freedom \n        Restoration Act of 1993, as amended in 1998, which prohibits \n        the Federal Government from imposing a substantial burden on \n        the free exercise of religion unless it demonstrates that a \n        compelling government interest is achieved by the least \n        restrictive means.\n            (3) Many people immigrated to America (including members of \n        the Quaker, Mennonite, and Church of the Brethren faiths) to \n        escape persecution for their refusal to participate in warfare, \n        yet during the First World War hundreds of conscientious \n        objectors were imprisoned in America for their beliefs. Some \n        died while incarcerated as a result of mistreatment.\n            (4) During the Second World War, ``alternative civilian \n        service'' was established in lieu of military service, by the \n        Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, to accommodate a \n        wide spectrum of religious beliefs and practices. Subsequent \n        case law also has expanded these exemptions, and has described \n        this policy as one of ``. . . long standing tradition in this \n        country . . .'' affording ``the important value of reconciling \n        individuality of belief with practical exigencies whenever \n        possible. It dates back to colonial times and has been \n        perpetuated in State and Federal conscription statutes'', and \n        ``has roots deeply embedded in history'' (Welsh v. United \n        States, 1970, Justice Harlan concurring). During and since the \n        Second World War thousands of conscientious objectors provided \n        essential staff for mental hospitals and volunteered as human \n        test subjects for arduous medical experiments, and provided \n        other service for the national health, safety and interest.\n            (5) Conscientious objectors have sought alternative service \n        for their tax payments since that time. They request legal \n        relief from government seizure of their homes, livestock, \n        automobiles, and other property; and from having bank accounts \n        attached, wages garnished, fines imposed, and imprisonment \n        threatened, to compel them to violate their personal and \n        religious convictions.\n            (6) Conscientious objection to participation in war in any \n        form based upon moral, ethical, or religious beliefs is \n        recognized in Federal law, with provision for alternative \n        service; but no such provision exists for taxpayers who are \n        conscientious objectors and who are compelled to participate in \n        war through the payment of taxes to support military \n        activities.\n            (7) The Joint Committee on Taxation has certified that a \n        tax trust fund, providing for conscientious objector taxpayers \n        to pay their full taxes for non-military purposes, would \n        increase Federal revenues.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Designated Conscientious Objector.--For purposes of this Act, \nthe term ``designated conscientious objector'' means a taxpayer who is \nopposed to participation in war in any form based upon the taxpayer's \nsincerely held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs or training (within \nthe meaning of the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. App. \n456(j))), and who has certified these beliefs in writing to the \nSecretary of the Treasury in such form and manner as the Secretary \nprovides.\n    (b) Military Purpose.--For purposes of this Act, the term \n``military purpose'' means any activity or program which any agency of \nthe Government conducts, administers, or sponsors and which effects an \naugmentation of military forces or of defensive and offensive \nintelligence activities, or enhances the capability of any person or \nnation to wage war, including the appropriation of funds by the United \nStates for--\n            (1) the Department of Defense;\n            (2) the intelligence community (as defined in section 3(4) \n        of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 104a(4)));\n            (3) the Selective Service System;\n            (4) activities of the Department of Energy that have a \n        military purpose;\n            (5) activities of the National Aeronautics and Space \n        Administration that have a military purpose;\n            (6) foreign military aid; and\n            (7) the training, supplying, or maintaining of military \n        personnel, or the manufacture, construction, maintenance, or \n        development of military weapons, installations, or strategies.\n\nSEC. 4.
