    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Technology Retraining and Investment \nNow Act for the 21st Century''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress hereby finds the following:\n            (1) The value added by workers in the United States and in \n        other countries is increasingly a function of the aggregate \n        knowledge acquired by workers through the aggregate educational \n        and training investments of both governments and businesses.\n            (2) The aggregate investment by governments of many of the \n        trading partners of the United States in the education and \n        training of knowledge workers in those countries has exceeded \n        the aggregate per-worker investment by Federal, State, and \n        local governments in the United States.\n            (3) The disparity is evidenced by the declining educational \n        performance of students in the United States compared to their \n        counterparts in other countries.\n            (4) In an increasingly global and competitive marketplace \n        it is becoming increasingly difficult for United States-based \n        businesses to fund worker education and training that is \n        provided at no cost for similar workers in other countries by \n        their governments.\n            (5) The current global workforce environment creates \n        increasing competitive pressures on domestic companies to \n        utilize highly educated knowledge workers in other countries.\n            (6) It is in the interest of the United States government, \n        national security, the preservation of a strong middle class, \n        and the welfare of our Nation's workers to reverse this trend \n        in a fashion that is consistent with trade obligations and the \n        ability of domestic companies to compete globally.\n            (7) Public-private partnerships work well in the United \n        States to advance the needs of our citizens, businesses and \n        communities. The research and development tax credit under \n        section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is just one \n        example of maximizing the use of each sector's strength, \n        reducing development risk and public capital investment, and \n        improving cost effectiveness.\n            (8) Businesses are most adept at training our workforce \n        because they train employees for available jobs, develop and \n        utilize new training methods, and eliminate ineffective \n        trainers and training programs.\n            (9) With a substantial number of baby boomers retiring over \n        the next 20 years, the United States has to ensure that it is \n        capable of training its workforce for the high paying \n        information and communications technology jobs, whose payroll \n        contributions will help support the benefit programs of these \n        retirees, as well as providing incentives to help mature \n        workers retrain for new jobs after they retire, if they desire.\n    (b) Purposes.--\n            (1) It is the purpose of this Act to encourage businesses \n        and individuals to support the educational development of \n        knowledge workers in the United States by providing incentives \n        for information and communications technology education and \n        training investments, for workers requiring the use of those \n        skills in professions such as information or communications \n        technology, engineering, manufacturing and other fields, and \n        for other purposes.\n            (2) By encouraging employers to train more incumbent \n        workers and potential employees in the areas necessary to \n        expand and maintain their businesses, the United States will \n        better utilize available training dollars and maximize the \n        ability of newly trained individuals to utilize their acquired \n        skills.\n\nSEC. 3.
