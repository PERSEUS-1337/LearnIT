FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The take-home pay of low-income families is subject to \n        reductions from many sources, including the Federal income tax, \n        Social Security payroll taxes, and State income taxes. In \n        addition, eligibility for many Federal and State programs for \n        assistance to the working families, such as the earned income \n        tax credit, the child tax credit, supplemental nutritional \n        assistance program, housing assistance programs, Federal and \n        State health care programs, child care assistance, and \n        temporary assistance to needy families, is based in part on \n        income levels. The rates at which the benefits from such \n        programs are phased out have the same disposable income \n        reducing effect as escalating marginal tax rates.\n            (2) The total effective marginal rate of tax for additional \n        income earned by low-income people can exceed 100 percent and \n        can be a disincentive to working more hours, getting a raise, \n        seeking education toward a more lucrative trade, getting \n        married, or engaging in other economic or social activities.\n            (3) Congress has enacted each of these programs without \n        consideration of the impact it would have on other existing \n        programs. As a result, the structure of the United States \n        system for the support of low-income families is uncoordinated \n        and contains features which work against the goal of \n        encouraging families to work their way toward self-sufficiency.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Low-income.--The term ``low-income'' means, with \n        respect to any individual or family group, an individual or \n        family group, as the case may be, whose income is not more than \n        225 percent of the poverty line (as defined by the Office of \n        Management and Budget).\n            (2) Federal benefits.--The term ``Federal benefits'' \n        means--\n                    (A) deductions, credits, and other tax benefits \n                available to low income taxpayers under the Internal \n                Revenue Code of 1986, including--\n                            (i) the earned income tax credit under \n                        section 32 of such Code,\n                            (ii) the child tax credit under section 24 \n                        of such Code, and\n                            (iii) the dependent care tax credit under \n                        section 21 of such Code, and\n                    (B) Federal assistance programs for low-income \n                individuals and families, including--\n                            (i) the supplemental nutritional assistance \n                        program established under the Food and \n                        Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.),\n                            (ii) any assistance, loan, loan guarantee, \n                        housing, housing assistance, or other housing \n                        related program administered, in whole or in \n                        part, by the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n                        Development, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, \n                        or any other Federal agency housing assistance, \n                        including the project-based and tenant-based \n                        rental assistance programs under section 8 of \n                        the United States Housing Act of 1937,\n                            (iii) any Federal programs providing child \n                        care assistance, and\n                            (iv) Federal programs providing health care \n                        assistance, including assistance under the \n                        Medicaid program established under title XIX of \n                        the Social Security Act and the State \n                        Children's Health Insurance Program under title \n                        XXI of such Act.\n            (3) Effective marginal tax rate.--The term ``effective \n        marginal tax rate'' means the cost, in terms of both taxes and \n        loss of Federal benefits, for each dollar earned by a low-\n        income individual.\n\nSEC. 4.

                   recommendations for increasing coordination of \n                        the delivery of Federal benefits for low-income \n                        families in order to reduce effective marginal \n                        tax rates and decrease disincentives to work \n                        and marriage.\n                            (ii) The relative usefulness of sudden \n                        benefit cutoffs (sometime referred to as \n                        ``cliffs'') versus gradual reductions (sometime \n                        referred to as ``phaseouts'') in Federal \n                        benefits on low-income workers' behavior \n                        relating to work and marriage.\n                            (iii) The interaction of Federal benefits \n                        and State assistance programs, and the \n                        potential benefits of structuring State \n                        programs consistent with the
