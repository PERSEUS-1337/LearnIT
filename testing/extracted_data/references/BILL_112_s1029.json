FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) improving consumers' understanding of and access to the \n        electric energy usage information of the consumers will help \n        consumers more effectively manage usage;\n            (2) consumers have a right of access to the electric energy \n        usage information of the consumers;\n            (3) the right of access to electric energy usage \n        information should be based on the need to have access to the \n        information rather than on a specific type of smart metering \n        technology and, as a result, all usage information platforms \n        can compete and innovation will be fostered;\n            (4) utilities should provide electric energy usage \n        information based on the best capabilities of the metering \n        technology currently deployed in the respective service areas \n        or, on upgrade, based on standards recognized by the National \n        Institute of Standards and Technology;\n            (5) consumers should have the ability to access unaudited \n        usage information directly from the electric meters of the \n        consumers or from sources independent of the electric meters, \n        and from sources independent of the utilities of the consumers;\n            (6) consumers should retain the right to the privacy and \n        security of electric energy usage information of the consumers \n        created through usage;\n            (7) consumers should have the right to control the electric \n        energy usage information of the consumers and the right to \n        privacy for the information when third party aggregators of \n        data are involved in creation, management, or collection of the \n        information; and\n            (8) consumers should have the right to know how the \n        authorized third-party data manager of the consumers will \n        manage the retail electric energy information of the consumers \n        once the manager has accessed the information.\n\nSEC. 3.
