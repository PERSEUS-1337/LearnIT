FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Individuals and their families have been harassed and \n        endangered by being persistently followed or chased in a manner \n        that puts them in reasonable fear of bodily injury, and in \n        danger of serious bodily injury or even death, by \n        photographers, videographers, and audio recorders attempting to \n        capture images or other reproductions of their private lives \n        for commercial purposes.\n            (2) The legitimate privacy interests of individuals and \n        their families have been violated by photographers, \n        videographers, and audio recorders who physically trespass in \n        order to capture images or other reproductions of their private \n        lives for commercial purposes, or who do so constructively \n        through intrusive modern visual or auditory enhancement \n        devices, such as powerful telephoto lenses and hyperbolic \n        microphones that enable invasion of private areas that would \n        otherwise be impossible without trespassing.\n            (3) Such harassment and trespass threatens not only \n        professional public persons and their families, but also \n        private persons and their families for whom personal tragedies \n        or circumstances beyond their control create media interest.\n            (4) Federal legislation is necessary to protect individuals \n        and their families from persistent following or chasing for \n        commercial purposes that causes reasonable fear of bodily \n        injury, because such harassment is not directly regulated by \n        applicable Federal, State, and local statutory or common laws, \n        because those laws provide an uneven patchwork of coverage, and \n        because those laws may not cover such activities when \n        undertaken for commercial purposes.\n            (5) Federal legislation is necessary to prohibit and \n        provide proper redress in Federal courts for trespass and \n        constructive trespass using intrusive visual or auditory \n        enhancement devices for commercial purposes, because \n        technological advances such as telephoto lenses and hyperbolic \n        microphones render inadequate existing common law and State and \n        local regulation of such trespass and invasion of privacy.\n            (6) There is no right, under the first amendment to the \n        Constitution of the United States, to persistently follow or \n        chase another in a manner that creates a reasonable fear of \n        bodily injury, to trespass, or to constructively trespass \n        through the use of intrusive visual or auditory enhancement \n        devices.\n            (7) This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, do not \n        in any way regulate, prohibit, or create liability for \n        publication or broadcast of any image or information, but \n        rather use narrowly tailored means to prohibit and create \n        liability for specific dangerous and intrusive activities that \n        the Federal Government has an important interest in preventing, \n        and ensure a safe and secure private realm for individuals \n        against intrusion, which the Federal Government has an \n        important interest in ensuring.\n            (8) This Act protects against unwarranted harassment, \n        endangerment, invasion of privacy, and trespass in an \n        appropriately narrowly tailored manner without abridging the \n        exercise of any rights guaranteed under the first amendment to \n        the Constitution of the United States, or any other provision \n        of law.\n            (9) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of \n        article I of the Constitution of the United States to enact \n        this Act.\n            (10) Because this Act regulates only conduct undertaken in \n        order to create products intended to be and routinely \n        transmitted, bought, or sold in interstate or foreign commerce, \n        or persons who travel in interstate or foreign commerce in \n        order to engage in regulated conduct, the Act is limited \n        properly to regulation of interstate or foreign commerce.\n            (11) Photographs and other reproductions of the private \n        activities of persons obtained through activities regulated by \n        this Act, and the amendments made by this Act, are routinely \n        reproduced and broadcast in interstate and international \n        commerce.\n            (12) Photographers, videographers, and audio recorders \n        routinely travel in interstate commerce in order to engage in \n        the activities regulated by this Act, and the amendments made \n        by this Act, with the intent, expectation, and routine result \n        of gaining material that is bought and sold in interstate \n        commerce.\n            (13) The activities regulated by this Act, and the \n        amendments made by this Act, occur routinely in the channels of \n        interstate commerce, such as the persistent following or \n        chasing of subjects in an inappropriate manner on public \n        streets and thoroughfares or in airports, and the use of public \n        streets and thoroughfares, interstate and international \n        airports, and travel in interstate and international waters in \n        order to physically or constructively trespass for commercial \n        purposes.\n            (14) The activities regulated by this Act, and the \n        amendments made by this Act, substantially affect interstate \n        commerce by threatening the careers, livelihoods, and rights to \n        publicity of professional public persons in the national and \n        international media, and by thrusting private persons into the \nnational and international media.\n            (15) The activities regulated by this Act, and the \n        amendments made by this Act, substantially affect interstate \n        commerce by restricting the movement of persons who are \n        targeted by such activities and their families, often forcing \n        them to curtail travel or appearances in public spaces, or, \n        conversely, forcing them to travel in interstate commerce in \n        order to escape from abuses regulated by this Act, and the \n        amendments made by this Act.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect individuals and their families against \n        reasonable fear of bodily injury, endangerment, trespass, and \n        intrusions on their privacy due to activities undertaken in \n        connection with interstate and international commerce in \n        reproduction and broadcast of their private activities;\n            (2) to protect interstate commerce affected by such \n        activities, including the interstate commerce of individuals \n        who are the subject of such activities; and\n            (3) to establish the right of private parties injured by \n        such activities, as well as the Attorney General of the United \n        States and State attorneys general in appropriate cases, to \n        bring actions for appropriate relief.\n\nSEC. 3.
