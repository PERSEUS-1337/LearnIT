ELECTRIC RELIABILITY STANDARDS.\n\n    Part II of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824 et seq.) is amended \nby inserting the following new section at the end thereof:\n\n``SEC. 215. ELECTRIC RELIABILITY.\n\n    ``(a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n            ``(1) The term `bulk-power system' means--\n                    ``(A) facilities and control systems necessary for \n                operating an interconnected electric energy \n                transmission network (or any portion thereof); and\n                    ``(B) electric energy from generation facilities \n                needed to maintain transmission system reliability.\n        The term does not include facilities used in the local \n        distribution of electric energy.\n            ``(2) The terms `Electric Reliability Organization' and \n        `ERO' mean the organization certified by the Commission under \n        subsection (c) the purpose of which is to establish and enforce \n        reliability standards for the bulk-power system, subject to \n        Commission review.\n            ``(3) The term `reliability standard' means a requirement, \n        approved by the Commission under this section, to provide for \n        reliable operation of the bulk-power system. The term includes \n        requirements for the operation of existing bulk-power system \n        facilities and the design of planned additions or modifications \n        to such facilities to the extent necessary to provide for \n        reliable operation of the bulk-power system, but the term does \n        not include any requirement to enlarge such facilities or to \n        construct new transmission capacity or generation capacity.\n            ``(4) The term `reliable operation' means operating the \n        elements of the bulk-power system within equipment and electric \n        system thermal, voltage, and stability limits so that \n        instability, uncontrolled separation, or cascading failures of \n        such system will not occur as a result of a sudden disturbance \n        or unanticipated failure of system elements.\n            ``(5) The term `Interconnection' means a geographic area in \n        which the operation of bulk-power system components is \n        synchronized such that the failure of one or more of such \n        components may adversely affect the ability of the operators of \n        other components within the system to maintain reliable \n        operation of the facilities within their control.\n            ``(6) The term `transmission organization' means a regional \n        transmission organization, independent system operator, \n        independent transmission provider, or other transmission \n        organization finally approved by the Commission for the \n        operation of transmission facilities.\n            ``(7) The term `regional entity' means an entity having \n        enforcement authority pursuant to subsection (e)(4).\n    ``(b) Jurisdiction and Applicability.--(1) The Commission shall \nhave jurisdiction, within the United States, over the ERO certified by \nthe Commission under subsection (c), any regional entities, and all \nusers, owners and operators of the bulk-power system, including but not \nlimited to the entities described in section 201(f), for purposes of \napproving reliability standards established under this section and \nenforcing compliance with this section. All users, owners and operators \nof the bulk-power system shall comply with reliability standards that \ntake effect under this section.\n    ``(2) The Commission shall issue a final rule to implement the \nrequirements of this section not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this section.\n    ``(c) Certification.--Following the issuance of a Commission rule \nunder subsection (b)(2), any person may submit an application to the \nCommission for certification as the Electric Reliability Organization \n(ERO). The Commission may certify one such ERO if the Commission \ndetermines that such ERO--\n            ``(1) has the ability to develop and enforce, subject to \n        subsection (e)(2), reliability standards that provide for an \n        adequate level of reliability of the bulk-power system; and\n            ``(2) has established rules that--\n                    ``(A) assure its independence of the users and \n                owners and operators of the bulk-power system, while \n                assuring fair stakeholder representation in the \n                selection of its directors and balanced decisionmaking \n                in any ERO committee or subordinate organizational \n                structure;\n                    ``(B) allocate equitably reasonable dues, fees, and \n                other charges among end users for all activities under \n                this section;\n                    ``(C) provide fair and impartial procedures for \n                enforcement of reliability standards through the \n                imposition of penalties in accordance with subsection \n                (e) (including limitations on activities, functions, or \n                operations, or other appropriate sanctions);\n                    ``(D) provide for reasonable notice and opportunity \n                for public comment, due process, openness, and balance \n                of interests in developing reliability standards and \n                otherwise exercising its duties; and\n                    ``(E) provide for taking, after certification, \n                appropriate steps to gain recognition in Canada and \n                Mexico.\n    ``(d) Reliability Standards.--(1) The Electric Reliability \nOrganization shall file each reliability standard or modification to a \nreliability standard that it proposes to be made effective under this \nsection with the Commission.\n    ``(2) The Commission may approve, by rule or order, a proposed \nreliability standard or modification to a reliability standard if it \ndetermines that the standard is just, reasonable, not unduly \ndiscriminatory or preferential, and in the public interest. The \nCommission shall give due weight to the technical expertise of the \nElectric Reliability Organization with respect to the content of a \nproposed standard or modification to a reliability standard and to the \ntechnical expertise of a regional entity organized on an \nInterconnection-wide basis with respect to a reliability standard to be \napplicable within that Interconnection, but shall not defer with \nrespect to the effect of a standard on competition. A proposed standard \nor modification shall take effect upon approval by the Commission.\n    ``(3) The Electric Reliability Organization shall rebuttably \npresume that a proposal from a regional entity organized on an \nInterconnection-wide basis for a reliability standard or modification \nto a reliability standard to be applicable on an Interconnection-wide \nbasis is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or \npreferential, and in the public interest.\n    ``(4) The Commission shall remand to the Electric Reliability \nOrganization for further consideration a proposed reliability standard \nor a modification to a reliability standard that the Commission \ndisapproves in whole or in part.\n    ``(5) The Commission, upon its own motion or upon complaint, may \norder the Electric Reliability Organization to submit to the Commission \na proposed reliability standard or a modification to a reliability \nstandard that addresses a specific matter if the Commission considers \nsuch a new or modified reliability standard appropriate to carry out \nthis section.\n    ``(6) The final rule adopted under subsection (b)(2) shall include \nfair processes for the identification and timely resolution of any \nconflict between a reliability standard and any function, rule, order, \ntariff, rate schedule, or agreement accepted, approved, or ordered by \nthe Commission applicable to a transmission organization.

Such penalty shall be subject to review by the Commission, \non its own motion or upon application by the user, owner or operator \nthat is the subject of the penalty filed within 30 days after the date \nsuch notice is filed with the Commission. Application to the Commission \nfor review, or the initiation of review by the Commission on its own \nmotion, shall not operate as a stay of such penalty unless the \nCommission otherwise orders upon its own motion or upon application by \nthe user, owner or operator that is the subject of such penalty. In any \nproceeding to review a penalty imposed under paragraph (1), the \nCommission, after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may \nconsist solely of the record before the electric reliability \norganization and opportunity for the presentation of supporting reasons \nto affirm, modify, or set aside the penalty), shall by order affirm, \nset aside, reinstate, or modify the penalty, and, if appropriate, \nremand to the electric reliability organization for further \nproceedings. The Commission shall implement expedited procedures for \nsuch hearings.\n    ``(3) On its own motion or upon complaint, the Commission may order \ncompliance with a reliability standard and may impose a penalty against \na user or owner or operator of the bulk-power system, if the Commission \nfinds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the user or \nowner or operator of the bulk-power system has engaged or is about to \nengage in any acts or practices that constitute or will constitute a \nviolation of a reliability standard.\n    ``(4) The Commission shall establish regulations authorizing the \nERO to enter into an agreement to delegate authority to a regional \nentity for the purpose of proposing reliability standards to the ERO \nand enforcing reliability standards under paragraph (1) if--\n            ``(A) the regional entity is governed by--\n                    ``(i) an independent board;\n                    ``(ii) a balanced stakeholder board; or\n                    ``(iii) a combination independent and balanced \n                stakeholder board.\n            ``(B) the regional entity otherwise satisfies the \n        provisions of subsection (c)(1) and (2); and\n            ``(C) the agreement promotes effective and efficient \n        administration of bulk-power system reliability.\nThe Commission may modify such delegation. The ERO and the Commission \nshall rebuttably presume that a proposal for delegation to a regional \nentity organized on an Interconnection-wide basis promotes effective \nand efficient administration of bulk-power system reliability and \nshould be approved. Such regulation may provide that the Commission may \nassign the ERO's authority to enforce reliability standards under \nparagraph (1) directly to a regional entity consistent with the \nrequirements of this paragraph.\n    ``(5) The Commission may take such action as is necessary or \nappropriate against the ERO or a regional entity to ensure compliance \nwith a reliability standard or any Commission order affecting the ERO \nor a regional entity.\n    ``(6) Any penalty imposed under this section shall bear a \nreasonable relation to the seriousness of the violation and shall take \ninto consideration the efforts of such user, owner, or operator to \nremedy the violation in a timely manner.\n    ``(f) Changes in Electricity Reliability Organization Rules.--The \nElectric Reliability Organization shall file with the Commission for \napproval any proposed rule or proposed rule change, accompanied by an \nexplanation of its basis and purpose.

A regional advisory body shall be \ncomposed or of one member from each participating State in the region, \nappointed by the Governor of each State, and may include \nrepresentatives of agencies, States, and provinces outside the United \nStates. A regional advisory body may provide advice to the Electric \nReliability Organization, a regional entity, or the Commission \nregarding the governance of an existing or proposed regional entity \nwithin the same region, whether a standard proposed to apply within the \nregion is just, reasonable, not unduly discriminatory or preferential, \nand in the public interest, whether fees proposed to be assessed within \nthe region are just, reasonable, not unduly discriminatory or \npreferential, and in the public interest and any other responsibilities \nrequested by the Commission. The Commission may give deference to the \nadvice of any such regional advisory body if that body is organized on \nan Interconnection-wide basis.\n    ``(k) Application to Alaska and Hawaii.--The provisions of this \nsection do not apply to Alaska or Hawaii.''."
