    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands Reform Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the \n        Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United \n        States of America was approved by Congress pursuant to Public \n        Law 94-241, 90 Stat. 263.\n            (2) At the time that the Covenant was being negotiated, \n        representatives of the government of the Northern Mariana \n        Islands expressed concern that United States immigration laws \n        would allow unrestricted immigration into their small island \n        community.\n            (3) In response to these concerns, section 503(a) of the \n        Covenant provided that the Immigration and Naturalization Act \n        did not immediately apply to the Commonwealth of the Northern \n        Mariana Islands.\n            (4) Congress expressly reserved the right to extend the \n        Immigration and Naturalization Act to the Commonwealth of the \n        Northern Mariana Islands at a future date.\n            (5) Following the enactment of the Covenant, the \n        Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands instituted a \n        largely unrestricted immigration policy, causing the \n        Commonwealth's population to increase from 16,780 in 1980 to a \n        population of over 58,800 in 1995, with foreign workers \n        outnumbering United States citizens.\n            (6) As a result of these immigration policies, 91 percent \n        of the private sector work force in the Commonwealth is \n        comprised of foreign workers.\n            (7) The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has \n        used its immigration policy to recruit a large, low-cost \n        foreign work force of desperately poor individuals with no \n        meaningful opportunity to demand safe living and working \n        conditions of fair wages and benefits.\n            (8) Notwithstanding an unemployment rate of 14 percent \n        among United States citizens, the Commonwealth has recruited \n        increasing numbers of foreign workers.\n            (9) Even though the Commonwealth alleges that unfilled job \n        openings justify recruitment of an increasing number of foreign \n        workers, the Commonwealth's own statistics indicate an \n        unemployment rate of 4.5 percent among foreign workers.\n            (10) The United States Immigration and Naturalization \n        Service reported that the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n        Islands has no reliable records of aliens who have entered the \n        Commonwealth, how long they remain, and when, if ever, they \n        depart.\n            (11) At the time that the Covenant was being negotiated, \n        representatives of the government of the Northern Mariana \n        Islands expressed concern that the minimum wage provisions of \n        the Fair Labor Standards Act would disrupt the Commonwealth's \n        struggling local economy.\n            (12) In response to these concerns, section 503(c) of the \n        Covenant provided that the minimum wage provisions of the Fair \n        Labor Standards Act did not immediately apply to the \n        Commonwealth.\n            (13) Congress expressly reserved the right to extend the \n        minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to the \n        Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands at a future date.\n            (14) The economy of the Commonwealth of the Northern \n        Mariana Islands has grown significantly and, in 1996, annual \n        gross business revenues rose to $1,500,000,000, a sixfold \n        increase during the past decade.\n            (15) The current minimum wage in the Commonwealth of the \n        Northern Mariana Islands is only $3.05 per hour for garment and \n        construction industry workers and $3.05 per hour for those \n        working in other industries.\n            (16) The United States Department of Labor has uncovered a \n        systematic pattern of labor abuses in the Commonwealth of the \n        Northern Mariana Islands, including--\n                    (A) involuntary servitude and peonage,\n                    (B) illegal withholding of wages earned,\n                    (C) nonpayment of overtime wages,\n                    (D) illegal deductions from paychecks,\n                    (E) kickbacks of wages paid to employees,\n                    (F) employee lockdowns in worksites and living \n                barracks, and\n                    (G) unsafe and unhealthy working and living \n                environments.\n            (17) Despite an expectation that they will enjoy the \n        American dream in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n        Islands, foreign workers have been required to sign contracts \n        with government representatives in the People's Republic of \n        China which--\n                    (A) waive rights guaranteed to United States \n                workers,\n                    (B) forbid participation in religious and political \n                activities while in the United States,\n                    (C) prohibit workers from dating or marrying in the \n                United States,\n                    (D) subject employees to civil and labor penalties \n                if returned to China, and\n                    (E) permit Chinese Government recruiters to charge \n                a fee of 25 percent of an employee's net pay for a \n                period of two years.\n            (18) The United States Department of Justice has determined \n        that the immigration and labor situation in the Commonwealth of \n        the Northern Mariana Islands has created a major organized \n        crime problem in the Commonwealth which involves--\n                    (A) immigration document fraud,\n                    (B) public corruption,\n                    (C) racketeering,\n                    (D) drug trafficking,\n                    (E) prostitution,\n                    (F) pornography,\n                    (G) extortion,\n                    (H) gambling,\n                    (I) smuggling, and\n                    (J) other forms of violent crime.\n            (19) The United States Department of Justice is \n        investigating numerous cases in the Commonwealth of the \n        Northern Mariana Islands of women being recruited from the \n        Philippines, China, and other Asian countries expressly for \n        criminal sexual activity, and has also described this situation \n        as the ``systematic trafficking of women and minors for \n        prostitution''.\n            (20) The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is \n        exempt from Federal immigration law, the Federal minimum wage \n        law, and Federal tariffs and taxes, yet its products are sold \n        as ``Made in USA'' although 95 percent of the workers in the \n        garment manufacturing industry are not United States citizens.\n            (21) Garments made in the Commonwealth of the Northern \n        Mariana Islands carrying the ``Made in USA'' label compete \n        directly with garments made on the United States mainland by \n        workers and businesses that are subject to Federal immigration \n        law, the Federal minimum wage law, and Federal taxes.\n            (22) In 1996, garment manufacturers in the Commonwealth \n        shipped garments to the Continental United States with a \n        wholesale value of $555 million, a 30-percent increase over the \n        previous year.\n            (23) Congress appropriated $10 million to fund a three-year \n        initiative by the United States Departments of Justice, Labor, \n        and Interior to assist the Commonwealth in its efforts to \n        improve its labor and immigration policies.\n            (24) Despite this appropriation there has been little or no \n        improvement in the immigration and labor policies of the \n        Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n            (25) The government of the Commonwealth of the Northern \n        Mariana Islands has been ineffective in stemming the flow of \n        immigration onto United States soil, raising the wage and \n        living standards for workers, and aggressively prosecuting \n        labor and human rights abuses.\n            (26) Despite efforts by the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton \n        administrations to persuade the government of the Commonwealth \n        of the Northern Mariana Islands to correct problems in the \n        Commonwealth, the situation has only deteriorated.\n            (27) The continuing concern about labor abuses, the \n        Commonwealth's immigration policy, and the employment of \n        foreign workers in a manner that unfairly competes with other \n        United States manufacturing prompted President Clinton on May \n        30, 1997, to notify the Governor of the Commonwealth of the \n        Northern Mariana Islands that Federal immigration and minimum \n        wage laws should be applied to the Commonwealth.\n\nSEC. 3. APPLICATION OF IMMIGRATION LAW.\n\n    (a) Article V, section 506 of the Covenant to Establish a \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with \nthe United States of America (approved by Public Law 94-241, 90 Stat. \n263) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n    ``(e)(1) For purposes of entry into the Northern Mariana Islands by \nany individual (but not for purposes of entry by an individual into the \nUnited States from the Northern Mariana Islands), the Immigration and \nNationality Act shall apply as if the Northern Mariana Islands were a \nState (as defined in section 101(a)(36) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act).\n    ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), with respect to an individual \nseeking entry into the Northern Mariana Islands for purposes of \nemployment in the textile, hotel, tourist, or construction industry \n(including employment as a contractor), the Federal statutes and \nregulations governing admission to Guam of individuals described in \nsection 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \nshall apply.
