FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Nearly half the world's population cooks their food \n        over open fires or inefficient, polluting, and unsafe \n        cookstoves using firewood, dung, or coal. Smoke from the use of \n        these traditional cookstoves and open fires is associated with \n        a number of chronic and acute diseases, including respiratory \n        illnesses such as pneumonia, heart disease, and cancer, with \n        women and young children affected disproportionately.\n            (2) It is estimated that smoke from cooking fuels accounts \n        for nearly 2,000,000 deaths annually in the developing world, \n        which is more than the deaths from malaria, tuberculosis, or \n        HIV. Millions more are sickened from the toxic smoke and \n        thousands suffer burns annually from open fires or unsafe \n        cookstoves.\n            (3) The amount of biomass cooking fuel required each year \n        can reach up to 2 tons per family. Where demand for local \n        biomass outstrips the natural regrowth of resources, local \n        environmental problems can result.\n            (4) Tremendous amounts of time--a burden shouldered \n        disproportionately by women and children--is spent collecting \n        and managing biomass cooking fuel resources.\n            (5) As nearby fuel supplies dwindle, women are forced to go \n        farther to find fuel to cook their families' meals. In some \n        regions, women and girls risk rape and other forms of gender-\n        based violence during the up to 20 hours per week they spend \n        away from their communities gathering firewood.\n            (6) Recent studies show that black carbon created from \n        biomass cookstoves significantly contributes to regional air \n        pollution and climate change. Black carbon emissions from \n        residential cookstoves in developing countries account for an \n        estimated 21 percent of total global inventory, and mitigation \n        in this sector represents a large potential public health \n        benefit.\n            (7) The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is an \n        innovative public-private partnership led by the United Nations \n        Foundation that was created to enable the adoption of clean and \n        efficient stoves in 100,000,000 homes by 2020. The Alliance \n        intends to work with public, private, and non-profit partners \n        to raise $250,000,000 towards overcoming market barriers that \n        currently impede the production, deployment, and use of clean \n        cookstoves in the developing world.\n            (8) The United States Government has committed a total of \n        up to $105,000,000 over the first five years of the Alliance to \n        help it achieve its goal of spurring the adoption of clean \n        cookstoves in 100,000,000 households by 2020, as follows:\n                    (A) The Department of State and the United States \n                Agency for International Development will commit \n                $11,570,000 to promote the adoption of clean \n                cookstoves, encourage foreign government support, and \n                further economic opportunities for women.\n                    (B) The Department of Energy will commit \n                $12,500,000 for applied research to advance clean \n                cookstove technologies and designs.\n                    (C) The Department of Health and Human Services \n                will commit $24,700,000 through the National Institutes \n                of Health and $2,180,000 through the Centers for \n                Disease Control and Prevention for health research and \n                implementation evaluation.\n                    (D) The Environmental Protection Agency will commit \n                $6,000,000 to enhance stove testing and evaluation, \n                cookstove design innovation, and the assessment of \n                health benefits.\n                    (E) The Overseas Private Investment Corporation \n                will commit up to $50,000,000 for debt financing or \n                insurance for projects that provide access to clean, \n                consistent, and affordable energy through the promotion \n                of clean cookstoves.\n\nSEC. 3.
