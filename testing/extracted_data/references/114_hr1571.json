FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Medicare requires beneficiaries to be hospitalized for \n        medically necessary inpatient hospital care for at least three \n        consecutive days before covering post-hospital care in a \n        skilled nursing facility under section 1861(i) of the Social \n        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(i)).\n            (2) Often patients remain under ``observation status'' in \n        the hospital for several days and these observation days are \n        not counted toward the 3-day stay requirement because they are \n        considered outpatient days.\n            (3) Hospitals' use of observation stays has increased \n        sharply since 2006. According to the March 2014 report of the \n        Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, outpatient visits, many \n        of which are observation stays, increased 28.5 percent between \n        2006 and 2012, with a simultaneous 12.6 percent decrease in \n        inpatient stays over this same six-year time period. A study \n        published in Health Affairs found a 34-percent increase in the \n        ratio of observation stays to inpatient admissions between 2007 \n        and 2009, leading the researchers to conclude that outpatient \n        observation status was becoming a substitute for inpatient \n        admission. The same study also documented increases in long-\n        stay outpatient status, including an 88-percent increase in \n        observation stays exceeding 72 hours.\n            (4) To health care providers, care provided during \n        observation is indistinguishable from the care provided to \n        inpatients and all medically necessary care is provided, \n        regardless of patient status. Beneficiaries are generally not \n        informed of their inpatient or outpatient status and assume \n        that they are inpatients when they are placed in a hospital \n        bed, only to find out that such care was not counted for \n        purposes of satisfying eligibility requirements for medically \n        prescribed Medicare coverage of post-hospital care in a skilled \n        nursing facility.\n            (5) Older Americans and people with disabilities who are \n        hospitalized but do not meet the 3-day inpatient hospital stay \n        requirement simply because they were placed in ``outpatient \n        observation status'' for some or all of their hospital stay \n        (even when their total actual stay exceeds three days in the \n        hospital) can face a significant and unexpected financial \n        burden, which can amount to thousands of dollars, for skilled \n        nursing facility care. Among beneficiaries who received care in \n        a skilled nursing facility that Medicare did not cover, the \n        average out-of-pocket charges were more than $10,000, according \n        to the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health \n        and Human Services.\n            (6) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \n        attempted to provide hospitals with clarity on which patients \n        should be categorized as inpatients in the inpatient hospital \n        payment rule for fiscal year 2014. However, this rule fails \n        Medicare beneficiaries because it does not address the problem \n        and explicitly states that days spent in observation status do \n        not count for purposes of satisfying the 3-day inpatient stay \n        requirement.\n            (7) Because of CMS' policy which indicates days under \n        observation do not count towards the 3-day inpatient stay \n        requirement, some patients under observation and their families \n        will continue to face a significant, often insurmountable \n        financial burden if they need skilled nursing care after their \n        hospital stay.\n            (8) This Act updates Medicare policy by deeming patients \n        under observation as inpatients for the purposes of satisfying \n        the Medicare 3-day inpatient stay requirement. This Act does \n        not repeal the 3-day inpatient stay requirement; rather it \n        simply expands the Secretary's administrative definition of \n        ``inpatient'' for purposes of the 3-day stay requirement to \n        include time spent under observation. As such, it is not a \n        reprise of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, \n        which repealed the 3-day requirement. This Act simply restores \n        the original objective of the 3-day rule, which was to ensure \n        Medicare coverage of skilled nursing facility stays following \n        hospital care for patients who stayed in the hospital for 3 \n        days.\n            (9) It is the intent of this Congress, through this Act, to \n        allow access to skilled nursing care for the population of \n        beneficiaries who meet medical necessity requirements for such \n        care, but who do not satisfy the 3-day inpatient stay \n        requirement simply because some or all of their time in the \n        acute care hospital is characterized as ``outpatient \n        observation status'' for billing purposes.\n            (10) It is the understanding of Congress that the Secretary \n        of Health and Human Services will monitor patterns of behavior \n        to ensure that providers deliver appropriate and needed levels \n        of care.\n            (11) The Office of the Inspector General of the Department \n        of Health and Human Services is supportive of counting hospital \n        observation days towards the 3-day inpatient stay requirement. \n        In addition, in September 2013, the Congressionally established \n        Commission on Long-Term Care recommended that CMS count time \n        spent in observation status toward meeting Medicare's 3-day \n        stay requirement.\n\nSEC. 3. COUNTING A PERIOD OF RECEIPT OF OUTPATIENT OBSERVATION SERVICES \n              IN A HOSPITAL TOWARD THE 3-DAY INPATIENT HOSPITAL STAY \n              REQUIREMENT FOR COVERAGE OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITY \n              SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1861(i) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395x(i)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``For \npurposes of this subsection, an individual receiving outpatient \nobservation services shall be deemed to be an inpatient during such \nperiod, and the date such individual ceases receiving such services \nshall be deemed the hospital discharge date (unless such individual is \nadmitted as a hospital inpatient at the end of such period).''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \napply to receipt of outpatient observation services beginning on or \nafter January 1, 2015, but applies to a period of post-hospital \nextended care services that was completed before the date of the \nenactment of this Act only if an administrative appeal is or has been \nmade with respect to such services not later than 90 days after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act. Notwithstanding any other provision \nof law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may implement such \namendment through an interim final regulation, program instruction, or \notherwise."
