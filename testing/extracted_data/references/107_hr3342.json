FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Before 1996, women in Afghanistan could exercise their \n        basic human rights and 70 percent of teachers, nurses, doctors, \n        and small business owners in Afghanistan were women.\n            (2) More than 90 percent of Afghan men and women believe \n        that women should have access to education and work, freedom of \n        expression, legal protection, and participation in government. \n        Respondents also support the inclusion of women's human rights \n        issues in any peace negotiations with respect to Afghanistan.\n            (3) Women make up more than 75 percent of the refugees in \n        camps, urban areas, and villages in Afghanistan. On the \n        Afghanistan border with Pakistan many organizations, including \n        women's organizations, are delivering critical services to \n        refugees and such women's organizations have the knowledge and \n        experience to assist the United States in delivering effective \n        relief aid to women.\n            (4) The active participation of women in the government, \n        economy, and society of Afghanistan is necessary to ensure \n        lasting peace in the region.\n            (5) During major conflicts in the region, women have \n        maintained local economies and have led the effort in \n        rebuilding economies after conflicts. Effective development and \n        reconstruction assistance, including microcredit assistance, \n        takes into account women's roles as economic leaders.\n\nSEC. 3.
