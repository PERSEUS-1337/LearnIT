FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Coal mining has been an important part of the \n        industrial heritage of the United States for over 150 years. As \n        coal is removed from underground mines, a large amount of other \n        materials accompanies the coal to the surface. This substance, \n        known as gob, contains a mixture of clay, rocks, soil, \n        minerals, and other raw materials. The gob piles contain \n        millions of cubic feet of material known to contribute to acid \n        mine drainage.\n            (2) The mountains of gob contain large amounts of potential \n        energy that can be recycled to create new sources of power. The \n        technology to use the gob pile materials as an efficient \n        alternative energy source has been developed over the past 15 \n        years. However, the incentive to invest in the technology has \n        not been pursued due to the high capitalization and operating \n        costs.\n            (3) Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) combustion is a clean \n        coal technology that produces low emissions of sulfur dioxides, \n        nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and mercury. CFB \n        represents the best available control technology to burn waste \n        coal and recover the energy stored therein. By using waste coal \n        as the fuel source, the existing waste coal sites can be \n        reclaimed, the mine drainage associated with these sites \n        ameliorated, and the alkaline coal combustion byproducts \n        beneficially used in reclaiming the mine lands.\n            (4) Developing alternate energy sources reduces energy \n        costs, reduces dependencies on foreign oil, and improves the \n        competitiveness of American industry. Increasing energy \n        demands, and over reliance on limited sources of energy, will \n        result in higher prices for homeowners and industry. Higher \n        production costs hurt American jobs, overburdens industry, and \n        stifles economic growth. The development of alternate energy \n        sources will result in lower prices, a cleaner environment, new \n        manufacturing, and more jobs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage and create \nincentives for alternate fuel sources to meet the increasing demands of \nhomeowners and industries while helping to keep the environment clean \nby utilizing waste coal efficiently.\n\nSEC. 3. ENERGY PRODUCED FROM WASTE COAL.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to business related \ncredits) is amended by inserting after section 45I the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 45J. ENERGY PRODUCED FROM WASTE COAL.\n\n    ``(a) General Rule.--For purposes of section 38, the waste coal \nenergy production credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to \n$0.75 per million Btu of heat input utilized by the taxpayer to produce \nenergy in an eligible facility from qualified waste coal during the \ntaxable year.\n    ``(b) Credit Reduced for Grants.--The amount of the credit \ndetermined under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any \ntaxable year shall be reduced by the amount which is the product of the \namount so determined for such year and a fraction--\n            ``(1) the numerator of which is the sum, for the taxable \n        year and all prior taxable years, of--\n                    ``(A) grants provided by the United States, a \n                State, or a political subdivision of a State for use in \n                connection with the project, and\n                    ``(B) the amount of any other credit allowable with \n                respect to any property which is part of the project, \n                and\n            ``(2) the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of \n        additions to the capital account for the project for the \n        taxable year and all prior taxable years.\nThe amounts under the preceding sentence for any taxable year shall be \ndetermined as of the close of the taxable year.\n    ``(c) Qualified Waste Coal.--\n            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the term \n        `qualified waste coal' means coal certified by the Secretary to \n        be waste (as defined
