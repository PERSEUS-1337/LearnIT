SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Public Rangeland \nGrazing Reform Act of 1993''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds--\n            (1) the Federal rangelands and riparian areas under the \n        jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest \n        Service in Western States should be managed in a manner to \n        achieve and sustain a status of healthy native range and \n        riparian ecosystems and in a manner that will sustain a full \n        and thriving spectrum of biologically diverse plant and animal \n        species within such ecosystems;\n            (2) a substantial amount of Federal rangeland continues to \n        be in a deteriorated condition;\n            (3) measures taken by the Bureau of Land Management and the \n        Forest Service to improve the condition of Federal rangelands \n        have not resulted in sufficient progress toward the achievement \n        of ecologically healthy and biologically diverse range and \n        riparian ecosystems for these lands;\n            (4) the fee formula established by Executive Order Numbered \n        12548 of February 14, 1986, has resulted in fees that have not \n        returned to the Nation's citizens an adequate return for the \n        privilege of utilizing affected rangeland for livestock \n        grazing; and\n            (5) it is necessary to revise applicable law so as to \n        improve management of grazing on rangelands in Western States \n        managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest \n        Service.\n\nSEC. 2.

No grazing pursuant to such permit shall be permitted after \nsuch termination unless, prior to such termination, the party that has \nobtained or will obtain control of such property or part thereof has \nsubmitted an application for a grazing permit based on such control, in \nwhich case the Secretary concerned may allow grazing to continue if \nsuch Secretary has reason to believe that such application is likely to \nbe approved. Such continued grazing shall be for a period no longer \nthan the remainder of the grazing year during which such application \nwas submitted.\n    ``(B)(i) A grazing permit held by a natural person shall terminate \nupon the death of its holder, but the Secretary may permit grazing to \ncontinue on lands covered by such grazing permit for a period not to \nexceed 2 years after the date of the death of such holder if necessary \nor appropriate in order to facilitate the orderly management of the \ndeceased holder's estate.\n    ``(ii) A grazing permit shall terminate upon an involuntary \ntransfer from the control of its holder (including a transfer by \noperation of law) of the privately owned property (or portion thereof) \nwith respect to which such grazing permit was issued, but the Secretary \nmay permit grazing to continue on lands covered by such grazing permit \nfor a period not to exceed 1 year after such involuntary transfer, if \nnecessary, in order to facilitate the redemption, sale, or other \ndisposition of such property or portion thereof.\n    ``(iii) After any continuation of grazing pursuant to either clause \n(i) or (ii) any grazing on lands affected by such continuation shall \noccur only subject to a new grazing permit.\n    ``(iv) Any decision by the Secretary concerned to permit a \ncontinuation of grazing pursuant to this paragraph shall be \ndiscretionary, and this paragraph shall not be construed as vesting in \nany party any right to graze livestock on any lands owned by the United \nStates or any right to any grazing permit.\n    ``(5) Any holder of a grazing permit who knowingly allows \nsubleasing to occur on public lands or National Forest lands covered by \nsuch permit shall forfeit to the United States the dollar equivalent of \nany value in excess of the grazing fee paid or payable to the United \nStates with respect to such permit, shall be disqualified from further \nexercise of any rights or privileges conferred by that permit or any \nother grazing permit, and shall be subject to the penalties specified \nin section 303 of this Act.\n    ``(6) Any person other than the holder of a grazing permit who \nknowingly engages in subleasing on or after the date of enactment of \nthis subsection shall be subject to the penalties specified in section \n303 of this Act.''."
