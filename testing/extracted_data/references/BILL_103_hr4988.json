Not later than October 1, 1996, the \n                Secretary shall report to the Congress on the results \n                of such project. If the Secretary finds, on the basis \n                of existing data, that furnishing any of these \n                examinations under the Medicare program to the extent \n                provided under the amendments made by this section is \n                cost-effective, and useful in decreasing incidents of \n                such cancers, the Secretary shall include such finding \n                in such report, such project shall be discontinued, and \n                the amendments made by this section shall become \n                effective on November 1, 1966.\n                    (ii) If the Secretary determines that such finding \n                cannot be made on the basis of existing data, such \n                project shall continue for an additional twenty-four \n                months. Not later than April 1, 1998, the Secretary \n                shall submit a final report to Congress on the results \n                of such project. The amendments made by this section \n                shall become effective on the first day of the first \n                month to begin after such report is submitted to the \n                Congress unless the report contains a finding by the \n                Secretary that furnishing preventive health care \n                examinations under the amendments made by this section \n                is not cost effective or does not reduce the incidence \n                of such cancers (in which case the amendments made by \n                this section shall not become effective).\n            (3) In conducting the demonstration project in order to \n        determine the cost effectiveness and effectiveness in reducing \n        the incidence of such cancers of including preventive health \n        care examinations in the medicare program, the Secretary is \n        required to conduct a demonstration of the provision of \n        preventive health care examinations as a service for medicare \n        beneficiaries and to expend $15,000,000 each year of the \n        demonstration project for this purpose. In conducting this \n        demonstration, the Secretary is authorized to reimburse for \n        such services in large scale demonstration projects, including \n        statewide projects. In determining cost effectiveness, the \n        Secretary shall consider the direct cost of providing such \n        services, the utilization of such services which might \n        otherwise not have occurred, the costs of illnesses and nursing \n        home days avoided, and other relevant factors, except that \n        extended life for beneficiaries shall not be considered to \n        reduce the cost effectiveness of preventive health care \n        examinations."
