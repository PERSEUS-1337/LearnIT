FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to a 1999 issue brief prepared by the \n        National Center for Education Statistics, the average public \n        school in America is 42 years old, and school buildings begin \n        rapid deterioration after 40 years. In addition, 29 percent of \n        all public schools are in the oldest condition, meaning that \n        the schools were built before 1970 and have either never been \n        renovated or were renovated prior to 1980.\n            (2) According to reports issued by the General Accounting \n        Office (GAO) in 1995 and 1996, it would cost $112,000,000,000 \n        to bring the Nation's schools into good overall condition, and \n        one-third of all public schools need extensive repair or \n        replacement.\n            (3) Many schools do not have the appropriate infrastructure \n        to support computers and other technologies that are necessary \n        to prepare students for the jobs of the 21st century.\n            (4) Without impeding on local control, the Federal \n        Government appropriately can assist State, regional, and local \n        entities in addressing school construction, renovation, and \n        repair needs by providing low-interest loans for purposes of \n        paying interest on related bonds and by supporting other State-\n        administered school construction programs.\n\nSEC. 3.

In determining \n        the schools with greatest need, the State shall take into \n        consideration whether a school--\n                    (A) is among the schools that have the greatest \n                numbers or percentages of children whose education \n                imposes a higher than average cost per child, such as--\n                            (i) children living in areas with high \n                        concentrations of low-income families;\n                            (ii) children from low-income families; and\n                            (iii) children living in sparsely populated \n                        areas;\n                    (B) has inadequate school facilities and a low \n                level of resources to meet the need for school \n                facilities;\n                    (C) is located in an area experiencing high \n                population growth; or\n                    (D) meets such criteria as the State may determine \n                to be appropriate.\n    (b) Repayment.--\n            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), a State that \n        uses funds made available under section 5(b) to make a loan or \n        support a State-administered program under subsection (a)(1) \n        shall repay to the stabilization fund the amount of the loan or \n        support, plus interest, at an annual rate of 4.5 percent.
