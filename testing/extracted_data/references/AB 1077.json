    "title": "An act to amend Section 14305 of the Corporations Code, relating to mutual water companies.",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Mutual water companies are nonprofit entities that seek to provide quality water service to their residential, commercial, municipal, and agricultural shareholders or members, many through small water systems and in disadvantaged communities throughout the state.\n(b) Since 2013, mutual water companies have made great improvements to water quality and service reliability across California, as well as to the transparency of their operations and finances.\n(c) Mutual water companies have been leaders in promoting water conservation and efficiency since the drought emergency in California began.\n(d) Mutual water companies serve as the sole water provider in their service territories and act in many ways like public agencies, and they therefore should take reasonable steps to ensure their shareholders and customers have a voice in the operations of the company.\n(e) Many mutual water companies have small or no meeting facilities, some of which meet in board members\u2019 residences, that can safely hold only a limited number of people, and are located in remote parts of California that are difficult to access by some shareholders and customers of the mutual water company.\n(f) Many small mutual water companies have limited financial means and it is important that their financial resources be put to efficient use in fulfilling their duty to provide safe and affordable water to their shareholders and members.\n(g) Mutual water companies are unique, and unlike large public agencies or for-profit utilities, these nonprofit organizations are solely responsible to their shareholders and customers and not the broader public outside of their service area.\n(h) Given the distinctive operational constraints faced by mutual water companies, the Legislature believes that mutual water companies should, where economically and technologically feasible, have means to provide the greatest shareholder and customer access to meetings within these constraints.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 14305 of the Corporations Code is amended to read:\n14305.\n(a) (1) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Mutual Water Company Open Meeting Act.\n(2) This section shall only apply to a mutual water company that operates a public water system.\n(b) (1) (A) A board of directors of a mutual water company shall allow an eligible person to personally attend a meeting of the board, if the eligible person gave the board at least 24 hours advance written notice of his or her intent to personally attend the meeting.\n(B) Notwithstanding any other law, the board of directors may use teleconferencing to provide any eligible person access to the meeting that otherwise would be denied attendance at a meeting of the board for failure to provide this notice, or because the number of eligible persons having already provided notice of attendance exceeds the room capacity of the place of the meeting described in the notice issued pursuant to subdivision (f). The teleconferenced meeting or proceeding shall comply with this section and all other applicable provisions of law relating to a specific type of meeting or proceeding conducted by a mutual water company. If the board uses teleconferencing, the board shall provide to an eligible person attending a meeting by teleconference, before the meeting begins, an electronic copy or photocopy of all documents not related to an executive session to be discussed at the meeting. A board of directors of a mutual water company shall not prohibit an eligible person from attending a meeting of the board either in person, so long as the eligible person has complied with the notice requirement of paragraph (A), or by teleconference except as provided by paragraph (2). A board of directors may allow an eligible person to attend the meeting personally in lieu of using teleconferencing pursuant to this paragraph.\n(C) For purposes of this subdivision, the term \u201cteleconference\u201d means, to the extent it is technologically feasible, any electronic means, that includes either audio or video or both, that allows an eligible person to hear a meeting and verbally interact with the board, including, but not limited to, a telephone, cellular telephone with speaker phone technology, or computer, or a device using internet-based video or audio conference technology.\n(2) A board of directors of a mutual water company shall only meet in executive session during a meeting. A board may prohibit an eligible person from attending an executive session to consider pending or potential litigation, matters relating to the formation of contracts with third parties, including matters relating to the potential acquisition of real property or water rights, member or shareholder discipline, personnel matters, or to meet with a member or shareholder, upon the member or shareholder\u2019s request, regarding the member or shareholder\u2019s payment of assessments, as specified in Section 14303.\n(3) The board of directors of a mutual water company shall meet in executive session, if requested by a member or shareholder who may be subject to a fine, penalty, or other form of discipline, and the member shall be entitled to attend the executive session.\n(4) An eligible person shall be entitled to attend a teleconference meeting, as specified in paragraph (3) of subdivision (o), or the portion of the teleconference meeting that is open to eligible persons, and shall be entitled to attend with or without fulfilling the notice requirement in paragraph (1). The teleconference meeting or portion of the meeting that is open to eligible persons shall be audible to the eligible person in a location specified in the notice of the meeting.\n(c) Any matter discussed in executive session shall be generally noted in the minutes of the meeting at which the executive session occurred.\n(d) The minutes, minutes proposed for adoption that are marked to indicate draft status, or a summary of the minutes, of any meeting of the board of directors of a mutual water company, conducted on or after January 1, 2014, other than an executive session, shall be available to eligible persons within 30 days of the meeting. The minutes, proposed minutes, or summary minutes shall be provided to any eligible person upon request and upon reimbursement of the mutual water company\u2019s costs for providing the minutes.\n(e) The pro forma budget required in Section 14306 shall be available to eligible persons within 30 days of the meeting at which the budget was adopted.

Notice may also be given by mail, by delivery of the notice to each unit served by the mutual water company, or, with the consent of the eligible person, by electronic means. The notice shall contain the agenda for the meeting.\n(g) An emergency meeting of the board may be called by the chief executive officer of the mutual water company, or by any two members of the board of directors other than the chief executive officer, if there are circumstances that could not have been reasonably foreseen which require immediate attention and possible action by the board, and which of necessity make it impracticable to provide notice as required by this section.\n(h) The board of directors of a mutual water company shall permit any eligible person to speak at any meeting of the mutual water company or the board of directors, except for any portion of a meeting that is held in executive session outside the presence of eligible persons.

An emergency situation exists if there are circumstances that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the board, that require immediate attention and possible action by the board, and that, of necessity, make it impracticable to provide notice.\n(ii) Upon a determination made by the board by a vote of two-thirds of the members present at the meeting, or, if less than two-thirds of total membership of the board is present at the meeting, by a unanimous vote of the members present, that there is a need to take immediate action and that the need for action came to the attention of the board after the agenda was posted and distributed pursuant to subdivision (f).\n(iii) The item appeared on an agenda that was posted and distributed pursuant to subdivision (f) for a prior meeting of the board of directors that occurred not more than 30 calendar days before the date that action is taken on the item and, at the prior meeting, action on the item was continued to the meeting at which the action is taken.\n(B) Before discussing any item pursuant to this paragraph, the board of directors shall openly identify the item to the members in attendance at the meeting.\n(j) (1) Notwithstanding any other law, the board of directors shall not take action on any item of business outside of a meeting.\n(2) (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board of directors shall not conduct a meeting via a series of electronic transmissions, including, but not limited to, electronic mail, except as specified in subparagraph (B).\n(B) Electronic transmissions may be used as a method of conducting an emergency meeting if all members of the board, individually or collectively, consent in writing to that action, and if the written consent or consents are filed with the minutes of the meeting of the board. These written consents may be transmitted electronically.\n(k) (1) An eligible person may bring a civil action for declaratory or equitable relief for a violation of this section by a mutual water company for which he or she is defined as an eligible person for a judicial determination that an action taken by the board is null and void under this section.\n(2) Prior to the commencement of an action pursuant to paragraph (1), the eligible person shall make a demand on the board to cure or correct the action alleged to be taken in violation of this section.
