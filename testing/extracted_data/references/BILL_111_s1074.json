FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) among the central causes of the financial and economic \n        crises that the United States faces today has been a widespread \n        failure of corporate governance;\n            (2) within too many of the Nation's most important \n        businesses and financial institutions, both executive \n        management and boards of directors have failed in their most \n        basic duties, including to enact compensation policies that are \n        linked to the long-term profitability of their institutions, to \n        appropriately analyze and oversee enterprise risk, and most \n        importantly, to prioritize the long-term health of their firms \n        and their shareholders;\n            (3) such failure has led to the loss of trillions of \n        dollars in shareholder value, losses that have been borne by \n        millions of Americans who are shareholders through their \n        pension plans, 401(k) plans, and direct investments;\n            (4) a key contributing factor to such failure was the lack \n        of accountability of boards to their ultimate owners, the \n        shareholders;\n            (5) policies that serve to limit the ability of \n        shareholders to nominate and elect board members have served to \n        minimize the accountability of boards and management to \n        shareholders;\n            (6) it has always been the intent of Congress that the \n        Securities and Exchange Commission should have full authority \n        to determine the use of the issuer proxy with regards to the \n        nomination and election of directors by shareholders; and\n            (7) providing a greater voice to shareholders while not \n        impinging on management prerogatives is in the best interests \n        of shareholders, public corporations, and the economy as a \n        whole.\n\nSEC. 3.
