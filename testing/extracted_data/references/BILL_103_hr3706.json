FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Proposals to export solid waste from the United States \n        to foreign countries are increasing. In numerous instances \n        exported waste has contaminated the environment, adversely \n        affected public health, and contributed to foreign policy \n        liabilities for the United States.\n            (2) Exports of solid waste are being undertaken to avoid \n        the community opposition and higher treatment and disposal \n        expenses that are associated with waste disposal, treatment, \n        and recycling in the United States.\n            (3) Increasingly, hazardous waste exports are justified by \n        the agreeable term ``recycling'', even though the result of the \n        export is a transfer of pollution to areas of the world with \n        little capability to manage that pollution.\n            (4) Continued exports of solid waste serve as a \n        disincentive to implementation of existing domestic policy, \n        which recognizes reuse and waste reduction as the best methods \n        of solid waste management.\n            (5) Imports of waste from foreign countries strain \n        diminishing domestic waste disposal capacity, threaten public \n        health, and contaminate the environment.\n            (6) The international Basel Convention on the Control of \n        Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal \n        recognizes the right and indeed encourages waste export and \n        import prohibitions. In the first meeting of the Parties, a \n        decision was made requesting industrialized countries to \n        prohibit transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and other \n        wastes for disposal to developing countries and further \n        requesting developing countries to prohibit the import of \n        hazardous wastes from industrialized countries.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to prohibit the export of \nsolid waste from the United States and the import of solid waste from \nforeign countries.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF EXPORT AND IMPORT OF SOLID WASTE.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--Subtitle A of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 \nU.S.C. 6901 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 1009.
