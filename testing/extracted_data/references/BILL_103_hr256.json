For \n                purposes of this subparagraph, the appropriate State \n                regulatory authority is solely the State bank \n                supervisor for the State in which the branch is \n                proposed to be established.\n                    ``(H) A State-chartered bank resulting from a \n                combination authorized by subparagraph (A) shall be \n                entitled to exercise at each of its branches, all \n                powers and privileges conferred by the law of its \n                chartering State and Federal law.
