FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) during the past three decades the United States has \n        made heavy economic, scientific, and technical commitments for \n        defense;\n            (2) these commitments led to the development of specialized \n        skills and business practices not directly applicable in the \n        civilian sector of the economy;\n            (3) as these commitments are modified to take account of \n        changing requirements for national security and domestic needs, \n        careful preparation is necessary if serious economic \n        dislocations are to be avoided; and\n            (4) the economic ability of the Nation and of management, \n        labor, and capital to adjust to changing national security \n        needs is consistent with the general welfare of the United \n        States.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide the means \nthrough which the United States can promote orderly economic adjustment \nwhich will--\n            (1) minimize the dislocation of workers, communities, and \n        industries;\n            (2) assure that such dislocations do not compound \n        recessionary trends; and\n            (3) encourage conversion of technologies and managerial and \n        worker skills developed in defense production to projects which \n        serve the civilian sector.\n\nSEC. 3.
