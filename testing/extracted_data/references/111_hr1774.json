INCORPORATION OF SMART GRID CAPABILITY IN ENERGY STAR PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Assessment.--Within one year after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary and the Administrator shall each assess the \npotential for cost-effective integration of Smart Grid technologies and \ncapabilities in all products that are reviewed by the Department of \nEnergy and the Environmental Protection Agency, respectively, for \npotential designation as Energy Star products.\n    (b) Analysis.--(1) Within 2 years after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary and the Administrator shall each prepare an \nanalysis of the potential energy savings and electricity cost savings \nthat could accrue for each of the products referred to in subsection \n(a) in the following optimal circumstances:\n                    (A) The products possessed full Smart Grid \n                capability.\n                    (B) The products were utilized in an electricity \n                utility service area which had Smart Grid capability \n                and time-of-use electric rates.\n                    (C) The time-of-use rates reflected national \n                average utility rates including average peak and valley \n                daily electricity costs to the utility.\n                    (D) Consumers using such products took full \n                advantage of such capability.\n    (2) The analysis under paragraph (1) shall be considered the ``best \ncase'' Smart Grid analysis. On the basis of such an analysis for each \nproduct, the Secretary and the Administrator shall determine whether \nthe installation of Smart Grid capability for such a product would be \ncost effective. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``cost \neffective'' means that the cumulative savings from using the product \nunder the ``best case'' Smart Grid circumstances for a period of 5 \nyears will be greater than the incremental cost of the Smart Grid \nfeatures included in the product.\n    (3) To the extent that including Smart Grid capability in any \nproducts analyzed under paragraph (2) yielded a finding that doing so \nwas cost effective in the best case, the Secretary and the \nAdministrator shall, not later than 3 years after the date of enactment \nof this Act take each of the following actions:\n            (A) Inform the manufacturer of such product of such \n        finding.\n            (B) Make special note in a prominent manner on any Energy \n        Star label for any product actually including Smart Grid \n        capability that--\n                    (i) Smart Grid capability is a feature of that \n                product;\n                    (ii) the use and value of those features depended \n                on the Smart Grid capability of the utility system in \n                which the product was installed and the use of those \n                features by the customer; and\n                    (iii) on a utility system with Smart Grid \n                capability, the use of the product's Smart Grid \n                capability could potentially reduce the cost of the \n                product's annual operation by an estimated dollar \n                amount representing the result of incremental energy \n                and electricity cost savings that would result from the \n                Smart Grid best case for that product.\n            (C) Submit a report to Congress summarizing the results of \n        the analyses for each class of products, and presenting the \n        potential national energy and electricity cost savings that \n        could be realized if cost-effective Smart Grid capability were \n        installed in the relevant products reviewed by the Energy Star \n        program.\n\nSEC. 4.
