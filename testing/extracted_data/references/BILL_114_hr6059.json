ONLINE PUBLICATION OF CARBON EMISSIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior shall make available \nto the public through the Internet--\n            (1) information that describes for all covered operations--\n                    (A) the aggregate amount of each fossil fuel, by \n                type and by State, produced under Federal leases; and\n                    (B) for gas reported, the portion and source of \n                such amount that was released by each of venting, \n                flaring, and fugitive release;\n            (2) information that accurately describes the estimated \n        amounts of existing fossil fuel resources on Federal lands \n        under lease for the production of fossil fuels, and of Federal \n        lands that have potential for such leasing; and\n            (3) information that describes the amount and sources of \n        energy, in megawatts, produced from operating solar, wind, and \n        geothermal projects on Federal lands under lease for the \n        production of renewable energy.\n    (b) Format.--Information made available under this section shall be \npresented in a format that--\n            (1) translates such amounts and portions into emissions of \n        metric tons of greenhouse gases expressed in carbon dioxide \n        equivalent using both the 20-year and 100-year Global Warming \n        Potential-weighted emission values;\n            (2) for energy produced from solar, wind, and geothermal \n        projects, includes an estimate of the greenhouse gas emissions \n        that would result from production of the same amount of energy \n        from fossil fuel resources; and\n            (3) allows--\n                    (A) downloading in a machine readable format; and\n                    (B) accessing the information without payment of \n                any fee or other charge.\n    (c) Data Publication Frequency.--The data made available under this \nsection shall be updated at least annually.\n\nSEC. 3. ACCURATE MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF METHANE EMISSIONS FROM \n              FEDERAL LANDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, if the Secretary of the Interior determines that \nrevisions or promulgation of rules are needed to implement section 2 \nwith regard to methane emissions, the Secretary shall initiate a \nprocess under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 \n(30 U.S.C. 1711 et seq.), the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et \nseq.), or other applicable law to promulgate regulations to require \naccurate measuring and reporting to the Secretary, by each holder of a \nlease for the production of fossil fuels on Federal land, of the actual \namount of methane gas produced under such lease, including all such gas \nnot sold by or on behalf of the lessee.\n    (b) Reporting of Gases.--The rules shall include requirements for \nreporting by holders of leases, to the maximum extent possible, the \namount and source of all vented, flared, and fugitive releases of gas \nresulting from the production of fossil fuels from Federal lands.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    Every 2 years, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress that \nincludes--\n            (1) efforts underway by the Department of the Interior to \n        decrease greenhouse gas emissions from covered operations on \n        Federal lands and waters; and\n            (2) plans for future reductions in greenhouse gas emissions \n        from covered operations on Federal lands and waters.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Covered operations.--The term ``covered operations'' \n        means all fossil fuel operations that are subject to the \n        mineral leasing laws or title V of the Federal Land Policy and \n        Management Act of 1976 (30 U.S.C. 1761 et seq.), regardless of \n        size, including production, storage, gathering, processing, \n        transportation, and handling operations.\n            (2) Flaring.--The term ``flaring'' means the intentional \n        and controlled burning of gas that occurs in the course of oil \n        and gas or coal operations.\n            (3) Fossil fuel.--The term ``fossil fuel'' means all \n        natural fuels, including oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, \n        and coal.\n            (4) Fugitive release.--The term ``fugitive release'' means \n        the unintentional and uncontrolled release of gas into the \n        atmosphere in the course of oil and gas or coal operations.\n            (5) Global warming potential-weighted emission.--The term \n        ``Global Warming Potential-weighted emission'' means the ratio \n        of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous \n        release of 1 kilogram of a trace substance relative to that of \n        1 kilogram of carbon dioxide, measured in metric tons of carbon \n        dioxide equivalent for each greenhouse gas according to the \n        most recent, and any subsequent, decisions by the \n        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change regarding global \n        warming potentials.\n            (6) Resources.--The term ``resources'' means oil, gas, and \n        coal resources, both identified and inferred, that are both \n        technically recoverable and economically recoverable using the \n        range of past, and predicted future, commodity prices.\n            (7) Venting.--The term ``venting'' means the intentional \n        and controlled release of gas into the atmosphere in the course \n        of oil and gas operations.\n            (8) Produced and production.--The terms ``produced'' and \n        ``production'' mean extracted, mined, withdrawn, sold, stored, \n        released (including release by venting, flaring, or fugitive \n        release), flared, used for beneficial purposes, or otherwise \n        emitted during production."
