FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) March 7, 2015, will mark 50 years since the brave Foot \n        Soldiers of the Voting Rights Movement first attempted to march \n        from Selma to Montgomery on ``Bloody Sunday'' in protest \n        against the denial of their right to vote, and were brutally \n        assaulted by Alabama state troopers.\n            (2) Beginning in 1964, members of the Student Nonviolent \n        Coordinating Committee attempted to register African-Americans \n        to vote throughout the state of Alabama.\n            (3) These efforts were designed to ensure that every \n        American citizen would be able to exercise their constitutional \n        right to vote and have their voices heard.\n            (4) By December of 1964, many of these efforts remained \n        unsuccessful. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., working with leaders \n        from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the \n        Southern Christian Leadership Conference, began to organize \n        protests throughout Alabama.\n            (5) On March 7, 1965, over 500 voting rights marchers known \n        as ``Foot Soldiers'' gathered on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in \n        Selma, Alabama in peaceful protest of the denial of their most \n        sacred and constitutionally protected right--the right to vote.\n            (6) Led by John Lewis of the Student Nonviolent \n        Coordinating Committee and Rev. Hosea Williams of the Southern \n        Christian Leadership Conference, these Foot Soldiers began the \n        march towards the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, Alabama.\n            (7) As the Foot Soldiers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, \n        they were confronted by a wall of Alabama state troopers who \n        brutally attacked and beat them.\n            (8) Americans across the country witnessed this tragic turn \n        of events as news stations broadcasted the brutality on a day \n        that would be later known as ``Bloody Sunday.''\n            (9) Two days later on Tuesday, March 9, 1965, nearly 2,500 \n        Foot Soldiers led by Dr. Martin Luther King risked their lives \n        once more and attempted a second peaceful march starting at the \n        Edmund Pettus Bridge. This second attempted march was later \n        known as ``Turnaround Tuesday.''\n            (10) Fearing for the safety of these Foot Soldiers who \n        received no protection from federal or state authorities during \n        this second march, Dr. King led the marchers to the base of the \n        Edmund Pettus Bridge and stopped. Dr. King kneeled and offered \n        a prayer of solidarity and walked back to the church.\n            (11) President Lyndon B. Johnson, inspired by the bravery \n        and determination of these Foot Soldiers and the atrocities \n        they endured, announced his plan for a voting rights bill aimed \n        at securing the precious right to vote for all citizens during \n        an address to Congress on March 15, 1965.\n            (12) On March 17, 1965, one week after ``Turnaround \n        Tuesday'', U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson ruled the Foot \n        Soldiers had a First Amendment right to petition the government \n        through peaceful protest, and ordered federal agents to provide \n        full protection to the Foot Soldiers during the Selma to \n        Montgomery Voting Rights March.\n            (13) Judge Johnson's decision overturned Alabama Governor \n        George Wallace's prohibition on the protest due to public \n        safety concerns.\n            (14) On March 21, 1965, under the court order, the U.S. \n        Army, the federalized Alabama National Guard, and countless \n        federal agents and marshals escorted nearly 8,000 Foot Soldiers \n        from the start of their heroic journey in Selma, Alabama to \n        their safe arrival on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol \n        Building on March 25, 1965.\n            (15) The extraordinary bravery and sacrifice these Foot \n        Soldiers displayed in pursuit of a peaceful march from Selma to \n        Montgomery brought national attention to the struggle for equal \n        voting rights, and served as the catalyst for Congress to pass \n        the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which President Johnson signed \n        into law on August 6, 1965.\n            (16) To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Voting \n        Rights Movement and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of \n        1965, it is befitting that Congress bestow the highest civilian \n        honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, in 2015, to the Foot \n        Soldiers who participated in Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday \n        or the final Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March during \n        March of 1965, which served as a catalyst for the Voting Rights \n        Act of 1965.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate shall make \nappropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of Congress, \nof a gold medal of appropriate design to the Foot Soldiers who \nparticipated in Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, or the final Selma \nto Montgomery Voting Rights March during March of 1965, which served as \na catalyst for the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation referred \nto in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in \nthis Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with suitable \nemblems, devices, and inscriptions to be determined by the Secretary.\n    (c) Award of Medal.--Following the award of the gold medal \ndescribed in subsection (a), the medal shall be given to the Selma \nInterpretative Center in Selma, Alabama, where it shall be available \nfor display or temporary loan to be displayed elsewhere, as \nappropriate.\n\nSEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n    The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold \nmedal struck pursuant to section 2 under such regulations as the \nSecretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient to cover the cost \nthereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \noverhead expenses, and the cost of the gold medal.\n\nSEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n    (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this Act are \nnational medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States \nCode.\n    (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and 5136 of \ntitle 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be \nconsidered to be numismatic items.\n\n            Passed the Senate February 26, 2015.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                             Secretary.\n114th CONGRESS\n\n  1st Session\n\n                                 S. 527\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n                                 AN ACT\n\n     To award a Congressional Gold Medal to the Foot Soldiers who \n participated in Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, or the final Selma \n to Montgomery Voting Rights March in March of 1965, which served as a \n              catalyst for the Voting Rights Act of 1965."
