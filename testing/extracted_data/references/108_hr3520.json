    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Strategy for Assuring Financial \nEmpowerment Act'' or the ``SAFE Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. STRATEGY FOR ASSURING FINANCIAL EDUCATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--\n            (1) In general.--The Congress finds it is imperative to--\n                    (A) reduce overlap and duplication in Federal \n                financial literacy and financial education programs and \n                in public and private educational activities, in order \n                to increase effectiveness and coordination and to \n                better utilize resources;\n                    (B) identify the most effective types of public \n                sector financial literacy programs and techniques as \n                measured by improved consumer decision-making;\n                    (C) coordinate and promote financial literacy and \n                financial education efforts at the State and local \n                level, including partnerships between Federal, State \n                and local governments, non-profit organizations and \n                private enterprises;\n                    (D) obtain recommendations for integrating economic \n                education and personal-finance education into primary, \n                secondary and post-secondary curricula; and\n                    (E) provide multilingual materials and programs \n                under the strategy for assuring financial education \n                whenever appropriate in order to effectively reach the \n                broadest number of people.\n            (2) Additional findings.--The Congress also finds that as \n        many as 1 in 10 American families, or about 10,000,000 \n        households, do not have a relationship with a traditional \n        financial institution such as a bank, thrift institution, or \n        credit union, despite the significant advantages of such a \n        relationship, including the following:\n                    (A) The establishment of a deposit account with a \n                financial institution leads to greater knowledge of \n                personal financial fundamentals.\n                    (B) Account ownership provides an opportunity to \n                build assets, because a deposit account is a tool that \n                can be used to save for homeownership, educational \n                opportunities, or retirement.\n                    (C) The unbanked typically pay higher costs in \n                transaction fees for financial services than do \n                individuals with banking relationships.\n                    (D) Opening and maintaining an account with a \n                financial institution provides opportunities to obtain \n                other products and services--such as home loans, car \n                loans, education loans, or small business loans--from \n                the institution, and can help individuals establish a \n                credit history for their future borrowing needs.\n                    (E) Owning an account provides a record of \n                financial transactions that can be drawn on in the case \n                of a dispute.\n                    (F) Account ownership provides the opportunity for \n                safer, more secure types of financial transactions, \n                such as direct deposit and check-writing, reducing the \n                risk that paychecks could be stolen or lost and \n                reducing the risk of becoming the victim of a robbery \n                or burglary triggered by carrying large sums of cash.\n    (b) Development and Transmittal to the Congress.--\n            (1) Development.--The President, acting through the \n        Secretary of the Treasury, the Office of Financial Education \n        established by the Secretary in the Department of the Treasury, \n        and in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n        Development and other officials of the administration, as \n        appropriate, shall develop a national strategy for financial \n        education, to be known as the Strategy for Assuring Financial \n        Empowerment (hereinafter in this section referred to as the \n        ``SAFE strategy'').\n            (2) Transmittal to the congress.--By February 1 of 2005 and \n        by that date of each succeeding year, the President shall \n        transmit to the Congress a national strategy developed in \n        accordance with paragraph (1).\n            (3) Appearance before the congress.--Before March 1, 2004, \n        and before March 1 of each subsequent year, the Secretary of \n        Treasury shall appear before the Committee on Financial \n        Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n        Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate at hearings \n        regarding the development of a national strategy for assuring \n        financial education.\n            (4) Working group.--The first national strategy transmitted \n        to the Congress in 2005 shall contain recommendations and a \n        proposal for forming a Financial Literacy and Education Working \n        Group to be chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n    (c) Issues To Be Addressed.--The SAFE strategy shall address any \narea the President considers appropriate, acting through the Secretary \nof the Treasury, the
