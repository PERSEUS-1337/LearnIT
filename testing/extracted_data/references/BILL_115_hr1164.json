FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Palestinian Authority's practice of paying salaries \n        to terrorists serving in Israeli prisons, as well as to the \n        families of deceased terrorists, is an incentive to commit acts \n        of terror.\n            (2) The United States does not provide direct budgetary \n        support to the Palestinian Authority. The United States does \n        pay certain debts held by the Palestinian Authority and funds \n        programs for which the Palestinian Authority would otherwise be \n        responsible.\n            (3) The United States Government supports community-based \n        programs in the West Bank and Gaza that provide for basic human \n        needs, such as food, water, health, shelter, protection, \n        education, and livelihoods, and that promote peace and \n        development.\n            (4) Since fiscal year 2015, annual appropriations \n        legislation has mandated the reduction of Economic Support Fund \n        aid for the Palestinian Authority as a result of their payments \n        for acts of terrorism including, in fiscal year 2017, a \n        reduction ``by an amount the Secretary determines is equivalent \n        to the amount expended by the Palestinian Authority, the \n        Palestine Liberation Organization, and any successor or \n        affiliated organizations with such entities as payments for \n        acts of terrorism by individuals who are imprisoned after being \n        fairly tried and convicted for acts of terrorism and by \n        individuals who died committing acts of terrorism during the \n        previous calendar year''.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    Congress--\n            (1) calls on the Palestinian Authority, the Palestine \n        Liberation Organization, and any successor or affiliated \n        organizations to stop payments for acts of terrorism by \n        individuals who are imprisoned after being fairly tried and \n        convicted for acts of terrorism and by individuals who died \n        committing acts of terrorism and to repeal the laws authorizing \n        such payments;\n            (2) calls on all donor countries providing budgetary \n        assistance to the Palestinian Authority to cease direct \n        budgetary support until the Palestinian Authority stops all \n        payments incentivizing terror;\n            (3) urges the Palestinian Authority to develop programs to \n        provide essential public services and support to any individual \n        in need within its jurisdictional control, rather than to \n        provide payments contingent on perpetrating acts of violence;\n            (4) urges the United States Permanent Representative to the \n        United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the \n        United States at the United Nations to highlight the issue of \n        Palestinian Authority payments for acts of terrorism and to \n        urge other Member States to apply pressure upon the Palestinian \n        Authority to immediately cease such payments; and\n            (5) urges the Department of State to use its bilateral and \n        multilateral engagements with all governments and organizations \n        committed to the cause of peace between Israel and the \n        Palestinians to highlight the issue of Palestinian Authority \n        payments for acts of terrorism and to urge such governments and \n        organizations to join the United States in calling on the \n        Palestinian Authority to immediately cease such payments.\n\nSEC. 4.
