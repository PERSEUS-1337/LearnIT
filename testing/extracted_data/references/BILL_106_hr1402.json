Reg. 16025), do not adequately \nreflect public comment on the original proposed rule published in the \nFederal Register on January 30, 1998 (63 Fed. Reg. 4802), and are \nsufficiently different from the proposed rule and any comments \nsubmitted with regard to the proposed rule that further emergency \nrulemaking is merited.\n    (b) Formal Rulemaking.--\n            (1) Required.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct \n        rulemaking, on the record after an opportunity for an agency \n        hearing, to reconsider the Class III and Class IV pricing \n        formulas included in the final decision referred to in \n        subsection (a).\n            (2) Implementation.--A final decision on the formula shall \n        be implemented not later than 10 months after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act.\n            (3) Effect of court order.--The actions authorized by this \n        subsection are intended to ensure the timely publication and \n        implementation of new pricing formulas for Class III and Class \n        IV milk.

The Secretary may not reduce the level of services \nprovided under that section on account of the prohibition against \nassessments, but shall rather cover the cost of marketing order \nadministration and services through funds available for the \nAgricultural Marketing Service of the Department.\n    (d) Effect on Implementation Schedule.--Subject to subsection (e), \nthe requirement for additional rulemaking in subsection (b) does not \nmodify or delay the time period for actual implementation of the final \ndecision referred to in subsection (a) as part of Federal milk \nmarketing orders, as such time period is specified in section 738 of \nthe Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (as contained in section \n101(a) of division A of Public Law 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681-30).\n    (e) Modified Manufacturing Allowance for Cheese.--\n            (1) Modification of allowance.--Pending the implementation \n        of new pricing formulas for Class III and Class IV milk as \n        required by subsection (b), the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n        modify the formula used for determining Class III prices, as \n        contained in the final decision referred to in subsection (a), \n        to replace the manufacturing allowance of 17.02 cents per pound \n        of cheese each place it appears in that formula with an amount \n        equal to 14.7 cents per pound of cheese.\n            (2) Expedited implementation.--The Secretary of Agriculture \n        shall implement the modified formula as soon as practicable \n        after the date of the enactment of this Act. Implementation and \n        use of the modified formula shall not be subject to--\n                    (A) the notice and hearing requirements of section \n                8c(3) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. \n                608c(3)), reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural \n                Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, or the notice and \n                comment provisions of section 553 of title 5, United \n                States Code;\n                    (B) a referendum conducted by the Secretary of \n                Agriculture pursuant to subsections (17) or (19) of \n                such section 8c;\n                    (C) the Statement of Policy of the Secretary of \n                Agriculture effective July 24, 1971 (36 Fed. Reg. \n                13804), relating to notices of proposed rulemaking and \n                public participation in rulemaking; and\n                    (D) chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code \n                (commonly known as the ``Paperwork Reduction Act'').\n            (3) Effect on minimum milk prices.--If the Secretary of \n        Agriculture announces minimum prices for milk under Federal \n        milk marketing orders pursuant to section 1000.50 of title 7, \n        Code of Federal Regulations, before the date on which the \n        Secretary first implements the modified formula, the minimum \n        prices so announced before that date shall be the only \n        applicable minimum prices under Federal milk marketing orders \n        for the months for which the prices have been announced.\n\nSEC. 3.
