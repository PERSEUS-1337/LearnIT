    "title": "SB 1066",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares as follows:\n(a) On December 4, 2015, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act (Public Law 114-94).\n(b) The FAST Act provides long-term funding certainty for surface transportation and requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to award certain grants pursuant to rulemaking.\n(c) The FAST Act includes grant programs for states that meet requirements associated with impaired driving interventions, including 24/7 Sobriety programs. These programs typically approach impaired driving deterrence by focusing on the most high-risk offenders, requiring abstinence from alcohol or illegal drugs, testing compliance multiple times per day, and swiftly delivering defined consequences for noncompliance.\n(d) The FAST Act permits the NHTSA to award 24/7 Sobriety program grants to states that meet two separate requirements:\n(1) That a state enact and enforce a law that requires all individuals convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or of driving while intoxicated to receive at least a 30-day restriction on driving privileges. California currently meets this requirement.\n(2) That a state provide a 24/7 Sobriety program with statewide applicability. A \u201c24/7 Sobriety program\u201d is a state law or program that authorizes a state court or an agency with jurisdiction to require an individual who has committed a driving-under-the-influence offense to abstain from alcohol or controlled substances for a period of time and be subject to testing for alcohol or controlled substances at least twice per day at a testing location, or by a continuous transdermal monitoring device, or by an alternative method approved by the NHTSA. California does not yet meet this requirement.\n(e) Additional federal grant moneys are available to states under the NHTSA\u2019s highway safety programs and national priority safety programs pursuant to Sections 402 and 405 of Title 23 of the United States Code.\n(f) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to authorize a statewide 24/7 Sobriety program so that California is eligible for the new 24/7 FAST Act grant funding and additional funding available through the NHTSA.\nSECTION 1.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 164.2 is added to the Streets and Highways Code, to read:\n164.2.\nFederal funds derived from apportionments made to the state under the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (\u201cFAST Act,\u201d Public Law\n114-094)\n114-94)\nshall be identified and included in the fund estimates prepared pursuant to Sections 14524 and 14525 of the Government Code for purposes of the interregional transportation improvement program prepared by the department pursuant to Section 14526 of the Government Code, the regional transportation improvement programs prepared by the regional transportation agencies pursuant to Section 14527 of the Government Code, and the state transportation improvement program adopted by the commission pursuant to Section 14529 of the Government Code.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 23582.5 is added to the Vehicle Code, to read:\n23582.5.\n(a) The court may order a person convicted of a violation of Section 23152 or 23153 to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified 24/7 Sobriety program, as described in subdivision (d), as a condition of probation, parole, sentence, or work permit if the program is available and deemed appropriate, and the person committed the current violation within 10 years of one or more separate violations of Section 23152 or 23153 that resulted in a conviction.\n(b) The court may require a person who has been arrested for a violation of Section 23152 or 23153 to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified 24/7 Sobriety program, as described in subdivision (d), as a condition of release on bond, if the program is available and deemed appropriate, and the person committed the current violation within 10 years of one or more separate violations of Section 23152 or 23153 that resulted in a conviction.\n(c) A person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked pursuant to Section 13352 or 13353 and who subsequently applies to the department for a restricted driving privilege shall be permitted to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of obtaining the restricted driving privilege if the program is available and deemed appropriate, and the person was charged with the current violation within 10 years of one or more separate violations of Section 23152 or 23153 that resulted in a conviction. The restricted driving privilege granted under this subdivision shall be for a minimum of one year and may be conditioned on participation in the 24/7 Sobriety program as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, participation in an ignition interlock device program.\n(d) For purposes of this section, a \u201c24/7 Sobriety program\u201d requires a participant to abstain from alcohol or controlled substance use for a designated period of time and be subject to at least twice-per-day breath testing for alcohol or periodic testing for controlled substances at a testing location. In the event of a hardship, testing for alcohol may be accomplished by a continuous transdermal monitoring device or by an alternative method approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Methodologies that provide immediate, in-person positive reinforcement for compliant behavior and the most immediate sanctions for noncompliant events are preferred testing methodologies under this program. However, a participant\u2019s ability to maintain employment, schooling, or family life, usually due to lack of proximity to a testing location, may be considered a hardship for the purposes of this subdivision. The 24/7 Sobriety program methodology shall be evidence-based. \u201cEvidence-based\u201d means the program methodology meets at least two of the following criteria:\n(1) Evaluation research shows that the program produces the expected positive results.\n(2) The results can be attributed to the program itself, rather than to other extraneous factors or events.\n(3) The evaluation is peer reviewed by experts in the field.\n(4) The program is endorsed by a federal agency or respected research organization and included in its list of effective programs.\n(e) A person ordered into a 24/7 Sobriety program may also be required to participate in any other driving-under-the-influence program required under California law, including, but not limited to, programs provided in Section 11836 of the Health and Safety Code.\n(f) Testing locations and methods that provide the best ability to sanction a violation as close in time as reasonably feasible to the occurrence of the violation should be given preference.\n(g) In order to enable all required defendants to participate, each person shall pay the program costs commensurate with the person\u2019s ability to pay as determined pursuant to Section 11837.4 of the Health and Safety Code.\n(h) The court shall not impose a program of more than 180 days in length unless the defendant tests positive for alcohol or an unauthorized controlled substance or fails to appear for a test.\n(i) The Office of Traffic Safety shall include a description of the provisions authorizing the 24/7 Sobriety program pursuant to this section in its highway safety plan required to be submitted to the NHTSA under subsection (k) of Section 402 of Title 23 of the United States Code, including any application requirements necessary to qualify for grants under Section 405 of Title 23 of the United States Code.\n(j) The department shall establish statewide uniform collection and reporting of all of the following data:\n(1) Participant demographic information.\n(2) Participant case history information.\n(3) Testing information, including testing duration, test results, and testing attendance.\n(4) Fees and fee payments."
