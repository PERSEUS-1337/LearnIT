The advisory committee may include health facilities, practicing physicians and surgeons from affected specialties, registered nurses and other affected health care personnel, labor and specialty organizations representing affected registered nurses, labor and specialty organizations representing other affected health care personnel, and other stakeholders.\n(2) By June 1, 2018, the division shall submit to the board the proposed regulation requiring a health facility to evacuate or remove plume through the use of a plume scavenging system in all settings that employ techniques that involve the creation of plume.\n(3) In developing the regulation, the division shall do all of the following:\n(A) Evaluate using as a benchmark the standards titled \u201cSystems for evacuation of plume generated by medical devices\u201d (ISO 16571) adopted by the International Organization for Standardization and the standards titled \u201cPlume scavenging in surgical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and aesthetic settings\u201d (CSA Z305.13-13) adopted by the CSA Group.\n(B) Take into consideration recommendations on the evacuation of plume from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n(C) Take into consideration the standards titled \u201cSystems for evacuation of plume generated by medical devices\u201d (ISO 16571) adopted by the International Organization for Standardization in developing a standard establishing how much plume shall be captured by a plume scavenging system.\n(D) Include a requirement in the regulation for employers to provide training to all workers foreseeably participating in procedures that involve the creation of plume. The training shall include, but not be limited to, general education on the contents of plume, the circumstances in which it is generated, the associated health and safety hazards, and appropriate use of the plume scavenging equipment and systems utilized by the health facility. The training shall be designed to provide an opportunity for interactive questions and answers with a person knowledgeable about occupational exposure to plume and the specific equipment utilized to scavenge plume.\n(c) The board shall, by July 1, 2019, adopt the proposed regulation of the division, except as specified in subdivision (f), requiring a health facility to evacuate or remove plume through the use of a plume scavenging system in all settings that employ techniques that involve the creation of plume.\n(d) (1) Nothing in this section alters, amends, expands, or reduces existing general room ventilation standards or requirements. These plume scavenging standards are in addition to general room ventilation standards or requirements, and compliance with general room ventilation standards shall not satisfy the requirements of this section.\n(2) Evidence that the plume scavenging system conforms to the minimum requirements of this section when installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, shall be provided by the manufacturer.\n(e) The use of surgical masks shall not satisfy the requirements of this section. The use of respirators shall not satisfy the requirements of this section except when, due to medical necessity, the plume scavenging system is not able to be located where it effectively captures plume.\n(f) This section shall not limit the authority of the division to develop a regulation, or the authority of the board to adopt a regulation, that is broader in scope or broader in application than required by this section.\nSEC. 2.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution."
