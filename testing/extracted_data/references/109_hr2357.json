    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Respirator Access Assurance Act of \n2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Each year millions of workers, responders and citizens \n        in the United States and around the world depend on the \n        availability of respirators made in the United States for \n        protection against exposure to hazardous materials and in the \n        event of terrorist incidents, airborne disease epidemics, and \n        other disasters.\n            (2) Respirators are tested, and the design and labeling of \n        respirators is regulated by an independent federal agency, the \n        National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), \n        which is part of the federal Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention. NIOSH establishes the performance standards for \n        respirators, independently tests and certifies respirators to \n        its standards, and performs follow-up field audits of \n        respirators to ensure continued compliance with NIOSH \n        performance standards. Prior to the establishment of NIOSH, \n        respirators were approved by the United States Bureau of Mines.\n            (3) Respirator manufacturers and sellers do not and cannot \n        control or determine the manner in which their products are \n        used.\n            (4) Manufacturers and sellers of respirators designed and \n        labeled in compliance with NIOSH requirements have been named \n        as defendants in a substantial number of product liability \n        claims alleging that these NIOSH-approved designs and warnings \n        are defective.\n            (5) Respirators are sold in and have an effect on \n        interstate commerce.\n            (6) Manufacturers of respirators may cease making such \n        products, in principal part because of the costs of litigation.\n            (7) A continued United States capacity to manufacture and \n        distribute respirators is necessary to assure that these \n        products remain available. Lack of availability of respirators \n        will increase risks to the health of millions of American \n        workers and emergency responders.\n            (8) The protections set forth in this Act are needed to \n        assure the continued commercial availability of lifesaving \n        respirators.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) ``Manufacturer'' means any person who, in the course of \n        a business conducted for that purpose, designs, makes, \n        produces, packages, or labels any respirator or component part \n        of a respirator, or engages another to do so.\n            (2) ``NIOSH'' means the National Institute for Occupational \n        Safety and Health.\n            (3) ``NIOSH approval'' means a certificate or formal \n        document issued by NIOSH stating that an individual respirator \n        or combination of respirators has met the minimum requirements \n        of part 84 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, or part 11 \n        of title 30, Code of Federal Regulations, and that the \n        manufacturer is authorized to use and attach an approval label \n        to any respirator manufactured in conformance with the plans \n        and specifications upon which the approval was based. For \n        purposes of this Act, NIOSH approval shall also mean \n        certification and/or approval by any Federal Government agency \n        with authority to approve respirators, including the United \n        States Bureau of Mines and the Mine Safety and Health \n        Administration.\n            (4) ``Respirator'' means any device designed to provide the \n        wearer with respiratory protection against inhalation of \n        hazardous materials.\n            (5) ``Seller'' means a person or entity, including a \n        retailer, distributor, or wholesaler, that is regularly engaged \n        in selling respirators.\n\nSEC. 4. EFFECT OF NIOSH APPROVAL OF DESIGN AND LABELING.\n\n    A manufacturer or seller of a respirator shall not be subject to \nany claim for defective design or warning or any claim which is based \non such an allegation if such respirator has received a NIOSH approval, \nand such respirator is manufactured in compliance with the NIOSH-\napproved design and labeling. This provision shall not apply to a \nrespirator that fails to comply with the NIOSH-approved design and \nlabeling standards.\n\nSEC. 5. PREEMPTION AND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    (a) Preemption.--The provisions of this Act shall supersede any and \nall State or local laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to \nany claim for defective design or warning or any claim which is based \non such an allegation if such respirator has received a NIOSH approval.\n    (b) Statutory Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed \nto affect any defense available to a defendant under any other \nprovision of state or federal law, or to create a cause of action or \nfederal court jurisdiction pursuant to section 1331 or 1332 of title \n28, United States Code, that otherwise would not exist under applicable \nlaw.\n\nSEC. 6. APPLICABILITY.\n\n    This Act applies to any civil action in a Federal or State court, \non the basis of any legal theory, for harm allegedly caused, directly \nor indirectly, by a respirator, a respirator manufacturer, or a \nrespirator seller.\n\nSEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act shall become effective upon enactment and shall apply to \nany action that has not proceeded to trial as of the date of enactment, \nregardless of when the respirator was manufactured or sold."
