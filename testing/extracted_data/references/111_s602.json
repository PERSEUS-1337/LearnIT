FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Each year in the United States, over 100 firefighters \n        die in the line of duty, while an additional tens of thousands \n        of firefighters are injured.\n            (2) The Federal Government has a vested interest in \n        protecting firefighter health and safety, as it relies on local \n        fire departments to efficiently and effectively implement the \n        National Response Framework in the response to major disasters.\n            (3) Adequate training, proper personal protective \n        equipment, safe staffing levels, safe operating procedures, and \n        physical and mental fitness of firefighters can reduce \n        avoidable firefighter fatalities.\n            (4) The fire services, in conjunction with Government \n        agencies and interested private-sector parties, has partnered \n        with standards-making bodies to develop national voluntary \n        consensus standards for safe fire department operations and \n        fire fighting capabilities.\n            (5) Such standards are widely respected and promoted by all \n        facets of the fire service to better ensure firefighter health \n        and safety.\n            (6) Through its Firefighter Fatality Investigation and \n        Prevention Program, the National Institute for Occupational \n        Safety and Health has identified the failure to follow specific \n        national voluntary consensus standards as a contributing factor \n        in many firefighter deaths.\n            (7) A comprehensive accounting of fire department \n        compliance with national voluntary consensus standards would \n        help policy makers seeking to enhance public safety and reduce \n        avoidable firefighter fatalities.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the term ``national voluntary consensus standards'' \n        means the most recently issued edition of the national \n        voluntary consensus standards for firefighter and fire \n        department staffing, training, safe operations, personal \n        protective equipment, and fitness available on the date of \n        enactment of this Act;\n            (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Homeland \n        Security; and\n            (3) the term ``Task Force'' means the Task Force to Enhance \n        Firefighter Safety established under section 5(a).\n\nSEC. 4.
