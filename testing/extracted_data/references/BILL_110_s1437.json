Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson to pass \n        civil rights legislation which culminated in the enactment of \n        the Civil Rights Act of 1964;\n            (8) the Civil Rights Act of 1964 greatly expanded civil \n        rights protections, outlawing racial discrimination and \n        segregation in public places and places of public \n        accommodation, in federally funded programs and employment and \n        encouraging desegregation in public schools, and has served as \n        a model for subsequent anti-discrimination laws;\n            (9) we are an eminently better Nation because of Rosa \n        Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and all those men and women \n        who have confronted, and continue to confront, injustice and \n        inequality wherever they see it;\n            (10) equality in education was one of the cornerstones of \n        the civil rights movement;\n            (11) on September 10, 1961, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \n        wrote that African American ``students are coming to understand \n        that education and learning have become tools for shaping the \n        future and not devices of privilege for an exclusive few'';\n            (12) over its long and distinguished history, the United \n        Negro College Fund has provided scholarships and operating \n        funds to its member colleges that have enabled more than \n        300,000 young African Americans to earn college degrees and \n        become successful members of society;\n            (13) those graduates include Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \n        as well as leaders in the fields of education, science, \n        medicine, law, entertainment, literature, the military, and \n        politics who have made major contributions to the civil rights \n        movement and the creation of a more equitable society;\n            (14) Congress has an obligation to lead America's continued \n        struggle to fight discrimination and ensure equal rights for \n        all; and\n            (15) the year 2014 will mark the semicentennial of the \n        passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nSEC. 3.
