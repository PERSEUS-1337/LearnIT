EXPEDITING CRIMINAL ALIEN DEPORTATION AND EXCLUSION.\n\n    (a) Convicted Defined.--Section 241(a)(2) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(2)) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following new subparagraph:\n                    ``(E) Convicted defined.--In this paragraph, the \n                term `convicted' means a judge or jury has found the \n                alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty \n                or nolo contendere, whether or not the alien appeals \n                therefrom.''.\n    (b) Deportation of Convicted Aliens.--\n            (1) Immediate deportation.--Section 242(h) of such Act (8 \n        U.S.C. 1252(h)) is amended--\n                    (A) by striking ``(h) An alien'' and inserting \n                ``(h)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), an alien''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following new \n                paragraph:\n    ``(2) An alien sentenced to imprisonment may be deported prior to \nthe termination of such imprisonment by the release of the alien from \nconfinement, if the Service petitions the appropriate court or other \nentity with authority concerning the alien to release the alien into \nthe custody of the Service for execution of an order of deportation.''.\n            (2) Prohibition of reentry into the united states.--Section \n        212(a)(2) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)) is amended--\n                    (A) by redesignating subparagraph (F) as \n                subparagraph (G); and\n                    (B) by inserting after subparagraph (E) the \n                following new subparagraph:\n                    ``(F) Aliens deported before serving minimum period \n                of confinement.--An alien deported pursuant to section \n                242(h)(2) is excludable during the minimum period of \n                confinement to which the alien was sentenced.''.\n    (c) Execution of Deportation Orders.--Section 242(i) of such Act (8 \nU.S.C. 1252(i)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``An \norder of deportation may not be executed until all direct appeals \nrelating to the conviction which is the basis of the deportation order \nhave been exhausted.''.\n    (d) Notification Requirement.--The Attorney General shall notify \neach alien incarcerated in a State or Federal prison of any available \noption for voluntary deportation and prisoner transfer where the alien \nwould be incarcerated for the remainder of the sentence of confinement \nin the country to which deported.\n\nSEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL STATEMENT CONCERNING INCARCERATION IN COUNTRY TO \n              WHICH CRIMINAL ALIENS ARE DEPORTED.\n\n    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress makes the following \nfindings:\n            (1) Aliens entering the United States without the knowledge \n        or permission of the Federal Government have become a major \n        economic and social problem in many States.\n            (2) The number of undocumented aliens committing felony \n        crimes has reached staggering proportions in California and in \n        other States.\n            (3) In 1988, 5,500 undocumented aliens were incarcerated in \n        California prisons; in 1994 there are 16,000.\n            (4) In 1993 incarcerated undocumented aliens represented \n        approximately 15 percent of the total California State prison \n        population.\n            (5) The cost of incarcerating each State prisoner in \n        California ranges between $15,000 to $30,000 and the cost to \n        the taxpayers of California for the incarceration of \n        undocumented criminal aliens in the State is approximately \n        $402,000,000.\n            (6) The State of California has spent over a billion \n        dollars in the past 5 years to incarcerate undocumented \n        criminal aliens.\n            (7) The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) \n        estimates that the average cost to deport an undocumented \n        criminal alien is $600.\n            (8) The United States has bilateral treaties concerning \n        prisoner transfers with several countries. The treaties have \n        strict criteria requiring that all parties, the United States \n        Department of Justice, the United States Department of State, \n        the foreign government, and the prisoner, consent to the \n        transfer. The prisoner must voluntarily request such a \n        transfer.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the President should direct the Secretary of State to \n        enter into negotiations with other countries in order to \n        conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements to provide for \n        incarceration in the country to which an alien is deported when \n        an alien is deported while subject to a term of imprisonment in \n        the United States;\n            (2) all existing agreements regarding prisoner transfer \n        should be renegotiated to remove the requirement of prisoner \n        approval and all other barriers to prisoner transfer; and\n            (3) any prisoner transfer agreement should include the \n        assurance that prisoners will complete the full term of any \n        sentence upon transfer to another country."
