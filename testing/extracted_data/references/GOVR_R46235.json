    "content": "While periodic, omnibus farm bills focus on agricultural and food policy, they also contain provisions addressing rural community and economic development. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), through its Rural Development agency (RD), administers a broad portfolio of programs focused on rural housing, rural infrastructure, and rural business and employment. Congress considers reauthorizing and amending many of these programs in periodic farm bills. The most recent is the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 farm bill, P.L. 115-334 ). The 2018 farm bill generally authorizes programs and funding levels for the period FY2019-FY2023, though some provisions apply to different periods, such as FY2019-FY2025. Since 1973, farm bills have included a title dedicated to rural development. The Rural Development title (Title VI) of the 2018 farm bill generally addresses (1) rural infrastructure, including housing, electrical generation and transmission, water and wastewater, and more recently, broadband deployment; (2) rural economic development; and (3) rural business creation and expansion. The Miscellaneous title (Title XII) also includes certain rural development provisions related to RD personnel, federal task forces or working groups, and other federal rural development programs. Programs authorized in other titles of P.L. 115-334 may benefit rural areas, especially rural areas with economies reliant on agriculture. However, most rural development provisions in the Rural Development and Miscellaneous titles specifically target rural areas. A number of issues influenced the rural development provisions of the 2018 farm bill. Many rural communities have experienced decreasing populations over the last decade. In addition, some rural residents struggle to access employment opportunities, especially in high-wage jobs. The ongoing opioid crisis and an increasing number of rural hospital closures have raised concerns about the health of rural residents. Aging infrastructure, such as electric or drinking water infrastructure, also presents a challenge to some rural communities. The digital divide \u00e2\u0080\u0094lower rates of broadband access in rural areas compared to urban areas\u00e2\u0080\u0094has raised concerns that rural residents may be less able to access opportunities and services such as distance learning, telemedicine, and e-commerce. In addition, policymakers and scholars have increasingly examined regional approaches to rural economic development rather than approaches focused on individual communities. The 2018 farm bill includes new provisions and programs related to rural broadband deployment, health care, and community development. The law also reauthorizes and amends existing programs related to broadband deployment, other rural infrastructure, and community development. P.L. 115-334 amends multiple definitions of rural used to determine eligibility for RD programs. The law also amends programs that address regional approaches to rural economic development. Further, P.L. 115-334 repeals some rural development programs and makes technical corrections to statutory language authorizing other programs. This report provides a brief overview of federal rural development programs. It then analyzes issues that influenced the development of rural development provisions in the 2018 farm bill. Next, the report details new rural development programs and entities created and changes made to existing rural development programs, in P.L. 115-334 . The Appendix provides a side-by-side comparison of each provision in the Rural Development title, as well as each rural development provision in the Miscellaneous title, of the 2018 farm bill with prior law. The Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-355 ) named USDA as the lead federal agency for rural development. RD is the mission area within USDA responsible for rural infrastructure and economic development assistance. Three agencies comprise RD: the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, the Rural Housing Service, and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS). RD programs are largely loan and grant programs that assist communities with small populations to finance development projects. Many RD programs have statutory authority in the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972 (the ConAct, P.L. 87-128) or the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.). RD programs typically rely on annual appropriations for funding, but omnibus farm bills also authorize mandatory funding for some RD programs. The most recent of these, the 2018 farm bill, reauthorizes or amends existing RD programs and authorizes new RD programs by amending the ConAct, the Rural Electrification Act, or other authorizing legislation. The 2018 farm bill also authorizes some rural development programs or entities administered outside USDA. For example, the law authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a new task force on precision agriculture connectivity. It also reauthorizes federal regional commissions, such as the Appalachian Regional Commission. A number of economic and social issues in rural America influenced the rural development provisions of the 2018 farm bill. Rural policy issues that influenced the 2018 farm bill include: rural population decline; rural underemployment; rural health issues, including the ongoing opioid crisis and an increasing rate of hospital closures in rural areas; aging rural infrastructure and a lack of access to broadband internet in rural areas; and a shift among some scholars and policymakers towards supporting regional approaches to rural economic development. Between 2010 and 2017, the number of people living in nonmetropolitan counties declined by approximately 223,000. Additionally, over 1,300 nonmetropolitan counties experienced population loss ( Figure 2 ). While the overall U.S. rural population declined, rates of population change varied among rural areas. Populations declined in many rural counties dependent on agriculture and manufacturing, while populations increased in many rural counties dependent on recreation. Population decline results from a combination of out-migration, declining birth rates, and increased mortality. Research has attributed rural out-migration to many factors, including lack of employment opportunities and less access to education, health care, and cultural amenities. Congress sought to address rural population decline in the 2018 farm bill through rural infrastructure, business development, and community development. Historically, agriculture and rural policy were closely linked due to the high percentage of rural Americans employed in agriculture. This link has weakened due to the changing nature of rural employment. In 2017, the agriculture sector accounted for 5.6% of rural jobs, down from 6.8% in 2001. In addition, USDA estimates that approximately 80% of total farm household income in 2019 will come from off-farm activities. Manufacturing has also been an important source of employment in rural areas, being responsible for a larger share of jobs in rural counties than in urban counties. In 2017, manufacturing employed 10.8% of the rural workforce, declining from 14.1% in 2001. Congress sought to address rural employment in the 2018 farm bill through entrepreneurship, business development, broadband deployment, and access to credit. Rural health issues also influenced the 2018 farm bill's rural development provisions. Policymakers continue to look for solutions to address the opioid epidemic that began in the 1990s. Though this epidemic has affected urban, suburban, and rural areas, the drug overdose death rate in rural areas increased at a faster rate than in urban areas between 1990 and 2015. In addition, many scholars and interest groups have asserted that the federal government's approach to mitigating the opioid crisis in rural areas should differ from the strategy for urban areas. While federal, state, and local governments have addressed the epidemic, drug overdose rates remain high. In addition, a rise in the number of rural hospital closures has increased concerns about access to health care in rural areas. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), 64 rural hospitals closed between 2013 and 2017, more than twice as many as during the previous five-year period. These hospital closures will likely result in rural residents having to travel greater distances for emergency medical care. In the 2018 farm bill, Congress included provisions related to refinancing of rural hospital debt, funding for opioid abuse prevention and treatment, and coordination of federal rural health efforts. Aging infrastructure continues to be a concern for rural areas. According to GAO, \"many rural communities face significant challenges in financing the costs of replacing or upgrading aging and obsolete drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.\" Because communities typically pay for drinking water infrastructure through rates charged to users, more sparsely populated communities have difficulty financing major infrastructure construction or upgrades. Some rural communities also lack the resources to assess infrastructure needs. Similar challenges exist to upgrading and maintaining rural housing and electricity infrastructure. The 2018 farm bill includes provisions related to rural infrastructure loan and grant programs, technical assistance for infrastructure planning, and prioritizing water infrastructure funding to address a public health crisis.  Additionally, scholars and policymakers have asserted that access to broadband internet is important for economic and community development in rural areas. According to the most recent FCC deployment data, as of December 2017, 26% of Americans in rural areas and 32% of Americans on tribal lands lack access to broadband at speeds of at least 25 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 3 Mbps upload. In comparison, 1.7% of Americans in urban areas lack access to broadband at 25/3 Mbps. The 2018 farm law includes provisions related to broadband deployment, federal program coordination, and the use of broadband for precision agriculture.  Some scholars and policymakers increasingly support a regional approach to rural economic development. Rather than focus on individual towns or communities, which may compete for jobs and residents, a regional approach draws on the strengths and opportunities of different localities within a region and involves coordination across communities. The 2018 farm bill contained provisions related to federal regional commissions, technical assistance for regional planning, and prioritizing projects that support a strategic community development plan. This section summarizes the rural development provisions in the 2018 farm bill. It provides an overview of new rural development provisions. It also summarizes provisions that reauthorize or amend federal statutes related to existing rural development programs and requirements. In addition to amending programs, the farm bill authorizes programs to receive mandatory or discretionary funding. Congress controls the level of discretionary funding through the subsequent enactment of annual appropriations. Congress controls the level of mandatory funding outside of the appropriations process based on payments made as a direct consequence of statutory requirements. Most RD programs rely on discretionary funding. Section 6101 directs USDA to set aside at least 20% of annual funds appropriated for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program for FY2019-FY2025 for telemedicine projects that provide substance use disorder treatment services. It also directs USDA to prioritize funding for Community Facilities Direct Loans and Grants and Rural Health and Safety Education Grants for projects that provide substance use disorder treatment, education, and prevention. The provision also authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to temporarily prioritize assistance under certain RD programs to help rural communities respond to a significant public health disruption . Section 6202 of the 2018 farm bill authorizes a new rural broadband deployment program to fund middle mile infrastructure . Middle mile infrastructure is infrastructure that does not connect directly to an end user (such as a business or household) but rather connects a local network to the larger internet backbone. The provision authorizes $10 million per year for loans and grants for FY2019-FY2023, subject to annual appropriations. Section 6208 adds a new section to the Rural Electrification Act that addresses environmental reviews for rural broadband programs. The new language authorizes USDA to obligate, but not disburse, loan or grant funds before the completion of an environmental, historical, or other review. The funds may be obligated if USDA determines that a subsequent review will be adequate and easily accomplished. Section 6213 authorizes USDA to use existing regulations for the Rural Broadband Access and Community Connect programs for up to one year until USDA issues a final rule implementing the 2018 farm bill changes.  Section 6212 establishes procedures for federal broadband program coordination . It directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) at the U.S. Department of Commerce to assist USDA with verifying applicant eligibility for USDA rural broadband programs. The provision also directs USDA and the FCC to coordinate before providing broadband assistance to prevent duplication. It requires USDA, NTIA, and the FCC to submit a report to Congress within one year of the farm bill's enactment on how to best coordinate federal broadband programs and activities.  Section 6214 establishes a Broadband Integration Working Group to conduct a survey of all current federal assistance for broadband deployment. The provision also directs the working group to make recommendations to address regulatory barriers and incentivize investment in broadband deployment and adoption. The working group includes numerous federal agencies. The administrator of RUS, Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information at the Department of Commerce, director of the National Economic Council, and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House co-chair the working group. Section 12511 directs the FCC to establish a task force on precision agriculture . Duties of the task force include identifying and measuring current gaps in broadband internet access on agricultural land and making policy recommendations to promote broadband deployment on unserved agricultural land. Section 6419 authorizes USDA to make grants to eligible entities to provide technical assistance and training to support applications for Rural Business-Cooperative Service programs . Eligible entities may use grants to assist communities in planning for business and economic development needs, identifying public and private financing options, and preparing applications and materials to request financial assistance. The law authorizes appropriations of $5 million per year for the program for FY2019-FY2023. Section 6302 directs USDA to provide technical assistance to t ribal entities to improve the entities' access to RD programs. The provision requires technical assistance to address the unique challenges faced by tribal governments, producers, businesses, and tribally designated housing entities in accessing RD programs.  Section 12510 directs USDA to establish Tribal Promise Zones that are to receive priority consideration for federal grant programs and initiatives. Criteria for Tribal Promise Zones include unemployment rates, poverty rates, vacancy rates, household income, and the effectiveness of a competitiveness plan submitted by nominating entities. Prior to the 2018 farm bill's enactment, the federal government had designated certain tribal areas as Tribal Promise Zones under an existing Promise Zones initiative at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Section 12510 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to re-designate any previously designated Tribal Promise Zone.  Section 6424 establishes a new Rural Innovation Stronger Economy Grant Program to establish job accelerators in rural regions. Grant awards may be between $500,000 and $2 million, and applicants must provide at least 20% of project funds. Eligible applicants may use funds for a variety of purposes, including linking rural communities and entrepreneurs to markets, facilitating the repatriation of high-wage jobs to the United States, and identifying and building assets in rural communities. The provision authorizes annual appropriations of $10 million per year for FY2019-FY2023.  Section 6306 creates a Council on Rural Community Innovation and Economic Development , comprised of various executive branch departments and agencies, to coordinate federal engagement with rural stakeholders and make recommendations to streamline and leverage federal investments in rural areas. The provision also establishes a Rural Smart Communities Working Group and a Jobs Accelerator Working Group within the council.  Section 6103 authorizes USDA to use loans or loan guarantees under certain rural business or infrastructure programs to refinance rural hospital debt . Congress permits USDA to assist a rural hospital with refinancing debt if \"the assistance would help preserve access to a health service in a rural community, meaningfully improve the financial position of the hospital, and otherwise meet the financial feasibility and adequacy of security requirements of the Rural Development Agency.\" Section 12409 directs USDA to establish a Rural Health Liaison who would integrate rural health activities across USDA, coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and provide technical assistance to USDA outreach, extension, and county offices. Section 6201 reauthorizes and makes a number of amendments to the Rural Broadband Access Program (also known as the Farm Bill Loan Program): Increases authorized funding for the program from $25 million to $350 million per year for the period FY2019-FY2023. Authorizes 3%-5% of annual program funding for technical assistance and training to applicants applying to provide broadband service to communities that lack broadband at speeds of at least 10/1 Mbps. Adds a grant component to the program to the existing direct and guaranteed loan components. To be eligible for a grant, at least 90% of households in the proposed service area \u00e2\u0080\u0094the area in which an applicant proposes to deploy broadband\u00e2\u0080\u0094must lack access to broadband at minimum speeds. Applicants must provide matching funds of 25%-75% of the project cost, depending on the population density of the proposed service area. Amends the eligibility criteria for loans to require at least 50% of households in proposed service areas to lack access to broadband service at minimum speeds. Under prior law, this threshold was 15% of households. Increases the minimum acceptable broadband speeds for the program from 4/1 Mbps to 25/3 Mbps. These minimum speeds determine both eligibility criteria and buildout requirements. USDA uses the minimum speeds to determine whether areas lack sufficient broadband service and are therefore eligible for program funding (see above two bullet points). USDA also requires all loan or grant recipients to provide broadband service that meets the minimum speeds. Directs USDA to prioritize applications that serve communities with a population of fewer than 10,000 residents; serve communities experiencing out-migration; provide broadband to cropland and ranchland for use in precision agriculture; and were developed with, and received funding from, community stakeholders, among other prioritization criteria. Increases the maximum time to complete buildout of broadband infrastructure to five years. Under prior law, the maximum buildout time was three years from when USDA made assistance available. Directs USDA to establish broadband buildout requirements \u00e2\u0080\u0094the level of internet service an applicant must provide for the duration of a project agreement. Section 6201 also directs USDA to project minimum acceptable service standards for projects with agreements of 5-10, 11-15, 16-20, and more than 20 years. Applicants must demonstrate the ability to furnish or improve service in order to meet the broadband buildout requirements. The conference report contains language further explaining congressional intent. Authorizes USDA to provide payment assistance for certain loan and grant recipients. This includes reduced interest rates or allowing borrowers to defer payments. Directs USDA to charge fees to lenders in amounts that reduce the cost of subsidies for guaranteed loans but are not a barrier to program participation. Moves certain provisions regarding notice requirements, default and deobligation, and service area assessment to other sections of the Rural Electrification Act and makes amendments to these relocated provisions. These provisions still apply to the Rural Broadband Access Program. Section 6201 also removes language regarding paperwork reduction, the preapplication process, and the number of application evaluation periods per year. Section 6102 reauthorizes the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program through FY2023 and increases the authorization for annual appropriations from $75 million to $82 million per year. Section 6204 codifies the Community Connect Program and authorizes funding of $50 million per year for FY2019-FY2023. Previously, Congress had authorized the program in annual Agriculture appropriations bills. Section 6203 reauthorizes the Rural Gigabit Network Pilot Program and renames it the Innovative Broadband Advancement Program . Congress authorizes USDA to provide loans or grants to decrease the cost of broadband deployment and increase broadband speeds. Eligible applicants must agree to complete project buildout within five years and increase broadband speeds to at least the minimum broadband buildout requirements established for the Rural Broadband Access Program. Congress authorizes appropriations of $10 million per year for FY2019-FY2023.  Section 6205 establishes criteria for outdated broadband systems . Beginning October 1, 2020, USDA must consider any portion of a service territory that is subject to an outstanding USDA grant agreement to be unserved if broadband speeds in that portion of a service territory are less than 10/1 Mbps. The provision includes an exception for broadband service providers that have constructed, or begun to construct, broadband facilities that meet the minimum speeds for the Rural Broadband Access Program. As mentioned earlier in this section, Section 6201 set minimum broadband speeds for the Rural Broadband Access Program at 25/3 Mbps. Section 6207 creates a new section of the Rural Electrification Act that addresses public notices, service area assessments, and reporting requirements under USDA rural broadband programs. The provision includes both new language and language moved from other sections of the Rural Electrification Act. It moves language related to public notice requirements, service area assessments, and reporting from the section of the Rural Electrification Act that authorizes the Rural Broadband Access Program to this newly created section. Moving this language makes it applicable to certain other programs authorized in the Rural Electrification Act in addition to the Rural Broadband Access Program. Section 6207 also makes the following amendments: Directs USDA to publish information on applications and funding awards for rural broadband programs in a searchable database on the RUS website. The database must be available to the public. Gives internet service providers at least 45 days to respond to a public notice of application, in contrast to at least 15 days under prior law. Providers may submit information on any broadband service the provider currently offers in the area identified in an application. This information helps USDA determine whether a proposed area meets program eligibility requirements. Exempts from certain Freedom of Information Act requirements information submitted by internet service providers in response to public notices. Includes language regarding assessing unserved communities for Rural Broadband Access Program eligibility. Under the program, USDA gives priority to unserved communities \u00e2\u0080\u0094communities that lack residential broadband service at speeds of at least 10/1 Mbps. Section 6207 directs USDA to coordinate with the FCC and NTIA, obtain data from any other relevant source, and perform site-specific testing to verify that communities given priority are eligible for program funding. Requires loan or grant recipients to report annually to USDA, rather than semiannually as under prior law. The provision also adds reporting requirements for middle mile projects. It directs USDA to submit a single report to Congress each year detailing assistance provided under all USDA rural broadband loan and grant programs. Authorizes not less than 3% and not more than 5% of funding appropriated for certain rural broadband programs be set aside for oversight, reporting, and accountability measures. Section 6210 authorizes recipients of certain RD loans, loan guarantees, or grants authorized by the Rural Electrification Act or the ConAct to use up to 10% of the award amount for rural broadband infrastructure projects . Recipients can use funding only for projects in areas that lack broadband service at speeds of at least 25/3 Mbps. The provision also directs USDA not to provide funding if it would result in competitive harm to another recipient of RD loans or grants.  Section 6206 moves language regarding default and deobligation from the section authorizing the Rural Broadband Access Program to a new section of the Rural Electrification Act. It also authorizes USDA to establish a deferral period of not shorter than the project buildout period in order to support the financial feasibility of a project. Section 6209 moves existing language regarding refinancing telecommunications loans to a new section of the Rural Electrification Act and amends this language. Prior law allowed a loan recipient to use any USDA telecommunications loan to refinance another USDA telecommunications loan if refinancing would support broadband deployment in rural areas. The amended language allows a loan recipient to refinance any outstanding loan that would have been used for an eligible telecommunications purpose under the Rural Electrification Act.  Sections 6211 and 6502 of P.L. 115-334 amend Section 922 of the Rural Electrification Act, which authorizes USDA to make loans for rural telephone service . Section 6211 authorizes telephone loans to be used to refinance other loans authorized by the Rural Electrification Act. It removes the limit that 40% or less of the telephone loan may be used to refinance other loans. Section 6502 removes the word rural from the section title of the Rural Electrification Act, amending it to read, \"Loans for telephone service.\" Section 6502 also removes the requirement for loan applicants to submit to USDA a certificate of convenience from a state regulatory body. Section 6403 amends the Water and Wastewater Revolving Loan Fund Program . It increases the maximum project award amount from $100,000 to $200,000 and decreases the authorization of annual appropriations from $30 million to $15 million per year for FY2019-FY2023. Section 6404 amends the Rural Water and Wastewater Technical Assistance Program . It increases the authorization of annual appropriations to between 3%-5% of annual appropriations for Water and Waste Disposal Grants, as opposed to 1%-3% under prior law. It also amends eligible projects to include addressing the long-term sustainability of water and wastewater systems and contamination of drinking and surface water.  Section 6405 reauthorizes the Rural Water and Wastewater Circuit Rider Program. It also increases the authorization of annual appropriations from $20 million to $25 million per year for FY2019-FY2023. Section 6408 reauthorizes grants for water systems for rural and Native villages in Alaska . It amends the eligible grant recipients to include Native villages, as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and consortiums formed pursuant to the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 ( P.L. 105-83 ). Section 6408 authorizes USDA to set aside up to 2% of annual program funds for consortiums to provide training and technical assistance for water and waste disposal operation and management. Section 6409 reauthorizes and amends the Household Well Water Systems Grant Program . It also authorizes subgrants, as well as previously authorized subloans. It limits subloans and subgrants to a maximum of $15,000 for each water well system or decentralized wastewater system. Section 6409 amends the definition of eligible individual to include one whose household incomes does not exceed 60% of the median nonmetropolitan household income for the state or territory. It also increases the authorization of annual appropriations from $5 million to $20 million per year for FY2019-FY2023. Section 6407 reauthorizes the Emergency and Imminent Community Water Assistance Grant Program . The law funds this program through both a set-aside of Rural Water and Wastewater Grant funding and a standalone appropriation. Section 6407 increases the set-aside from 3%-5% to 5%-7% of annual Rural Water and Wastewater Grant funding. It also increases the authorization for the standalone appropriation from $35 million to $50 million per year for FY2019-FY2023. This provision also directs USDA to prioritize projects that address water contamination posing a threat to human health or the environment. It increases the maximum grant amount from $500,000 to $1 million for projects that respond to a significant decline in water quality or quantity. Section 6407 also establishes an Interagency Task Force on Rural Water Quality to examine drinking water and surface water contamination in rural communities, particularly those in close proximity to active or decommissioned military installations in the United States. The task force must be composed of representatives from certain federal agencies and state and community stakeholders. The task force is to submit a report to relevant committees and make recommendations to address water contamination issues. Section 6303 amends the Rural Energy Savings Program to authorize financing of off-grid and renewable energy storage systems. It also directs USDA to streamline borrower accounting requirements and to publish an annual report on the program. It increases the maximum interest rate for program loans from 3% to 5%. It also directs USDA to exclude any debt incurred under the program in the calculation of a borrower's eligibility for other loans made under the Rural Electrification Act. The provision also reauthorizes annual appropriations of $75 million per year for FY2019-FY2023.  Section 6501 authorizes USDA to refinance electric and telephone loans made by RUS. It also directs USDA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Energy, under which the Department of Energy will provide technical assistance to USDA on making electric and telephone loans. Section 6505 reauthorizes USDA's ability to guarantee payments on bonds and notes issued for electrification or telephone purposes . It amends the purpose of bond or note guarantees to be for financing utility infrastructure. It also adds terms for bond or note guarantees, including a 30-year maximum length. Section 6505 removes the prohibition on guarantees for bonds or notes that will finance electricity generation. It also directs USDA to continue carrying out specified sections of the Rural Electrification Act until the full implementation of any new regulations required by the 2018 farm bill.  Section 6506 reauthorizes the use of certain telecommunications loans for expansion of 911 access . It also amends the eligible loan purposes to include multiuse emergency communications networks that provide critical transportation-related information services. Section 6507 authorizes USDA to make or guarantee electric loans for cybersecurity and grid security improvements . Section 6418 authorizes USDA to collect loan fees for certain loans authorized by the ConAct in such amounts as to bring down the costs of loan subsidies. It also specifies that loan fees shall be consistent with current practices in the marketplace and shall not act as a barrier to participation in the loan programs. The 2018 farm bill also reauthorizes additional programs through FY2023. Section 6406 reauthorizes Tribal College and University Essential Community Facilities Grants, Section 6410 reauthorizes Solid Waste Management Grants, and Section 6412 reauthorizes grants for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Weather Radio Transmitters. Section 6422 reauthorizes the Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program through FY2023. It eliminates mandatory funding for the program (previously $3 million per year) and decreases the authorization of appropriations from $40 million to $20 million per year for FY2019-FY2023. It also adds a minimum grant amount of 20% of the total outstanding balance of microloans made by the intermediary, subject to availability of funding. Section 6412 reauthorizes the Rural Cooperative Development Grant Program through FY2023. It also directs academic institutions conducting research under the program to include economic census data in their research on the economic impacts of cooperatives. Section 6427 reauthorizes appropriations of $20 million per year for the Rural Business Investment Program through FY2023. Section 6426 amends the program by revising the definitions of development venture capital and equity capital . The provision also removes the $500 maximum amount for fees, replacing it with language authorizing USDA to charge \"such fees as the Secretary [of Agriculture] considers appropriate, so long as those fees are proportionally equal for each rural business investment company.\" It also prohibits rural business investment companies from investing in entities that are not otherwise eligible for Farm Credit System financing if a Farm Credit System institution holds more than 50% of the shares of the investment company. Under prior law, this threshold was 25%. Section 6426 also prohibits USDA from requiring that an entity applying to be a rural business investment company provide investment or capital beyond the requirements listed in statute.  Section 6416 reauthorizes appropriations of $25 million per year through FY2023 for the Intermediary Relending Program . The provision also sets a maximum loan amount that an intermediary may make for a project at the lesser of $400,000 or 50% of the loan made by USDA to the intermediary. It adds criteria for evaluating applications, directs USDA to establish a schedule for the return of equity contributions, and directs USDA to reduce the administrative requirements on intermediaries. Section 6503 amends the Cushion of Credit Program to terminate all deposit authority into cushion of credit accounts effective December 20, 2018. It reduces the interest rate for borrowers from 5% per year to 4% per year for FY2021 and then to the applicable one-year Treasury rate thereafter. The provision allows a borrower to reduce the cushion of credit account balance in order to prepay loans made or guaranteed under the Rural Electrification Act. Borrowers may make these prepayments through September 2020. The provision prohibits collection of prepayment premiums from borrowers. Section 6503 also authorizes such sums as necessary from the U.S. Treasury to cover any loan modification costs. Section 6504 reauthorizes and amends the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program . It moves language regarding the program from the section of the Rural Electrification Act authorizing the Cushion of Credit Program to a new section of the act. Section 6504 authorizes annual appropriations of $10 million per year for FY2019-FY2023. It also provides for mandatory funding, financed through the Commodity Credit Corporation, of $5 million per year for FY2022 and FY2023. Section 12608 reauthorizes the Rural Emergency Medical Service Training and Equipment Assistance Program and authorizes annual appropriations of such sums as necessary for FY2019-FY2023. It amends eligibility to include only emergency medical service agencies operated by a local or tribal government and tax-exempt emergency medical services agencies. It also amends eligible grant activities to include public education concerning first aid, illness prevention, and emergency preparedness. The provision amends prioritization criteria and decreases the matching requirement for grants from 25% to 10% of the grant amount. It also amends the definition of emergency medical services to include medical care delivered outside of a medical facility under emergency conditions resulting from a natural disaster. The 2018 farm bill also reauthorizes the following programs through FY2023. Section 6411 reauthorizes Rural Business Development Grants, Section 6413 reauthorizes Loans for Locally or Regionally Produced Agricultural Food Products, Section 6414 reauthorizes the Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas Program, and Section 6423 reauthorizes Delta Health Care Services Grants. The 2018 farm bill includes three provisions that amend the definition of rural for certain RD programs. USDA uses population thresholds to determine whether an area is rural for the purposes of RD programs. Rural population thresholds vary across RD programs. Section 6301 amends the ConAct to direct USDA to exclude individuals incarcerated on a long-term or regional basis and the first 1,500 individuals residing on a military base when determining whether an area is a rural area for certain RD programs . It also amends the Rural Electrification Act and the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to exclude the same populations when determining whether an area is a rural area for certain RD broadband programs . Section 6305 amends the definition s of rural and rural area in the Housing Act of 1949 . The amended definition allows any area classified as rural or a rural area prior to 1990 to remain so until the next decennial census, if the area has a population between 10,000 and 35,000 and has \"a serious lack of mortgage credit for lower and moderate-income families.\" Section 6402 amends the definition of rural for determining eligibility for guaranteed loans under the Water and Waste Disposal and the Community Facilities programs. It increases the population threshold for guaranteed loans to 50,000 or fewer. Under prior law, the population thresholds were 10,000 or fewer for Water and Waste Disposal Guaranteed Loans and 20,000 or fewer for Community Facilities Guaranteed Loans. Section 6402 also directs USDA to prioritize guaranteed loan applications for areas with a population of 10,000 or fewer for the Water and Waste Disposal Program and 20,000 or fewer for the Community Facilities Program. The population thresholds for grant and direct loan eligibility remain unchanged at 10,000 or fewer for the Water and Waste Disposal Program and 20,000 or fewer for the Community Facilities Program. Section 6401 amends the Strategic Economic and Community Development provision of the ConAct. This provision allows USDA to prioritize funding under certain RD programs for projects that support multijurisdictional strategic community development plans. Section 6401 expands the provision to apply to all RD programs as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. It increases the portion of funding USDA may reserve for projects under this section from 10% to 15% of program funding made available for a fiscal year. Section 6401 also authorizes annual appropriations of $5 million for FY2019-FY2023 for technical assistance to rural communities in developing strategic community investment plans.  Sections 6425 and 6304 reauthorize and amend federal regional commissions and authorities. Section 6425 reauthorizes the Delta Regional Authority through October 1, 2023. It also reauthorizes annual appropriations of $30 million per year for the authority for FY2019-FY2023. Section 6304 reauthorizes three federal regional commissions \u00e2\u0080\u0094the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0094and increases authorized appropriations for each commission from $30 million to $33 million per year through FY2023. Federal statute directs the commissions to set aside 40% of grant funding in a given fiscal year for certain eligible activities, including transportation, telecommunications, or other public infrastructure. Section 6304 adds promoting development of renewable and alternative energy sources as an eligible activity for set-aside funding. The 2018 farm bill did not reauthorize the Northern Great Plains Regional Authority . Section 6304 also authorizes a new State Capacity Building Grant Program for the Northern Border Regional Commission . Congress authorizes the commission to provide grants to Maine, New Hampshire, New York, or Vermont for economic development activities. An eligible state must submit to the commission an annual work plan that includes the purpose of the grant. Section 6304 authorizes appropriations of $5 million per year for FY2019-FY2023 for the grant program.  Section 6415 reauthorizes the Rural Economic Area Partnership (REAP) Program through FY2023. USDA has established REAP Zones to address critical issues related to economic growth, employment, and isolation. REAP Zones typically consist of multiple counties within a state and receive technical assistance and funding from USDA for strategic planning and community development activities. Section 6420 reauthorizes the National Rural Development Partnership through FY2023. This partnership, coordinated by USDA, includes state rural development councils and a national coordinating committee. State rural development councils facilitate collaboration among local government, private sector, and nonprofit entities in planning and implementing programs related to rural development. The national coordinating committee oversees and provides support for state rural development council activities. Section 12407 amends the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-354 ) to reestablish the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development as a permanent position within USDA. USDA eliminated the Under Secretary position in a 2017 reorganization, replacing it with an Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development who reported directly to the Secretary of Agriculture and was not a Senate-confirmed position. The Under Secretary position reports to the Deputy Secretary of Agriculture and requires Senate confirmation.  USDA asserted that the 2017 reorganization \"recognizes and promotes the importance of rural development by placing it under the direct oversight of the Secretary.\" However, some stakeholder organizations opposed eliminating the Under Secretary position. For example, a letter to the House and Senate Agriculture Appropriations subcommittees signed by 578 organizations stated that RD \"needs the time and attention of a management team led by an Under Secretary who is empowered to direct and administer rural development programs and field staff.\" Section 6417 grants the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary's designees access to certain information from the Department of Health and Human Services in order to verify income for individuals participating in certain Rural Housing Service programs . Prior law granted the HUD Secretary access to certain information to verify income of participants for certain HUD housing programs. Section 6417 allows the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary's designees access to the same information, subject to the same requirements, as the HUD Secretary. Sections 6601 through 6603 repeal certain rural development programs. Section 6602 repeals the Rural Telephone Bank. Section 6603 repeals all sections of the Launching our Communities' Access to Local Television Act of 2000 (Title X of H.R. 5548 , as enacted by Section 1(a)(2) of P.L. 106-553 ) except Section 1008 of the act. Section 6601 of the 2018 farm bill repeals the following programs, which were previously authorized in the ConAct or the Rural Electrification Act: Multijurisdictional regional planning organizations (Section 306(a)(23) of the ConAct), Grants to broadcasting systems (Section 310B(f) of the ConAct), Rural telework organizations (Section 379 of the ConAct), Historical barn preservation (Section 379A of the ConAct), Grants to train farm workers in new technologies and to train farm workers in specialized skills necessary for high-value crops (Section 379C of the ConAct), Grants to the Delta Regional Agricultural Economic Development Program (Section 379D of the ConAct), Grants for expansion of employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities in rural areas (Section 379F of the ConAct), Regional rural collaborative investment program (Subtitle I of the ConAct), Certain electric and telephone loans (Section 314 of the Rural Electrification Act), and The National Center for Rural Telecommunications Assessment (Section 602 of the Rural Electrification Act). Sections 6701 and 6702 make technical corrections to the ConAct and Rural Electrification Act. Section 6701 amends the ConAct to correct the reference to the definition of Indian tribe for the Community Facilities Loan and Grant Program. It also clarifies the eligible activities for Rural Business Development Grants. Further, Section 6701 amends the ConAct to include Alabama as a participating state in the Delta Regional Authority. Congress initially made this amendment in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 ( P.L. 106-554 , \u00c2\u00a71(a)(4)). However, the amendment did not take effect at the time because it referred to the incorrect authorizing legislation. Section 6701 of the 2018 farm bill directs the correction to take effect as if included in P.L. 106-554 . Section 6702 corrects misspellings in the Rural Electrification Act."
