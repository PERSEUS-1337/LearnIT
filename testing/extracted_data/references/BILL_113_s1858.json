FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The implementation of new rules and regulations set \n        forth in the Transformation Order has created financial \n        uncertainty and instability for rural carriers by denying rural \n        carriers a meaningful opportunity to recover investments and \n        expenses incurred to provide universal service prior to 2012.\n            (2) The implementation of the Transformation Order, \n        including the utilization of a widely criticized regression \n        analysis used to determine levels of universal service support, \n        is creating significant uncertainty with respect to the \n        sufficiency and predictability of the universal service support \n        mechanisms, which has discouraged rural carriers from making \n        broadband infrastructure investments to build out new broadband \n        capabilities in high cost-to-serve rural communities throughout \n        the United States.\n            (3) The intent of Congress under section 254 of the \n        Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254) is that the \n        Commission--\n                    (A) consult with the Federal-State Joint Board on \n                Universal Service before adopting changes to \n                regulations that affect universal service high-cost \n                fund mechanisms; and\n                    (B) adopt policies and regulations that establish \n                and maintain ``specific, predictable, and sufficient'' \n                support mechanisms to preserve and advance universal \n                service.\n            (4) The Secretary of Agriculture has warned that the \n        implementation of the Transformation Order is having unintended \n        consequences for rural broadband investment and deployment and \n        for other Federal programs designed to promote rural broadband \n        deployment.\n            (5) The Department of Agriculture has reported that demand \n        for Rural Utilities Service loans for broadband buildout has \n        plummeted in 2013, due in part to the uncertainty created by \n        the new rules and regulations set forth in the Transformation \n        Order.\n            (6) Surveys of rural carriers indicate that nearly two-\n        thirds of rural rate-of-return carriers are canceling or \n        postponing new broadband investments, while other reports \n        indicate that rural rate-of-return carriers are being forced to \n        increase consumer prices and reduce staff, creating ripple \n        effects for economies in rural areas of the United States.\n            (7) Congressional hearings have demonstrated that the \n        approach of the Commission to the consideration, review, and \n        resolution of petitions for waivers from rules adopted under \n        the Transformation Order--\n                    (A) is unduly burdensome and costly for small, \n                rural carriers and inconsistent with the established \n                policy and waiver standards of the Commission; and\n                    (B) is consequently discouraging small, rural \n                carriers from requesting waivers and is creating \n                additional business uncertainties.\n            (8) Congressional hearings have demonstrated that the \n        Commission can make adjustments to the Transformation Order to \n        address the adverse impact and business uncertainties \n        confronting small, rural carriers without affecting other \n        categories of carriers or increasing the Universal Service Fund \n        budget established in the Transformation Order.\n\nSEC. 4. SUSPENSION AND REVISION OF PROVISION OF TRANSFORMATION ORDER.\n\n    (a) Suspension.--Section 36.621(a)(5) of title 47, Code of Federal \nRegulations (relating to the annual limitation of study area total \nunseparated loop cost pursuant to a schedule announced by the Wireline \nCompetition Bureau), shall have no force or effect.\n    (b) Review and Revision.--\n            (1) Publication of revised proposal for universal service \n        distribution to rural rate-of-return carriers.--\n                    (A) Requirement to submit proposal.--Not later than \n                60 days after the effective date of this Act, the \n                Commission shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking \n                to adopt a revised proposal for rural support.\n                    (B) Recovery of reasonable investments and \n                operating expenses.--The Commission shall ensure that \n                the revised proposal for rural support does not deprive \n                a rural rate-of-return carrier of the opportunity to \n                recover reasonable investments and operating expenses \n                incurred prior to the adoption under subparagraph (D) \n                of the revised proposal for rural support.\n                    (C) Consultation with joint boards.--Before the \n                Commission issues a final rule under subparagraph (D) \n                to adopt a revised proposal for rural support, the \n                Commission shall consult with the applicable Federal-\n                State Joint Board to the extent that such consultation \n                is required under the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n                U.S.C. 151 et seq.).\n                    (D) Final rule adopting proposal.--Not earlier than \n                45 days and not later than 120 days after the date on \n                which the Commission issues the notice of proposed \n                rulemaking under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall \n                issue a final rule adopting a revised proposal for \n                rural support.\n            (2) Report to congress.--Not later than 60 days after the \n        effective date of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the \n        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n        Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of \n        Representatives--\n                    (A) a report that contains the revised proposal for \n                rural support published in the notice of proposed \n                rulemaking under paragraph (1)(A); and\n                    (B) a report that--\n                            (i) describes the amount of universal \n                        service funding necessary to achieve universal \n                        service objectives during the 10-year period \n                        following the date on which the report is \n                        submitted; and\n                            (ii) includes--\n                                    (I) quantitative and qualitative \n                                analysis in support of the findings of \n                                the Commission under clause (i); and\n                                    (II) a specific analysis \n                                identifying the unique circumstances \n                                and resulting high-cost loop support \n                                required to provide and maintain \n                                universal service in Alaska and on \n                                tribal lands.\n    (c) Interim Limitations.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the effective \n        date of this Act, the Commission shall establish interim \n        limitations on study area total unseparated loop costs by--\n                    (A) determining the annual Universal Service Fund \n                distribution for each rural rate-of-return carrier on \n                the basis of the applicable rules that were in effect \n                on the day before the effective date of the \n                Transformation Order; and\n                    (B) adjusting the universal service distribution of \n                high-cost loop support that results from the annual \n                distribution determined under paragraph (1) to \n                reflect--\n                            (i) the revision to section 36.605 of title \n                        47, Code of Federal Regulations, required under \n                        section 5 of this Act; and\n                            (ii) any revisions to responses to waiver \n                        petitions required under section 6 of this Act.\n            (2) Duration.--The interim limitations established under \n        paragraph (1) shall be in effect until the date on which the \n        final rule required under subsection (b)(1)(D) takes effect.\n\nSEC. 5.
