Grandfather clause.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Old-growth forests are unique ecosystems that serve as \n        critical habitat for hundreds of vertebrate and invertebrate \n        animals, plants, and fungi.\n            (2) Old-growth forests provide clean and plentiful water \n        and support streams and rivers containing runs of anadromous \n        and resident cold water fish, which are wholly dependent on \n        high quantity and quality water for migration, spawning, \n        rearing, and cover.\n            (3) The high quantity and quality of water in streams and \n        rivers in old-growth forests can only be maintained by \n        protecting the watersheds of these streams and rivers.\n            (4) Old-growth forests provide unique and outstanding \n        opportunities for educational study, scientific research, and \n        recreation.\n            (5) The establishment of a watershed and forest preserve to \n        protect areas of old-growth forests and surface waters can \n        contribute significantly to the quality of life for the \n        residents of the State of Oregon through education, recreation, \n        and a protected water supply.\n            (6) The area known as the Opal Creek Forest, located on the \n        upper Little North Fork of the Santiam River in the State of \n        Oregon, contains one of the largest remaining intact old-growth \n        forest ecosystems in the Western Oregon Cascades. Although the \n        landscape mosaic in the Opal Creek Forest may reflect some past \n        logging, young stands of trees in the area mainly owe their \n        existence to natural disturbances, chiefly wildfire.\n            (7) The Opal Creek Forest contains outstanding geological \n        and botanical features and contains attributes of historic and \n        prehistoric importance.\n            (8) The recreational use of the Opal Creek Forest, \n        typically in the form of hiking, sightseeing, and the general \n        enjoyment of the outdoor environment, is significant and likely \n        to increase.\n            (9) It is desirable to limit the human-related disturbances \n        and development of the Opal Creek Forest in order to protect \n        fully the special features of the forest and maintain the full \n        potential of its watershed for scientific, educational, and \n        research purposes.\n            (10) Preservation of the Opal Creek Forest provides \n        outstanding opportunities for scientists to conduct research \n        regarding old-growth forests and for educators to provide \n        scientifically credible information to the public.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect and preserve the forests and watersheds \n        contained in the Opal Creek Forest Preserve;\n            (2) consistent with paragraph (1), to promote and conduct--\n                    (A) research in the Preserve regarding old-growth \n                forests in a manner that does not include the \n                harvesting of timber or otherwise damage the ecosystem; \n                and\n                    (B) educational programs in the Preserve on old-\n                growth forests and cultural and historic resources in \n                the Preserve; and\n            (3) consistent with paragraphs (1) and (2), to permit and \n        regulate recreation in the Preserve.\n\nSEC. 3.
