These consultations shall also include appropriate \nopportunities for public review and comment.\n    (c) Transmittal to Congress.--Prior to the end of the third \ncomplete fiscal year commencing after the date of enactment of this \nAct, the Secretary shall transmit the plan developed under this section \nto the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of \nRepresentatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \nthe United States Senate.\n\nSEC. 102.

The \nSecretary shall develop a report which contains a list of areas within \nthe National Park System where National Park Service management should \nbe modified or terminated.\n    (2) In developing the list under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall \nconsider such factors as duplication within the National Park System, \nbetter representation of a particular resource type under management of \nanother entity, lack of significance, lack of management feasibility, \ncost, lack of visitor accessibility, modifications that change the \ncharacter of the resource, lack of collaboration to protect resources, \nsuitability for management by another agency, and the compatibility of \nthe resource with the present mission and role of the National Park \nService.\n    (3) For any areas for which termination of National Park Service \nmanagement is recommended, the Secretary shall make recommendations \nregarding management by an entity or entities other than the National \nPark Service.

The Secretary shall give \nspecial consideration to themes, sites, and resources not already \nadequately represented in the National Park System as identified in the \nNational Park System Plan to be developed under section 101 of the \nNational Park System Reform Act of 1994.

Each study under this section \nshall be prepared with appropriate opportunity for public involvement, \nincluding at least one public meeting in the vicinity of the area under \nstudy, and reasonable efforts to notify potentially affected landowners \nand State and local governments. In conducting the study, the Secretary \nshall consider whether the area under study--\n            ``(1) possesses nationally significant natural or cultural \n        resources, or outstanding recreational opportunities, and that \n        it represents one of the most important examples of a \n        particular resource type in the country; and\n            ``(2) is a suitable and feasible addition to the system.\nEach study shall consider the following factors with regard to the area \nbeing studied: the rarity and integrity of the resources, the threats \nto those resources, whether similar resources are already protected in \nthe National Park System or in other Federal, state or private \nownership, the public use potential, the interpretive and educational \npotential, costs associated with acquisition, development and \noperation, the socioeconomic impacts of any designation, the level of \nlocal and general public support and whether the unit is of appropriate \nconfiguration to ensure long term resource protection and visitor use. \nEach such study shall also consider whether direct National Park \nService management or alternative protection by other agencies or the \nprivate sector is appropriate for the area. Each such study shall \nidentify what alternative or combination of alternatives would in the \nprofessional judgment of the Director of the National Park Service, be \nmost effective and efficient in protecting significant resources and \nproviding for public enjoyment. The letter transmitting each completed \nstudy to Congress shall contain a recommendation regarding the \nAdministration's preferred management option for the area.\n    ``(d) List of Areas.--At the beginning of each calendar year, along \nwith the annual budget submission, the Secretary shall submit to the \nCommittee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States \nSenate a list of areas which have been previously studied which contain \nprimarily cultural or historical resources and a list of areas which \nhave been previously studied which contain primarily natural resources \nin numerical order of priority for addition to the National Park \nSystem. In developing the list, the Secretary should consider threats \nto resource values, cost escalation factors and other factors listed in \nsubsection (c) of this section.''.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives September 28, 1994.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                           DONNALD K.
