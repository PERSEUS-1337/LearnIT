FINDINGS; DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The people of Iraq have made significant progress in \n        establishing the framework for a democratic government.\n            (2) In an October 2005 referendum, the Iraqi people voted \n        to approve Iraq's Constitution, setting up an Islamic federal \n        democracy while strengthening the rights of women and \n        minorities in that country.\n            (3) On December 15, 2005, Iraqis voted in the first multi-\n        party elections in that country in 50 years.\n            (4) The Iraqi parliament that emerged from the December \n        2005 elections includes representation across a broad cross \n        section of the population and has established affirmative \n        measures to include women and ethnic minorities in positions of \n        authority.\n            (5) The Iraqi constitutional framework has allowed the \n        election of President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Nouri \n        Kamal al-Maliki to form Iraq's first democratically-elected \n        government in its history.\n            (6) The Government of the United States has expended, \n        through the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF), \n        approximately 67 percent of the $20,912,000,000 in various \n        reconstruction efforts in Iraq.\n            (7) In an effort to allow Iraqis to take over security \n        operations, approximately 265,000 Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) \n        have been trained, nearing the total force goal of 325,000 by \n        August 2007.\n            (8) However, despite the emergence of a democratically-\n        elected Iraqi Government, most civilian functions of that \n        government remain the responsibility of United States military \n        and Coalition military forces.\n    (b) Declarations of Policy.--Congress makes the following \ndeclarations of policy:\n            (1) While the military excellence with which Operation \n        Iraqi Freedom has been executed is to be congratulated, it is \n        in the best interests of the United States and the nation of \n        Iraq that the proper functions of government be transferred to \n        Iraqi control as soon as is practicable.\n            (2) In order to have an orderly, deliberate, and \n        expeditious transition to Iraqi civilian control, the task of \n        doing so must be vested in a national commission which is \n        specifically empowered and authorized to monitor and assess \n        that transition and oversee that such transition is carried \n        out.\n            (3) Congress acknowledges that there is successful \n        precedent for such a commission in comparable circumstances. At \n        the close of World War II, a national commission, composed of \n        three United States Senators, three Members of the House of \n        Representatives, and three Presidential appointees were \n        appointed and directed to oversee the transition of the \n        Philippines from United States military to local, civilian \n        control.\n            (4) It is again the desire of Congress, as set forth in \n        this Act, to establish a national commission to undertake the \n        responsibility of overseeing the development of a plan and its \n        implementation to transition Iraq from United States military \n        control to Iraqi civilian control in an orderly, deliberate, \n        and expeditious manner.\n            (5) Congress anticipates and expects that the United States \n        military will work in concert with and be an integral part of \n        the national commission.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to establish a national commission to \ndevelop plans for the orderly and expeditious transfer of power for \nIraqi Government operations from United States military forces to the \nnewly-elected Government of Iraq. The national commission shall seek \nthe goals of empowering the newly-elected Government of Iraq and \nreducing reliance on United States military forces, while enabling the \nsafe, prompt, and orderly return of such military forces to the United \nStates, and further--\n            (1) to facilitate a dialogue between members of the \n        commission, Iraqi leaders, and coalition and international \n        partners in furtherance of the purpose of this Act;\n            (2) to report such findings, conclusions, and \n        recommendations as are consistent with the purpose of this Act; \n        and\n            (3) to provide guidance and support for the expeditious \n        assumption of governmental responsibility by the newly-elected \n        and appointed Iraqi government officials as is consistent with \n        congressional oversight responsibilities regarding the proper \n        use of United States reconstruction assistance for Iraq.\n\nSEC. 4.
