    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Safety \nAct of 1994''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there are approximately 170,000 public and 110,000 \n        private at-grade rail-highway crossings in the United States;\n            (2) during 1993, there were nearly 4,900 accidents at these \n        crossings;\n            (3) it is necessary to improve safety at our Nation's rail-\n        highway crossings and along rail rights-of-way;\n            (4) there are insufficient public funds to provide for the \n        installation of warning systems that are automatically \n        activated by approaching trains at all public crossings;\n            (5) many of the Nation's public rail-highway crossings are \n        unnecessary and should be closed;\n            (6) rail-highway crossing consolidation will reduce the \n        potential for rail-highway crossing collisions and will allow \n        States to concentrate on improving safety at the remaining \n        crossings;\n            (7) incentives are needed to encourage State and local \n        governments to increase the consolidation of rail-highway \n        crossings; and\n            (8) increased funding must be provided to educate motorists \n        in their responsibilities at crossings in order to realize the \n        full benefits from the public investment in rail-highway \n        crossing warning systems.\n\nSEC. 3. RAIL-HIGHWAY GRADE CROSSING CLOSING PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Increased Federal Share.--Section 120(c) of title 23, United \nStates Code, is amended by inserting ``rail-highway crossing \nclosures,'' after ``vanpooling,''.\n    (b) Incentive Funds; Benefits and Costs Analyses.--Section 130 of \ntitle 23, United States Code, is amended by redesignating subsection \n(h) as subsection (j) and inserting after subsection (g) the following:\n    ``(h) Incentive Funds for Closing Crossings.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), any State, \n        after adopting a policy requiring the review of the need for \n        all new public at-grade rail-highway crossings, may, in its \n        discretion, use the funds authorized under this section to \n        provide an incentive payment to a local jurisdiction upon the \n        permanent closing by the jurisdiction of a public at-grade \n        crossing.\n            ``(2) Conditions.--The incentive payments authorized by \n        paragraph (1) of this subsection may be in amounts of not to \n        exceed $7,500: Provided, That the funds are matched by an equal \n        payment from the railroad owning the tracks on which the \n        crossing is located.\n            ``(3) Use of funds.--The local jurisdiction receiving funds \n        under this subsection shall use the Federal funds portion of \n        the incentive payment for transportation safety improvements \n        only.\n    ``(i) Public Benefits and Costs Analyses.--Not later than 18 months \nafter the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall \nestablish guidelines to enable States to determine the public benefits \nand costs resulting from any new rail-highway grade crossings.''.\n\nSEC. 4. OPERATION LIFESAVER.\n\n    Section 104(d)(1) of title 23, United States Code, is amended to \nread as follows:\n            ``(1) Operation lifesaver.--Before making an apportionment \n        of funds under subsection (b)(3) for a fiscal year, the \n        Secretary shall set aside $500,000 of the funds authorized to \n        be appropriated for the surface transportation program for such \n        fiscal year for carrying out a public information and education \n        program to help prevent and reduce motor vehicle accidents, \n        injuries, and fatalities, to improve driver performance at \n        railway-highway crossings, and to help prevent trespassing on \n        rail rights-of-way and the resulting injuries and fatalities. \n        Expenditure of any funds in excess of $300,000 shall be \n        contingent upon receipt of matching funds from nonpublic \n        sources.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
