FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the industrialization of developing nations has driven \n        demand for nonfuel minerals necessary for telecommunications, \n        military technologies, healthcare technologies, and \n        conventional and renewable energy technologies;\n            (2) the availability of minerals and mineral materials are \n        essential for economic growth, national security, technological \n        innovation, and the manufacturing and agricultural supply \n        chain;\n            (3) minerals and mineral materials are critical components \n        of every transportation, water, telecommunications, and energy \n        infrastructure project necessary to modernize the crumbling \n        infrastructure of the United States;\n            (4) the exploration, production, processing, use, and \n        recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the economic \n        well-being, security, and general welfare of the United States;\n            (5) the United States has vast mineral resources but is \n        becoming increasingly dependent on foreign sources of mineral \n        resources, as demonstrated by the fact that--\n                    (A) 25 years ago, the United States was dependent \n                on foreign sources for 45 nonfuel mineral materials, of \n                which--\n                            (i) 8 were imported by the United States to \n                        fulfill 100 percent of the requirements of the \n                        United States for those nonfuel mineral \n                        materials; and\n                            (ii) 19 were imported by the United States \n                        to fulfill greater than 50 percent of the \n                        requirements of the United States for those \n                        nonfuel mineral materials;\n                    (B) by 2015 the import dependence of the United \n                States for nonfuel mineral materials increased from \n                dependence on the import of 45 nonfuel mineral \n                materials to dependence on the import of 47 nonfuel \n                mineral materials, of which--\n                            (i) 19 were imported by the United States \n                        to fulfill 100 percent of the requirements of \n                        the United States for those nonfuel mineral \n                        materials; and\n                            (ii) 22 were imported by the United States \n                        to fulfill greater than 50 percent of the \n                        requirements of the United States for those \n                        nonfuel mineral materials;\n                    (C) according to the Department of Energy, the \n                United States imports greater than 50 percent of the 41 \n                metals and minerals key to clean energy applications;\n                    (D) the United States share of worldwide mineral \n                exploration dollars was 7 percent in 2015, down from 19 \n                percent in the early 1990s;\n                    (E) the 2014 Ranking of Countries for Mining \n                Investment, which ranks 25 major mining countries, \n                found that 7- to 10-year permitting delays are the most \n                significant risk to mining projects in the United \n                States; and\n                    (F) in late 2016, the Government Accountability \n                Office found that--\n                            (i) ``the Federal government's approach to \n                        addressing critical materials supply issues has \n                        not been consistent with selected key practices \n                        for interagency collaboration, such as ensuring \n                        that agencies' roles and responsibilities are \n                        clearly defined''; and\n                            (ii) ``the Federal critical materials \n                        approach faces other limitations, including \n                        data limitations and a focus on only a subset \n                        of critical materials, a limited focus on \n                        domestic production of critical materials, and \n                        limited engagement with industry''.\n\nSEC. 3.
