FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are \n        facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly weaponry, \n        body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;\n            (2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the \n        interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;\n            (3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise \n        affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls \n        over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to \n        control this traffic within their own borders through the \n        exercise of their police power;\n            (4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco \n        Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers of \n        body armor, a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, \n        California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects \n        outfitted in body armor, and the 1997 murder of Captain Chris \n        McCurley of the Etowah County, Alabama Drug Task Force by a \n        drug dealer shielded by protective body armor, demonstrate the \n        serious threat to community safety posed by criminals who wear \n        body armor during the commission of a violent crime;\n            (5) of the approximately 1,200 officers killed in the line \n        of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been saved \n        by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times \n        higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;\n            (6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent \n        of State and local police are not issued body armor;\n            (7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local \n        police departments access to body armor that is no longer \n        needed by Federal agencies; and\n            (8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n        clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n        States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce \n        that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Body armor.--The term ``body armor'' means any product \n        sold or offered for sale, in interstate or foreign commerce, as \n        personal protective body covering intended to protect against \n        gunfire, regardless of whether the product is to be worn alone \n        or is sold as a complement to another product or garment.\n            (2) Law enforcement agency.--The term ``law enforcement \n        agency'' means an agency of the United States, a State, or a \n        political subdivision of a State, authorized by law or by a \n        government agency to engage in or supervise the prevention, \n        detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation of \n        criminal law.\n            (3) Law enforcement officer.--The term ``law enforcement \n        officer'' means any officer, agent, or employee of the United \n        States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, \n        authorized by law or by a government agency to engage in or \n        supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or \n        prosecution of any violation of criminal law.\n\nSEC. 4. AMENDMENT OF SENTENCING GUIDELINES WITH RESPECT TO BODY ARMOR.\n\n    (a) In General.--Pursuant to its authority under section 994(p) of \ntitle 28, United States Code, the United States Sentencing Commission \nshall review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines and the policy \nstatements of the Commission, as appropriate, to provide an appropriate \nsentencing enhancement for any crime of violence (as defined in section \n16 of title 18, United States Code) or drug trafficking crime (as \ndefined in section 924(c) of title 18, United States Code) (including a \ncrime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an \nenhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous \nweapon or device) in which the defendant used body armor.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that any \nsentencing enhancement under this section should be at least 2 levels.\n\nSEC. 5.
