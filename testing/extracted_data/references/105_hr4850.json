ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.\n\n    (a)(1) In General.--Subject to valid existing rights, lands \ndesignated as wilderness by this Act shall be managed by the Secretary \nof the Interior in accordance with the Wilderness Act and this Act, \nexcept that, with respect to the lands designated as wilderness by this \nAct, any reference in the Wilderness Act to the effective date of the \nWilderness Act shall be deemed to be a reference to the date of \nenactment of this Act.\n    (2) Potential Wilderness.--\n            (A) Definition.--As used in this paragraph, the term \n        ``potential wilderness lands'' means:\n                    (i) lands within the boundaries of the areas \n                designated as wilderness by this Act that are \n                identified as ``potential wilderness'' on the map \n                referred to in section 2(a); and\n                    (ii) lands and interests therein acquired by the \n                United States on or after the date of enactment of this \n                Act that are located within the boundaries of Rocky \n                Mountain National Park and contiguous with lands \n                designated as wilderness by this Act.\n            (B) Management.--Potential wilderness lands shall be \n        managed as components of the National Wilderness Preservation \n        System upon publication in the Federal Register of a notice by \n        the Secretary of the Interior that all uses thereon \n        inconsistent with the Wilderness Act have ceased.\n    (b) Water Rights.--(1) The Congress finds that, according to \ndecisions of courts of the State of Colorado, the United States has \nexisting rights to substantial quantities of water within Rocky \nMountain National Park, and that consequently there is no need for this \nAct to effect a reservation by the United States of any additional \nwater rights to fulfill the purposes for which the wilderness \ndesignations made by this Act are made.\n    (2) Nothing in this Act or any action taken pursuant thereto shall \nconstitute either an express or implied reservation of water or water \nrights for any purpose.\n    (c) Colorado-Big Thompson Project.--\n            (1) Existing activities.--Activities on, under, or \n        affecting the lands designated as wilderness by this Act \n        relating to the monitoring, operation, maintenance, repair, \n        replacement, or use of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project and \n        its facilities which were allowed as of June 1, 1998, shall be \n        allowed to continue, and shall not be affected by the \n        designation of such lands as wilderness.\n            (2) New activities.--In addition to the activities \n        described in paragraph (1), any other activities on, under, or \n        affecting the lands designated as wilderness by this Act that \n        are necessary to respond to catastrophic events or emergencies \n        and that affect the continued operation, maintenance, repair, \n        replacement or use of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project and its \n        facilities shall be allowed, subject to reasonable restrictions \n        established by the Secretary of the Interior in order to \n        protect the wilderness values of such lands; Provided, however, \n        That any such restrictions shall not permanently reduce the \n        water supply capability of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project or \n        the Windy Gap Project.\n            (3) Other projects.--Nothing in section 1 of the Act of \n        January 26, 1915 (16 U.S.C. 191; 38 State. 798) shall be \n        construed to permit development within the lands designated as \n        wilderness by this Act of any reclamation project not in \n        existence on the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (d) Exclusions.--(1) Boundaries for the wilderness and potential \nwilderness areas designated by this Act specifically exclude--\n            (A) the Grand Ditch (including both the main canal of the \n        Grand Ditch and a branch thereof known as the Specimen Ditch) \n        and its right-of-way as well as associated appurtenances, \n        structures, buildings, camps, and work sites in existence as of \n        June 1, 1998; and\n            (B) lands owned by the St. Vrain & Left Hand Water \n        Conservancy District, including Copeland Reservoir and the \n        inlet ditch to such reservoir from the North St. Vrain Creek, \n        amounting to approximately 35.38 acres.\n    (2) Nothing in this Act shall affect management or use of any lands \nnot included within the boundaries of the areas designated as \nwilderness or potential wilderness by this Act.\n    (e) No Buffer Zones.--Congress does not intend that the designation \nby this Act of wilderness areas in the State of Colorado creates or \nimplies the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around \nany wilderness area. The fact that nonwilderness activities or uses can \nbe seen or heard from within a wilderness area shall not, of itself, \npreclude such activities or uses up to the boundary of the wilderness \narea."
