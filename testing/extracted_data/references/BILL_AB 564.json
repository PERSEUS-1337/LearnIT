In order to receive a credit pursuant to this subdivision, parents shall submit a request to the department that is postmarked no later than 60 days after the day for which the credit was earned. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in a denial of the credit by the department.\n(g) All fees collected shall be remitted to the State Treasury to be deposited into the Program Development Fund established in Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 4670) to provide resources needed to initiate new programs, consistent with approved priorities for the program development in the state plan, or to be used by the department to offset General Fund costs.\n(h) Parents may appeal a determination of the amount of a monthly parental fee or the denial or amount of a credit requested pursuant to subdivision (f) by submitting a written appeal request to the director within 30 days of the date of the monthly parental fee confirmation letter or credit confirmation or denial letter. An appeal pursuant to this subdivision may consider only disputes concerning the family income used to set the monthly parental fee and the denial or amount of credit. The director, or his or her designee shall, within 30 days after receipt of the appeal, review the assessed monthly parental fee or credit denial or amount for accuracy and provide written notice of the decision to the appellant. The director or his or her designee shall, when deciding an appeal of a monthly parental fee, consider the income documentation and the calculation of the monthly parental fee described in subdivision (e). All decisions regarding monthly parental fee appeals shall be retroactive to the date the appealed monthly parental fee was assessed.\n(i) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2016."
