LIMITATIONS ON BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES AND \n              CRITERIA FOR CERTAIN DECISIONS INVOLVING SUCH ACTIVITIES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 2012, the Department of Defense requested additional \n        rounds of defense base closure and realignment in 2013 and \n        2015.\n            (2) There have been five rounds of defense base closure and \n        realignment (BRAC) in the last 25 years (1988, 1991, 1993, \n        1995, and 2005).\n            (3) Congress has not approved additional rounds of base \n        closure and realignment to occur after 2005, and recognizes \n        that the 2005 round incurred substantial costs that will not be \n        offset by savings for nearly two decades.\n            (4) According to the Government Accountability Office, \n        implementation of the 2005 round of defense base closure and \n        realignment cost $35,100,000,000, or approximately \n        $14,100,000,000 more than was estimated by the 2005 Base \n        Closure and Realignment Commission.\n            (5) Furthermore, the Government Accountability Office has \n        determined that the 2005 round of defense base closure and \n        realignment will take 17 years before taxpayers realize net \n        savings from the round.\n            (6) On March 8, 2012, defending the request for additional \n        rounds of defense base closure and realignment in testimony \n        before the Committee on Armed Services of the House of \n        Representatives, Dr. Dorothy Robyn, Deputy Undersecretary of \n        Defense for Installations and Environment, asserted that the \n        Department of Defense would close military installations using \n        non-BRAC authorities, stating that ``if Congress does not \n        authorize additional BRAC rounds the department will be forced \n        to use its existing authorities to begin to realign and close \n        bases''.\n            (7) The Department of Defense may close or realign bases \n        only if a round of defense base closure and realignment is \n        carried out in compliance with sections 2687 and 993 of title \n        10, United States Code.\n            (8) Section 2687 of title 10, United States Code, contains \n        ambiguous language, leading the Department of Defense to pursue \n        significant closures and realignments without congressional \n        approval or an authorization for a round of defense base \n        closure and realignment.\n            (9) Sections 2687 and 993 of title 10, United States Code, \n        contain single action limits on reductions that are too easily \n        circumvented by cumulative actions.\n            (10) As demonstrated by BRAC and other closure and \n        realignment actions, base closures and realignments can have \n        significant effects on Department of Defense functions, current \n        and future operational capabilities, and on host communities \n        and States.\n            (11) Recommendations for closures and realignments should \n        be carried out only with the consent of Congress, which has the \n        constitutional responsibility to ``raise and support Armies,'' \n        ``provide and maintain a Navy,'' ``make Rules for the \n        Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,'' and \n        ``provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the \n        Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed \n        in the Service of the United States''.\n    (b) Limitations on Base Closure and Realignment Activities.--\nSection 2687 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``at which at \n                least 300 civilian personnel are authorized to be \n                employed'';\n                    (B) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:\n            ``(2) any realignment with respect to any military \n        installation involving a reduction in the number of military \n        and civilian personnel authorized to be employed at such \n        military installation at the time the Secretary of Defense \n        notifies Congress under subsection (b) of the Secretary's \n        proposal to close or realign such installation by more than the \n        lesser of--\n                    ``(A) 100;
