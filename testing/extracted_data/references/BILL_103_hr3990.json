FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that.--\n            (1) rape and sexual assaults continue to be serious threats \n        to the safety of communities across America;\n            (2) sexual offenders are much more likely than any other \n        category of criminals to repeat their crimes again and again, \n        even after serving time in prison; and\n            (3) the average rape sentence is just 10\\1/2\\ years, and \n        the average time served is half of that, approximately 5 years.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) States should more seriously consider the relatively \n        high recidivism rate of sexual offenders when deciding whether \n        to plea bargain with a first-time sexual offender and whether \n        to grant parole to sexual offenders; and\n            (2) States should review their treatment and parole \n        supervision programs for sexual offenders to assure that these \n        programs are fulfilling their goals, and, if they are not, \n        these programs should be immediately replaced or abandoned.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL JURISDICTION OVER RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES.\n\n    Section 2241 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(e) Punishment for Sexual Predators.--(1) Whoever, in a \ncircumstance described in paragraph (2) of this subsection--\n            ``(A) violates this section; or\n            ``(B) engages in conduct, in or affecting interstate or \n        foreign commerce, that would be a violation of subsection (a), \n        (b), or (c) of this section, if the offense had occurred in the \n        special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United \n        States;\nshall be imprisoned for life.\n    ``(2) The circumstance referred to in paragraph (1) of this \nsubsection is that the defendant has previously been convicted of \nanother State or Federal offense for conduct which--\n            ``(A) is an offense under this section or section 2242 of \n        this title; or\n            ``(B) would have been an offense under either of such \n        sections if the offense had occurred in the special maritime or \n        territorial jurisdiction of the United States.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
