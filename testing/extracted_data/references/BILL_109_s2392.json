FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Under the oppressive rule of the Taliban, the women of \n        Afghanistan were denied the most basic human rights, including \n        the rights to work, to an education, to health care, and to \n        move freely.\n            (2) Women who attempted to assert their rights under the \n        Taliban regime were subjected to beatings and imprisonments, \n        and many suffer from the long-term consequences of such \n        oppression.\n            (3) Women in Afghanistan have one of the highest mortality \n        rates in the world, with an estimated 16,000 maternal deaths \n        annually.\n            (4) Despite efforts by the United States Government and the \n        international community to improve the lives of women and girls \n        in Afghanistan, many women and girls continue to lack access to \n        basic services, including health care and education. \n        Approximately 80 percent of Afghan women are illiterate.\n            (5) Today, women and girls in Afghanistan still face \n        oppression resulting from violence and intimidation by Taliban \n        and other militia groups. In recent months, there has been a \n        significant increase in the number of attacks against girls' \n        schools in an attempt to prevent women and girls from regaining \n        their rights and freedoms.\n            (6) The strengthening of institutions and nongovernmental \n        organizations that are led by women in Afghanistan is essential \n        to building civil society and holding the Government of \n        Afghanistan accountable for protecting women's rights and human \n        rights.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the protection of the rights of women and girls in \n        Afghanistan and their full participation in the reestablishment \n        of democracy are essential to the reconstruction of a stable \n        and democratic Afghanistan, and to achieve such a \n        reconstruction, the United States Government must commit \n        resources to advance the rights of women throughout \n        Afghanistan;\n            (2) the United States Government should provide strong \n        support for the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs and the \n        Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, both of which were \n        created by the Agreement on Provisional Agreements in \n        Afghanistan Pending the Establishment of Permanent Governing \n        Institutions, done in Bonn December 5, 2001 (commonly known as \n        the ``Bonn Agreement'') to remedy past violations of women's \n        rights and human rights and to establish institutions and \n        programs to ensure policies that advance such rights;\n            (3) the United States Government should make it a priority \n        to provide assistance to Afghan-led nongovernmental \n        organizations, particularly Afghan women-led nonprofit \n        organizations; and\n            (4) grants and assistance to Afghanistan shall be \n        conditioned upon the Government of Afghanistan adhering to \n        international standards for women's rights and human rights.\n\nSEC. 4. ASSISTANCE TO WOMEN AND GIRLS.\n\n    Section 103(a)(7) of the Afghan Freedom Support Act of 2002 (22 \nU.S.C. 7513(a)(7)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking clauses (i) through \n        (xii) and inserting the following:\n                            ``(i) to provide equipment, medical \n                        supplies, and other assistance to health care \n                        facilities for the purpose of reducing maternal \n                        and infant mortality and morbidity;\n                            ``(ii) to establish and expand programs to \n                        provide services to women and girls suffering \n                        from posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, \n                        and mental illness;\n                            ``(iii) to protect and provide services to \n                        vulnerable populations, including widows, \n                        orphans, and women head of households;\n                            ``(iv) to establish primary and secondary \n                        schools for girls that include mathematics, \n                        science, and languages in their primary \n                        curriculum;\n                            ``(v) to expand technical and vocational \n                        training programs to enable women to support \n                        themselves and their families;\n                            ``(vi) to maintain and expand adult \n                        literacy programs, including economic literacy \n                        programs that promote the well-being of women \n                        and their families;\n                            ``(vii) to provide special educational \n                        opportunities for girls whose schooling was \n                        ended by the Taliban and who now face obstacles \n                        to participating in the normal education \n                        system, such as girls who are now married and \n                        girls who are older than the normal age for \n                        their classes;\n                            ``(viii) to disseminate information \n                        throughout Afghanistan on the rights of women \n                        and on international standards for human \n                        rights;\n                            ``(ix) to provide information and \n                        assistance to enable women to exercise \n                        property, inheritance, and voting rights, and \n                        to ensure equal access to the judicial system;\n                            ``(x) to monitor and investigate violations \n                        of women's rights and to provide legal \n                        assistance to women who have suffered \n                        violations of their rights;\n                            ``(xi) to increase political and civil \n                        participation of women in all levels of \n                        society, including the criminal justice system;\n                            ``(xii) to provide information and training \n                        related to women's rights and human rights to \n                        military, police, and legal personnel;
