    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Waste Terrorist Threat \nAssessment and Protection Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City, \n        Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania were the deadliest and \n        costliest terrorist attacks against the United States in its \n        history, resulting in the deaths of over 3,000 people at the \n        World Trade Center, Pentagon, and Pennsylvania crash site.\n            (2) The economic and cleanup costs as a result of the \n        September 11 terrorist attacks are estimated at $1,000,000,000 \n        in New York City alone.\n            (3) The attacks have resulted in massive economic \n        disruption to the United States. The New York Stock Exchange's \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 12 percent and the \n        NASDAQ market dropped 11.7 percent within the first 2 weeks \n        after the attacks.\n            (4) The September 11 attacks represent a dramatic expansion \n        in the ability of terrorists to inflict massive damage, \n        including the wide-scale loss of human life and economic \n        disruption to the United States and the world.\n            (5) Terrorists are willing to use any and all methods to \n        bring about their desire to destroy human life and property.\n            (6) The terrorists who attacked the United States have \n        demonstrated their willingness and desire to target innocent \n        civilians.\n            (7) Terrorists can be expected to continue to improve their \n        destructive capabilities. Their networks have become more \n        sophisticated and resourceful in carrying out heinous acts of \n        destruction.\n            (8) Since its inception in March 2002, the threat alert has \n        consistently been at an ``elevated'' level, reaching a level of \n        ``high'' 4 times.\n            (9) To counter this threat, the United States should take \n        every reasonable step, consistent with the principles upon \n        which this country was founded, to restrict terrorists' ability \n        to inflict damage against the United States.\n            (10) Instead of making the United States safer, the \n        proposed Yucca Mountain Project, as currently designed, would \n        give terrorists an obvious huge, easy-to-attack target that, at \n        any point, could cause massive economic and civilian casualties \n        within the United States.\n            (11) The Yucca Mountain Project proposes to ship 77,000 \n        tons of deadly high-level radioactive nuclear waste throughout \n        the United States over the next 30 to 40 years. High-level \n        radioactive nuclear waste is one of the most toxic substances \n        known to mankind.\n            (12) While there is concern about the potential terrorist \n        attacks directed against spent fuel stored at nuclear \n        facilities, exponentially more radioactive waste would be \n        stored, including potentially above ground, at Yucca Mountain, \n        than at any existing nuclear facility, making Yucca Mountain an \n        inviting target for terrorism.\n            (13) The waste would be transported by rail and by truck \n        through at least 43 States, through hundreds of cities and \n        towns, and through more than 360 congressional districts.\n            (14) Findings of the Nevada State Nuclear Projects Agency \n        demonstrate that a July 18, 2001, train accident in a Baltimore \n        tunnel created a fire situation that would have been hot enough \n        to breach a nuclear waste cask and release a cloud of suspended \n        radioactive particles. Such findings conclude that this type of \n        contamination would spread over 33 square miles, cost more than \n        $13,000,000,000 to clean up, and cause up to 31,824 cancer-\n        related deaths.\n            (15) At almost every stage of the Yucca Mountain Project, \n        high-level radioactive nuclear waste would be very vulnerable \nto terrorist attacks. Terrorists could attack or steal the waste as it \ntravels on our roads, highways, railways, or waterways, as it is stored \nor moved at intermodal storage facilities or storage depots, or at the \nproposed repository itself.\n            (16) The United States Government, in attempting to \n        implement the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, has not \n        sufficiently addressed the threat of terrorist attacks.\n            (17) The Department of Energy has failed to address the \n        Yucca Mountain Project's vulnerability to terrorism and \n        sabotage, intrusions, trespassing, vandalism, arson, and bomb-\n        related incidents, as expressed by the State of Nevada and \n        independent researchers throughout the country. As a result, \n        the Department of Energy has failed to discuss or provide any \n        plan for prevention and response to terrorist attacks directed \n        at Yucca Mountain.\n            (18) The Department of Energy's current methodology for \n        assessing risks seriously underestimates those associated with \n        sabotage and terrorism against radioactive shipments, waste \n        stored at intermodal storage facilities or storage depots, and \n        at Yucca Mountain itself.\n            (19) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the agency in \n        charge of protecting public health and safety and the \n        environment from the harmful effects of nuclear waste, has not \n        revised its rules regarding the transportation of nuclear waste \n        since the early 1970s. The antiquated rules do not address \n        modern-day threats and weapons, nor the increased risk posed by \n        today's most violent and maniacal terrorists.\n\nSEC. 3. YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT VULNERABILITY AND DEFENSE PLAN.\n\n    The Secretary of Homeland Security shall coordinate the development \nand implementation of an interagency plan, in conjunction with \nappropriate Federal, State, and local agencies and with public input, \nto prepare for and defend against Federal crimes of terrorism targeting \nany aspect of the Yucca Mountain Project.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RECOMMENDATION.\n\n    The Secretary of Energy shall not submit a license application \nunder section 114(b) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. \n10134(b)), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall not issue any \nlicense for a repository at Yucca Mountain under section 114(d) of the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10134(d)), unless--\n            (1) the interagency plans required under sections 3 and 4 \n        are completed and included in the final environmental impact \n        statement for Yucca Mountain, and all rules and recommendations \n        implemented completely;\n            (2) public hearings have been held for all affected \n        populations;\n            (3) the Secretary has certified that all facets of the \n        Yucca Mountain Project are not vulnerable to Federal crimes of \n        terrorism; and\n            (4) the Secretary of Homeland Security has prepared and \n        transmitted to the Congress a report on the potential liability \n        costs and damages resulting from a wide range of Federal crimes \n        of terrorism against the Yucca Mountain Project.\n\nSEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Federal crime of terrorism'' has the meaning \n        given that term in section 2332b(g)(5) of title 18, United \n        States Code; and\n            (2) the term ``Yucca Mountain Project'' means all aspects \n        of the high-level nuclear waste repository currently being \n        studied at Yucca Mountain.
