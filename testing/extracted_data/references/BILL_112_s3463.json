By 2020, \n        States will spend an estimated $83,000,000,000 on individuals \n        with diabetes or pre-diabetes.\n            (2) The National Diabetes Prevention Program, as \n        established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n        has been proven to reduce the onset of diabetes in at-risk \n        adults by 58 percent, using a cost-effective, community-based \n        intervention.\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \nNational Diabetes Prevention Program presents an opportunity for States \nto reduce the incidence of diabetes among individuals enrolled in their \nMedicaid programs."
