    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Retailers and Entertainers Lacey \nImplementation and Enforcement Fairness Act'' or the ``RELIEF Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Amendments to the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 were \n        enacted as part of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of \n        2008 (Public Law 110-246).\n            (2) The 2008 amendments were intended to level the playing \n        field for American businesses engaged in the responsible \n        harvest, shipment, manufacture, and trade of plants and plant \n        products whose prices had been undercut by a black market \n        fueled by irresponsible and illegal taking of protected plants \n        around the globe.\n            (3) The 2008 amendments were overly broad and their \n        enforcement as enacted could criminalize actions of a good-\n        faith owner, purchaser, or retailer of a plant or plant \n        product, subjecting them to penalties that include forfeiture, \n        fines, and imprisonment.\n            (4) Sanctions for violating the 2008 amendments should be \n        proportional to the act in violation. An individual who is not \n        in the commercial shipping business should not be held to the \n        same standard of compliance under that Act.\n            (5) Individuals fear that they risk incurring those \n        penalties by merely owning or traveling with a vintage musical \n        instrument, antique furniture, or another wood product.\n            (6) The Department of the Interior and Department of \n        Justice have stated ``people who unknowingly possess a musical \n        instrument or other object containing wood that was illegally \n        taken, possessed, transported or sold in violation of law and \n        who, in the exercise of due care would not have known that it \n        was illegal, do not have criminal exposure.''.\n            (7) It is necessary to clarify the 2008 amendments so that \n        legally harvested new plant products can enter the market \n        place.\n            (8) Declaration requirements for plant products imported or \n        manufactured prior to May 22, 2008, are unreasonable since the \n        sourcing of plant products was not previously required by law.\n            (9) Federal law enforcement officials should not engage in \n        overzealous enforcement action under the 2008 amendments.\n            (10) It is important to ensure that the appropriate \n        agencies have the necessary funding to implement the current \n        phases of the declaration requirement before considering any \n        future phases.\n            (11) The appropriate agencies have the responsibility of \n        providing a publicly accessible database so that everyone can \n        be notified of the foreign laws of countries as they apply to \n        the importation of plants.\n\nSEC. 3.
