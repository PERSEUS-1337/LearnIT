FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) chimpanzees are the only great apes currently used in \n        invasive research in the United States;\n            (2)(A) as of the date of introduction of this Act, there \n        are approximately 1,000 chimpanzees housed in laboratories in \n        the United States;\n            (B) more than \\1/2\\ of these chimpanzees are owned by the \n        Federal Government; and\n            (C) the vast majority are financially supported by the \n        Federal Government;\n            (3) great apes are highly intelligent and social animals;\n            (4) research laboratory environments involving invasive \n        research cannot meet the complex physical, social, and \n        psychological needs of great apes;\n            (5) invasive research performed on great apes, and the \n        breeding, housing, maintenance, and transport of great apes for \n        these purposes, are economic in nature and substantially affect \n        interstate commerce;\n            (6) maintaining great apes in laboratories costs the \n        Federal Government more than caring for great apes in suitable \n        sanctuaries that are specifically designed to provide adequate \n        lifetime care for great apes; and\n            (7) the National Research Council report entitled \n        ``Chimpanzees in Research--Strategies for their Ethical Care, \n        Management, and Use'' concluded that--\n                    (A) there is a ``moral responsibility'' for the \n                long-term care of chimpanzees used for scientific \n                research;\n                    (B) there should be a moratorium on further \n                chimpanzee breeding;\n                    (C) euthanasia should not be used as a means to \n                control the size of the great ape population; and\n                    (D) sanctuaries should be created to house \n                chimpanzees in a manner consistent with high standards \n                of lifetime care, social enrichment, and cognitive \n                development.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) phase out invasive research on great apes and the use \n        of Federal funding of such research, both within and outside of \n        the United States;\n            (2) prohibit the transport of great apes for purposes of \n        invasive research;\n            (3) prohibit the breeding of great apes for purposes of \n        invasive research; and\n            (4) require the provision of lifetime care of great apes \n        who are owned by or under the control of the Federal Government \n        in a suitable sanctuary through the permanent retirement of the \n        apes.\n\nSEC. 3.
