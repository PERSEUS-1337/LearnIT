Compensation paid for a \nperiod after the former member's separation, but before the former \nmember resides in the household, shall not be recouped. If the former \nmember subsequently ceases to reside in such household before the end \nof the period of eligibility for such payments, the Secretary may not \nresume such payments.\n    ``(3) In a case in which the victim of the dependent-abuse offense \nresulting in the separation of the former member was a dependent child, \nthe Secretary concerned may not pay compensation under this section to \na spouse or former spouse who would otherwise be eligible to receive \nsuch compensation if the Secretary determines (under regulations \nprescribed under subsection (i)) that the spouse or former spouse was \nan active participant in the conduct constituting the dependent-abuse \noffense.\n    ``(h) Coordination of Benefits.--The Secretary concerned may not \nmake payments to a spouse or former spouse under both this section and \nsection 1408(h)(1) of this title.
