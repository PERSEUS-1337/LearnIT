FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Child welfare service providers, both individuals and \n        organizations, have the inherent, fundamental, and inalienable \n        right to free exercise of religion protected by the United \n        States Constitution.\n            (2) The right to free exercise of religion for child \n        welfare service providers includes the freedom to refrain from \n        conduct that conflicts with their sincerely held religious \n        beliefs.\n            (3) Most States provide government-funded child welfare \n        services through various charitable, religious, and private \n        organizations.\n            (4) Religious organizations, in particular, have a lengthy \n        and distinguished history of providing child welfare services \n        that predates government involvement.\n            (5) Religious organizations have long been and should \n        continue contracting with and receiving grants from \n        governmental entities to provide child welfare services.\n            (6) Religious organizations cannot provide certain child \n        welfare services, such as foster-care or adoption placements, \n        without receiving a government contract, grant or license.\n            (7) Religious organizations display particular excellence \n        when providing child welfare services.\n            (8) Children and families benefit greatly from the child \n        welfare services provided by religious organizations.\n            (9) Governmental entities and officials administering \n        federally funded child welfare services in some States, \n        including Massachusetts, California, Illinois, and the District \n        of Columbia, have refused to contract with religious \n        organizations that are unable, due to sincerely held religious \n        beliefs or moral convictions, to provide a child welfare \n        service that conflicts, or under circumstances that conflict, \n        with those beliefs or convictions; and that refusal has forced \n        many religious organizations to end their long and \n        distinguished history of excellence in the provision of child \n        welfare services.\n            (10) Ensuring that religious organizations can continue to \n        provide child welfare services will benefit the children and \n        families that receive those federally funded services.\n            (11) States also provide government-funded child welfare \n        services through individual child welfare service providers \n        with varying religious and moral convictions.\n            (12) Many individual child welfare service providers \n        maintain sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions \n        that relate to their work and should not be forced to choose \n        between their livelihood and adherence to those beliefs or \n        convictions.\n            (13) Because governmental entities provide child welfare \n        services through many charitable, religious, and private \n        organizations, each with varying religious beliefs or moral \n        convictions, and through diverse individuals with varying \n        religious beliefs or moral convictions, the religiously \n        impelled inability of some religious organizations or \n        individuals to provide certain services will not have a \n        material effect on a person's ability to access federally \n        funded child welfare services.\n            (14) The activities of funding and administering these \n        child welfare services substantially affect interstate \n        commerce.\n            (15) Taking adverse actions against child welfare service \n        providers that are unable, due to their sincerely held \n        religious beliefs or moral convictions, to provide certain \n        services (or provide services under certain circumstances) \n        substantially affects interstate commerce.\n            (16) The provisions of this Act are remedial measures that \n        are congruent and proportional to protecting the constitutional \n        rights of child welfare service providers guaranteed under the \n        Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n            (17) Congress has the authority to pass this Act pursuant \n        to its spending clause power, commerce clause power, and \n        enforcement power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment \n        to the United States Constitution.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To prohibit governmental entities from discriminating \n        or taking an adverse action against a child welfare service \n        provider on the basis that the provider declines to provide a \n        child welfare service that conflicts, or under circumstances \n        that conflict, with the sincerely held religious beliefs or \n        moral convictions of the provider.\n            (2) To protect child welfare service providers' exercise of \n        religion and to ensure that governmental entities will not be \n        able to force those providers, either directly or indirectly, \n        to discontinue all or some of their child welfare services \n        because they decline to provide a child welfare service that \n        conflicts, or under circumstances that conflict, with their \n        sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.\n            (3) To provide relief to child welfare service providers \n        whose rights have been violated.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCRIMINATION AND ADVERSE ACTIONS PROHIBITED.\n\n    (a) The Federal Government, and any State that receives federal \nfunding for any program that provides child welfare services under part \nB or part E of title IV of the Social Security Act (and any \nsubdivision, office or department of such State) shall not discriminate \nor take an adverse action against a child welfare service provider on \nthe basis that the provider has declined or will decline to provide, \nfacilitate, or refer for a child welfare service that conflicts with, \nor under circumstances that conflict with, the provider's sincerely \nheld religious beliefs or moral convictions.\n    (b) Subsection (a) does not apply to conduct forbidden by paragraph \n(18) of section 471(a) of such Act.\n\nSEC. 4. FUNDS WITHHELD FOR VIOLATION.\n\n    The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall withhold from a \nState 15 percent of the federal funds the State receives for a program \nthat provides child welfare services under part B or part E of title IV \nof the Social Security Act if the State violates section 3 when \nadministering or disbursing funds under such program.\n\nSEC. 5. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.\n\n    (a) A child welfare service provider aggrieved by a violation of \nsection 3 may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial \nproceeding and obtain all appropriate relief, including declaratory \nrelief, injunctive relief, and compensatory damages, with respect to \nthat violation.\n    (b) A child welfare service provider that prevails in an action by \nestablishing a violation of section 3 is entitled to recover reasonable \nattorneys' fees and costs.\n    (c) By accepting or expending federal funds in connection with a \nprogram that provides child welfare services under part B or part E of \ntitle IV of the Social Security Act, a State waives its sovereign \nimmunity for any claim or defense that is raised under this section.\n\nSEC. 6. SEVERABILITY.\n\n    If any provision of this Act, or any application of such provision \nto any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the \nremainder of this Act and the application of the provision to any other \nperson or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\nSEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    (a) The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the 1st \nday of the 1st fiscal year beginning on or after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and the withholding of funds authorized by \nsection 4 shall apply to payments under parts B and E of such Act for \ncalendar quarters beginning on or after such date.\n    (b) If legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) is \nrequired for a governmental entity to bring itself into compliance with \nthis Act, the governmental entity shall not be regarded as violating \nthis Act before the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter beginning after \nthe first regular session of the legislative body that begins after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act. For purposes of the preceding \nsentence, if the governmental entity has a 2-year legislative session, \neach year of the session is deemed to be a separate regular session.\n\nSEC. 8.
