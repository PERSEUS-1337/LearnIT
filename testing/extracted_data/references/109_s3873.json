SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RURAL AMERICA.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The founders realized the fundamental importance of \n        property rights when they codified the Takings Clause of the \n        Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which requires that \n        private property shall not be taken ``for public use, without \n        just compensation''.\n            (2) Rural lands are unique in that they are not \n        traditionally considered high tax revenue-generating properties \n        for State and local governments. In addition, farmland and \n        forest land owners need to have long-term certainty regarding \n        their property rights in order to make the investment decisions \n        to commit land to these uses.\n            (3) Ownership rights in rural land are fundamental building \n        blocks for our Nation's agriculture industry, which continues \n        to be one of the most important economic sectors of our \n        economy.\n            (4) In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. \n        City of New London, abuse of eminent domain is a threat to the \n        property rights of all private property owners, including rural \n        land owners.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the use of \neminent domain for the purpose of economic development is a threat to \nagricultural and other property in rural America and that the Congress \nshould protect the property rights of Americans, including those who \nreside in rural areas. Property rights are central to liberty in this \ncountry and to our economy. The use of eminent domain to take farmland \nand other rural property for economic development threatens liberty, \nrural economies, and the economy of the United States. The taking of \nfarmland and rural property will have a direct impact on existing \nirrigation and reclamation projects. Furthermore, the use of eminent \ndomain to take rural private property for private commercial uses will \nforce increasing numbers of activities from private property onto this \nNation's public lands, including its National forests, National parks \nand wildlife refuges. This increase can overburden the infrastructure \nof these lands, reducing the enjoyment of such lands for all citizens. \nAmericans should not have to fear the government's taking their homes, \nfarms, or businesses to give to other persons. Governments should not \nabuse the power of eminent domain to force rural property owners from \ntheir land in order to develop rural land into industrial and \ncommercial property. Congress has a duty to protect the property rights \nof rural Americans in the face of eminent domain abuse.\n\nSEC. 8.
