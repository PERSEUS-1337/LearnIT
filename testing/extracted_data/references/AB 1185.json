($1,000,000).\n(b) The governing board, for projects over one million dollars ($1,000,000), before December 31, 2020, may use the best value procurement method in accordance with this article.\n(c) The bidder may be selected on the basis of the best value to the governing board of the school district. In order to implement this method of selection, the governing board of the school district shall adopt and publish procedures and required guidelines for evaluating the qualifications of the bidders that ensure the best value selections by the school district are conducted in a fair and impartial manner. These procedures and guidelines shall conform to this article and shall be mandatory for the school district when using best value selection.\n(d) If the governing board of the school district deems it to be for the best interest of the school district, the governing board of the school district, on the refusal or failure of the selected bidder for a project to execute a tendered contract, may award it to the bidder with the second lowest best value score. If the second bidder fails or refuses to execute the contract, the governing board of the school district may likewise award it to the bidder with the third lowest best value score.\n(e) The governing board of the school district shall let any contract for a project pursuant to this article to the selected bidder that represents the best value or else reject all bids.\n(f) (1) If the school district elects to award a project pursuant to this section, retention proceeds withheld by the district from the selected best value contractor shall not exceed 5 percent if a performance and payment bond, issued by an admitted surety insurer, is required in the solicitation of bids.\n(2) In a contract between the selected best value contractor and a subcontractor, and in a contract between a subcontractor and any subcontractor thereunder, the percentage of the retention proceeds withheld shall not exceed the percentage specified in the contract between the district and the selected best value contractor.

Information submitted by the bidder as part of the evaluation process shall not be open to public inspection to the extent that information is exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code).\n(2) A best value entity shall not be prequalified or shortlisted unless the entity provides an enforceable commitment to the governing board that the entity and its subcontractors at every tier will use a skilled and trained workforce to perform all work on the project or contract that falls within an apprenticeable occupation in the building and construction trades.\n(3) An entity\u2019s commitment that a skilled and trained workforce will be used to perform the project or contract may be established by any of the following:\n(A) The entity\u2019s agreement with the school district that the entity and its subcontractors at every tier will comply with the requirements of this subdivision and that the entity will provide the governing board of the school district with evidence, on a monthly basis while the project or contract is being performed, that the entity and its subcontractors are complying with the requirements of this subdivision.\n(B) If the governing board has entered into a project labor agreement that will bind all contractors and subcontractors performing work on the project or contract and that includes the requirements of this subdivision, the entity\u2019s agreement that it will become a party to that project labor agreement.\n(C) Evidence that the entity has entered into a project labor agreement that includes the requirements of this subdivision and that will bind the entity and all its subcontractors at every tier performing the project or contract.\n(c) Each solicitation for bids shall do all of the following:\n(1) Invite prequalified bidders to submit sealed bids in the manner prescribed by this article.\n(2) Include a section identifying and describing the following:\n(A) Criteria that the school district will consider in evaluating the qualifications of the bidders.\n(B) The methodology and rating or weighting system that will be used by the school district in evaluating bids.\n(C) The relative importance or weight assigned to the criteria for evaluating the qualifications of bidders identified in the request for bids.\n(d) Final evaluation of the bidders shall be done in a manner that prevents the identity of the bidders and the cost or price information from being revealed in evaluating the qualifications of the bidders prior to completion of qualification scoring.\n20119.4.\nSelection of the best value contractor shall be made as follows:\n(a) (1) The school district shall evaluate the qualifications of the bidders based solely upon the criteria set forth in the solicitation documents, and shall assign a qualification score to each bid.\n(2) Qualification scores shall be determined by using only the criteria and selection procedures specifically identified in the request for proposals. The following minimum factors, however, shall be weighted as deemed appropriate by the school district:\n(A) Relevant experience.\n(B) Safety record.\n(C) Other factors identified in the request for proposal.\n(b) To determine the best value contractor, the school district shall divide each bidder\u2019s price by its qualifications score. A preference of up to 5 percent shall be applied to the price of a bid submitted by a small business, as defined by the school district, before dividing the bidder\u2019s price by its qualification score. The lowest resulting cost per quality point will represent the best value bid. The award of the contract shall be made to the bidder whose bid is determined, by the school district in writing, to be the best value to the school district.\n(c) The school district shall issue a written decision of its contract award or else reject all bids.\n(d) Upon issuance of a contract award, the school district shall publicly announce its award identifying the project, the project price, the best value contractor to which the award is made, as well as the prices, qualification scores, and resulting costs per qualification point for all responsive bidders. The contract file shall include documentation sufficient to support the decision to award.\n20119.5.\n(a) (1) A school district that uses the best value procurement method pursuant to this article shall submit to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature an interim and final report on the use of the best value procurement method. The reports shall be prepared by an independent third party and the school district shall pay for the cost of the report. The reports shall be submitted to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature as follows:\n(A) An interim report on or before July 1, 2018.\n(B) A final report on or before January 1, 2020.\n(2) A report shall include, but is not limited to, the following information:\n(A) A description of the projects awarded using the best value procedures.\n(B) The contract award amounts.\n(C) The best value contractors awarded the projects.\n(D) A description of any written protests concerning any aspect of the solicitation, bid, or award of the best value contracts, including the resolution of the protests.\n(E) A description of the prequalification process.\n(F) The criteria used to evaluate the bids, including the weighting of the criteria and an assessment of the effectiveness of the methodology.\n(G) If a project awarded under this article has been completed, an assessment of the project performance, to include a summary of any delays or cost increases.\n(b) The requirement for submitting a report imposed pursuant to subdivision (a) is inoperative on January 1, 2021, pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code.\n20119.6.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this article, the best value procurement method is not intended to change any guideline, criterion, procedure, or requirement of the governing board of the school district to let a contract for a project to the lowest responsible bidder or else reject all bids.\n20119.7.\nThis article shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends that date.\nSEC. 2.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the need to establish a pilot project for the Los Angeles Unified School District to determine the potential benefits and consequences of using best value procurement to facilitate infrastructure improvements and ease fiscal impacts."
