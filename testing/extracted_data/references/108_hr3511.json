    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Video Programming Consumer Privacy \nProtection Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The personal privacy of Americans in the digital age is \n        of increasing concern to consumers and public policy must \n        strive to keep up with changes in technology.\n            (2) The cable television industry has long provided video \n        programming to millions of consumers over cable systems capable \n        of collecting personal information about a subscriber's viewing \n        habits.\n            (3) Congress recognized the growing threat to personal \n        privacy posed by the emerging cable system-based technology and \n        in 1984 enacted privacy protections contained in section 631 of \n        the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 551), to safeguard \n        the personal privacy of American consumers when they utilize \n        any service over a cable system.\n            (4) Under these rules, cable television operators utilizing \n        their cable facilities to offer television programming, pay-\n        per-view services, or telecommunications services, such as \n        broadband access to the Internet, must protect the personal \n        privacy of subscribers and are prohibited from disclosing \n        personal data without the prior written or electronic consent \n        of subscribers.\n            (5) In addition, the Video Privacy Protection Act (18 \n        U.S.C. 2710) prohibits a video rental or sales outlet from \n        disclosing personal information regarding what video tapes a \n        consumer rents or buys without the informed, written consent of \n        the consumer.\n            (6) Since these personal privacy protections were enacted \n        by Congress, other technology has arrived that provides \n        services to consumers that are similar to those provided by \n        cable operators and video rental outlets.\n            (7) For example, direct broadcast satellite providers \n        (``DBS providers''), such as DirecTV and Echostar, now boast 20 \n        million subscribers nationwide and these satellite-based \n        services compete with cable operators on the array of services \n        that cable operators typically offer.\n            (8) In addition, over 1 million consumers now subscribe to \n        fast-growing digital video recording services, such as those \n        provided by companies such as Tivo and Replay TV, which, like \n        cable operators and DBS providers, possess the ability to \n        gather information from consumers about a consumer's use of the \n        system, including an individual consumer's television viewing \n        habits.\n            (9) While DBS providers and providers of digital video \n        recording services offer consumers services similar to those \n        offered by cable operators over cable systems, competitors \n        utilizing these technologies do not currently have to comply \n        with the privacy protections in section 631 because such \n        provisions apply only to cable operators.\n            (10) Consistent with the policy endorsed by Congress in \n        enacting the Telecommunications Act of 1996 of regulating \n        entities based upon the service which is provided rather than \n        the technology used to deliver that service, the public \n        interest compels that privacy protections for consumers should \n        be consistently applied irrespective of who the provider is, or \n        what technology they employ to deliver services to consumers.\n            (11) While DBS providers and providers of digital video \n        recording services have not announced plans to or record the \n        personal viewing habits or gather other personal data from a \n        consumer's use of their services, the public interest would be \n        served by requiring comparable privacy protections for American \n        consumers.\n\nSEC. 3. PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended by adding at \nthe end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 715.
