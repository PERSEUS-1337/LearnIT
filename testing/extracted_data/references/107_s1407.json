    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Critical Infrastructures Protection \nAct of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Information revolution has transformed the conduct \n        of business and the operations of government as well as the \n        infrastructure relied upon for the defense and national \n        security of the United States.\n            (2) Private business, government, and the national security \n        apparatus increasingly depend on an interdependent network of \n        critical physical and information infrastructures, including \n        telecommunications, energy, financial services, water, and \n        transportation sectors.\n            (3) A continuous national effort is required to ensure the \n        reliable provision of cyber and physical infrastructure \n        services critical to maintaining the national defense, \n        continuity of government, economic prosperity, and quality of \n        life in the United States.\n            (4) This national effort requires extensive modeling and \n        analytic capabilities for purposes of evaluating appropriate \n        mechanisms to ensure the stability of these complex and \n        interdependent systems, and to underpin policy recommendations, \n        so as to achieve the continuous viability and adequate \n        protection of the critical infrastructure of the nation.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) that any physical or virtual disruption of the \n        operation of the critical infrastructures of the United States \n        be rare, brief, geographically limited in effect, manageable, \n        and minimally detrimental to the economy, essential human and \n        government services, and national security of the United \n        States;\n            (2) that actions necessary to achieve the policy stated in \n        paragraph (1) be carried out in a public-private partnership \n        involving corporate and non-governmental organizations; and\n            (3) to have in place a comprehensive and effective program \n        to ensure the continuity of essential Federal Government \n        functions under all circumstances.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL COMPETENCE FOR CRITICAL \n              INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION.\n\n    (a) Support of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Continuity by \nNational Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center.--\n            (1) In general.--The National Infrastructure Simulation and \n        Analysis Center (NISAC) shall provide support for the \n        activities of the President's Critical Infrastructure \n        Protection and Continuity Board under Executive Order ____.\n            (2) Particular support.--The support provided for the Board \n        under paragraph (1) shall include the following:\n                    (A) Modeling, simulation, and analysis of the \n                systems comprising critical infrastructures, including \n                cyber infrastructure, telecommunications \n                infrastructure, and physical infrastructure, in order \n                to enhance understanding of the large-scale complexity \n                of such systems and to facilitate modification of such \n                systems to mitigate the threats to such systems and to \n                critical infrastructures generally.\n                    (B) Acquisition from State and local governments \n                and the private sector of data necessary to create and \n                maintain models of such systems and of critical \n                infrastructures generally.\n                    (C) Utilization of modeling, simulation, and \n                analysis under subparagraph (A) to provide education \n                and training to members of the Board, and other \n                policymakers, on matters relating to--\n                            (i) the analysis conducted under that \n                        subparagraph;\n                            (ii) the implications of unintended or \n                        unintentional disturbances to critical \n                        infrastructures; and\n                            (iii) responses to incidents or crises \n                        involving critical infrastructures, including \n                        the continuity of government and private sector \n                        activities through and after such incidents or \n                        crises.\n                    (D) Utilization of modeling, simulation, and \n                analysis under subparagraph (A) to provide \n                recommendations to members of the Board and other \n                policymakers, and to departments and agencies of the \n                Federal Government and private sector persons and \n                entities upon request, regarding means of enhancing the \n                stability of, and preserving, critical infrastructures.\n            (3) Recipient of certain support.--Modeling, simulation, \n        and analysis provided under this subsection to the Board shall \n        be provided, in particular, to the Infrastructure \n        Interdependencies committee of the Board under section 9(c)(8) \n        of the Executive Order referred to in paragraph (1).\n    (b) Activities of President's Critical Infrastructure Protection \nand Continuity Board.--The Board shall provide to the Center \nappropriate information on the critical infrastructure requirements of \neach Federal agency for purposes of facilitating the provision of \nsupport by the Center for the Board under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 5. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``critical infrastructure'' means systems and \nassets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that \nthe incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a \ndebilitating impact on national security, national economic security, \nnational public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There is hereby authorized for the Department of Defense for fiscal \nyear 2002, $8,000,000 for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency for \nactivities of the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis \nCenter under section 4 in that fiscal year."
