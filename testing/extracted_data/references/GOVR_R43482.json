    "content": "Funding for federal programs that is provided through the annual appropriations process in regular appropriations acts is typically available for obligation during a single fiscal year, unless otherwise specified. This period of availability most often begins on the first day of the fiscal year of the appropriations act (October 1), also referred to as the \"budget year.\" For example, appropriations provided by the FY2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-289 ), which was enacted on September 29, 2006, were generally available for obligation and expenditure on October 1, 2006, the first day of FY2007, and remained available through September 30, 2007. However, a delayed period of availability that begins after the start of the fiscal year, or even during a future fiscal year, may be provided for particular programs that are funded through the annual appropriations process. Delayed periods of availability are typically provided to meet specific budgetary needs related to the purpose or structure of a program. Some of the reasons to provide such periods of availability may be more broadly applicable, such as to prevent a funding shortfall late in the fiscal year or a funding gap in the following fiscal year. Although only a comparatively small number of individual programs receive funds that are available during such periods, many of these programs have a large number of beneficiaries. For example, portions of the Medicaid program, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and Department of Education formula grants are funded for delayed periods of availability.  The statutory authority for a particular delayed period of availability may derive from provisions authorizing a particular program, those that provide appropriations to fund it, or a combination of the two. Under congressional rules, a statutory authorization of such a period of availability must precede an appropriation for those purposes. A program's authorizing statute may specifically address such a period of availability in the authorization of appropriations or address it more generally in the provisions that govern the program. If the authorizing statute itself does not suggest a delayed schedule for the funds, the legislative history associated with that statute could anticipate that such funds will be provided. Another possibility is that Congress could decide to use a delayed period of availability during the annual appropriations process even if the program's authorization or associated legislative history is silent as to timing of future funds or only authorizes a schedule that is aligned with the budget year. On the other hand, even when the authorization anticipates that funds will be available for a delayed period, appropriations may subsequently be provided on a schedule that is aligned with the budget year. In either instance, the period of availability associated with the appropriations would be controlling. A variety of approaches have been used during the annual appropriations process to provide funds that become available at some point after the beginning of the fiscal year. These include, but are not limited to, the three periods of availability: \"advance appropriations,\" \"forward funding,\" and \"advance funding.\" Advance appropriations become available for obligation starting at least one fiscal year after the budget year. Forward funding becomes available beginning late in the budget year and is carried into at least one following fiscal year. A dvance funding is funding for the following fiscal year that becomes available for obligation late in the budget year and would be in addition to the funds for that fiscal year. Any expenditure of advance funds is counted as part of the following fiscal year's appropriation. These particular periods of availability as compared to annual appropriations are illustrated in Figure 1 . While these three delayed periods of availability all share some similarities, they are distinct concepts in three regards due to the timing of the funds. First, advance appropriations become available after the end of the budget year, whereas forward funds become available during the budget year. Second, advance appropriations become available at some point after the budget year has ended, whereas advance funds are available only during the budget year. Third, forward funds are available into the following fiscal year, whereas advance funds expire once the budget year ends.  Although advance appropriations, forward funding, and advance funding are each discrete concepts, they tend to have some degree of variation in how they are implemented, including the interval in advance for which funds are provided and the duration of availability for those funds. For example, advance appropriations may be provided one or two fiscal years prior to when they become available for obligation and be available during a single fiscal year or multiple fiscal years or with no fiscal year limitation. In addition, a program may receive funds on a combination of timetables.  Providing funds for a delayed period of availability may have budget process implications for Congress. Funds provided for such periods are generally subject to both procedural and statutory budget enforcement, and their budgetary effects are attributed (or \"scored\") to particular fiscal years for such purposes. Since FY2001, the budget resolution has also imposed limits for the House and Senate on advance appropriations for discretionary spending. For FY2014, these limits were established through the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act (Division A, H.J.Res. 59 ). As was previously mentioned, congressional rules require a statutory authorization that allows a delayed period of availability to precede an appropriation for those purposes. If a delayed period of availability for a program is not authorized by existing law, providing funding in a general appropriations bill or amendment thereto for such a period may subject that bill or amendment to a point of order.  This report examines concepts, practices, and procedural implications associated with the particular delayed periods of availability described above. The following three sections discuss the origins, relevant budgetary concepts, and practices associated with advance appropriations, forward funding, and advance funding. The fourth section explains the budget process implications that are associated with these funding approaches. The scope of this report is generally restricted to an analysis of advance appropriations, forward funding, and advance funding in the context of the budget process. The program-specific considerations and potential consequences of these funding approaches are not discussed. For information on particular programs, see the CRS reports on those issue areas. Advance appropriations is a form of budget authority that becomes available one or more fiscal years after the budget year covered by the appropriations act. For example, in an appropriations act for FY2016, funds would generally become available for obligation on October 1, 2015. Advance appropriations in the FY2016 act would not become available until the start of FY2017 or later.  According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), advance appropriations were first provided in 1962 for grants-in-aid that funded airport construction. Other early uses included grants for urban renewal and the Department of Education. Currently, this period of availability is used for a wide variety of programs funded by discretionary and appropriated mandatory spending.  Perhaps the most significant implication of advance appropriations relates to funding gaps. The congressional budget process currently requires that annual appropriations be enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year (October 1). If such appropriations are not enacted by that time, one or more continuing resolutions (CRs) may be enacted to prevent a funding gap from occurring until regular appropriations are completed or the fiscal year ends. Programs that are funded through the appropriations process are at risk of a funding gap at the beginning of the fiscal year if annual appropriations or a CR is not enacted or at any point during the fiscal year when a CR expires and has not been replaced by a further CR or annual appropriations. However, if a program's appropriations for all or part of a fiscal year are enacted in the previous year's appropriations act, the program might not experience a funding gap, assuming that such appropriations were available during that period and were unexpended.  A related implication, but one that is more generally associated with a program's annual operations, is that advance appropriations may enable that program to avoid the need for any continuing appropriations during periods when the regular appropriations bills for that fiscal year have not yet been enacted. The potential consequences of CRs on program operations have been noted by a variety of observers, including funding levels, program delivery, management support, and revenue collection. The extent to which a program has previously been provided advance appropriations that are available at the start of a fiscal year, that program would not be reliant on funding that would otherwise be provided through a CR.  Some have argued that programs that receive advance appropriations may be better able to engage in advance planning. Enacting funding for a program in advance may enable it to make long-term commitments related to its internal operations or the population that it serves. Similarly, advance appropriations may assist agencies in planning and carrying out multi-year capital expenditures by spreading the cost over a number of fiscal years. However, others argue that the ability to make such commitments may be limited by the extent to which programmatic needs can be forecasted in advance. Congress may also prefer to exercise control over programs through regular annual appropriations in certain circumstances. Advance appropriations are typically enacted at an interval of one fiscal year prior to when such appropriations become available. For example, FY2013 funds for the \"medical facilities\" (VHA\u2014Department of Veterans Affairs) account were provided one year in advance in the FY2012 appropriations act:  For necessary expenses for the maintenance and operation of hospitals, nursing homes, domiciliary facilities, and other necessary facilities of the Veterans Health Administration; for administrative expenses in support of planning, design, project management, real property acquisition and disposition, construction, and renovation of any facility under the jurisdiction or for the use of the Department; for oversight, engineering, and architectural activities not charged to project costs; for repairing, altering, improving, or providing facilities in the several hospitals and homes under the jurisdiction of the Department, not otherwise provided for, either by contract or by the hire of temporary employees and purchase of materials; for leases of facilities; and for laundry services, $5,441,000,000 , plus reimbursements, shall become available on October 1, 2012, and shall remain available until September 30, 2013 . Less frequently, accounts receive advance appropriations for the second fiscal year succeeding the budget year of the appropriations law in which they are enacted. For example, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting account received FY2014 appropriations two years in advance in the FY2012 appropriations act: For payment to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (referred to in this Act as \"CPB\"), as authorized by the Communications Act of 1934, an amount which shall be available within limitations specified by that Act, for the fiscal year 2014, $445,000,000 . Because advance appropriations are defined by when they make funds first available for obligation, a range of options exists under recent practice for the duration of their availability\u2014from one quarter of the fiscal year to no fiscal year limitation. For example, the advance appropriation for the \"payments for foster care and permanency\" (Administration for Children and Families\u2014Department of Health and Human Services) account was available for the first quarter of the fiscal year only: For making payments to States or other non-Federal entities under title IV-E of the Social Security Act, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, $2,100,000,000. A further example of a no-year advance appropriation was the Public and Indian Housing\u2014tenant-based rental assistance (Department of Housing and Urban Development) account: For activities and assistance for the provision of tenant-based rental assistance authorized under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.) (\"the Act\" herein), not otherwise provided ... $4,000,000,000, to remain available until expended, shall be available on October 1, 2012 .  For accounts that receive advance appropriations, the amount of budget authority that will be available once the fiscal year commences is sometimes adjusted in subsequent appropriations acts. In some instances, an account is appropriated some funds a year in advance, and then the remainder of the funds are appropriated for the budget year. Those advance appropriated funds provided through the prior appropriations act may be reduced through a rescission. In the example below, which was excerpted in the prior subsection, the account for Public and Indian Housing\u2014tenant-based rental assistance (Department of Housing and Urban Development) received additional funding to the prior year's advance in the budget year plus an advance appropriation for the succeeding fiscal year:  For activities and assistance for the provision of tenant-based rental assistance authorized under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.) (\"the Act\" herein), not otherwise provided for, $14,914,369,000, to remain available until expended, shall be available on October 1, 2011 (in addition to the $4,000,000,000 previously appropriated under this heading that became available on October 1, 2011), and $4,000,000,000, to remain available until expended, shall be available on October 1, 2012 .  An additional provision in this appropriations act also adjusted downward the amount that was advance appropriated in the FY2011 appropriations act. Of the unobligated balances remaining from funds appropriated under the heading \"Tenant-Based Rental Assistance\" under the \"Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011\", $650,000,000 are rescinded from the $4,000,000,000 which are available on October 1, 2011 . As an effect of these provisions, the amount of new budget authority available for this account as of October 1, 2011, was the $4,000,000,000 advance appropriation plus the $14,914,369,000 budget year appropriation minus the $650,000,000 rescission for a total of $18,264,369,000. Forward funding is a period of availability that begins during the last quarter of the budget year and continues into at least the following fiscal year. For example, in an appropriations bill for FY2016, budget authority that is forward funded would become available during FY2016 but not until July 1, 2016, or later and would remain available through all or part of FY2017. This budget authority is often available for a period of more than 12 months, in which case it can be classified as multi-year budget authority but may also be provided in shorter increments.  While the first use of forward funding is unknown, the modern practice appears to have begun around the same time as the change in the federal fiscal year from July 1 to October 1, which occurred in fiscal year 1976. As a consequence of this new schedule, the ability to obligate funds for certain activities became difficult, for example, if the activities required obligations to be made in the summer and remain available through the fall. At least partially in response to this issue, some programs were provided forward funding to allow such obligations to occur during the summer months and the funds to remain available into the following fiscal year. Under current practice, this period of availability is used only for programs that are funded by discretionary spending.  The main implication associated with forward funding relates to the seasonal timing of obligations that it may enable. The following two departments currently receive forward funding.  1. The Department of Education, for the largest formula grant programs to states; and 2. The Department of Labor, for vocational training programs. These particular programs require significant obligations during the summer to prepare for activities that coincide with the school year. Although advance appropriations might enable these programs to plan ahead based on those budgetary resources, such advance appropriations could not be obligated until they became available at the beginning of the fiscal year. Forward funding part or all of a program, in contrast, allows for obligations to occur up to three months prior to that time so that the availability of funds coincides with the program year.  Forward funds tend to become available at an interval that starts on July 1. Funds are available during at least two fiscal years, but the duration of these funds may be for one year or multiple years, depending on whether the funds are available for more or fewer than 12 months. For example, the Community Service Employment for Older Americans (Employment and Training Administration\u2014Department of Labor) account provided funds for one-year duration (12 months): To carry out title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (referred to in this Act as \"OAA\"), $449,100,000, which shall be available for the period July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013 . In contrast, funds of a multi-year duration (15 months) were provided by the School Improvement Programs (Department of Education) account: For carrying out school improvement activities authorized by parts A and B of title II, part B of title IV, parts A and B of title VI, and parts B and C of title VII of the ESEA; the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act; section 203 of the Educational Technical Assistance Act of 2002; the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003; and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, $4,550,018,000, of which $2,725,246,000 shall become available on July 1, 2012, and remain available through September 30, 2013 . While forward funding is sometimes provided as the only schedule of availability for an account, it is typically combined with either budget year or advance appropriations. This allows for only the portion of the program that requires summer obligations to be funded in this manner, while the remaining aspects can be funded through regular annual or advance appropriations. For example, the Office of Job Corps (Employment and Training Administration\u2014Department of Labor) account contained both forward funding and annual appropriations: To carry out subtitle C of title I of the WIA, including Federal administrative expenses, the purchase and hire of passenger motor vehicles, the construction, alteration, and repairs of buildings and other facilities, and the purchase of real property for training centers as authorized by the WIA, $1,706,171,000, plus reimbursements, as follows: (1) $1,572,049,000 for Job Corps Operations, which shall be available for the period July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013 ;  (2) $104,990,000 for construction, rehabilitation and acquisition of Job Corps Centers, which shall be available for the period July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2015 ... and  (3) $29,132,000 for necessary expenses of the Office of Job Corps, which shall be available for obligation for the period October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012 . Forward funding combined with advance appropriations was provided by the Education for the Disadvantaged (Department of Education) account: For carrying out title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (referred to in this Act as \"ESEA\") and section 418A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (referred to in this Act as \"HEA\"), $15,750,983,000, of which $4,817,117,000 shall become available on July 1, 2012, and shall remain available through September 30, 2013 , and of which $10,841,177,000 shall become available on October 1, 2012, and shall remain available through September 30, 2013 , for academic year 2012-2013. Advance funding is a form of budget authority provided for a small number of accounts that allows for additional obligations late in the budget year that are counted as a part of the succeeding fiscal year's funding. In essence, advance funds have three defining characteristics. First, advance funds are provided for an account in addition to the appropriation for the budget year in that account. Second, advance funds become available only after the budget year has begun, usually during the last two months of that year, and are no longer available once the budget year ends. Third, any expenditure of the advance funds is directed in the appropriations act to be charged to the succeeding fiscal year's appropriation. For example, an appropriations act for FY2016 provides $100 million for an account in annual appropriations and additional budget authority for such sums as may be necessary for obligations after September 1, 2016. Legislative language in that account further directs that any expenditure of the \"such sums\" budget authority is to be charged to the next fiscal year's appropriation for FY2017. At the end of FY2016, the obligations of the advance funds total $1 million. Subsequent appropriations for FY2017 total $100 million plus advance funding for that account, and the $1 million in obligations of the FY2016 advance funding is charged against that $100 million for FY2016. Effectively, then, FY2017 budget authority for new obligations is $99 million plus the advance funds for FY2017. As with forward funding, the first time that advance funds were provided in an appropriations act is not known. Provisions that display the essential characteristics of advance funding date back to at least FY1967, when such additional funds were provided for the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees and Ex-Servicemen account. Historically, advance funding has tended to be provided for certain accounts that fund payments based on an entitlement formula. The practice of providing for such entitlements through advance funding, as opposed to other funding mechanisms, appears to be a legacy of earlier funding practices that pre-date the current conceptualization of budget enforcement and execution. It has limited application in the present day, as only two accounts currently receive advance funding: 1. Office of Workers Compensation Programs\u2014Special Benefits (Department of Labor); and 2. Federal Unemployment Benefits and Allowances (Employment and Training Administration\u2014Department of Labor). The total amount of payments that are funded by these and similar accounts may be particularly sensitive to changes in eligible beneficiaries or difficult to predict more than a year in advance. In such instances, providing extra funds that become available late in the fiscal year might lessen or eliminate the potential for a funding shortfall and the need for separate supplemental appropriations. However, because any obligations of such funds must be charged to the succeeding fiscal year, any use of this budget authority technically reduces base appropriations that are available in that future year.  Both the date of initial availability and consequent duration of the advance funds for the two accounts vary slightly. The first account, Office of Workers Compensation Programs\u2014Special Benefits (Department of Labor), is provided advance funds for about the last seven weeks of the fiscal year: For the payment of compensation, benefits, and expenses (except administrative expenses) accruing during the current or any prior fiscal year authorized by 5 U.S.C. 81; continuation of benefits as provided for under the heading \"Civilian War Benefits\" in the Federal Security Agency Appropriation Act, 1947; the Employees' Compensation Commission Appropriation Act, 1944; sections 4(c) and 5(f) of the War Claims Act of 1948; and 50 percent of the additional compensation and benefits required by section 10(h) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, $350,000,000, together with such amounts as may be necessary to be charged to the subsequent year appropriation for the payment of compensation and other benefits for any period subsequent to August 15 of the current year. The second account, Federal Unemployment Benefits and Allowances (Employment and Training Administration\u2014Department of Labor), which funds the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers program, is provided advance funds for about the last two weeks of the fiscal year: For payments during fiscal year 2012 of trade adjustment benefit payments and allowances under part I of subchapter B of chapter 2 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974, and section 246 of that Act; and for training, employment and case management services, allowances for job search and relocation, and related State administrative expenses under part II of subchapter B of chapter 2 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974, including benefit payments, allowances, training, employment and case management services, and related State administration provided pursuant to section 231(a) of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2011, $1,100,100,000, together with such amounts as may be necessary to be charged to the subsequent appropriation for payments for any period subsequent to September 15, 2012. Using a delayed period of availability to fund a program may also have budget process implications. These implications derive from scorekeeping rules that govern the fiscal year to which such funds are attributed for the purposes of budget enforcement. The congressional budget resolution has also imposed various limits on advance appropriations for discretionary spending since FY2001. For FY2014 and FY2015, these limits were established in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. If a delayed period of availability has not been authorized by law, making funds available on such a schedule in a general appropriations bill or amendment thereto may subject it to a point of order under House and Senate rules. Both statutory processes and congressional procedures enable previously agreed-upon fiscal goals to be enforced, both during the consideration of budgetary measures and once they have been enacted. This enforcement is based upon estimated budgetary effects that are attributed (i.e., \"scored\") by fiscal year. Under longstanding scorekeeping guidelines, new budget authority is attributed to the first fiscal year that it is available for obligation. Consequently, advance appropriations are not scored against the budget year covered by the bill in which they are enacted but instead against the first fiscal year for which they are provided (one or more years after the budget year). Forward funding, in contrast, is scored against the budget year of the bill in which it is enacted, because it becomes available during the budget year. Similarly, because advance funding is for mandatory spending, CBO attributes the total projected budget authority and outlays that will be required for the budget year to that account.  Congress has imposed procedural controls to limit the overall level of advance appropriations in response to concerns that such appropriations may affect future budgetary resources and that they might be used to circumvent other budgetary controls. Between FY1991 and FY2002, statutory spending limits restricted the amount of discretionary spending for each fiscal year. Because budget authority is scored against the first year it is available, advance appropriations could be enacted for future fiscal years that would not count against the current fiscal year's limits. Previously enacted advance appropriations would, however, count against those limits if they were first available during that budget year. As a consequence, some observers became concerned that an increase in the use of advance appropriations could affect flexibility in future budgetary decisions. Because of this, the FY2001 budget resolution, and every budget resolution thereafter, has contained provisions limiting future advance appropriations. The first limits on advance appropriations created points of order on the House and Senate floor against the consideration of future legislation that would enact such appropriations above a specified dollar amount. These provisions also provided procedures for a supermajority waiver and appeal in the Senate. Similar restrictions were in the FY2002 budget resolution, which also included new provisions exempting advance appropriations for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from these limits. The FY2004 and FY2006 budget resolutions both carried similar language to FY2002, except that advance appropriations were further restricted to a list of eligible accounts. In FY2008 and FY2009, the House discontinued the exemption for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, although the Senate continued to include it in its procedures for advance appropriations. The FY2010 budget resolution added the Department of Veterans Affairs for the Medical Services, Medical Support and Compliance, and Medical Facilities accounts of the Veterans Health Administration to the list of accounts that were explicitly exempt in the House and Senate from the advance appropriations cap.  Although the House and Senate did not agree on a budget resolution for FY2011, FY2012, FY2013, or FY2014, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (Division A, H.J.Res. 59 , 113 th Congress) reinstated procedural limits on advance appropriations in the House and the Senate. Section 112 of the Bipartisan Budget Act limited the aggregate total of advance appropriations in the Senate for FY2015 and FY2016. Section 113 deemed the provisions of the House-adopted version of the budget resolution ( H.Con.Res. 25 ) to be enforceable in the House for the remainder of the 113 th Congress, including the provisions therein that limit FY2015 advance appropriations (Section 601).  Most recently, the FY2016 budget resolution ( S.Con.Res. 11 ) imposed separate procedural limits for the House and Senate on advance appropriations. The form of the limit in the House was the same as the FY2014 limit associated with the Bipartisan Budget Act. The form of the Senate restriction, however, differed from previous fiscal years in that it was specific to advance appropriations in discretionary accounts.  The full text of the provisions limiting advance appropriations since FY2001 is provided in the Appendix . As was previously discussed, delayed periods of availability for funds can be established either in the corresponding authorization law or through the annual appropriations process. The way in which such schedules are established has implications for points of order related to legislating on appropriations.  Both House and Senate Rules contain provisions that restrict the content of appropriations measures. In general, such rules restrict the inclusion of appropriations not previously authorized by law or other \"legislative provisions\" that have the effect of changing existing law under certain circumstances. Precedents associated with these rules may prohibit advance appropriations or forward funding when it is not authorized by law. House precedents generally prohibit appropriations for durations that are beyond the fiscal year covered by the bill, such as appropriations that are made \"available until expended,\" except when \"existing law can be interpreted to permit that availability.\" Because both advance appropriations and forward funds are by definition available for a duration that is beyond the budget year, it appears that these periods of availability would need to be authorized, or at least permitted, by law in order for such subsequent appropriations to be in order under House rules. Senate precedents are more ambiguous. However, as was the case for the House, those that prohibit no-year appropriations when no authorization for such availability exists may be applicable to advance appropriations and forward funding.  There appear to be no House or Senate precedents that directly address the issue of advance funding. Such provisions could be considered to be legislative if they are determined to improperly restrict the timing of expenditures, the authority for which has been conferred under existing law to both the Office of Management and Budget and the agency.  On this and other matters, the rules of the House and Senate are not self-enforcing. A Member must raise a point of order against a measure or amendment to trigger the procedures described above. In addition, the House may waive clause 2(b) and (c) of Rule XXI through the adoption of a special rule, unanimous consent, or suspension of the rules. The Senate, likewise, may waive paragraphs (2) and (4) of Rule XVI through unanimous consent or suspension of the rules. FY2001 (H.Con.Res. 290) SEC. 203. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF BUDGETARY LIMITS.
