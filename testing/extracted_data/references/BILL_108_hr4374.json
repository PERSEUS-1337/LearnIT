FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The past decade has been a turbulent time for health \n        care facilities and nurses.\n            (2) Recent research published in the Journal of the \n        American Medical Association has shown that registered nurse \n        staffing levels have a significant impact on preventable deaths \n        in hospitals, and that the odds of patient mortality increase 7 \n        percent for every additional patient added to the average \n        registered nurse's workload.\n            (3) Recent research supported by the Agency for Health Care \n        Research and Quality, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n        Services, and the National Institute for Nursing Research shows \n        that inadequate registered nurse staffing is directly related \n        to serious complications such as pneumonia, upper \n        gastrointestinal bleeding, and urinary tract infections, as \n        well as failure to stop deaths caused by shock, cardiac arrest, \n        sepsis, and deep vein thrombosis in hospitalized patients.\n            (4) The Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare \n        Organizations recently reported that inadequate nurse staffing \n        contributes to nearly a quarter of all unexpected incidents \n        that kill or injure hospitalized patients.\n            (5) The Institute of Medicine has reported that both \n        nursing-to-resident staffing levels and the ratio of \n        professional nurses to other nursing personnel are important \n        indicators of high quality of care, and that the participation \n        of registered nurses in direct care giving and in the provision \n        of hands-on guidance to nurse assistants is positively \n        associated with quality of care in nursing facilities.\n            (6) Recent research conducted by the Centers for Medicare & \n        Medicaid Services found strong, objective proof that nurse \n        staffing in nursing homes is directly related to quality \n        measures such as sepsis, urinary tract infections, incidence of \n        pressure sores, resisting care improvement, and weight loss.\n            (7) As a payer for inpatient and outpatient hospital \n        services for individuals entitled to benefits under the \n        medicare and medicaid programs established under titles XVIII \n        and XIX of the Social Security Act, the Federal Government has \n        a compelling interest in promoting the safety of such \n        individuals by requiring providers participating in such \n        programs to provide these individuals with information \n        regarding nurse staffing levels.\n\nSEC. 3. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF STAFFING AND OUTCOMES DATA.\n\n    (a) Disclosure of Staffing and Outcomes.--Any provider under the \nmedicare program shall, as a condition of continued participation in \nsuch program, make publicly available information regarding nurse \nstaffing and patient outcomes as specified by the Secretary.

This information shall \n        be expressed both in raw numbers, in terms of total hours of \n        nursing care per patient (including adjustment for case mix and \n        acuity), and as a percentage of nursing staff, and shall be \n        broken down in terms of the total nursing staff, each unit, and \n        each shift.\n            (3) Numbers of unlicensed personnel utilized to provide \n        direct patient care. This information shall be expressed both \n        in raw numbers and as a percentage of nursing staff and shall \n        be broken down in terms of the total nursing staff, each unit, \n        and each shift.\n            (4) The average number of patients per registered nurse, \n        licensed practical nurse, or unlicensed personnel providing \n        direct patient care.
