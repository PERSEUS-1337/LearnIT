FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On January 12, 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.0 on the \n        Richter magnitude scale struck the country of Haiti.\n            (2) According to the United States Geological Survey \n        (USGS)--\n                    (A) the earthquake epicenter was located \n                approximately 15 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, the \n                capital of Haiti; and\n                    (B) the earthquake was followed by 59 aftershocks \n                of magnitude 4.5 or greater, the most severe measuring \n                6.0.\n            (3) According to the Government of Haiti, more than 316,000 \n        people died as a result of the earthquake, including 103 \n        citizens of the United States and more than 100 United Nations \n        personnel.\n            (4) According to the United Nations and the International \n        Organization for Migration--\n                    (A) an estimated 3,000,000 people were directly \n                affected by the disaster, nearly one-third of the \n                country's population; and\n                    (B) more than 2,100,000 people were displaced from \n                their homes to settlements.\n            (5) Casualty numbers and infrastructure damage, including \n        to roads, ports, hospitals, and residential dwellings, place \n        the earthquake as the worst cataclysm to hit Haiti in over two \n        centuries and, proportionally, one of the world's worst natural \n        disasters in modern times.\n            (6) The Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) conducted by \n        the Government of Haiti, the United Nations, the World Bank, \n        the Inter-American Development Bank, and other experts \n        estimates that damage and economic losses totaled \n        $7,804,000,000, approximately 120 percent of Haiti's gross \n        domestic product in 2009.\n            (7) Haiti is the poorest, least developed country in the \n        Western Hemisphere with, prior to the earthquake--\n                    (A) more than 70 percent of Haitians living on less \n                than $2 per day; and\n                    (B) a ranking of 149 out of 182 countries on the \n                United Nations Human Development Index.\n            (8) House Resolution 1021, which was passed on January 21, \n        2010, on a vote of 411 to 1 expressed--\n                    (A) the House of Representatives' ``deepest \n                condolences and sympathy for the horrific loss of \n                life'' caused by the earthquake; and\n                    (B) bipartisan support for Haiti's recovery and \n                reconstruction.\n            (9) The initial emergency response of the men and women of \n        the United States Government, led by the United States Agency \n        for International Development and United States Southern \n        Command, was swift and resolute.\n            (10) United States urban search and rescue (USAR) teams \n        were immediately activated after the earthquake and deployed \n        from Fairfax County, Virginia, Los Angeles County, California, \n        Miami-Dade, Florida, the City of Miami, Florida, and Virginia \n        Beach, Virginia, to assist the United States Agency for \n        International Development (USAID) Disaster Assistance Response \n        Team (DART), and New York City's first responders asked the \n        Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to activate a \n        New York City urban search and rescue shortly thereafter.\n            (11) A month after the earthquake, the House of \n        Representatives unanimously passed House Resolution 1059 which \n        expressed gratitude to these USAR units, and highlighted that \n        the 511 United States rescue workers comprised roughly one-\n        third of the entire international USAR effort in Haiti, and \n        more than 130 people were rescued from under the rubble in \n        Haiti by these units.\n            (12) Individuals, businesses, and philanthropic \n        organizations across the United States and throughout the \n        international community responded in support of Haiti and its \n        populace during this crisis, sometimes in innovative ways such \n        as fundraising through text messaging.\n            (13) The Haitian diaspora in the United States, which was \n        integral to emergency relief efforts--\n                    (A) has annually contributed significant monetary \n                support to Haiti through remittances; and\n                    (B) continues to seek opportunities to partner with \n                the United States Agency for International Development \n                and other agencies to substantively contribute to the \n                reconstruction of Haiti.\n            (14) Significant challenges still remain in Haiti as it \n        works to recover and rebuild.\n            (15) According to the International Organization for \n        Migration, approximately 680,000 people remain in spontaneous \n        and organized camps in Haiti.\n            (16) According to numerous nongovernmental organizations \n        and United States contractors, the pace of reconstruction has \n        lagged significantly behind the original emergency relief \n        phase.\n            (17) The widespread irregularities that occurred in the \n        elections held in Haiti on November 28, 2010, led to outbursts \n        of violence which undermined the recovery efforts.\n            (18) On October 21, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was \n        detected in the Lower Artibonite region.\n            (19) Initial efforts to contain the epidemic were disrupted \n        by Hurricane Tomas and resulting widespread flooding, which led \n        to the spreading and entrenchment of the disease throughout the \n        country.\n            (20) According to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and \n        Population, as of March 28, 2011--\n                    (A) approximately 4,766 people have died from \n                cholera; and\n                    (B) approximately 270,991 have been infected from \n                the disease.\n            (21) According to the Pan American Health Organization and \n        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cholera could \n        spread to as many as 400,000 people within the first year of \n        the epidemic, potentially causing 7,600 deaths at the current \n        case fatality rate.\n            (22) The United States has provided more than $62,523,017 \n        worth of assistance to combat the cholera epidemic, including \n        by assisting with stockpiling health commodities, equipping \n        cholera treatments centers, providing public information, and \n        improving water and sanitation systems.\n            (23) The efforts to combat the cholera epidemic have helped \n        to drive the mortality rate from cholera down from nearly 7 \n        percent to 1.7 percent of all contracted cases as of February \n        25, 2011.\n            (24) Throughout the series of crises, the people of Haiti \n        continue to demonstrate unwavering resilience, dignity, and \n        courage.\n            (25) On March 20, 2011, presidential and parliamentary \n        elections were held in Haiti without major disruptions or \n        problems.\n            (26) At the international donors conference ``Towards a New \n        Future for Haiti'' held on March 31, 2010, 59 donors pledged \n        over $5,000,000,000 to support Haiti.\n            (27) The United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for \n        Haiti estimates that nearly $1,900,000,000 has been disbursed, \n        with an additional amount of approximately $2,000,000,000 \n        committed.\n            (28) Haiti will need the support of the international \n        community in order to confront the ongoing cholera epidemic and \n        to promote reconstruction and development.\n\nSEC. 3.
