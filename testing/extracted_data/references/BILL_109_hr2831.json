IMPROVEMENTS IN BENEFIT ACCRUAL STANDARDS.\n\n    (a) Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n1974.--\n            (1) Rules relating to reduction in accrued benefits because \n        of attainment of any age.--Section 204(b)(1)(H) of the Employee \n        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. \n        1054(b)(1)(H)) is amended by adding at the end the following \n        new clauses:\n    ``(vii)(I) A plan complies with clause (i) if a participant's \nentire accrued benefit, as determined as of any date under the formula \nfor determining benefits as set forth in the text of the plan \ndocuments, would be equal to or greater than that of any similarly \nsituated, younger individual.\n    ``(II) For purposes of this clause, an individual is similarly \nsituated to a participant if such individual is identical to such \nparticipant in every respect (including period of service, \ncompensation, position, date of hire, work history, and any other \nrespect) except for age.\n    ``(III) In determining the entire accrued benefit for purposes of \nthis clause, the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit \n(including any early retirement subsidy that is fully or partially \nincluded or reflected in an employee's opening balance or other \ntransition benefits) shall be disregarded.\n    ``(viii) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the \nrequirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan provides \nallowable offsets against those benefits under the plan which are \nattributable to employer contributions, based on benefits which are \nprovided under title II of the Social Security Act, the Railroad \nRetirement Act of 1974, or under any retirement program for officers or \nemployees of the Federal Government or of the government of any State \nor political subdivision thereof. For purposes of this clause, \nallowable offsets based on such benefits consist of offsets equal to \nall or part of the actual benefit payment amounts, reasonable \nprojections or estimations of such benefit payment amounts, or \nactuarial equivalents of such actual benefit payment amounts, \nprojections, or estimations (determined on the basis of reasonable \nactuarial assumptions).\n    ``(ix) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the \nrequirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan provides a \ndisparity in contributions or benefits with respect to which the \nrequirements of section 401(l) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are \nmet.\n    ``(x)(I) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the \nrequirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan provides for \npre-retirement indexing of accrued benefits under the plan.\n    ``(II) For purposes of this clause, the term `pre-retirement \nindexing' means, in connection with an accrued benefit, the periodic \nadjustment of the accrued benefit by means of the application of a \nrecognized index or methodology so as to protect the economic value of \nthe benefit against inflation prior to distribution.''.\n            (2) Determinations of accrued benefit as balance of benefit \n        account.--Section 203 of such Act (29 U.S.C. 1053) is amended \n        by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(f)(1) A defined benefit plan under which the accrued benefit \npayable under the plan upon distribution (or any portion thereof) is \nexpressed as the balance of an account maintained for the participant \nshall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subsection \n(a)(2) and section 205(g) solely because of the amount actually made \navailable for such distribution under the terms of the plan, in any \ncase in which--\n            ``(A) the applicable interest rate that would be required \n        to discount the participant's accrued benefit projected under \n        the terms of the plan to normal retirement age to a present \n        value equal to the amount actually made available for \n        distribution under the plan is not greater than\n            ``(B) a market rate of return.\n    ``(2) The Secretary of the Treasury may provide by regulation for \nrules governing the calculation of a market rate of return for purposes \nof paragraph (1) and for permissible methods of crediting interest to \nthe account (including variable interest rates) resulting in effective \nrates of return meeting the requirements of paragraph (1).''.\n    (b) Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.--\n            (1) Rules relating to reduction in accrued benefits because \n        of attainment of any age.--Subparagraph (H) of section \n        411(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n        continued accrual beyond normal retirement age) is amended--\n                    (A) by striking the heading and inserting the \n                following: ``Rules relating to reduction in accrued \n                benefits because of attainment of any age.--''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following:\n                            ``(vi) Comparison to similarly situated, \n                        younger individuals.--\n                                    ``(I) In
