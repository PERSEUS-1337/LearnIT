FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are more than 1,800,000 people in the United \n        States living with limb loss.\n            (2) Every year, there are more than 130,000 people in the \n        United States who undergo amputation.\n            (3) In addition, United States military personnel serving \n        in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world have sustained \n        traumatic injuries resulting in amputation.\n            (4) The number of amputations in the United States is \n        projected to increase in the years ahead due to rising \n        incidence of diabetes and other chronic illness.\n            (5) Those suffering from limb loss can and want to regain \n        their lives as productive members of society.\n            (6) Prosthetic devices enable amputees to continue working \n        and living productive lives.\n            (7) Insurance companies have begun to limit reimbursement \n        of prosthetic equipment costs at unrealistic levels or not at \n        all and often restrict coverage over a person's lifetime, which \n        shifts costs onto the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n            (8) Eleven States have addressed this problem and have \n        enacted prosthetic parity legislation.\n            (9) Prosthetic parity legislation has been introduced and \n        is being actively considered in 30 States.\n            (10) The States in which prosthetic parity laws have been \n        enacted have found there to be minimal or no increases in \n        insurance premiums and have reduced Medicare and Medicaid \n        costs.\n            (11) Prosthetic parity legislation will not add to the size \n        of government or to the costs associated with the Medicare or \n        Medicaid programs.\n            (12) If coverage for prosthetic devices and components are \n        offered by a group health insurance policy, then providing such \n        coverage of prosthetic devices on par with other medical and \n        surgical benefits will not increase the incidence of \n        amputations or the number of individuals for which a prosthetic \n        device would be medically necessary and appropriate.\n            (13) In States where prosthetic parity legislation has been \n        enacted, amputees are able to return to a productive life, \n        State funds have been saved, and the health insurance industry \n        has continued to prosper.\n            (14) Prosthetic services allow people to return more \n        quickly to their preexisting work.\n            (15) Spina bifida occurs in 7 out of every 10,000 live \n        births in the United States.\n            (16) For children with spina bifida, access to a custom \n        orthotic device impacts both their short and long term \n        mobility, their muscle strength, and overall quality of life. \n        As they mature, the orthotic device allows them to maintain \n        their maximum level of functionality. This has a profound \n        impact on their ability to become and remain independent and \n        productive members of the community.\n            (17) Cerebral palsy is one of the most common congenital \n        (existing before birth or at birth) disorders of childhood. \n        About 10,000 babies per year in the United States will develop \n        cerebral palsy.\n            (18) The purpose of a custom orthotic device for people \n        with cerebral palsy is to protect, such as stabilizing a \n        fracture during healing; to prevent deformity, such as \n        stretching braces worn while the person sleeps, to help prevent \n        muscle contractures; and to improve function. This can help \n        kids with cerebral palsy achieve maximum potential in growth \n        and development.\n            (19) If coverage for prosthetic and custom orthotic devices \n        and related services is offered to individuals by a group \n        health insurance policy, then providing such coverage of \n        prosthetic and orthotic devices on par with other medical and \n        surgical benefits will not increase the incidence of \n        amputations or the number of individuals for which a prosthetic \n        or custom orthotic device would be medically necessary and \n        appropriate.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require that each group \nhealth plan that provides both coverage for prosthetic devices and \ncomponents and medical and surgical benefits, provide such coverage \nunder terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the terms \nand conditions under which such benefits are provided under such plan.\n\nSEC. 3.
