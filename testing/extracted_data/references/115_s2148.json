FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) White supremacists and other right-wing extremists are \n        the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the \n        United States.\n            (2) A 2009 report from the Extremism and Radicalization \n        Branch of the Department of Homeland Security concluded ``that \n        lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing violent right-\n        wing extremist ideology are the most dangerous domestic \n        terrorism threat in the United States''.\n            (3) An unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin \n        from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of \n        Homeland Security found that ``white supremacist extremism \n        poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,'' and that \n        White supremacists ``were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 \n        attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic \n        extremist movement''.\n            (4) According to the New America Foundation, since \n        September 11, 2001, 76 Americans have died in terrorist attacks \n        by domestic extremists in the United States. 89 percent were \n        killed by far-right-wing extremists.\n            (5) The fatal attacks described in paragraph (4) include--\n                    (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh \n                gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a White \n                supremacist shot and killed 6 members of the gurdwara;\n                    (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish \n                community center and a Jewish assisted living facility \n                in Overland Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and \n                killed 3 civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager;\n                    (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, \n                in which 2 supporters of the far right-wing ``patriot'' \n                movement shot and killed 2 police officers and a \n                civilian;\n                    (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel \n                AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a \n                White supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the \n                church;\n                    (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a \n                Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, \n                Colorado, in which an anti-abortion extremist shot and \n                killed a police officer and 2 civilians;\n                    (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-\n                American man in New York City, allegedly committed by a \n                White supremacist who reportedly traveled to New York \n                ``for the purpose of killing black men'';\n                    (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, \n                in which a White supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men \n                and injured a third after the men defended 2 young \n                women whom the individual had targeted with anti-Muslim \n                hate speech; and\n                    (H) the August 12, 2017, attack in Charlottesville, \n                Virginia, in which a White supremacist allegedly killed \n                one and injured nineteen after driving his car through \n                a crowd of individuals protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and \n                of which Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does \n                meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our \n                statute.''.\n            (6) The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism found \n        that right-wing extremists were responsible for 150 terrorist \n        acts, attempted acts, and plots and conspiracies that took \n        place in the United States between 1993 and 2017. These attacks \n        resulted in the deaths of 255 people and injured more than 600.\n            (7) According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in 2015, \n        for the first time in 5 years, the number of hate groups in the \n        United States rose by 14 percent. The increase included a more \n        than twofold rise in the number of Ku Klux Klan chapters. The \n        number of anti-government militias and ``patriot'' groups also \n        grew by 14 percent in 2015.\n            (8) In November 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n        released its annual hate crime incident report, which found \n        that in 2016, hate crimes increased by almost 5 percent, \n        including a 19-percent rise in hate crimes against American \n        Muslims. Similarly, the previous year's report found that in \n        2015, hate crimes increased by 6 percent. Much of that increase \n        came from a 66-percent rise in attacks on American Muslims. In \n        both reports, race-based crimes were most numerous; more than \n        50 percent of those hate crimes targeted African Americans.\n            (9) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had \n        expressed anti-Muslim views was charged with murder for \n        allegedly killing 6 people and injuring nineteen in a shooting \n        rampage at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada. It was the first-\n        ever mass shooting at a mosque in North America, and Prime \n        Minister Trudeau labeled it a terrorist attack.\n            (10) Between January and July 2017, news reports found 63 \n        incidents in which American mosques were targeted by threats, \n        vandalism, or arson.\n\nSEC. 3.
