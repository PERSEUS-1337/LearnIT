SECRETARIAL STUDY.\n\n    Within 24 months after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in \nconsultation with the Administrator, the Secretary of the Department of \nLabor, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Commissioners of the \nUnited States Commission on Civil Rights, shall issue for public \ncomment a report identifying the nature and extent, if any, of acute \nand chronic impacts on human health in EHIAs as compared to other \ncounties. Such impacts shall include but not be limited to cancer, \nbirth deformities, infant mortality rates, and respiratory diseases. \nThe report shall be coordinated by the Administrator of the Agency for \nToxic Substances Disease Registry, who shall work closely with the \nDirectors of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, \nthe National Center for Health Statistics, and the Center for Disease \nControl, and shall seek to--\n            (1) isolate the impacts of environmental pollution;\n            (2) segregate the effects of other factors such as health \n        care availability or substance abuse or diet;\n            (3) rank the relative risks posed by the toxic chemicals \n        present in EHIAs and by the varied sources of toxic chemicals, \n        both individually and cumulatively;\n            (4) take into account the need to remedy the impacts of \n        pollution in high population density areas;\n            (5) evaluate the levels below which release of toxic \n        chemicals, either individually or cumulatively, must be reduced \n        to avoid adverse impacts on human health; and\n            (6) determine the impacts of uncontrolled releases.\nAs a result of the report in communities where the Administrator of the \nAgency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry has determined that \nadverse health impacts exist, the agency shall also make this \ninformation readily available to members of the community by providing \ninformation directly to the affected communities and tribal governments \nin the Environmental High Impact Areas about the release of toxic \nchemicals and the potential effects of such exposure.\n\nSEC. 402. LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE.\n\n    (a) Report.--If the report under section 401 identifies significant \nadverse impacts of environmental pollution on human health in EHIAs as \na group, the President shall submit to Congress within one year after \npublication of the report, proposed legislation to remedy and prevent \nsuch impacts. Such legislation shall include--\n            (1) expansion of EPCRA to include additional facilities, \n        additional chemicals, or reduced quantities of chemicals \n        triggering reporting obligations;\n            (2) means to redress regulatory loopholes (such as \n        recycling and industrial wastes exempt from regulation under \n        subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act and wastes subject \n        to lessened regulatory requirements); and\n            (3) measures such as taxes on uncontrolled or controlled \n        emissions, or restrictions on toxic chemical releasing \n        activities within an EHIA to induce source reduction in EHIAs, \n        regardless of whether facilities are in compliance with \n        existing law.\n    (b) Report on Changes and Recommendations.--Within 2 years after \npublication of the report, the Administrator shall provide a report to \nthe Congress which identifies all of the changes made or recommended to \nbe made to the Environmental Protection Agency's existing regulations, \nthe purpose for each change and the goals to be achieved as a result of \nthe substantive changes. The Administrator shall also advise Congress \nof the regulatory changes that were not made because of the presence of \nconflicting statutory mandates or the lack of statutory authority.\n    (c) Proposed Legislation.--Within 3 years after publication of the \nhealth impact study, the President shall submit to Congress proposed \nlegislation to remedy the problems of conflicting statutory mandates or \nthe lack of statutory authority identified in the report to Congress \npursuant to subsection (b).\n\nSEC. 403. MORATORIUM.\n\n    If the report under section 401 finds significant adverse impacts \nof environmental pollution on human health in EHIAs, there shall be a \nmoratorium on the siting or permitting of any new toxic chemical \nfacility in any EHIA shown to emit toxic chemicals in quantities found \nto cause significant adverse impacts on human health. A new toxic \nchemical facility may be cited or permitted in such an EHIA during this \nperiod only if--\n            (1) the need for the activity is shown to the Secretary;\n            (2) the owner or operator of the facility demonstrates that \n        the facility will develop a plan and maintain a comprehensive \n        pollution prevention program; and\n            (3) the facility demonstrates that it will minimize \n        uncontrolled releases into the environment.\nThe moratorium shall continue in effect in such an EHIA until the \nAdministrator determines, upon petition of any interested party, that \nthe health-based levels identified pursuant to section 401(5) have been \nattained at the EHIA."
