FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As noted in the 2006 Institute of Medicine report, \n        ``The Future of Emergency Care'', the availability of on-call \n        specialists is an acute problem in emergency departments and \n        trauma centers requiring attention to identified barriers such \n        as liability reform.\n            (2) Also acknowledged in the 2006 IOM report, emergency and \n        trauma care is delivered in an inherently challenging \n        environment, often requiring emergency physicians and trauma \n        surgeons to make life-and-death decisions with little time or \n        information or without a standing relationship with the \n        patient. For these reasons, physicians providing emergency and \n        trauma care face extraordinary exposure to medical liability \n        claims, which are far higher than for those physicians who do \n        not provide such care.\n            (3) Younger surgeons, who often take the on-call shifts at \n        trauma centers, are leaving States with the most severe \n        liability problems. For example, according to the Project on \n        Medical Liability in Pennsylvania, funded by the Pew Charitable \n        Trust, resident physicians in high-risk fields such as general \n        surgery and emergency medicine named malpractice costs as the \n        reason for leaving the State three times more often than any \n        other factor.\n            (4) Further, an American Hospital Association study found \n        that more than 50 percent of hospitals in medical liability \n        crisis States now have trouble recruiting physicians, and 40 \n        percent say the liability situation has resulted in less \n        physician coverage for their emergency departments. The crisis \n        has even forced the closure of trauma centers in Florida, \n        Mississippi, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia at various \n        times in recent years.\n            (5) Specialties that have experienced particularly high \n        premium increases, including neurosurgery, orthopaedics, and \n        general surgery, are also among those services that emergency \n        patients most frequently require.\n            (6) According to a report from the General Accountability \n        Office, soaring medical liability premiums have led specialists \n        to reduce or stop on-call services to hospital emergency \n        departments, seriously inhibiting patient access to emergency \n        surgical services.\n            (7) The Department of Health and Human Services' \n        congressionally created EMTALA technical advisory group (TAG) \n        recognized that professional liability insurance is a concern \n        for providers and that having protections would increase \n        coverage in the emergency department. The TAG recommended that \n        the Department of Health and Human Services act to support \n        amending the EMTALA statute to include liability protection for \n        hospitals, physicians, and other licensed independent \n        practitioners who provide services to patients covered by \n        EMTALA.\n\nSEC. 3. CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.\n\n    The constitutional authority upon which this Act rests is the power \nof the Congress to provide for the general welfare, to regulate \ncommerce, and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for \ncarrying into execution Federal powers, as enumerated in section 8 of \narticle I of the Constitution of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. PROTECTION FOR EMERGENCY AND RELATED SERVICES FURNISHED \n              PURSUANT TO EMTALA.\n\n    Section 224(g) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 233(g)) \nis amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (4), by striking ``An entity'' and \n        inserting ``Subject to paragraph (6), an entity''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(6)(A) For purposes of this section--\n                    ``(i) an entity described in subparagraph (B) shall \n                be considered to be an entity described in paragraph \n                (4);
