    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Extension services such as the Manufacturing Extension \n        Partnership and the Agricultural Extension Service have proven \n        to be effective public-private partnerships to integrate new \n        technologies and to improve utilization of existing \n        technologies by small to medium sized manufacturers and the \n        United States agricultural community.\n            (2) Undergraduate institutions of higher education working \n        with nonprofit organizations and State and Federal agencies can \n        tailor educational technology extension programs to meet \n        specific local and regional requirements.\n            (3) Undergraduate institutions of higher education, often \n        with the assistance of the National Science Foundation, have \n        during the past 20 years been integrating educational \n        technologies into their curriculums, and as such can draw upon \n        their own experiences to advise elementary and secondary school \n        educators on ways to integrate a variety of educational \n        technologies into the educational process.\n            (4) Many elementary and secondary school systems, \n        particularly in rural and traditionally underserved areas, lack \n        general information on the most effective methods to integrate \n        their existing technology infrastructure, as well as new \n        educational technology, into the educational process and \n        curriculum.\n            (5) Most Federal and State educational technology programs \n        have focused on acquiring educational technologies with less \n        emphasis on the utilization of those technologies in the \n        classroom and the training and infrastructural requirements \n        needed to efficiently support those types of technologies. As a \n        result, in many instances, the full potential of educational \n        technology has not been realized.\n            (6) Our global economy is increasingly reliant on a \n        workforce not only comfortable with technology, but also able \n        to integrate rapid technological changes into the production \n        process. As such, in order to remain competitive in a global \n        economy, it is imperative that we maintain a work-ready labor \n        force.\n            (7) According to ``Teacher Quality: A Report on the \n        Preparation and Qualifications of Public School Teachers'', \n        prepared by the Department of Education, only 1 in 5 teachers \n        felt well prepared to work in a modern classroom.\n            (8) The most common form of professional development for \n        teachers continues to be workshops that typically last no more \n        than 1 day and have little relevance to teachers' work in the \n        classroom.\n            (9) A 1998 national survey completed by the Department of \n        Education found that only 19 percent of teachers had been \n        formally mentored by another teacher, and that 70 percent of \n        these teachers felt that this collaboration was very helpful to \n        their teaching.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the utilization \nof educational technologies in elementary and secondary education by \ncreating an educational technology extension service based at \nintermediate school districts, regional education service agencies, or \nundergraduate institutions of higher education.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Director'' means the Director of the \n        National Science Foundation.\n            (2) The term ``institution of higher education'' has the \n        meaning given that term in section 101 of the Higher Education \n        Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001).\n\nSEC. 3.

Each evaluation panel \n                shall measure the involved ETU Center's performance \n                against the objectives specified in this Act. Funding \n                for an ETU Center shall not be renewed unless the \n                evaluation is positive.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the National Science Foundation to carry out this Act \n$7,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $8,500,000 for fiscal year 2003, and \n$9,500,000 for fiscal year 2004."
