FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) High-speed passenger rail technology, while not new in \n        Europe and Asia, is a new transportation technology in the \n        United States. Its design, development, construction, \n        financing, funding, and operation require specific skills and \n        expertise that are not abundant in the United States, and will \n        require years to develop.\n            (2) Unlike highways, mass transit, and aviation, high-speed \n        rail requires unique and separated rights of way to operate and \n        must be fully integrated with other passenger transportation \n        system elements to be successful.\n            (3) In order to ensure the proper development of high-speed \n        intercity passenger rail service in the United States, it is \n        critical that a dedicated office be established at the highest \n        levels of the Federal Government to coordinate and facilitate \n        the intricate relationships between--\n                    (A) various levels of government; and\n                    (B) the wide range of industrial interests that \n                will be required to work together to make high-speed \n                rail successful.\n            (4) Resources for transportation infrastructure are in high \n        demand. Many people contend that there are not enough resources \n        to maintain the transportation system the Nation has built, let \n        alone to build new modes of transportation such as high-speed \n        intercity passenger rail.\n            (5) The capacity of the current transportation system \n        threatens the present and future competitiveness of the United \n        States. Unless investments are made in new, faster, and more \n        efficient transportation capacity, such as intercity high-speed \n        passenger rail, it will be very difficult for the United \n        States--\n                    (A) to rise out of its current economic condition; \n                or\n                    (B) to regain its leadership role domestically and \n                internationally.\n            (6) Placing the development of a national system of \n        intercity high-speed rail corridors that are highly integrated \n        with other modes of transportation under the direct supervision \n        of the Secretary of Transportation and delegating the day-to-\n        day administration of such system to an Assistant Secretary \n        will ensure an effective launch and the efficient operation of \n        a new national transportation modality.\n            (7) It is in the interest of the United States to \n        expeditiously develop and deploy intercity high-speed passenger \n        rail under the singularly focused direction of the Secretary of \n        Transportation.\n\nSEC. 3.
