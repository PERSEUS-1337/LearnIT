DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n        Development.\n            (2) Lab.--The term ``Lab'' means the United States Global \n        Development Lab established under section 4.\n            (3) USAID.--The term ``USAID'' means the United States \n        Agency for International Development.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Leveraging academic research and private sector \n        expertise to effectively apply science and technology to United \n        States foreign aid can increase the effectiveness of United \n        States aid dollars and lead to better outcomes.\n            (2) In the last 20 years, human ingenuity and \n        entrepreneurship around the world has reduced child mortality \n        rates by 42 percent and poverty rates by 52 percent, lifting \n        hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.\n            (3) Over the next 40 years, the developing world is \n        expected to be the largest source of product and services \n        growth. Breakthroughs pioneered for the developing world can \n        translate into jobs and economic growth in the United States.\n            (4) In 2014 the Office of Science and Technology and the \n        Office of Innovation and Development Alliances at the United \n        States Agency for International Development were abolished to \n        pave the way to bring their staffing and other resources into \n        the United States Global Development Lab.\n            (5) The Lab represents a new approach to invest, test, and \n        apply more effective solutions to humanity's greatest \n        challenges.\n            (6) The Lab will partner with entrepreneurs, experts, \n        nongovernmental organizations, universities, and science and \n        research institutions to solve development challenges in a \n        faster, more cost-efficient, and more sustainable way.\n            (7) The Lab will utilize a pay-for-success model, which \n        uses science, technology, and innovation-driven competitions to \n        expand the number and diversity of solutions to development \n        challenges.\n            (8) In contrast with traditional grants or contracts, where \n        USAID pays for a proposal to be implemented, pay-for-success \n        awards are given to a winner only after the objectives of the \n        competition have been achieved.\n            (9) Expanding pay-for-success authority to allow the Lab to \n        use these awards globally will increase the number of high \n        value solutions to choose from at a significantly reduced cost.\n\nSEC. 4.
