A member may make the \n        motion only on the legislative day after the day on which the \n        Member announces to the House concerned the Member's intention \n        to make the motion, except that, in the case of the House of \n        Representatives, the motion may be made without such prior \n        announcement if the motion is made by direction of the \n        committee to which the bill was referred. The motion is highly \n        privileged in the House of Representatives and is privileged in \n        the Senate and is not debatable.

A motion to \n        reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n        disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to \n        the consideration of the bill is agreed to, the respective \n        House shall immediately proceed to consideration of the bill \n        without intervening motion, order, or other business, and the \n        bill shall remain the unfinished business of the respective \n        House until disposed of.\n            (2) Debate.--Debate on the bill, and on all debatable \n        motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n        to not more than 4 hours in the House of Representatives and 10 \n        hours in the Senate, which shall be divided equally between \n        those favoring and those opposing the bill. A motion further to \n        limit debate is in order and not debatable. A motion to \n        postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other \n        business, or a motion to recommit the bill is not in order. A \n        motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill is agreed to or \n        disagreed to is not in order.\n            (3) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n        conclusion of the debate on the bill and a single quorum call \n        at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with \n        the rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final passage \n        of the bill shall occur.\n            (4) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the chair \n        relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the \n        House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure \n        relating to the bill shall be decided without debate.\n    (f) Exercise of Rulemaking Powers.--This section is enacted by the \nCongress--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of \n        Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as such they \n        shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, \n        respectively, or of that House to which they specifically \n        apply, and such rules shall supersede other rules only to the \n        extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n        either House to change such rules (so far as relating to such \n        House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent \n        as in the case of any other rule of such House.\n    (g) Definitions.--In this section, the term ``agency'' has the \nmeaning given that term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code."
