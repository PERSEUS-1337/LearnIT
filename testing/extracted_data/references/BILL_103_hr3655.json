Buy-Downs and Interest Rate Reductions.--(a) Upon the \nrequest of the issuer, annually the Administration is authorized to \nbuy-down the interest rate on any debenture purchased by the Federal \nFinancing Bank (1) which has been issued by a development company \npursuant to the provisions of section 503 of the Investment Act or (2) \nwhich has been issued by a small business investment company pursuant \nto the provisions of section 303 of such Act. The buy-down shall be \nlimited to the current year only. As used in this section, the term \n``buy-down'' means a payment from the Administration to the Federal \nFinancing Bank in an amount determined by the Administration to reduce \nthe interest payment for that year to an amount equal to 7.5 per centum \nof the outstanding principal amount of the debenture.\n    (b) Upon the request of the issuer, annually the Administration is \nauthorized to reduce the interest rate on any debenture issued by a \nsmall business investment company licensed pursuant to the provisions \nof section 301(d) of the Investment Act. The reduction shall be limited \nto the current year only. The amount of the reduction shall be an \namount determined by the Administration to make the interest payment \nfor that year equal to 7.5 per centum of the outstanding principal \namount of the debenture, less the amount of any other reductions or \ncredits otherwise provided by law.\n\n                               TITLE III\n\n    Sec. 301. Prepayments.--(a) Annually, after the regular \nAppropriations Act has been signed into law providing funding for the \nAdministration, the Administration shall calculate the amount needed to \ncarry out the provisions of section 201 of this Act. If it determines \nthat it has sufficient funding to fully carry out the buy-downs and \nreductions authorized by such section, it shall obtain from the Federal \nFinancing Bank a computation of the amount of the prepayment penalty \nwhich would be required from the issuer of each such debenture if it \nwas prepaid as of the end of the current fiscal year. The \nAdministration shall also compute the amount of the prepayment penalty \non 301(d) debentures as if such debentures had been sold to the Federal \nFinancing Bank.\n    (b) After making the above determinations, the Administration shall \npromptly notify the issuer of each debenture subject to the provisions \nof section 201 of this Act that it will receive offers from any \ninterested issuer to prepay the debenture in full. The issuer shall \ninclude in any offer amount of the full prepayment penalty, or assumed \nprepayment penalty in the case of a debenture from a 301(d) issuer, \nless any amount proposed by the issuer to be paid by the Administration \npursuant to the provisions of this title. The notification to the \nissuer shall include such information as the Administration determines \nto be appropriate, but shall include--\n            (1) the amount of funds available to carry out this title;\n            (2) a computation of the total amount of the prepayment \n        penalties and assumed prepayment penalties if all issuers \n        prepaid;\n            (3) the amount of the prepayment penalty or assumed \n        prepayment penalty for the issuer receiving the notification;\n            (4) the time period during which the Administration will \n        accept offers; and\n            (5) a description of the process under which the \n        Administration will evaluate, give priority to, and accept \n        submission of offers pursuant to this title.\n    (c) Within 30 days after termination of the period for submission \nof offers, the Administration shall evaluate each offer and shall \nassign each a priority. The priority shall be based upon the per centum \nof the prepayment penalty which the issuer offers to pay, with the \nhighest per centum receiving the highest priority. The Administration \nshall approve offers beginning with the one with the highest priority \nand continuing until it utilizes all funds available to carry out this \ntitle in the current fiscal year.\n    Sec. 302.
