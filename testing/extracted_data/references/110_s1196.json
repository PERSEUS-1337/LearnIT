    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health Care for Our Wounded \nWarriors Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) An estimated one in six members of the Armed Forces \n        returning from service in Iraq or Afghanistan has a diagnosable \n        condition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n            (2) One in ten members of the Armed Forces who have served \n        in Iraq or Afghanistan may suffer from a traumatic brain injury \n        (TBI).\n            (3) Since 2001, approximately 1,500,000 members of the \n        Armed Forces have been deployed in support of the conflicts in \n        Iraq and Afghanistan, of whom approximately one-third have \n        served at least two tours of duty, 70,000 have served three \n        tours of duty, and 20,000 have served at least five tours of \n        duty.\n            (4) Currently, there are 700,000 children in the United \n        States with at least one parent deployed to support ongoing \n        military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n            (5) The Department of Defense is facing a shortage of \n        mental health professionals. The Department has had as many as \n        450 psychologists on active duty in the Armed Forces in past \n        years. However, the Department currently has only 350 \n        psychologists on active duty in the Armed Forces in support of \n        combat operations.\n            (6) The demands placed on the Department of Defense mental \n        health system exceed its capacity to provide services in a \n        timely manner to all those in need.\n            (7) The long-term costs of treating members of the Armed \n        Forces returning from Iraq and Afghanistan could ultimately \n        reach $700,000,000,000, with post-traumatic stress disorder \n        projected to be one of the most expensive conditions to treat.\n            (8) Women now constitute 16 percent of the members of the \n        Armed Forces and are assigned to 90 percent all military \n        occupations. As a result, there is a need for research on \n        whether or not women in combat roles have unique mental health \n        needs that should be addressed by the mental health system of \n        the Department of Defense.\n            (9) More than 25 percent of the members of the Armed Forces \n        deployed in support combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan \n        are ethnic minorities. There is a need for research on whether \n        or not minorities have unique mental health needs that should \n        be addressed by the mental health system of the Department of \n        Defense.\n            (10) Three out of every five deployed members of the Armed \n        Forces have a spouse, child, or both. However, there is a \n        paucity of research on the mental health needs of members of \n        the Armed Forces and their families.\n            (11) Approximately 40 percent of the billets for licensed \n        clinical psychologists in the Army are vacant, and there are \n        shortages in other mental health professions, including \n        psychiatry and clinical social work.\n            (12) The long-term needs associated with mental health \n        conditions and brain injuries will require a robust mental \n        health professional workforce.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MENTAL HEALTH OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n              FORCES.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) members of the Armed Forces deserve the best possible \n        treatment for injuries sustained while in service to the United \n        States;\n            (2) injuries sustained by members of the Armed Forces in \n        combat produce both physical and mental illnesses;\n            (3) members of the Armed Forces should have access to \n        mental health providers to facilitate their treatment for \n        mental illness sustained during combat;\n            (4) mental health disorders, such as post-traumatic stress \n        disorder (PTSD), incurred by members of the Armed Forces in \n        combat should be treated with an urgency similar to physical \n        ailments incurred by such members in combat;\n            (5) there is a need to train, recruit, and retain more \n        psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists, neurologists, and \n        other health care professionals to diagnose and provide short-\n        term and long-term care for members of the Armed Forces with \n        mental health conditions, including traumatic brain injuries \n        (TBIs), sustained in combat; and\n            (6) there is a continued need for--\n                    (A) basic science research on post-traumatic stress \n                disorder, traumatic brain injury, and other combat-\n                related conditions;\n                    (B) the development of new treatments for post-\n                traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and \n                other combat-related conditions;\n                    (C) the dissemination of best practices for \n                treating and managing post-traumatic stress disorder, \n                traumatic brain injury, and other combat-related \n                conditions; and\n                    (D) a long-term strategy for education, training, \n                recruitment, and retention for the mental health \n                workforce of the Department of Defense in order to \n                expand and improve that workforce.\n\nSEC. 4.
