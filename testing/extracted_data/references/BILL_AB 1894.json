However, each of the chapters, and each article, section, subdivision, sentence, clause, and phrase of each chapter is severable.\n(b) If one of the chapters or any article, section, subdivision, sentence, clause, or phrase of any one of the chapters is for any reason held void, invalid, or unconstitutional, the decision shall not affect the validity of any other chapter or any of its articles, sections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses, or phrases.\nSEC. 7.\nSection 61412 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n61412.\n(a) (1) Every milk handler who receives manufacturing milk subject to this article shall deduct as an assessment from payments made to producers for manufacturing milk the sum of one and two-tenths cents ($0.012) per hundredweight of manufacturing milk.\n(2) The amount of the assessments deducted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be paid to the secretary on or before the 45th day following the last day of the month during which the manufacturing milk was received.\n(b) (1) Every milk handler who receives manufacturing milk subject to this article that purchases or handles manufacturing milk from producers shall pay a fee of six-tenths of one cent ($0.006) per hundredweight of manufacturing milk.\n(2) The amount of the fee shall be paid to the secretary on or before the 45th day following the last day of the month in which the manufacturing milk was received.\n(c) Moneys from the amounts paid to the secretary pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) may be used to administer and enforce this chapter.\nSEC. 8.\nSection 61805 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n61805.\nThe purposes of this chapter are to do all of the following:\n(a) Provide funds for administration and enforcement of this chapter, by assessments to be paid by producers and handlers of market milk in the manner prescribed in this chapter.\n(b) Authorize and enable the secretary to prescribe marketing areas and to determine minimum prices to be paid to producers by handlers for market milk that are necessary due to varying factors of costs of production, health regulations, transportation, and other factors in the marketing areas of this state. In determining minimum prices to be paid producers by handlers, the secretary shall endeavor under like conditions to achieve uniformity of cost to handlers for market milk within any marketing area. However, no minimum prices established or determined under this chapter shall be invalid because uniformity of cost to handlers for market milk in any marketing area is not achieved as a result of the minimum producer prices so established or determined.\n(c) Authorize and enable the secretary to formulate stabilization and marketing plans, subject to the limitations prescribed in this chapter with respect to the contents of the stabilization and marketing plans, and to declare the plans in effect for any marketing area.\n(d) Enable the dairy industry, with the aid of the state, to develop and maintain satisfactory marketing conditions, bring about and maintain a reasonable amount of stability and prosperity in the production of market milk, and provide means for conducting educational and research activities.\nSEC. 9.\nSection 62211 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n62211.\n(a) (1) Every handler subject to the provisions of any stabilization and marketing plan, including a producer-handler, shall deduct as an assessment from payments made to producers for market milk, including the handler\u2019s own production, the sum of one and six-tenths cents ($0.016) per hundredweight of market milk.\n(2) The amount of the assessments so deducted shall be paid to the secretary on or before the 45th day following the last day of the month during which such market milk was received.\n(b) (1) Every handler subject to the provisions of any stabilization and marketing plan that purchases or handles market milk from producers, including the handler\u2019s own production, if any, shall pay a fee of eight-tenths of one cent ($0.008) per hundredweight of market milk.\n(2) The amount of such fee shall be paid to the secretary on or before the 45th day following the last day of the month in which that market milk was received.\n(c) Moneys from the amounts paid to the secretary pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) may be used to administer and enforce this chapter.\nSEC. 10.\nSection 76259 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n76259.\nThe term of office of all members of the commission, except ex officio members, shall be two years from the date of their election and until their successors are qualified.

The Department of Conservation or the landowner, also referred to in this section as \u201cparties,\u201d may provide information to assist the assessor to determine the value. Any information provided to the assessor shall be served on the other party, unless the information was provided at the request of the assessor, and would be confidential under law if required of an assessee.\n(b) Within 45 days of receiving the assessor\u2019s notice pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 51283 or Section 51283.4, if the Department of Conservation or the landowner believes that the current fair market valuation certified pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 51283 or Section 51283.4 is not accurate, the department or the landowner may request formal review from the county assessor in the county considering the petition to cancel the contract. The department or the landowner shall submit to the assessor and the other party the reasons for believing the valuation is not accurate and the additional information the requesting party believes may substantiate a recalculation of the property valuation. The assessor may recover his or her reasonable costs of the formal review from the party requesting the review, and may provide an estimate of those costs to the requesting party. The recovery of these costs from the department may be deducted by the city or county from cancellation fees received pursuant to this chapter before transmittal to the Controller for deposit in the Soil Conservation Fund. The assessor may require a deposit from the landowner to cover the contingency that payment of a cancellation fee will not necessarily result from the completion of a formal review. This subdivision shall not be construed as a limitation on the authority provided in Section 51287 for cities or counties to recover their costs in the cancellation process, except that the assessor\u2019s costs of conducting a formal review shall not be borne by the nonrequesting party.\n(1) If no request is made within 45 days of receiving notice by certified mail of the valuation, the assessor\u2019s valuation shall be used to calculate the fee.\n(2) Upon receiving a request for formal review, the assessor shall formally review his or her valuation if, based on the determination of the assessor, the information may have a material effect on valuation of the property. The assessor shall notify the parties that the formal review is being undertaken and that information to aid the assessor\u2019s review shall be submitted within 30 days of the date of the notice to the parties. Any information submitted to the assessor shall be served on the other party who shall have 30 days to respond to that information to the assessor. If the response to the assessor contains new information, the party receiving that response shall have 20 days to respond to the assessor as to the new information. All submittals and responses to the assessor shall be served on the other party by personal service or an affidavit of mailing. The assessor shall avoid ex parte contacts during the formal review and shall report any such contacts to the department and the landowner at the same time the review is complete. The assessor shall complete the review no later than 120 days of receiving the request.\n(3) At the conclusion of the formal review, the assessor shall either revise the cancellation valuation or determine that the original cancellation valuation is accurate. The assessor shall send the revised valuation or notice of the determination that the valuation is accurate to the department, the landowner, and the board or council considering the petition to cancel the contract. The assessor shall include a brief narrative of what consideration was given to the items of information and responses directly relating to the cancellation value submitted by the parties. The assessor shall give no consideration to a party\u2019s information or response that was not served on the other party. If the assessor denies a formal review, a brief narrative shall be provided to the parties indicating the basis for the denial, if requested.\n(c) For purposes of this section, the valuation date of any revised valuation pursuant to formal review or following judicial challenge shall remain the date of the assessor\u2019s initial valuation, or his or her initial recomputation pursuant to Section 51283.4. For purposes of cancellation fee calculation in a tentative cancellation as provided in Section 51283, or in a recomputation for final cancellation as provided in Section 51283.4, a cancellation value shall be considered current for one year after its determination and certification by the assessor.\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department and the landowner may agree on a cancellation valuation of the land. The agreed valuation shall serve as the cancellation valuation pursuant to Section 51283 or Section 51283.4. The agreement shall be transmitted to the board or council considering the petition to cancel the contract.\n(e) If the department and landowner agree upon a cancellation value pursuant to subdivision (d) on a contract with a city or county that includes an additional cancellation fee pursuant to Section 51240, the department shall provide a preliminary valuation to the county assessor of the county in which the land is located and the board of supervisors or the city council at least 60 days before the effective date of the final cancellation valuation. The preliminary valuation shall include a description of the rationale and facts considered by the department in determining the cancellation value. The assessor may provide comments on the preliminary valuation to the board of supervisors or city council. The board of supervisors or city council may provide comments on the preliminary valuation and cancellation value, if submitted, to the department. Before determining the final cancellation valuation, the department shall consider the comments of the board or council concerning the preliminary valuation and cancellation valuation, if submitted.\n(f) This section represents the exclusive administrative procedure for appealing a cancellation valuation calculated pursuant to this section. The Department of Conservation shall represent the interests of the state in the administrative and judicial remedies for challenging the determination of a cancellation valuation or cancellation fee."
