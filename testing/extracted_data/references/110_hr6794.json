Any audit carried out with respect to such \n        an audit unit shall meet the completeness requirement and the \n        other standards set forth under paragraph (7) and applicable to \n        audits carried out with respect to other precincts and \n        alternative audit units, including the requirement that all \n        paper ballots be counted by hand.\n            (10) The audit shall be conducted in a public and \n        transparent manner, such that members of the public are able to \n        observe the entire process.\n    (c) Collection and Submission of Audit Results; Publication.--\n            (1) State submission of report.--In order to receive a \n        payment under this section, a State shall submit to the \n        Commission a report, in such form as the Commission may \n        require, on the results of each audit conducted under this \n        section.\n            (2) Commission action.--The Commission may request \n        additional information from a State based on the report \n        submitted under paragraph (1).\n            (3) Publication.--The Commission shall publish each report \n        submitted under paragraph (1) upon receipt.\n    (d) Delay in Certification of Results by State.--No State may \ncertify the results of any election which is subject to an audit under \nthis section prior to completing the audit, resolving discrepancies \ndiscovered in the audit, and submitting the report required under \nsubsection (c).\n    (e) State Defined.--In this Act, the term ``State'' includes the \nDistrict of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American \nSamoa, and the United States Virgin Islands."
