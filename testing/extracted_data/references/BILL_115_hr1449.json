REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF PAKISTAN AS A STATE SPONSOR OF \n              TERRORISM.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, \n        al-Qaeda leaders and the Afghan Taliban fled Afghanistan to \n        Pakistan and settled in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas \n        (FATA). Joint Task Force Guantanamo threat assessments \n        subsequently revealed that Pakistan's Inter-Services \n        Intelligence (ISI) facilitated al-Qaeda's movement of fighters \n        to and from Afghanistan as well as the terrorist organization's \n        purchase of weapons.\n            (2) The Government of Pakistan, and the ISI in particular, \n        provide support and a safe haven to groups designated as \n        foreign terrorist organizations pursuant to section 219 of the \n        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189) by the United \n        States Government. Then Chairman of the United States Joint \n        Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen testified in 2011 that \n        ``the Haqqani Network . . . acts as a veritable arm of \n        Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. With ISI \n        support, Haqqani operatives planned and conducted'' various \n        attacks against United States personnel and interests in \n        Afghanistan, including a 2011 attack on the United States \n        Embassy in Kabul.\n            (3) The founder and leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, \n        was found and killed in the Pakistani military town of \n        Abbottabad in 2011. The Government of Pakistan subsequently \n        condemned the raid that killed the terrorist leader and \n        continues to imprison Dr. Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani doctor \n        who played an instrumental role in identifying Osama bin \n        Laden's hiding place.\n            (4) A 2012 NATO report indicated that the Afghan Taliban is \n        directly assisted by the Pakistani security services and noted \n        that ``Pakistan's manipulation of the Taliban senior leadership \n        continues [unabated]''. The report also suggested that Pakistan \n        is aware of the locations of senior Taliban leaders, including \n        one who maintained a residence in the immediate vicinity of the \n        ISI headquarters in Islamabad.\n            (5) The leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Akhtar \n        Mansour, was located in southwestern Pakistan at the time of \n        his death by a United States drone strike on May 21, 2016. \n        Pakistan's Baluchistan Province has long been a haven for the \n        Afghan Taliban, and the group's top leadership is headquartered \n        in the city of Quetta in Baluchistan Province.\n            (6) The Department of State's 2016 Country Reports on \n        Terrorism noted that Pakistan ``did not take substantial action \n        against the Afghan Taliban or HQN (the Haqqani Network), or \n        substantially limit their ability to threaten United States \n        interests in Afghanistan''. The report also stated that \n        ``Pakistan has not taken sufficient action against other \n        externally-focused groups such as Laskar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) and \n        Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which continued to cooperate, train, \n        organize, and fundraise in Pakistan''. Moreover, since passage \n        of Carl Levin and Howard P. `Buck' McKeon National Defense \n        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291), \n        the Secretary of Defense has been unable to certify that \n        Pakistan has taken adequate action against the Haqqani Network \n        in accordance with section 1222(f) of such Act.\n            (7) Pakistan has not taken steps to demonstrate its \n        commitment to prevent the Haqqani Network from using North \n        Waziristan as a safe haven, nor has it shown progress in \n        arresting and prosecuting Haqqani Network senior leaders and \n        mid-level operatives.\n    (b) Reports.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the President, acting through the \n        Secretary of State and in consultation with the heads of other \n        appropriate Federal departments and agencies, shall submit to \n        the appropriate congressional committees a report that \n        determines whether--\n                    (A)(i) with respect to each of the acts described \n                in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), the \n                Government of Pakistan, including any agents or \n                instrumentalities of such Government, directly or \n                indirectly, committed, conspired to commit, attempted, \n                aided, or abetted any such act; or\n                    (ii) the Government of Pakistan, including any \n                agents or instrumentalities of such Government, \n                directly or indirectly, committed, conspired to commit, \n                attempted, aided, or abetted any act not referred to in \n                clause (i) that constitutes an act of or support for \n                international terrorism; and\n                    (B) any such act referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) \n                constitutes an act of or support for international \n                terrorism.\n            (2) Follow-up.--If the Secretary of State makes a \n        determination in the affirmative with respect to subparagraph \n        (B) of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, not later than 30 \n        days after making such determination, submit to the appropriate \n        congressional committees a report that contains--\n                    (A) a determination regarding whether the \n                Government of Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism; \n                or\n                    (B) a detailed justification as to why the conduct \n                described in the report required under such paragraph \n                (1) does not meet the legal criteria for a \n                determination in the affirmative under subparagraph (A) \n                of this paragraph.\n    (c) Form.--The reports required by subsection (b) shall be \nsubmitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex, if \nappropriate.\n\nSEC. 3.
