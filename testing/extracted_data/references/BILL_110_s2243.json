FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) \n        mandates that all states ``refrain from providing any form of \n        support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in \n        terrorist acts'', take ``the necessary steps to prevent the \n        commission of terrorist acts'', and ``deny safe haven to those \n        who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts''.\n            (2) In 2004, the Council on Foreign Relations reported that \n        it knew of ``not a single Saudi donor of funds to terrorist \n        groups who has been publicly punished''.\n            (3) In his July 2005 testimony to the Committee on Banking, \n        Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, Stewart Levey, the \n        Undersecretary for the Office of Terrorism and Financing \n        Intelligence of the Department of the Treasury, reported that \n        ``even today, we believe that Saudi donors may still be a \n        significant source of terrorist financing, including for the \n        insurgency in Iraq''. He added that Saudi financiers and \n        charities ``remain a key source for the promotion of ideologies \n        used by terrorists and violent extremists''.\n            (4) According to a July 27, 2007 New York Times article, \n        ``Of an estimated 60 to 80 foreign fighters who enter Iraq each \n        month, American military and intelligence officials say that \n        nearly half are coming from Saudi Arabia and that the Saudis \n        have not done enough to stem the flow.''.\n            (5) According to a July 15, 2007 Los Angeles Times article, \n        ``About 45% of all foreign militants targeting U.S. troops and \n        Iraqi civilians and security forces are from Saudi Arabia ... \n        according to official U.S. military figures made available to \n        The Times by the senior officer. Nearly half of the 135 \n        foreigners in U.S. detention facilities in Iraq are Saudis, he \n        said. Fighters from Saudi Arabia are thought to have carried \n        out more suicide bombings than those of any other nationality, \n        said the senior U.S. officer, who spoke on condition of \n        anonymity because of the subject's sensitivity.''.\n            (6) The Center for Religious Freedom, formerly affiliated \n        with Freedom House, in a 2006 report entitled ``Saudi Arabia's \n        Curriculum of Intolerance'', stated that despite 2005 \n        statements by the Saudi Foreign Minister that their educational \n        curricula have been reformed, this is ``simply not the case''. \n        Contrarily, religious textbooks continue to advocate the \n        destruction of any non-Wahhabi Muslim. Saudi Arabia has \n        established Wahhabism, an extreme form of Islam, as the \n        official state doctrine, and about 5,000,000 children are \n        instructed each year in Islamic studies using Saudi Ministry of \n        Education textbooks.\n            (7) A Fall 2007 United States Commission on International \n        Religious Freedom report stated ``Due to insufficient \n        information provided by the Saudi government, the Commission \n        could not verify that a formal mechanism exists within the \n        Saudi government to review thoroughly and revise educational \n        texts and other materials sent outside of Saudi Arabia. It \n        appears that the Saudi government has made little or no \n        progress on efforts to halt the exportation of extremist \n        ideology outside the Kingdom.''.\n            (8) A September 2005 Government Accountability Office \n        report stated that ``Saudi Arabia's multibillion-dollar \n        petroleum industry, although largely owned by the government, \n        has fostered the creation of large private fortunes, enabling \n        many wealthy Saudis to sponsor charities and educational \n        foundations whose operations extend to many countries. United \n        States Government and other expert reports have linked some \n        Saudi donations to the global propagation of religious \n        intolerance, hatred of Western values, and support of terrorist \n        activities''.\n            (9) A June 2004 press release on the website of the Saudi \n        embassy, www.saudiembassy.net, discussed the creation of the \n        Saudi National Commission for Relief and Charity Work Abroad, a \n        nongovernmental body designed to ``take over all aspects of \n        private overseas aid operations and assume responsibility for \n        the distribution of private charitable donations from Saudi \n        Arabia'' in order to ``guard against money laundering and the \n        financing of terrorism''. As of late 2007, this Commission had \n        not been created.\n            (10) In a February 2006 open Senate Select Committee on \n        Intelligence hearing on the ``World Wide Threat'', former \n        Director of National Intelligence and current Deputy Secretary \n        of State John Negroponte, stated that ``there are private Saudi \n        citizens who still engage in these kinds of donations [in which \n        money is transferred back door to terrorists]''.\n            (11) A March 2005 report by the Congressional Research \n        Service stated that at least 5 persons listed as beneficiaries \n        of the Saudi Committee for the Support of the Al Quds Intifada \n        were suspected suicide bombers.\n            (12) During November 8, 2005 testimony on Saudi Arabia \n        before the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Homeland \n        Security of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, Steve \n        Emerson, terrorism expert and Executive Director of the \n        Investigative Project on Terrorism, stated that despite \n        repeated declarations by Saudi officials that there has been \n        substantial reform in education, progress against terrorism, \n        and movement toward transparency, a review of other Saudi \n        announcements shows that they have either specifically failed \n        to follow through or cannot be proven to have followed through \n        on their pledges. He also noted that the Saudi government \n        established the Saudi Committee for the Support of the Al Quds \n        Intifada, which was proven to provide aid to Palestinian \n        terrorist groups. During an Israeli raid on a Hamas \n        institution, they discovered a spreadsheet from the \n        aforementioned committee giving a detailed account about how \n        they received $545,000 from the committee to allocate to 102 \n        families of so-called martyrs. The spreadsheet included the \n        names of 8 suicide bombers.\n            (13) A January 2007 Congressional Research Service Report \n        on Saudi Arabia's terrorist-financing activities indicated that \n        although the records portion of the Committee for the Support \n        of the Al Quds Intifada was deactivated in March 2005, of the \n        1,300 listed beneficiaries, over 60 matched or closely \n        resembled the names of known Palestinian militants who carried \n        out attacks against Israel between October 2000 and March 2002.\n            (14) The final report of the Presidentially-appointed Iraq \n        Study Group stated that ``funding for the Sunni insurgency in \n        Iraq comes from private donors in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf \n        states''.\n            (15) A January 2005 report by the Center for Religious \n        Freedom found that Saudi Arabia was creating and distributing, \n        through its embassy in Washington, D.C., material promoting \n        hatred, intolerance, and violence at mosques and Islamic \n        centers in the United States.\n            (16) On December 14, 2005, R. James Woolsey, former \n        Director of Central Intelligence wrote, ``Over the long run, \n        this movement [Wahhabism] is in many ways the most dangerous of \n        the ideological enemies we face.'' Mr. Woolsey also explained \n        that ``al Qaeda and the Wahhabis share essentially the same \n        underlying totalitarian theocratic ideology. It is this common \n        Salafist ideology that the Wahhabis have been spreading widely \n        -- financed by $3-4 billion/year from the Saudi government and \n        wealthy individuals in the Middle East over the last quarter \n        century -- to the madrassas of Pakistan, the textbooks of \n        Turkish children in Germany, and the mosques of Europe and the \n        U.S.''.\n            (17) According to a May 2006 report by the Center for \n        Religious Freedom, official Saudi religious textbooks continue \n        to teach hatred of those who do not follow Wahhabi Muslim \n        doctrine and encourage jihad against such ``infidels'' and \n        ``the Saudi public school religious curriculum continues to \n        propagate an ideology of hate toward the unbeliever ... [A] \n        text instructs students that it is a religious obligation to do \n        `battle' against infidels in order to spread the faith''.\n            (18) In May 2006, the Congressional Research Service \n        reported that ``Saudi Arabia has discussed increasing boycott \n        efforts against Israel, despite their WTO [World Trade \n        Organization] obligations''.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) it is imperative that the Government of Saudi Arabia \n        immediately and unconditionally--\n                    (A) permanently close all charities, schools, or \n                other organizations or institutions in the Kingdom of \n                Saudi Arabia that fund, train, incite, encourage, or in \n                any other way aid and abet terrorism anywhere in the \n                world (referred to in this Act as ``Saudi-based terror \n                organizations''), including by means of providing \n                support for the families of individuals who have \n                committed acts of terrorism;\n                    (B) end funding or other support by the Government \n                of Saudi Arabia for charities, schools, and any other \n                organizations or institutions outside the Kingdom of \n                Saudi Arabia that train, incite, encourage, or in any \n                other way aid and abet terrorism anywhere in the world \n                (referred to in this Act as ``offshore terror \n                organizations''), including by means of providing \n                support for the families of individuals who have \n                committed acts of terrorism;\n                    (C) block all funding from private Saudi citizens \n                and entities to any Saudi-based terror organization or \n                offshore terrorism organization; and\n                    (D) provide complete, unrestricted, and \n                unobstructed cooperation to the United States, \n                including the unsolicited sharing of relevant \n                intelligence in a consistent and timely fashion, in the \n                investigation of groups and individuals that are \n                suspected of financing, supporting, plotting, or \n                committing an act of terror against United States \n                citizens anywhere in the world, including within the \n                Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; and\n            (2) the President, in determining whether to make the \n        certification described in section 4, should judge whether the \n        Government of Saudi Arabia has continued and sufficiently \n        expanded its efforts to combat terrorism since the May 12, 2003 \n        bombing in Riyadh.\n\nSEC. 4. PRESIDENTIAL CERTIFICATION.\n\n    The President shall certify to the appropriate congressional \ncommittees when the President determines that the Government of Saudi \nArabia--\n            (1) is fully cooperating with the United States in \n        investigating and preventing terrorist attacks;\n            (2) has permanently closed all Saudi-based Wahhabbist \n        organizations that fund Islamic extremism, internally and \n        abroad;\n            (3) has exercised maximum efforts to block all funding from \n        private Saudi citizens, corporations, and entities, to foreign \n        Islamic extremist and terrorist movements; and\n            (4) has stopped financing and disseminating materials, and \n        other forms of support, that encourage the spread of radical \n        Wahhabi ideology.\n\nSEC. 5.
