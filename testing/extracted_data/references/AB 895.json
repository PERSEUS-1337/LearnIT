Peevey (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1096, held that an interested person desiring to enforce the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) against the Public Utilities Commission must do so by filing a petition for writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court or the court of appeal and may not do so by filing an action for injunctive relief in the superior court.\n(2) Also in 2014, the Public Utilities Commission argued in the Superior Court of San Francisco that Section 1759 of the Public Utilities Code prevents the superior court from ordering the commission to provide the City of San Bruno, pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code), with emails documenting improper communications between commissioners and utility executives.\n(3) The Public Utilities Commission continues to maintain the position that the superior court does not have jurisdiction to hear actions arising out of the California Public Records Act, and has cited the Disenhouse case defending this position.\n(4) The intent of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act is that actions of state agencies be taken openly and that their deliberation be conducted openly.\n(5) The intent of the California Public Records Act is to protect the fundamental right of every person in this state to access information concerning the conduct of the people\u2019s business.\n(6) The people\u2019s right to remain informed so that they may retain control over the instruments of government that they have created is not less of a right for some agencies than for other agencies, nor shall the people\u2019s ability to enforce the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and the California Public Records Act be more hampered for some agencies than for other agencies.\n(7) The duties, responsibilities, and actions of the Public Utilities Commission affect the well-being of current and future generations, and the public interest and principles of fundamental fairness and due process of law require that the commission conduct its affairs in an open, objective, and impartial manner, free of undue influence and the abuse of power and authority.\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Public Utilities Commission should be subject to the judicial review provisions of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and the California Public Records Act.\nSEC. 7.\nSections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this act do not apply to any claims brought by an electrical corporation, as defined in Section 218 of the Public Utilities Code, that arise from the energy crisis of 2000\u201302."
