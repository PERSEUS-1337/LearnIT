FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) On November 11, 1620, prior to embarking for the shores of \n    America, the Pilgrims signed the Mayflower Compact that declared: \n    ``Having undertaken, for the Glory of God and the advancement of \n    the Christian Faith and honor of our King and country, a voyage to \n    plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia,''.\n        (2) On July 4, 1776, America's Founding Fathers, after \n    appealing to the ``Laws of Nature, and of Nature's God'' to justify \n    their separation from Great Britain, then declared: ``We hold these \n    Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that \n    they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, \n    that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness''.\n        (3) In 1781, Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of \n    Independence and later the Nation's third President, in his work \n    titled ``Notes on the State of Virginia'' wrote: ``God who gave us \n    life gave us liberty. And can the liberties of a nation be thought \n    secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in \n    the minds of the people that these liberties are of the Gift of \n    God. That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed, I \n    tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that his \n    justice cannot sleep forever.''.\n        (4) On May 14, 1787, George Washington, as President of the \n    Constitutional Convention, rose to admonish and exhort the \n    delegates and declared: ``If to please the people we offer what we \n    ourselves disapprove, how can we afterward defend our work? Let us \n    raise a standard to which the wise and the honest can repair; the \n    event is in the hand of God!''.\n        (5) On July 21, 1789, on the same day that it approved the \n    Establishment Clause concerning religion, the First Congress of the \n    United States also passed the Northwest Ordinance, providing for a \n    territorial government for lands northwest of the Ohio River, which \n    declared: ``Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to \n    good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means \n    of education shall forever be encouraged.''.\n        (6) On September 25, 1789, the First Congress unanimously \n    approved a resolution calling on President George Washington to \n    proclaim a National Day of Thanksgiving for the people of the \n    United States by declaring, ``a day of public thanksgiving and \n    prayer, to be observed by acknowledging, with grateful hearts, the \n    many signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an \n    opportunity peaceably to establish a constitution of government for \n    their safety and happiness.''.\n        (7) On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered \n    his Gettysburg Address on the site of the battle and declared: ``It \n    is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining \n    before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion \n    to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of \n    devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not \n    have died in vain--that this Nation, under God, shall have a new \n    birth of freedom--and that Government of the people, by the people, \n    for the people, shall not perish from the earth.''.\n        (8) On April 28, 1952, in the decision of the Supreme Court of \n    the United States in Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), in \n    which school children were allowed to be excused from public \n    schools for religious observances and education, Justice William O. \n    Douglas, in writing for the Court stated: ``The First Amendment, \n    however, does not say that in every and all respects there shall be \n    a separation of Church and State. Rather, it studiously defines the \n    manner, the specific ways, in which there shall be no concern or \n    union or dependency one on the other. That is the common sense of \n    the matter. Otherwise the State and religion would be aliens to \n    each other--hostile, suspicious, and even unfriendly. Churches \n    could not be required to pay even property taxes. Municipalities \n    would not be permitted to render police or fire protection to \n    religious groups. Policemen who helped parishioners into their \n    places of worship would violate the Constitution. Prayers in our \n    legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty in the messages of \n    the Chief Executive; the proclamations making Thanksgiving Day a \n    holiday; `so help me God' in our courtroom oaths--these and all \n    other references to the Almighty that run through our laws, our \n    public rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First \n    Amendment. A fastidious atheist or agnostic could even object to \n    the supplication with which the Court opens each session: `God save \n    the United States and this Honorable Court.'''.\n        (9) On June 15, 1954, Congress passed and President Eisenhower \n    signed into law a statute that was clearly consistent with the text \n    and intent of the Constitution of the United States, that amended \n    the Pledge of Allegiance to read: ``I pledge allegiance to the Flag \n    of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it \n    stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice \n    for all.''.\n        (10) On July 20, 1956, Congress proclaimed that the national \n    motto of the United States is ``In God We Trust'', and that motto \n    is inscribed above the main door of the Senate, behind the Chair of \n    the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and on the currency of \n    the United States.\n        (11) On June 17, 1963, in the decision of the Supreme Court of \n    the United States in Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. \n    203 (1963), in which compulsory school prayer was held \n    unconstitutional, Justices Goldberg and Harlan, concurring in the \n    decision, stated: ``But untutored devotion to the concept of \n    neutrality can lead to invocation or approval of results which \n    partake not simply of that noninterference and noninvolvement with \n    the religious which the Constitution commands, but of a brooding \n    and pervasive devotion to the secular and a passive, or even \n    active, hostility to the religious. Such results are not only not \n    compelled by the Constitution, but, it seems to me, are prohibited \n    by it. Neither government nor this Court can or should ignore the \n    significance of the fact that a vast portion of our people believe \n    in and worship God and that many of our legal, political, and \n    personal values derive historically from religious teachings. \n    Government must inevitably take cognizance of the existence of \n    religion and, indeed, under certain circumstances the First \n    Amendment may require that it do so.''.\n        (12) On March 5, 1984, in the decision of the Supreme Court of \n    the United States in Lynch v. Donelly, 465 U.S. 668 (1984), in \n    which a city government's display of a nativity scene was held to \n    be constitutional, Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, \n    stated: ``There is an unbroken history of official acknowledgment \n    by all three branches of government of the role of religion in \n    American life from at least 1789 . . . [E]xamples of reference to \n    our religious heritage are found in the statutorily prescribed \n    national motto `In God We Trust' (36 U.S.C. 186), which Congress \n    and the President mandated for our currency, see (31 U.S.C. \n    5112(d)(1) (1982 ed.)), and in the language `One Nation under God', \n    as part of the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag. That \n    pledge is recited by many thousands of public school children--and \n    adults--every year . . . Art galleries supported by public revenues \n    display religious paintings of the 15th and 16th centuries, \n    predominantly inspired by one religious faith. The National Gallery \n    in Washington, maintained with Government support, for example, has \n    long exhibited masterpieces with religious messages, notably the \n    Last Supper, and paintings depicting the Birth of Christ, the \n    Crucifixion, and the Resurrection, among many others with explicit \n    Christian themes and messages. The very chamber in which oral \n    arguments on this case were heard is decorated with a notable and \n    permanent--not seasonal--symbol of religion: Moses with the Ten \n    Commandments. Congress has long provided chapels in the Capitol for \n    religious worship and meditation.''.\n        (13) On June 4, 1985, in the decision of the Supreme Court of \n    the United States in Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38 (1985), in \n    which a mandatory moment of silence to be used for meditation or \n    voluntary prayer was held unconstitutional, Justice O'Connor, \n    concurring in the judgment and addressing the contention that the \n    Court's holding would render the Pledge of Allegiance \n    unconstitutional because Congress amended it in 1954 to add the \n    words ``under God,'' stated ``In my view, the words `under God' in \n    the Pledge, as codified at (36 U.S.C. 172), serve as an \n    acknowledgment of religion with `the legitimate secular purposes of \n    solemnizing public occasions, [and] expressing confidence in the \n    future.'''.\n        (14) On November 20, 1992, the United States Court of Appeals \n    for the 7th Circuit, in Sherman v. Community Consolidated School \n    District 21, 980 F.2d 437 (7th Cir. 1992), held that a school \n    district's policy for voluntary recitation of the Pledge of \n    Allegiance including the words ``under God'' was constitutional.\n        (15) The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously held, in \n    Newdow v. U.S. Congress (9th Cir. June 26, 2002), that the Pledge \n    of Allegiance's use of the express religious reference ``under \n    God'' violates the First Amendment to the Constitution, and that, \n    therefore, a school district's policy and practice of teacher-led \n    voluntary recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance is \n    unconstitutional.\n        (16) The erroneous rationale of the 9th Circuit Court of \n    Appeals in Newdow would lead to the absurd result that the \n    Constitution's use of the express religious reference ``Year of our \n    Lord'' in Article VII violates the First Amendment to the \n    Constitution, and that, therefore, a school district's policy and \n    practice of teacher-led voluntary recitations of the Constitution \n    itself would be unconstitutional.\n\nSEC. 2. ONE NATION UNDER GOD.\n\n    (a) Reaffirmation.--Section 4 of title 4, United States Code, is \namended to read as follows:\n\n``Sec. 4. Pledge of allegiance to the flag; manner of delivery\n\n    ``The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag: `I pledge allegiance to the \nFlag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it \nstands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for \nall.', should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with \nthe right hand over the heart. When not in uniform men should remove \nany non-religious headdress with their right hand and hold it at the \nleft shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should \nremain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute.''.\n    (b) Codification.--In codifying this subsection, the Office of the \nLaw Revision Counsel shall show in the historical and statutory notes \nthat the 107th Congress reaffirmed the exact language that has appeared \nin the Pledge for decades.\n\nSEC. 3. REAFFIRMING THAT GOD REMAINS IN OUR MOTTO.\n\n    (a) Reaffirmation.--Section 302 of title 36, United States Code, is \namended to read as follows:\n\n``Sec. 302. National motto\n\n    ```In God we trust' is the national motto.''.\n    (b) Codification.--In codifying this subsection, the Office of the \nLaw Revision Counsel shall make no change in section 302, title 36, \nUnited States Code, but shall show in the historical and statutory \nnotes that the 107th Congress reaffirmed the exact language that has \nappeared in the Motto for decades.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
