FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and \n        women have served in building the Nation's nuclear defense and, \n        in the course of this work, have been exposed to beryllium, \n        ionizing radiation, and other hazards unique to nuclear weapons \n        production and testing, including tens of thousands of workers \n        in New Mexico. The purpose of the Energy Employees Occupational \n        Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (in this section \n        referred to as the ``Act''), which was enacted on October 30, \n        2000, is to provide for timely, uniform, and adequate \n        compensation of covered employees and, where applicable, \n        survivors of such employees, suffering from illnesses incurred \n        by such employees in the performance of duty for the Department \n        of Energy and certain of its contractors and subcontractors.\n            (2) Executive Order No. 13179 required the Secretary of \n        Health and Human Services to carry out the Act's statutory \n        requirement to issue and implement procedures for conducting \n        radiation dose reconstruction, to establish the scientific \n        basis for compensation, and to issue regulations under which \n        classes of workers could petition to become members of a \n        Special Exposure Cohort and under which such petitions could be \n        evaluated. Pursuant to the Act, workers may petition to be \n        members of a Special Exposure Cohort when it is not feasible to \n        estimate dose with sufficient accuracy and there is a \n        reasonable likelihood that exposures to radiation may have \n        endangered the health of the class of workers. Special Exposure \n        Cohort status provides an automatic presumption of causation \n        for 22 radiation-related cancers without the need for \n        attempting to estimate radiation dose, and is intended to \n        remove an otherwise insurmountable burden of proof. Such \n        Special Exposure Cohorts have been designated by Congress at \n        Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, the K-25 facility at Oak \n        Ridge, Tennessee, and the Amchitka Island Test site in Alaska.\n            (3) The National Institute for Occupational Safety and \n        Health was tasked with conducting radiation dose \n        reconstructions under the Act. As of April 16, 2004, the \n        Institute has completed 15 out of 571 radiation dose \n        reconstructions for covered workers at Los Alamos, New Mexico. \n        The Institute has completed only 18 out of 765 dose \n        reconstructions in New Mexico. Sick workers are dying while \n        awaiting a determination on their claims, and in many cases the \n        delays have caused them to lose hope.\n            (4) Congressional intent undergirding the statutory \n        requirement to allow additional Special Exposure Cohorts was \n        explained by Senator Jeff Bingaman, an original cosponsor, as \n        part of the floor debate on the enactment of the Act on October \n        12, 2000. He stated that this provision was added ``for a \n        significant minority who were exposed to radiation but for whom \n        it would be infeasible to reconstruct their dose. There are \n        several reasons why . . . this infeasibility might exist. First \n        relevant dose records might be missing or might not exist \n        altogether. Second there might be a way to reconstruct the \n        dose, but it would be prohibitively expensive to do so. Finally \n        it might take so long to reconstruct a dose for a group of \n        workers that they will all be dead before we have an answer \n        that can be used to determine their eligibility.''.\n            (5) Dose reconstruction is being interminably delayed for \n        claimants at Los Alamos National Laboratory. A May 5, 2004, \n        report to Congress by the Centers for Disease Control regarding \n        obstacles to records recovery needed for radiation dose \n        reconstruction states that: ``Los Alamos National Laboratory \n        has not submitted individual bioassay data, nor detailed \n        external dosimetry data. The submittals consist of derived dose \n        quantities, which cannot readily be used in dose \n        reconstructions because they use a different methodology than \n        NIOSH uses for dose reconstructions''.\n            (6) Hearings and investigations reveal that there was not \n        appropriate worker monitoring for mixed neutron and gamma \n        radiation for certain time periods, doubtful reliability of \n        radiation dosimetry reports provided to claimants for certain \n        time periods, and for some claimants, access has been denied to \n        particular monitoring records. One of the workers who testified \n        at a Department of Energy hearing in Espanola, New Mexico, in \n        2000 described how he could fall through the cracks of a system \n        that operated solely on dose histories. He was a supervisor at \n        what was called the ``hot dump'' at Los Alamos. Environmental \n        restoration reports indicate that more than 80 different \n        radionuclides were taken there to be disposed of, making it \n        very difficult to resconstruct dose amounts for each worker.\n            (7) Over the course of the atomic weapons program at Los \n        Alamos, health-related documents were withheld from the workers \n        and public in order to shield the Government and its \n        contractors from public criticism, concerns about union demands \n        for hazardous duty pay, and real or perceived liability.\n            (8) Memoranda indicate that air concentrations of \n        radionuclides at Area G of Los Alamos were systematically \n        underreported in environmental surveillance reports issued to \n        the public in the late 1980's and early 1990's, according to \n        the Pueblo Office of Environmental Protection in 1992.\n            (9) During the 2003 and 2004 regular sessions, the New \n        Mexico legislature, through the leadership of State \n        Representative Ray Ruiz, enacted Joint Memorials calling upon \n        the United States Congress to enact comprehensive reforms to \n        subtitle B and subtitle D of the Act to remedy the injustices \n        to workers made sick from employment by contractors and \n        subcontractors at Los Alamos. House Joint Memorial 16 (2003) \n        and House Joint Memorial 20 (2004) state in relevant part: \n        ``those employees who are unable to obtain records establishing \n        past exposures and employees whose claims of radiation exposure \n        are in jeopardy of being denied due to scientific uncertainty \n        in causation determinations should receive the benefit of the \n        doubt and be compensated under the federal act''.\n            (10) The memorial also urges that, in enacting Federal \n        reform legislation with respect to the Act: ``special exposure \n        cohorts be established for employees in area G and the linear \n        accelerator at Los Alamos national laboratory, and for security \n        guards and all construction workers, due to the impossibility \n        of accurately reconstructing past radiation doses.''.\n            (11) The predicates for a Special Exposure Cohort for Los \n        Alamos workers have been met. For some, dose records are \n        missing or are incomplete; for others, it is requiring a costly \n        research effort, the reliability of the Institute's dose \n        estimates may be open to question, and for virtually all Los \n        Alamos claimants, the Institute is taking so long to estimate \n        dose that claimants are dying off before they ever receive a \n        determination. Justice has been denied through interminable \n        delays. New Mexico's large population of potentially eligible \n        claimants at Department of Energy facilities should not have to \n        wait another generation or more to be compensated for their \n        occupational illnesses.\n\nSEC. 3.
