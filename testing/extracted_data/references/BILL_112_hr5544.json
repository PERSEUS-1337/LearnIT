LAND EXCHANGE, BOUNDARY WATERS CANOE AREA WILDERNESS AND \n              SUPERIOR NATIONAL FOREST, MINNESOTA.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The State of Minnesota owns multiple parcels of land in \n        the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the Superior \n        National Forest that were granted to the State through sections \n        16 and 36 of the Enabling Act of 1857 to be held in trust for \n        the benefit of the public school system in the State (in this \n        section referred to as ``State trust lands'').\n            (2) The State trust lands were acquired by the State long \n        before the establishment of either the National Forest System \n        or the wilderness area and are scattered in a largely \n        checkerboard fashion amid the Superior National Forest and the \n        wilderness area.\n            (3) The presence of State trust lands in the wilderness \n        area makes land and resource management in the wilderness area \n        more difficult, costly, and controversial for the United States \n        and the State.\n            (4) Although the State trust lands were granted to the \n        State to generate financial support for the public school \n        system through the sale or development of natural resources, \n        development of those resources in the wilderness area may be \n        incompatible with managing the wilderness area for \n        recreational, natural, and conservation purposes.\n            (5) The United States owns land and interests in land in \n        other parts of the State that can be transferred to the State \n        in exchange for the State trust lands without jeopardizing \n        Federal management objectives or needs.\n            (6) It is in the public interest to exchange, on terms that \n        are fair to the United States and the State, National Forest \n        System land in the State that has limited recreational and \n        conservation resources for State trust lands located in the \n        wilderness area with important recreational, scenic, and \n        conservation resources for permanent public management and use.\n            (7) The Legislature of the State of Minnesota, meeting in \n        its 87th Legislative Session, passed (and on April 27, 2012, \n        the Governor of Minnesota approved) S.F No. 1750 (Chapter 236), \n        section 4 of which adds section 92.80 to the Minnesota Statutes \n        to expedite the exchange of a portion of the State trust lands \n        located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.\n    (b) Land Exchange Required.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall \nconsummate a land exchange with the State of Minnesota pursuant to \nsection 4 of S.F No. 1750 (Chapter 236) of the Legislature of the State \nof Minnesota (section 92.80 of the Minnesota Statutes) to acquire all \nright, title, and interest of the State in and to certain State trust \nlands identified as provided in such section in exchange for all right, \ntitle, and interest of the United States in and to National Forest \nSystem land in the State for inclusion in the State trust lands.\n    (c) Valuation of Lands for Exchange.--Subdivision 4 of section 4 of \nS.F No. 1750 (Chapter 236) of the Legislature of the State of Minnesota \n(section 92.80 of the Minnesota Statutes) shall control for purposes of \nthe examination and value determination of the lands to be exchanged.\n    (d) Survey and Administrative Costs.--The exact acreage and legal \ndescription of the land to be exchanged under subsection (b) shall be \ndetermined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary. The State of \nMinnesota shall be responsible for the costs of the survey and all \nother administrative costs related to the land exchange.\n    (e) Boundaries and Management of Acquired Land.--\n            (1) Land acquired by secretary.--\n                    (A) In general.--The land acquired by the Secretary \n                under subsection (b) shall be added to and administered \n                as part of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness \n                established pursuant to section 3 of the Wilderness Act \n                (16 U.S.C. 1132(a)), and the Secretary shall modify the \n                boundaries of the wilderness area to reflect inclusion \n                of the acquired lands. Subject to subparagraph (B), the \n                land acquired by the Secretary shall be managed in \n                accordance with the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et \n                seq.) and other laws and regulations applicable to the \n                National Wilderness Preservation System.\n                    (B) No effect on existing fishing and hunting \n                rights.--The acquisition of land by the United States \n                under subsection (b) and inclusion of the land in the \n                Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness shall not alter \n                or otherwise affect--\n                            (i) any fishing and hunting rights in \n                        existence with respect to the land immediately \n                        before the conveyance of the land to the United \n                        States; or\n                            (ii) the use of such rights after \n                        conveyance.\n            (2) Land acquired by state.--The land acquired by the State \n        of Minnesota under subsection (b) shall be deemed to be State \n        trust lands and shall be held in trust for the benefit of the \n        public school system in the State. It is the sense of Congress \n        that, whenever the land acquired by the State of Minnesota \n        under subsection (b) is not being used for revenue-generating \n        activities, the State should make the land available for other \n        compatible uses, including hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, \n        snowmobiling, and trail riding.\n            (3) Boundaries of superior national forest.--The Secretary \n        shall modify the boundaries of the Superior National Forest to \n        reflect the land exchange conducted under this section.\n    (f) Relation to Other Laws.--\n            (1) Land and water conservation fund act.--For purposes of \n        section 7 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 \n        (16 U.S.C. 460l-9), the boundaries of the Superior National \n        Forest, as modified by subsection (e)(3), shall be considered \n        to be boundaries of the Superior National Forest as of January \n        1, 1965.\n            (2) Not a major federal action.--The land exchange \n        conducted under this section shall not be considered to be a \n        major Federal action.\n            (3) Thye-blatnik act.--The Secretary shall not take into \n        consideration the lands acquired by the United States under \n        this Act in determining the appraised value of National Forest \n        System lands in the State of Minnesota used for purposes of \n        making payments to the State of Minnesota under the Act of June \n        22, 1948, and the Act of June 22, 1956 (commonly known as the \n        Thye-Blatnik Act and Humphrey-Thye-Blatnik-Andresen Act; 16 \n        U.S.C. 577c through 577h).\n    (g) No Impact on Other Land Exchanges.--The land exchange described \nin subsection (b) does not affect any land exchange involving National \nForest System land in the State of Minnesota underway as of the date of \nthe enactment of this Act.\n    (h) Report.--If the Secretary fails to complete the land exchange \ndescribed in subsection (b) before the end of the 18-month period \nbeginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \nsubmit to Congress, not later than 30 days after the end of such \nperiod, a report--\n            (1) specifying the reasons why the exchange has not been \n        completed; and\n            (2) stating the date by which the Secretary anticipates the \n        conveyance will be completed.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives September 12, 2012.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L.
