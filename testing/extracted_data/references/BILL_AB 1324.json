    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 38501 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n38501.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Global warming poses a serious threat to the economic well-being, public health, natural resources, and the environment of California. The potential adverse impacts of global warming include the exacerbation of air quality problems, a reduction in the quality and supply of water to the state from the Sierra snowpack, a rise in sea levels resulting in the displacement of thousands of coastal businesses and residences, damage to marine ecosystems and the natural environment, and an increase in the incidences of infectious diseases, asthma, and other human health-related problems.\n(b) Global warming will have detrimental effects on some of California\u2019s largest industries, including agriculture, wine, tourism, skiing, recreational and commercial fishing, and forestry. It will also increase the strain on electricity supplies necessary to meet the demand for summer air-conditioning in the hottest parts of the state.\n(c) California has long been a national and international leader on energy conservation and environmental stewardship efforts, including the areas of air quality protections, energy efficiency requirements, renewable energy standards, natural resource conservation, and greenhouse gas emission standards for passenger vehicles. The program established by this division will continue this tradition of environmental leadership by placing California at the forefront of national and international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\n(d) National and international actions are necessary to fully address the issue of global warming. However, action taken by California to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases will have far-reaching effects by encouraging other states, the federal government, and other countries to act.\n(e) By exercising a global leadership role, California will also position its economy, technology centers, financial institutions, and businesses to benefit from national and international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. More importantly, investing in the development of innovative and pioneering technologies will assist California in achieving the statewide limits on emissions of greenhouse gases established by this division for 2020 and beyond and will provide an opportunity for the state to take a global economic and technological leadership role in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.\n(f) It is the intent of the Legislature that the State Air Resources Board coordinate with state agencies,\nas well as\nand\nconsult with the environmental justice community, industry sectors, business groups, academic institutions, environmental organizations, and other stakeholders, in implementing this division.\n(g) It is the intent of the Legislature that the State Air Resources Board consult with the Public Utilities Commission in the development of emissions reduction measures, including limits on emissions of greenhouse gases applied to electricity and natural gas providers regulated by the Public Utilities Commission in order to ensure that electricity and natural gas providers are not required to meet duplicative or inconsistent regulatory requirements.\n(h) It is the intent of the Legislature that the State Air Resources Board design emissions reduction measures to meet the statewide emissions limits for greenhouse gases established pursuant to this division in a manner that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits for California\u2019s economy, improves and modernizes California\u2019s energy infrastructure and maintains electric system reliability, maximizes additional environmental and economic co-benefits for California, and complements the state\u2019s efforts to improve air quality.\n(i) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Climate Action Team established by the Governor to coordinate the efforts set forth under Executive Order S-3-05 continue its role in coordinating overall climate policy.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 38505 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n38505.\nFor the purposes of this division, the following terms have the following meanings:\n(a) \u201cAllowance\u201d means an authorization to emit, during a specified year, up to one ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.\n(b) \u201cAlternative compliance mechanism\u201d means an action undertaken by a greenhouse gas emission source that achieves the equivalent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over the same time period as a direct emission reduction, and that is approved by the state board. \u201cAlternative compliance mechanism\u201d includes, but is not limited to, a flexible compliance schedule, alternative control technology, a process change, or a product substitution.\n(c) \u201cCarbon dioxide equivalent\u201d means the amount of carbon dioxide by weight that would produce the same global warming impact as a given weight of another greenhouse gas, based on the best available science, including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n(d) \u201cCost-effective\u201d or \u201ccost-effectiveness\u201d means the cost per unit of reduced emissions of greenhouse gases adjusted for its global warming potential.\n(e) \u201cDirect emission reduction\u201d means a greenhouse gas emission reduction action made by a greenhouse gas emission source at that source.\n(f) \u201cEmissions reduction measure\u201d means programs, measures, standards, and alternative compliance mechanisms authorized pursuant to this division, applicable to sources or categories of sources, that are designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\n(g) \u201cGreenhouse gas\u201d or \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d includes all of the following gases:\n(1) Carbon dioxide.\n(2) Methane.\n(3) Nitrous oxide.\n(4) Hydrofluorocarbons.\n(5) Perfluorocarbons.\n(6) Sulfur hexafluoride.\n(7) Nitrogen trifluoride.\n(h) \u201cGreenhouse gas emissions limit\u201d means an authorization, during a specified year, to emit up to a level of greenhouse gases specified by the state board, expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.\n(i) \u201cGreenhouse gas emission source\u201d or \u201csource\u201d means any source, or category of sources, of greenhouse gas emissions whose emissions are at a level of significance, as determined by the state board, that its participation in the program established under this division will enable the state board to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and monitor compliance with the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit.\n(j) \u201cLeakage\u201d means a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases within the state that is offset by an increase in emissions of greenhouse gases outside the state.\n(k) \u201cMarket-based compliance mechanism\u201d means either of the following:\n(1) A system of market-based declining annual aggregate emissions limitations for sources or categories of sources that emit greenhouse gases.\n(2) Greenhouse gas emissions exchanges, banking, credits, and other transactions, governed by rules and protocols established by the state board, that result in the same greenhouse gas emission reduction, over the same time period, as direct compliance with a greenhouse gas emission limit or emission reduction measure adopted by the state board pursuant to this division.\n(l) \u201cState board\u201d means the State Air Resources Board.\n(m) \u201cStatewide greenhouse gas emissions\u201d means the total annual emissions of greenhouse gases in the state, including all emissions of greenhouse gases from the generation of electricity delivered to and consumed in California, accounting for transmission and distribution line losses, whether the electricity is generated in state or imported. Statewide emissions shall be expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.\n(n) \u201cStatewide greenhouse gas emissions limit\u201d or \u201cstatewide emissions limit\u201d means the maximum allowable level of statewide greenhouse gas emissions in\n2020,\n2020 and beyond,\nas determined by the state board pursuant to Part 3 (commencing with Section 38550)."
