FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the \n        Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during \n        the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's \n        history.\n            (2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County, Kentucky, on \n        February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency \n        through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and \n        commitment to the United States.\n            (3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham \n        Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.\n            (4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice \n        toward none and with charity for all.\n            (5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the \n        country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, \n        1865.\n            (6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of \n        Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for \n        accomplishing the ``American dream'' through honesty, \n        integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.\n            (7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of \n        the birth of Abraham Lincoln.\n            (8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood \n        in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in \n        Washington, D.C.\n            (9) The so-called ``Lincoln cent'' was introduced in 1909 \n        on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse \n        design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.\n            (10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the \n        talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to \n        design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting \n        a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.\n            (11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the ``Lincoln \n        cent'', there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the \n        original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing \n        mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial \n        in Washington, D.C.\n            (12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President \n        Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of \n        the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of \n        1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of \n        the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.\n\nSEC. 3. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.\n\n    (a) In General.--During the year 2009, the Secretary of the \nTreasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following \ndesign specifications:\n            (1) Obverse.--The obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue \n        to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President Abraham \n        Lincoln.\n            (2) Reverse.--The reverse of the coins shall bear 4 \n        different designs each representing a different aspect of the \n        life of Abraham Lincoln, such as--\n                    (A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;\n                    (B) his formative years in Indiana;\n                    (C) his professional life in Illinois; and\n                    (D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.\n    (b) Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in 2009.--\n            (1) Order.--The 1-cent coins to which this section applies \n        shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in \n        subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar \n        quarter of 2009.\n            (2) Number.--The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of \n        such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the \n        number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of the \n        designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.\n    (c) Design Selection.--The designs for the coins specified in this \nsection shall be chosen by the Secretary--\n            (1) after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln \n        Bicentennial Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts; and\n            (2) after review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory \n        Committee.\n\nSEC. 4. REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009.\n\n    The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after December \n31, 2009, shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln's \npreservation of the United States of America as a single and united \ncountry.\n\nSEC. 5. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT AS THE 1909 \n              PENNY.\n\n    The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in 2009 with \nthe exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin contained in 1909 in such \nnumber as the Secretary determines to be appropriate for numismatic \npurposes.\n\nSEC. 6. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n     It is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor David \nBrenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic departure from \nprevious American coinage that should be reproduced, using the original \nform and relief of the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins \nissued in 2009."
