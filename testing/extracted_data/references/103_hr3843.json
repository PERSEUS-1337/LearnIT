FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Hundreds of thousands of obsolete industrial sites \n        nationwide are polluted with medium to low amounts of \n        environmental contamination.\n            (2) Reusing these sites requires cleanup of the \n        contamination, adding costs and uncertainties to the \n        redevelopment process.\n            (3) Left unused, these contaminated sites mean loss of tax \n        revenues and job opportunities for the community and pose \n        potential risks to nearby residents or people who venture onto \n        the site.\n            (4) State efforts to encourage voluntary cleanup and \n        redevelopment of such sites are hindered by Federal \n        requirements for environmental permits to conduct the cleanups \n        and by the lack of Federal certification of such State efforts.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage cleanup and \nredevelopment of contaminated industrial facilities (known as \n``brownfields'') as economically viable alternatives to previously \nundeveloped ``greenfield'' sites.\n\nSEC. 3. CERTIFICATION OF STATE VOLUNTARY CLEANUP PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the \n``Administrator'') shall establish certification criteria for State \nvoluntary cleanup programs at eligible facilities. If a State meets the \ncriteria for certification, the Administrator shall certify the State \nto carry out the cleanup program in such State at eligible facilities \nin lieu of any Federal program that addresses the cleanup of such \nfacilities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or the Solid Waste Disposal \nAct.\n    (b) Biennial Audits and Revocation of State Certification.--The \nAdministrator shall ensure that State programs continue to meet the \nterms of the certification issued pursuant to subsection (a) by \nconducting biennial audits of State voluntary cleanup programs. If the \nAdministrator finds that the State is not administering the program in \naccordance with the terms of the certification, the Administrator shall \nnotify the State of deficiencies and of the Administrator's intention \nto withdraw the State's certification if the deficiencies are not \nresolved within 6 months. Withdrawal of State certification shall not \naffect any cleanup completed and approved by the State as of the date \nof such withdrawal.\n    (c) Specific Criteria.--The Administrator shall require that, in \norder for a State voluntary cleanup program to be certified under \nsubsection (a), the program shall, at a minimum, contain each of the \nfollowing provisions--\n            (1) The program shall provide that only eligible \n        facilities, as described in subsection (d), may participate in \n        the program.\n            (2) The program shall provide adequate opportunities for \n        public participation in the development and implementation of \n        cleanup plans for eligible facilities. Public participation \n        requirements shall include but not be limited to providing \n        opportunity for affected parties to review and comment on \n        cleanup documents and plans, and providing opportunity for \n        public input to the remedy selection process. Affected parties \n        shall include but not be limited to local work force \n        representatives, adjacent community residents, and local \n        environmental and other public interest organizations.\n            (3) The program shall provide technical assistance \n        throughout each voluntary cleanup.\n            (4) The program shall provide adequate oversight and \n        enforcement authority to ensure that the voluntary cleanups \n        comply with Federal and State laws (except permit requirements \n        as provided in subsection (e)).\n            (5) provide for a certification from the State to the owner \n        or prospective purchaser of an eligible facility that the \n        cleanup is complete.\n    (d) Eligible Facilities.--For purposes of this Act, the term \n``eligible facility'' means a facility or property in a State that is \ndetermined by the State to have environmental contamination that--\n            (1) could prevent the timely use, development, or reuse of \n        the facility or property; and\n            (2) is limited in scope and can be comprehensively and \n        readily evaluated.\nSuch term shall not include any of the following:\n            (A) A facility that is eligible for abatement action under \n        section 106 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n        Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980.\n            (B) A facility that, as of the date of the enactment of \n        this Act, is subject to Federal enforcement action under the \n        Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n        Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.).\n            (C) A facility included, or proposed for inclusion, on the \n        National Priorities List or on the comprehensive environmental \n        response, compensation, and liability inventory system \n        (``CERCLIS'') that has been evaluated as high priority under \n        the hazard ranking system.\n            (D) A facility required to have a permit under section 3005 \n        of the Solid Waste Disposal Act that does not have a permit \n        under that section and does not qualify for authorization to \n        operate in interim status under subsection (e) of that section.\n            (E) A land disposal unit with respect to which a closure \n        notification under subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.) is submitted and closure requirements \n        are specified in a closure plan or permit.\n            (F) A facility subject to corrective action under section \n        3004(u) or 3008(h) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. \n        5924(u) or 6928(h)) that is evaluated as high priority under \n        the Environmental Protection Agency's National Corrective \n        Action Priority System as set forth in regulations under \n        subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n            (G) A facility at which assistance for response activities \n        may be obtained pursuant to subtitle I of the Solid Waste \n        Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq.) from the Leaking \n        Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund established under section \n        9508 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n            (H) A facility owned or operated by a department, agency, \n        or instrumentality of the United States.\n    (e) Relationship to Permit Requirements.--No Federal, State, or \nlocal permit shall be required for any cleanup conducted under a State \nvoluntary cleanup program certified under this section, if the cleanup \nis carried out in compliance with the certified program."
