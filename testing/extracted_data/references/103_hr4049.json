FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Due to the end of the Cold War, the United States has \n        not recently conducted underground nuclear testing at the \n        Department of Energy facility known as the Nevada Test Site, \n        Nevada, and the United States does not plan to conduct such \n        testing in the foreseeable future.\n            (2) Because the world political situation is ever-changing \n        and dangerous, it is imperative that the United States remain \n        strong militarily and continue to be a nuclear superpower.\n            (3) It is imperative that the Nevada Test Site be \n        maintained in a full state of readiness to ensure the \n        capability of the nuclear arsenal of the United States.\n            (4) The Nevada Test Site is in a beneficial location for \n        activities suitable for research and development of emerging \n        technologies that will be important to the United States in the \n        21st century.\n            (5) Technology development carried out at the Nevada Test \n        Site should include both private-sector and military projects.\n            (6) The Nevada Test Site can support the stewardship of the \n        Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, the nonproliferation of \n        nuclear weapons, and the technological competitiveness of the \n        United States by providing the environment for nuclear and non-\n        nuclear test and demonstration experiments and projects for \n        government, industry, and academia.\n            (7) The Nevada Test Site can provide the infrastructure to \n        support industrial and civilian tests of environmentally \n        demanding projects and programs.\n            (8) The Nevada Test Site can support the testing and \n        demonstration of environmental clean-up technologies by \n        government and industry.\n            (9) The Nevada Test Site can support the testing of \n        alternative and renewable energy sources for environmentally \n        clean and economically competitive replacements for traditional \n        fossil energy sources and uses in many parts of Nevada and in \n        the United States as a whole.\n            (10) The Nevada Test Site can provide support for \n        disarmament activities such as the demonstration of rocket \n        motor destruction technology and conventional munitions \n        destruction technology.\n            (11) The Nevada Test Site can support non-proliferation \n        experiments in disablement, nuclear forensics, sensors, and \n        verification and monitoring.\n            (12) The Nevada Test Site can support treaty-compliant \n        experiments for stockpile stewardship purposes.\n            (13) The size and remoteness of the Nevada Test Site make \n        the Nevada Test Site well-suited for a multitude of activities \n        associated with the restructuring of the United States \n        military.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to ensure full operational readiness of the underground \n        nuclear testing facilities and infrastructure of the Nevada \n        Test Site;\n            (2) to ensure an appropriate level of funds for such \n        readiness to be maintained;\n            (3) to create a National Test and Demonstration Center of \n        Excellence at the Nevada Test Site for the promotion of \n        disarmament, demilitarization, alternative and renewable energy \n        sources, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, sensor \n        development, and environmentally sensitive technologies; and\n            (4) to ensure the availability of the Nevada Test Site, \n        within appropriate restrictions, for use by private-sector \n        industries seeking to make use of the inherent qualities that \n        make the Nevada Test Site the greatest outdoor laboratory in \n        the world.\n\nSEC. 4. MAINTENANCE OF READINESS CAPABILITY OF NEVADA TEST SITE.\n\n    (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n            (1) In general.--The amount referred to in paragraph (2) is \n        hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy \n        for fiscal year 1995 and each fiscal year thereafter to \n        maintain the operational readiness of the underground nuclear \n        testing facilities and infrastructure of the Nevada Test Site.\n            (2) Authorized amount.--The amount referred to in paragraph \n        (1) is not less than the amount appropriated to the Secretary \n        of Energy for fiscal year 1992 to maintain the operational \n        readiness of the underground nuclear testing facilities and \n        infrastructure of the Nevada Test Site.\n    (b) Staffing Levels.--During fiscal year 1995 and each fiscal year \nthereafter, the Secretary of Energy shall maintain a staffing level at \nthe Nevada Test Site that the Secretary considers sufficient to carry \nout activities under this Act in addition to any other activities \nconducted by the Department of Energy at the Nevada Test Site.\n    (c) Infrastructure Assessments and Activities.--The Secretary of \nEnergy, through the Nevada Test Site Operations Office, shall carry out \nany infrastructure assessments and activities necessary to accommodate \nnew projects and initiatives at the Nevada Test Site.\n\nSEC. 5.
