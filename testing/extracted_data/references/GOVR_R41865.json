    "content": "Black's Law Dictionary defines legislative history as \"the background and events leading to the enactment of a statute, including hearings, committee reports, and floor debates.\"  It also descri bes one of the primary reasons legal, policy, and legislative researchers investigate the legislative history of a particular piece of legislation: \"Legislative history is sometimes recorded so that it can later be used to aid in interpreting the statute.\" However, the purpose of legislative history research is not limited to statutory interpretation. Questions researchers may want to answer through legislative history include  Which committees and Members were involved? How was the legislative language amended as it advanced through the congressional process? How did Members vote on proposed amendments and final passage? To answer these and similar questions, researchers must identify the chronological steps the legislation followed through Congress and the materials that document what happened during each of these steps. This report briefly describes the actions a piece of legislation might undergo during the legislative process and provides information on resources for retrieving legislative history materials. This report focuses on legislative history research, and therefore does not contain detailed information about the legislative process. However, because a general understanding of the legislative process is helpful when compiling a legislative history, overviews of certain congressional actions are provided. Detailed guides on the legislative process for the House and Senate are available online: How Our Laws Are Made, Revised and Updated, by John V. Sullivan Parliamentarian, United States House of Representatives Presented by Mr. Brady of Pennsylvania July 24, 2007 https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/How+Our+Laws+Are+Made+-+Learn+About+the+Legislative+Process Enactment of a Law by Robert B. Dove Parliamentarian, United States Senate Updated: February 1997 https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/Enactment+of+a+Law+-+Learn+About+the+Legislative+Process In addition, there are a number of Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports on various aspects of the legislative process referenced throughout this report and available on CRS's website at http://www.crs.gov . The legislative history resource materials discussed below vary in scope and availability. For example, the Government Printing Office's (GPO's) Federal Digital System (FDsys), through its website http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/home.action , is an online collection of official congressional publications and databases containing texts of legislation, the Congressional Record , House and Senate calendars, committee prints, committee hearings, committee reports, and other material useful for legislative research. However, the information available on these websites is limited to more recent Congresses. By contrast, print publications may be more historically complete, but limited to only one type of document or information. For example, the Congressional Record and its predecessor publications, which are available in print going back to 1789, contain information on procedural actions for legislation and transcripts of the proceedings on the House and Senate floor, but do not contain the text of committee hearings. The references cited below are available online through government sources or in hard copy through CRS or the Law Library of Congress. They are also commonly available at local libraries, law libraries, or federal depository libraries. GPO has a website to assist patrons in finding the nearest depository library, at http://catalog.gpo.gov/fdlpdir/FDLPdir.jsp . References to commercial services that require subscriptions are limited to those available in all congressional offices.  In addition, some stages of the legislative process are more fully documented than others. For example, bills are often debated and amended extensively during their consideration by congressional subcommittees, but these deliberations are not usually transcribed and made widely available. In general, information on subcommittee action is limited to discussion in news accounts or reports from the full committee. In some instances, a legislative history may have already been compiled. There are a few government and commercial sources for compiled legislative histories. Online Sources Proquest Legislative Insight http://www.conquest-leg-insight.com/legislativeinsight/LegHistMain.jsp This commercial service offers compiled legislative histories that typically include bill text, Congressional Record references, committee documents, and miscellaneous publications for public laws enacted starting with the 57 th Congress (1901-1903). Users can search by public law number, Statutes at Large citation, or enacted bill number. Proquest Congressional http://web.lexis-nexis.com/congcomp  Proquest Congressional, a commercial database, has legislative histories from 1969 to the present. Researchers can find legislative history compilations by keywords in the abstract, bill tracking, bill text, floor votes, public laws, United States Code or Statutes at Large . Results can be restricted by words in the title of the legislative history or the Congress. Print Sources Government Accountability Office (GAO) Legislative History Microfiche . This resource contains the legislative history for most public laws from 1921 to 1980. Reprints from the microfiche may be available from CRS, the Law Library of Congress, or at a federal depository library. Committee Prints . On occasion, committees produce legislative histories of enactments within their jurisdiction. Reprints of published copies of committee prints may be available through CRS, the Library of Congress, or at a federal depository library. Bills. Most legislation introduced by a Member of Congress (i.e., the legislation's sponsor) is introduced as a \"bill,\" the general form used for legislation that will have the force of law if enacted. Bills are numbered sequentially in the order they were introduced. Bills introduced in the Senate are preceded by \"S.\"; those in the House by \"H.R.\" Bills remain pending from the time of introduction until final passage or the final adjournment of a Congress (i.e., the numbered two-year convocation of the House and Senate that begins January 3 following each biennial federal election). Bills not enacted during a Congress \"die\"; further legislative consideration requires that they be reintroduced in the next Congress. Joint Resolutions . While bills are used for purposes of general legislation, joint resolutions (S.J.\u00a0Res. or H.J. Res.) are used to propose constitutional amendments and for a variety of special or subordinate purposes, such as continuing appropriations. Except for those proposing constitutional amendments, joint resolutions become law in the same manner as bills. If a legislative measure receives action, GPO publishes versions of the legislative text as it moves through the various stages of the legislative process. These versions include those marked reported, engrossed, engrossed House/Senate amendment, public print, and enrolled. By comparing different bill or resolution texts, researchers can determine at what stage in the legislative process revisions were made. Online Sources Government Printing Office (FDsys) http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=BILLS FDsys enables users to browse or search for bills and resolutions from the 103 rd Congress (1993-1994) forward. Legislative Information System (LIS) http://www.lis.gov Congress.gov http://www.congress.gov LIS is available to congressional researchers. Users can browse or search for bill and resolution texts starting with the 101 st Congress (1989-1990). Congress.gov is available to the general public and covers the same time period for legislative text. American Memory's A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: Bills and Resolutions http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/ The American Memory website contains scanned images of some historical bills and resolutions. Coverage for the House starts with the 6 th Congress (1799-1800) through the 42 nd \u00a0Congress (1871-1872). For the Senate, coverage is from the 16 th Congress (1819-1821) through the 42 nd Congress (1871-1872). Print Sources Print versions of bills are available on microfiche or microfilm through the Law Library of Congress (1789-current) and certain federal depository libraries. At its most fundamental, legislative history tracks congressional action on a piece of legislation and its status within the legislative process. When beginning a legislative history research project, one of the first steps a researcher may want to undertake is locating information on the history of the bill and citations to documents. Through the years, various government and private entities have tracked the history and status of bills. Online Sources LIS http://www.lis.gov Congress.gov http://www.congress.gov LIS is available to congressional offices and provides bill summary and status information on bills and resolutions starting from the 93 rd Congress (1973-1974) to the present. Congress.gov, a public legislative service from the Library of Congress, contains the same information on a bill's history and status. Congressional Calendars http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CCAL House and Senate calendars are published periodically during the session by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate. The calendars provide a list of legislation. In the House calendar, the history and current status of legislation receiving action is summarized. FDsys contains final House and Senate calendars starting from the 104 th Congress (1995-1996) to the present. Print Sources Digest of Public General Bills and Resolutions. The Bill Digest, a publication of the Library of Congress from 1936 until 1990, contains summaries and status of legislation. House and Senate Calendars. Published copies of the calendars are available through CRS, the Law Library of Congress, or at a federal depository library. Congressional Information Service (CIS). A commercial service, the CIS Index lists each public law in the Annual Abstracts volume and references publications concerning the law. These references include a list of congressional hearings, reports, documents, and prints back to 1970. The Legislative Histories volume contains the legislative history information on selected public laws, including dates of congressional debate, back to 1970. The CIS Historical Index contains congressional documents from 1789 through 1972. Legislation is usually referred to a committee after introduction, according to its subject matter. Often, a committee will further refer the legislation to one of its subcommittees. The subcommittees may request reports from government agencies or departments, hold hearings, mark up the bill (meet to propose changes), and report the legislation to the full committee. The full committee may take similar action, with or without prior subcommittee consideration, and report the legislation to its full chamber (i.e., the House or Senate). Hearings. Hearings provide a committee or subcommittee the opportunity to explore topics or legislation. Hearings may include statements of committee Members and interested parties, as well as the testimony of witnesses. GPO publishes hearings made available to them by committees. Online Sources GPO FDsys http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CHRG Through FDsys, researchers can download selected committee hearings starting with the 105 th Congress (1985-1986). Proquest Congressional Hearings Digital Collection http://web.lexis-nexis.com/congcomp Proquest Congressional, a commercial database, has scanned PDF images of published committee hearings from 1824 to the present. Print Sources Print versions of committee hearings are available through CRS and the Law Library of Congress. More recent hearings are available through the House and Senate Document Rooms. Individual hearings may be available through a federal depository library. Reports. Most legislation never proceeds through full committee consideration and remains in committee for the remainder of a Congress. However, committees may, by majority vote, report some bills and resolutions for consideration by the entire chamber. The House requires a written report on the legislation, but the Senate does not. These committee reports can be particularly useful documents for legislative history research because they often describe the purpose of the legislation and summarize or explain specific provisions. The report will also give details on the committee's actions, understandings, and conclusions about the legislation. Changes to existing laws, votes on amendments during markups, and subcommittee information are supplemental material to the committee report that may also be useful for legislative history research. If the legislation was considered by a subcommittee, that information may also be covered in the full committee's report. Committee reports are published by GPO. Sometimes, the reports are reproduced in whole or part by commercial publishers. Committee reports are identified as House Report (H. Rept. or H. Rep.) or Senate Report (S. Rept. or S. Rep.) and given a number (e.g., S.Rept. 107-31 is the 31 st report to the Senate in the 107 th Congress).

USCCAN, a commercial service, reprints the major reports and conference report or portions thereof, for most public laws enacted since 1941, along with the text of the public law. This publication is available through CRS, the Law Library of Congress, and may be in the collection of a federal depository library. Prints and Documents . Committee prints and documents can be used to duplicate research papers or annual reports from executive branch agencies of interest to the committee, papers prepared by the committee staff, reports on investigative and oversight hearings and activities, and analytical information on legislation. Some committees use prints for reproducing compilations of laws that come under their legislative jurisdiction. Committee prints are identified as House Print (H. Prt.) or Senate Print (S. Prt.) and given a number (e.g. Senate Print 111-6 is the sixth numbered print for the Senate in the 111 th Congress). Committee documents are identified as House Document (H. Doc.) or Senate Document (S. Doc.) and given a number (e.g. House Document 111-2 is the second numbered document for the House in the 111 th Congress). Online Sources GPO FDsys\u2014Committee Prints http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CPRT FDsys has House and Senate committee prints starting from the 105 th Congress (1997-1998).

Print Sources Copies of committee prints and documents are available through CRS and the subject collections of the Library of Congress. More recent prints and documents may be available through the House and Senate Document rooms. Individual prints and documents may be available through a federal depository library. Legislation may be brought to the floor of the respective chambers for consideration by the full House or Senate. The length and scope of debate on the floor of Congress (e.g., which amendments, if any, will be considered) are governed by the rules of the respective chambers. For example, in the House, the measure is sometimes considered under the terms of a \"special rule,\" that is, a simple resolution reported by the Committee on Rules, which may be accompanied by a written report specifying which amendments can be offered on the floor. Votes on amendments and final passage may or may not be in the form of a formal recorded vote, in which the vote of each Member is identified. The debates are published in the Congressional Record . Recorded votes, called \"roll call votes,\" are published in the Congressional Record but they can also be found through other sources, such as the Clerk of the House website, the Secretary of the Senate, and commercial publishers. After legislation is passed by one chamber, it is sent to the other chamber for action, where it is often referred to committee. If the second chamber chooses to consider the legislation and passes it without change, it is submitted to the President. Remarks on the House or Senate floor can be useful for legislative history research because Members will often speak to the purpose of the legislation, emphasize or clarify certain provisions in the legislation; or raise concerns about the potential impact in their statements. In addition to debate on passage, sponsors and cosponsors may submit introductory remarks and materials on legislation into the Congressional Record . These remarks may explain the reasons for, and expected effects of, the legislation. The Congressional Record is the official record of the proceedings and debates of Congress and contains a summary of the daily proceedings of the House and Senate. Predecessor publications for the Congressional Record are the Congressional Globe (1833-1873), Register of Debates in Congress (1825-1837), and Annals of the Congress of the United States (1789-1824). Currently, there are two editions of the Congressional Record published by GPO\u2014the daily edition and the permanent edition. The daily edition is published each day Congress is in session and the pages are lettered and numbered by chamber (e.g., Senate pages begin with \"S\" and House pages begin with \"H\"). The permanent or \"bound\" edition is published years later. It is continuously paginated (e.g., the pages are renumbered and the \"S\" and \"H\" designations are dropped) and the text may have been edited.

If there are differences between the House and Senate versions of a piece of legislation, the last chamber to adopt its version may send its language back to the other chamber for further consideration in amended form. The first chamber may take up the amended version, or the two chambers may establish a conference committee to reach agreement on a common version. Each chamber appoints conferees, usually members of the original reporting committees, who may take up only those areas in disagreement. A majority of the Senate conferees and a majority of the House conferees must agree on what to report back to their respective chambers. Upon reaching agreement, a conference committee usually issues a report (usually printed as a House Report) that contains two parts: the agreed upon text and a joint explanatory statement. The joint explanatory statement in the conference report may discuss the differences between the House and Senate passed language, discuss the reasons certain provisions were chosen over others, and provide additional information on the purpose of the legislation. If passed by both chambers in identical form, the legislation is sent to the President. Conference committee reports are available in the same formats and sources as regular committee reports. They can also be found in the Congressional Record . The President may approve a bill or resolution, veto it, or take no action. If the President signs a bill into law, he may issue a signing statement. If no action is taken, the legislation becomes public law after 10 days (Sundays excepted) unless final adjournment of Congress has occurred, in which case the legislation does not become law (known as a \"pocket veto\"). If the President vetoes the legislation, Congress may override the veto. Two-thirds of the House of Representatives and two-thirds of the Senate must vote to override the veto. If the two chambers vote to override the veto, the legislation becomes law without the President's signature.
