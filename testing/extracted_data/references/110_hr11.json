    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``NSA Oversight Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On September 11, 2001, acts of treacherous violence \n        were committed against the United States and its citizens.\n            (2) Such acts render it both necessary and appropriate that \n        the United States exercise its right to self-defense by \n        protecting United States citizens both at home and abroad.\n            (3) The Federal Government has a duty to pursue al Qaeda \n        and other enemies of the United States with all available \n        tools, including the use of electronic surveillance, to thwart \n        future attacks on the United States and to destroy the enemy.\n            (4) The President of the United States possesses the \n        inherent authority to engage in electronic surveillance of the \n        enemy outside of the United States consistent with his \n        authority as Commander-in-Chief under Article II of the \n        Constitution.\n            (5) Congress possesses the authority to regulate electronic \n        surveillance within the United States.\n            (6) The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees to \n        the American people the right ``to be secure in their persons, \n        houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \n        seizures'' and provides that courts shall issue ``warrants'' to \n        authorize searches and seizures, based upon probable cause.\n            (7) The Supreme Court has consistently held for nearly 40 \n        years that the monitoring and recording of private \n        conversations constitutes a ``search and seizure'' within the \n        meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n            (8) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 \n        U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) and chapters 119 and 121 of title 18, \n        United States Code, were enacted to provide the legal authority \n        for the Federal Government to engage in searches of Americans \n        in connection with criminal investigations, intelligence \n        gathering, and counterintelligence.\n            (9) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and \n        specified provisions of the Federal criminal code, were \n        expressly enacted as the ``exclusive means by which electronic \n        surveillance ... may be conducted'' domestically pursuant to \n        law (18 U.S.C. 2511(2)(f)).\n            (10) Warrantless electronic surveillance of Americans \n        inside the United States conducted without congressional \n        authorization may have a serious impact on the civil liberties \n        of citizens of the United States.\n            (11) United States citizens, such as journalists, \n        academics, and researchers studying global terrorism, who have \n        made international phone calls subsequent to the terrorist \n        attacks of September 11, 2001, and are law-abiding citizens, \n        may have the reasonable fear of being the subject of such \n        surveillance.\n            (12) Since the nature and criteria of the National Security \n        Agency (NSA) program is highly classified and unknown to the \n        public, many other Americans who make frequent international \n        calls, such as Americans engaged in international business, \n        Americans with family overseas, and others, have a legitimate \n        concern they may be the inadvertent targets of eavesdropping.\n            (13) The President has sought and signed legislation \n        including the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \n        Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism \n        (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-56), and the \n        Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act of 2004 \n        (Public Law 108-458), that have expanded authorities under the \n        Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n            (14) It may be necessary and desirable to amend the Foreign \n        Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to address new challenges \n        in the Global War on Terrorism. The President should submit a \n        request for legislation to Congress to amend the Foreign \n        Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 if the President desires \n        that the electronic surveillance authority provided by such Act \n        be further modified.\n            (15) The Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public \n        Law 107-40), passed by Congress on September 14, 2001, \n        authorized military action against those responsible for the \n        attacks on September 11, 2001, but did not contain legal \n        authorization nor approve of domestic electronic surveillance \n        not authorized by chapters 119 or 121 of title 18, United \n        States Code, or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n        1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3. REITERATION OF CHAPTERS 119 AND 121 OF TITLE 18, UNITED STATES \n              CODE, AND THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT OF \n              1978 AS THE EXCLUSIVE MEANS BY WHICH DOMESTIC ELECTRONIC \n              SURVEILLANCE MAY BE CONDUCTED.\n\n    (a) Exclusive Means.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nchapters 119 and 121 of title 18, United States Code, and the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) shall be \nthe exclusive means by which electronic surveillance may be conducted.\n    (b) Future Congressional Action.--Subsection (a) shall apply until \nspecific statutory authorization for electronic surveillance, other \nthan as an amendment to chapters 119 or 121 of title 18, United States \nCode, or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. \n1801 et seq.), is enacted.
