FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Park Service was established to conserve \n        the national parks, their scenery, natural and historic \n        objects, and wildlife for public enjoyment, in such manner and \n        by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment \n        of future generations.\n            (2) The central purpose of the establishment of our \n        national parks is being challenged by chronic funding \n        shortfalls, which have created annual shortfalls in operational \n        funding that exceed $800,000,000, and have amassed a \n        maintenance backlog estimated by the Congressional Research \n        Service to be between $4,520,000,000 and $6,800,000,000.\n            (3) Without providing the Park Service the resources \n        necessary to operate and maintain our national parks, future \n        generations will--\n                    (A) receive diminished visitor services;\n                    (B) experience a continually weakening system that \n                is less and less able to fulfill its mission; and\n                    (C) inherit a National Park System that has been \n                left to them in worse condition than it was left to \n                their ancestors.\n            (4) The annual Congressional appropriations process has \n        proved insufficient to fully address the debilitating funding \n        shortfalls of the national parks, making it necessary to \n        supplement what the appropriations process is able to \n        accomplish.\n            (5) It is necessary to ensure that fiscal resources devoted \n        to the national parks are spent wisely and effectively, making \n        strong congressional oversight over annual appropriations \n        extremely important.\n            (6) Congress can enhance the resources available for \n        national park operations and ensure adequate oversight over \n        Park Service spending by removing from the appropriations \n        process a series of funding responsibilities that are outside \n        the core operating budgets for the national parks.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to eliminate the annual \noperating deficit and the maintenance backlog in the national parks by \nthe centennial anniversary of the National Park System by enabling \nCongress to focus on overseeing and fully funding the core operations \nof the national parks in the annual appropriations process.\n\n                        TITLE I--CENTENNIAL FUND\n\nSEC. 101.
