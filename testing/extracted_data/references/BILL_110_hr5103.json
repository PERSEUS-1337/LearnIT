FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) The majority of rubber used by industry in the United \n        States is synthetic rubber that has been derived from \n        petroleum.\n            (2) The tire industry is the largest consumer of rubber in \n        the United States, using over 3 billion pounds of rubber \n        annually to produce over 250 million tires.\n            (3) Recycled rubber from scrap tires can be used in the \n        production of new tires at loadings exceeding 10 percent of the \n        weight of rubber in the tire if the particle size of the \n        recycled rubber is extremely fine (80 mesh/177 microns or \n        finer) and the particles are free from impurities such as steel \n        and fiber.\n            (4) On average, the United States can save a gallon of oil \n        for every tire produced incorporating 10 percent recycled \n        rubber.\n            (5) On average, for every pound of recycled rubber used as \n        an alternative to synthetic rubber, the United States will \n        prevent a pound of carbon dioxide from being released into the \n        atmosphere.\n            (6) An independent study has determined that air \n        permeability in a standard tire can be reduced by up to 50 \n        percent when using recycled content. If recycled content is \n        used in every passenger car in the United States, it would \n        result in a fuel savings of up to 750 million gallons per year.\n\nSEC. 3.
