FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The operation of dams and other water diversion \n        projects are for the benefit of the American public. They \n        provide inexpensive energy, flood control, water storage for \n        municipal and agricultural purposes, and opportunities for \n        recreational boating and enjoyment. The construction and \n        operation of these Federal water resources development projects \n        have had impacts on many water systems and their respective \n        fish populations, resulting in the need to build and operate \n        fish hatcheries to mitigate for aquatic resources affected by \n        these projects.\n            (2) In accordance with the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 \n        (16 U.S.C. 742a et seq.), the Fish and Wildlife Coordination \n        Act (16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.), the Watershed Protection and Flood \n        Prevention Act (16 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), and the National \n        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the \n        United States Fish and Wildlife Service has established policy \n        (501 FW 2) to seek to mitigate for fish, wildlife, and their \n        habitats, and uses thereof, from the effects of land and water \n        developments.\n            (3) The Service currently operates fish hatcheries that are \n        involved in mitigation fishery activities related to \n        construction and operation of Federal water resources \n        development projects.\n            (4) Inconsistency in authorities to construct and operate \n        Federal water resources development projects has led to a \n        myriad of mechanisms for funding and conducting Federal \n        mitigation fishery activities. In most cases, Federal water \n        project development agencies fund mitigation fishery costs. In \n        some cases, the Service expends its appropriations to offset or \n        completely pay for mitigation fishery costs.\n            (5) The Service is the Federal agency through which a water \n        development agency will negotiate to provide reimbursement \n        funding or goods and services (or both) to compensate for the \n        impact of Federal water development projects on aquatic \n        resources.\n            (6) The water development agency should bear the financial \n        responsibility for mitigation fishery costs incurred by the \n        Service. Where applicable, the water development agency should \n        include the costs of fisheries mitigation caused by a \n        particular water development project as set forth in a fishery \n        mitigation plan, when eliciting reimbursement from a power \n        management agency for the ongoing cost of maintaining and \n        operating that water development project.\n\nSEC. 3. MITIGATION FISHERY ACTIVITIES.\n\n    (a) Imposition of Charges.--The Director of the Service shall \nimpose a charge for conducting mitigation fishery activities.\n    (b) Fishery Mitigation Plans.--\n            (1) Development.--A charge imposed by the Service under \n        subsection (a) shall be paid by a water development agency in \n        accordance with a fishery mitigation plan developed and \n        approved by the Director and the head of the agency.\n            (2) Contents.--A fishery mitigation plan developed under \n        this subsection shall--\n                    (A) describe the long-term goals and annual targets \n                under which the Service will conduct mitigation fishery \n                activities in connection with projects carried out by a \n                water development agency;\n                    (B) establish charges to be imposed by the Service \n                on the agency for conducting the mitigation fishery \n                activities;

availability of amounts.--Funds \n        paid to the Service under this subsection shall--\n                    (A) be credited to the appropriation of the Service \n                initially charged for providing the service for which \n                the payment is being made;\n                    (B) be available to the Service for expenditure in \n                amounts specified in appropriations Acts; and\n                    (C) remain available until expended.\n            (3) Projects without fishery mitigation plans.--In the \n        absence of a fishery mitigation plan, the Service may conduct \n        mitigation fishery activities and receive funding from a water \n        development agency for the activities based on the terms and \n        conditions that applied with respect to the activities in the \n        prior fiscal year.\n    (e) Services Provided to Power Management Agencies.--If a water \ndevelopment agency collects reimbursements from a power management \nagency for the ongoing costs of maintaining and operating a Federal \nwater resources development project, the water development agency may \ninclude, in those ongoing costs, the costs associated with the \nproject's fishery mitigation activities.\n    (f) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Mitigation fishery activities.--The term ``mitigation \n        fishery activities'' means rearing and stocking of native and \n        nonnative fish to replace or maintain fishery resources or \n        harvest levels (or both) lost as a result of a Federal water \n        resources development project, and includes project planning, \n        population assessment and evaluation, genetic monitoring, \n        broodstock development, and fish health sampling.\n            (2) Mitigation fishery costs.--The term ``mitigation \n        fishery costs'' means the expenditures necessary to operate, \n        maintain, and rehabilitate mitigation fishery facilities and to \n        conduct mitigation fishery activities, and includes personnel, \n        transportation, utilities, contractual services, fish feed, \n        supplies, equipment, routine maintenance, deferred maintenance, \n        fish eggs, technical support, fish health, management and \n        administration, planning, and hatchery product evaluations.\n            (3) Mitigation fishery facility.--The term ``mitigation \n        fishery facility'' means a facility described in subsection (g) \n        that is owned and operated by the Service through the National \n        Fish Hatchery System for the purpose, either wholly or \n        substantially in part, of conducting mitigation fishery \n        activities.\n            (4) Service.--The term ``Service'' means the United States \n        Fish and Wildlife Service.\n            (5) Water development agency.--The term ``water development \n        agency'' means the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of \n        Reclamation, or the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n    (g) Listing of Mitigation Fishery Facilities.--The mitigation \nfishery facilities referred to in subsection (f) are as follows:\n            (1) In Arkansas--\n                    (A) Greers Ferry National Fish Hatchery;
