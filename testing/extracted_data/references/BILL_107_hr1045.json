FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The greater deployment of distributed energy resources \n        can help alleviate bottlenecks and deficiencies in the nation's \n        energy production and delivery system, and improve power \n        quality and reliability, while bringing more efficient and \n        environmentally responsible energy resources into the \n        mainstream.\n            (2) The United States needs to ensure the rapid deployment \n        of new power generation technologies in order to meet the \n        growing demand for electricity in the `new economy,' while at \n        the same time paying careful attention to improving energy \n        efficiency and reducing pollution from energy production.\n            (3) The United States is poised to be a world leader in the \n        design and manufacture of distributed energy resources \n        technology.\n            (4) The current regulatory environment serves as a \n        disincentive to the deployment of distributed energy resources \n        in many parts of the country, due to the lack of consistent \n        policies and procedures for the interconnection of distributed \n        energy resources to the local electric grid.\n            (5) Existing tax treatment of distributed energy resources \n        also creates difficulties for the installation of these \n        technologies.\n            (6) The Federal Government needs a more coordinated program \n        for research, development and demonstration of distributed \n        energy resources.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to lower energy costs \nto consumers, increase electric system reliability, create a more \ndiverse and robust energy network, and provide energy efficiency and \nenvironmental improvements, through the rapid development and \ndeployment of distributed energy resources.\n\n       TITLE I--INTERCONNECTION OF LOCAL DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES\n\nSEC. 101.
