SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Accountability in \nCorporate Political Activity Act of 2010''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC \n        allows a corporation to have increased access to the election \n        process by permitting unlimited disbursements from a \n        corporation's general treasury funds for the purpose of \n        political advocacy.\n            (2) As established in the Citizens United case, the Court \n        rejected the argument that political speech of corporations or \n        other associations should be treated differently under the \n        First Amendment simply because such associations are not \n        ``natural persons'', thereby granting corporations the same \n        First Amendment rights as individuals regarding political \n        advocacy.\n            (3) In the United States, 48 States prohibit individuals \n        from voting while incarcerated, and 2 States permanently bar \n        individuals convicted of a felony from voting.\n            (4) Unlike individuals, corporations are not currently \n        subject to any form of disenfranchisement from the political \n        process due to the conviction of a crime.\n            (5) Corporations should be subject to similar regulations \n        and punishments as individuals for violating the law and the \n        public's trust.\n\nSEC. 2.
