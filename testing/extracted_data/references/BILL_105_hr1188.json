ZERO DISCHARGE OF TOXIC PERSISTENT AND BIOACCUMULATIVE \n              SUBSTANCES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Substances that persist or bioaccumulate, or both, in \n        the environment build to higher and higher concentration over \n        time, reaching their greatest levels in the tissues of species \n        high on the food chain, including humans.\n            (2) Toxic substances that persist or bioaccumulate, or \n        both, in the environment are biologically active in \n        infinitesimal quantities, causing reproductive failure, birth \n        defects, developmental impairment, hormonal disruption, \n        behavioral disorders, immune suppression, and cancer at low \n        doses, and mixtures of these substances may cause these effects \n        at even lower doses.\n            (3) Regulatory approaches that permit even limited \n        production and discharge of toxic substances that persist or \n        bioaccumulate, or both, in the environment result in the \n        accumulation of these substances in the environment and food \n        chain over time and subsequent damage to the health of humans \n        and other species.\n            (4) The most favored method of preventing the continued \n        contamination of the environment from persistent or \n        bioaccumulative toxic substances is to phaseout their \n        production and use over time and to replace these substances or \n        the processes that produce them, or both, with safer \n        alternatives.\n            (5) Among the persistent and bioaccumulative toxic \n        substances of greatest concern are organochlorines discharged \n        in the production of pulp and paper as a result of the use of \n        chlorine or any other chlorinated oxidizing agent in the pulp \n        and paper manufacturing process.\n            (6) The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the \n        United States and Canada concludes that ``the discharge of \n        toxic substances in toxic amounts be prohibited and the \n        discharge of any or all persistent toxic substances be \n        virtually eliminated''.\n            (7) In the Sixth Biennial Report on Great Lakes Water \n        Quality, the International Joint Commission on Great Lakes \n        Water Quality concluded as follows: ``The concepts of virtual \n        elimination and zero discharge are consistent and a clear \n        statement or direction to take to achieve the Agreement's \n        purpose. The overall strategy or aim regarding persistent toxic \n        substances is virtual elimination, and the tactic or method to \n        be used to achieve the aim is through zero input or discharge \n        of those substances created as a result of human activity.''.\n    (b) Zero Discharge of Organochlorine Compounds, Byproducts, and \nMetabolites.--Title III of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \nU.S.C. 1311-1330) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 321.
