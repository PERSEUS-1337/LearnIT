FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The manufacturing sector is an important driver of the \n        United States economy, contributing almost 30 percent of our \n        economic growth during the 1990's, and twice the productivity \n        growth of the service sector during that period.\n            (2) The manufacturing sector contributes significantly to \n        our Nation's development of new products and technologies for \n        world markets, performing almost 60 percent of all research and \n        development in the United States over the past two decades.\n            (3) The manufacturing sector provides high quality jobs, \n        with average weekly wages in 2002 nearly 26 percent higher than \n        jobs in the service sector.\n            (4) The manufacturing growth creates a significant number \n        of jobs and investments in other sectors of the economy, and \n        this ``multiplier effect'' is reckoned by economists to be \n        larger (2.43 to 1) than for any other significant sector of the \n        economy.\n            (5) The ``jobless recovery'' from the recent recession has \n        witnessed the worst job slump since the Great Depression and \n        the weakest employment recovery on record.\n            (6) The manufacturing sector has been hit the hardest by \n        the jobless recovery, with more than 2,700,000 jobs lost since \n        July 2000, accounting for nearly 90 percent of the total United \n        States jobs lost.\n            (7) A significant factor in the loss of valuable United \n        States manufacturing jobs is the difficulty faced by United \n        States manufacturers in competing effectively against lower \n        priced foreign products.\n            (8) A significant obstacle to United States manufacturers \n        in competing against foreign manufacturers is the practice of \n        some governments of intervening aggressively in currency \n        markets to maintain their own currencies at artificially low \n        valuations, thus subsidizing their export sales and raising \n        price barriers to imports from the United States.\n            (9) Certain Asian countries exemplify this practice. China, \n        Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan together have accumulated \n        approximately $1,200,000,000,000 in foreign currency reserves, \n        about \\1/2\\ of the world's total reserves. The vast majority of \n        these reserves, perhaps as high as 90 percent, are in dollars. \n        These same 4 countries account for 60 percent of the United \n        States world trade deficit in manufactured goods. These \n        reserves are symptomatic of a strategy of intervention to \n        manipulate currency values.\n            (10) The People's Republic of China is particularly \n        aggressive in intervening to maintain the value of its \n        currency, the renminbi, at an artificially low rate. China \n        maintains this rate by mandating foreign exchange sales at its \n        central bank at a fixed exchange rate against the dollar, in \n        effect, pegging the renminbi at this rate. This low rate \n        represents a significant reason why China has contributed the \n        most to our trade deficit in manufactured goods. The United \n        States trade deficit with China increased from $57,000,000,000 \n        in 1998 to $103,000,000,000 in 2002, while China accumulated \n        dollar reserves totaling over $345,000,000,000 as of June 2003, \n        keeping the value of the renminbi essentially flat since 1994.\n            (11) Economists estimate that as a result of this \n        manipulation of the Chinese currency, the renminbi is \n        undervalued by between 15 and 40 percent, effectively creating \n        a 15- to 40-percent subsidy for Chinese exports and giving \n        Chinese manufacturers a significant price advantage over United \n        States and other competitors.\n            (12) Japan held foreign currency reserves worth \n        $526,600,000,000 as of June 2003, and for the previous 6 months \n        increased its reserves by an average of $12,500,000,000 per \n        month. Experts estimate that the yen is undervalued by \n        approximately 20 percent or more, giving Japanese manufacturers \n        a significant price advantage over United States competitors.\n            (13) In addition to being placed at a competitive \n        disadvantage by foreign competitors' exports that are unfairly \n        subsidized by strategically undervalued currencies, United \n        States manufacturers also may face significant nontariff \n        barriers to their own exports to these same countries. For \n        example, in China a complex system involving that nation's \n        value added tax and special tax rebates ensures that \n        semiconductor devices imported into China are taxed at 17 \n        percent while domestic devices are effectively taxed at 6 \n        percent.\n            (14) The United States has the right and power to redress \n        unfair competitive practices in international trade involving \n        currency manipulation.\n            (15) Under section 3004 of the Omnibus Trade and \n        Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Secretary of the Treasury is \n        required to determine whether any country is manipulating the \n        rate of exchange between its currency and the dollar for the \n        purpose of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments \n        or gaining unfair advantage in international trade. If such \n        violations are found, the Secretary of the Treasury is required \n        to undertake negotiations with any country that has a \nsignificant trade surplus.\n            (16) Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the \n        International Monetary Fund prohibits currency manipulation by \n        a member for the purposes of gaining an unfair competitive \n        advantage over other members, and the related surveillance \n        provision defines ``manipulation'' to include ``protracted \n        large-scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n        market''.\n            (17) Under Article XV of the Exchange Agreements of the \n        General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, all contracting parties \n        ``shall not, by exchange action, frustrate the intent of the \n        provisions of this Agreement, nor by trade action, the intent \n        of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary \n        Fund''. Such actions are actionable violations. The intent of \n        the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Exchange Agreement, \n        as stated in the preamble of that Agreement, includes the \n        objective of ``entering into reciprocal and mutually \n        advantageous arrangements directed to substantial reduction of \n        tariffs and other barriers to trade,'' and currency \n        manipulation may constitute a trade barrier disruptive to \n        reciprocal and mutually advantageous trade arrangements.\n            (18) Deliberate currency manipulation by nations to \n        significantly undervalue their currencies also may be \n        interpreted as a violation of the Agreement on Subsidies and \n        Countervailing Measures of the World Trade Organization (as \n        described in section 101(d)(12)) of the Uruguay Round \n        Agreements Act, which could lead to action and remedy under the \n        World Trade Organization dispute settlement procedures.\n            (19) Deliberate, large-scale intervention by governments in \n        currency markets to significantly undervalue their currencies \n        may be a nullification and impairment of trade benefits \n        precluded under Article XXIII of the General Agreement on \n        Tariffs and Trade, and subject to remedy.\n            (20) The United States Trade Representative also has \n        authority to pursue remedial actions under section 301 of the \n        Trade Act of 1974.\n            (21) The United States has special rights to take action to \n        redress market disruption under section 406 of the Trade Act of \n        1974 adopted pursuant to the provisions of the United States-\n        China Bilateral Agreement on World Trade Organization \n        Accession.\n            (22) While large-scale manipulation of currencies by \n        certain major trading partners to achieve an unfair competitive \n        advantage is one of the most pervasive barriers faces by the \n        manufacturing sector in the United States, other factors are \n        contributing to the decline of manufacturing and small and mid-\n        sized manufacturing firms in the United States, including but \n        not limited to non-tariff trade barriers, lax enforcement of \n        existing trade agreements, and weak or under utilized \n        government support for trade promotion.\n\nSEC. 3. NEGOTIATION PERIOD REGARDING CURRENCY NEGOTIATIONS.\n\n    Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall \nbegin bilateral and multilateral negotiations for a 90-day period with \nthose governments of nations determined to be engaged most egregiously \nin currency manipulation, as defined in section 7, to seek a prompt and \norderly end to such currency manipulation and to ensure that the \ncurrencies of these countries are freely traded on international \ncurrency markets, or are established at a level that reflects a more \nappropriate and accurate market value. The President shall seek support \nin this process from international agencies and other nations and \nregions adversely affected by these currency practices.\n\nSEC. 4. FINDINGS OF FACT AND REPORT REGARDING CURRENCY MANIPULATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--During the 90-day negotiation period described in \nsection 3, the International Trade Commission shall--\n            (1) ascertain and develop the full facts and details \n        concerning how countries have acted to manipulate their \n        currencies to increase their exports to the United States and \n        limit their imports of United States products;\n            (2) quantify the extent of this currency manipulation;\n            (3) examine in detail how these currency practices have \n        affected and will continue to affect United States \n        manufacturers and United States trade levels, both for imports \n        and exports;\n            (4) review whether and to what extent reduction of currency \n        manipulation and the accumulation of dollar-denominated \n        currency reserves and public debt instruments might adversely \n        affect United States interest rates and public debt financing;\n            (5) make a determination of any and all available \n        mechanisms for redress under applicable international trade \n        treaties and agreements, including the Articles of Agreement of \n        the International Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on \n        Tariffs and Trade, the World Trade Organization Agreements, and \n        United States trade laws; and\n            (6) undertake other appropriate evaluations of the issues \n        described in paragraphs (1) through (5).\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the International Trade Commission shall provide a detailed \nreport to the President, the United States Trade Representative, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, and the appropriate congressional committees \non the findings made as a result of the reviews undertaken under \nparagraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 5. INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CURRENCY MANIPULATION.\n\n    At the end of the 90-day negotiation period provided for in section \n3, if agreements are not reached by the President to promptly end \ncurrency manipulation, the President shall institute proceedings under \nthe relevant provisions of international law and United States trade \nlaws including sections 301 and 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 with \nrespect to those countries that, based on the findings of the \nInternational Trade Commission under section 4, continue to engage in \nthe most egregious currency manipulation. In addition to seeking a \nprompt end to currency manipulation, the President shall seek \nappropriate damages and remedies for the Nation's manufacturers and \nother affected parties. If the President does not institute action, the \nPresident shall, not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, provide to the appropriate congressional committees a \ndetailed explanation and accounting of precisely why the President has \ndetermined not to institute action.\n\nSEC. 6. ADDITIONAL REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n    (a) National Security.--Within 90 days of the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary of Defense shall provide a detailed report to \nthe appropriate congressional committees evaluating the effects on our \nnational security of countries engaging in significant currency \nmanipulations, and the effect of such manipulation on critical \nmanufacturing sectors such as semiconductors.\n    (b) Other Unfair Trade Practices.--Within 90 days of the date of \nenactment of this Act, the United States Trade Representative and the \nInternational Trade Commission shall evaluate and report in detail to \nthe appropriate congressional committees on other trade practices and \ntrade barriers by major East Asian trading nations potentially in \nviolation of international trade agreements, including the practice of \nmaintaining a value-added or other tax regime that effectively \ndiscriminates against imports by underpricing domestically produced \ngoods.\n    (c) Trade Enforcement.--Within 90 days of the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the United States Trade Representative and the International \nTrade Commission shall report in detail to the appropriate \ncongressional committees on steps that could be taken to significantly \nimprove trade enforcement efforts against unfair trade practices by \ncompetitor trading nations, including making recommendations for \nadditional support for trade enforcement efforts.\n    (d) Trade Promotion.--Within 90 days of the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretaries of State and Commerce, and the United States \nTrade Representative, shall prepare a detailed report with \nrecommendations on steps that could be undertaken to significantly \nimprove trade promotion for United States goods and services, including \nrecommendations on additional support to improve trade promotion.\n\nSEC. 7. CURRENCY MANIPULATION DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``currency manipulation'' means--\n            (1) large-scale manipulation of exchange rates by a nation \n        in order to gain an unfair competitive advantage as stated in \n        Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the International \n        Monetary Fund and related surveillance provisions;\n            (2) sustained, large-scale currency intervention in one \n        direction, through mandatory foreign exchange sales at a \n        nation's central bank at a fixed exchange rate; or\n            (3) other mechanisms, used to maintain a currency at a \n        fixed exchange rate relative to another currency."
