SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Pool and Spa \nSafety Act''.\n    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Recommended swimming pool safety standards.\nSec. 4. State swimming pool safety grant program.\nSec. 5. National education program.\nSec. 6. Definitions.\nSec. 7. CPSC reports.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) drowning is the leading cause of death in children \n        under 4 and the second leading cause of death in children 14 \n        and under in the United States;\n            (2) many children drown due to pool and spa drowning and \n        entrapment, such as Virginia Graeme Baker, who at age 7 drowned \n        by entrapment in a residential spa, and Preston de Ibern, who \n        at age 5 nearly drowned and was left permanently brain damaged, \n        finally succumbing to his catastrophic health care issues when \n        he was 12 years old;\n            (3) in 2003, 782 children ages 14 and under died as a \n        result of unintentional drowning;\n            (4) from 1985 to 2004, at least 33 children ages 14 and \n        under died as a result of pool and spa entrapment;\n            (5) adult supervision at all aquatic venues is a critical \n        safety factor in preventing children from drowning; and\n            (6) research studies show that the installation and proper \n        use of barriers or fencing, as well as additional layers of \n        protection, could substantially reduce the number of childhood \n        residential swimming pool drownings and near drownings.\n\nSEC. 3. RECOMMENDED SWIMMING POOL SAFETY STANDARDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Safety standards.--Within 90 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Commission shall issue an advance \n        notice of proposed rulemaking to establish recommended minimum \n        State law standards for swimming pools and spas with respect \n        to--\n                    (A) enclosure of the pool or spa by barriers to \n                entry that will effectively prevent small children from \n                gaining unsupervised access to the pool or spa; and\n                    (B) devices and systems designed to prevent \n                entrapment of children by pool or spa drains.\n            (2) Deadline.--The Commission shall issue the recommended \n        minimum standards as a final rule within 18 months after it \n        issues the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.\n            (3) Status of standards.--\n                    (A) In general.--The standards promulgated by the \n                Commission under this section--\n                            (i) shall be advisory in nature;\n                            (ii) shall not prevent the Commission from \n                        subsequently promulgating standards regulating \n                        pool and spa safety or from relying on an \n                        applicable national performance standard;\n                            (iii) shall not be promulgated as a \n                        consumer product safety rule;
