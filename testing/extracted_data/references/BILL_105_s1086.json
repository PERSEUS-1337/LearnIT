PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to support the autonomous governance of Hong Kong and \n        the future well-being of the Hong Kong people by ensuring the \n        continuity of United States laws with respect to Hong Kong \n        after its reversion to the People's Republic of China on July \n        1, 1997; and\n            (2) to outline circumstances under which the President of \n        the United States could modify the application of United States \n        laws with respect to Hong Kong if the People's Republic of \n        China fails to honor its commitment to give the Special \n        Administrative Region of Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Joint Declaration of the Government of the United \n        Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the \n        Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of \n        Hong Kong, done at Beijing on December 19, 1984, is a binding \n        international agreement that sets forth the commitments made by \n        both governments on the reversion of Hong Kong to the People's \n        Republic of China on July 1, 1997.\n            (2) The People's Republic of China in the Joint Declaration \n        pledges, among other things, that ``the Hong Kong Special \n        Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, \n        except in foreign and defence affairs . . .,'' that basic human \n        rights and freedoms ``will be ensured by law . . .,'' and that \n        ``[t]he legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative \n        Region shall be constituted by elections.''.\n            (3) Senior government officials of the People's Republic of \n        China have repeatedly assured a smooth transfer of Hong Kong to \n        Chinese sovereignty, a successful implementation of the ``one \n        country, two systems'' policy, long-term prosperity for Hong \n        Kong, and continued respect for the basic rights of the Hong \n        Kong people.\n            (4) Despite guaranteeing the autonomous governance of Hong \n        Kong, several official acts and statements by senior officials \n        of the Government of the People's Republic of China reflect an \n        attempt to infringe upon the current and future levels of \n        autonomy in Hong Kong. These acts or statements include--\n                    (A) initial proposals, which were later withdrawn, \n                by officials of the Government of the People's Republic \n                of China to obtain confidential files on civil servants \n                of the Hong Kong Government or require such civil \n                servants to take ``loyalty oaths'';\n                    (B) the decision of the Government of the People's \n                Republic of China to dissolve the democratically \n                elected Legislative Council on July 1, 1997, and the \n                appointment of a provisional legislature in December of \n                1996;\n                    (C) the delineation by officials concerning the \n                types of speech and association that will be permitted \n                by the Government of the People's Republic of China \n                after the reversion;\n                    (D) initial warnings, which were later withdrawn, \n                to religious institutions not to hold certain \n                gatherings after the reversion; and\n                    (E) the decision on February 23, 1997, of the \n                Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of \n                the People's Republic of China to repeal or amend \n                certain Hong Kong ordinances, including the Bill of \n                Rights Ordinance, the Societies Ordinance of 1992 \n                (relating to freedom of association), and the Public \n                Order Ordinance of 1995 (relating to freedom of \n                assembly).\n            (5) Despite commitments in the Joint Declaration \n        guaranteeing the autonomous governance of Hong Kong, several \n        official acts of the Government of the United Kingdom have \n        damaged prospects for the future autonomy of Hong Kong. These \n        acts include--\n                    (A) the conclusion of an agreement on the Court of \n                Final Appeal, which violates the Joint Declaration; and\n                    (B) a 1990 agreement with the People's Republic of \n                China to limit the number of democratically-elected \n                seats in the Legislative Council to one-third the \n                number of seats in the Council, which violates the \n                Joint Declaration.\n            (6) The reversion of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of \n        China has important implications for both United States \n        national interests and the interests of the Hong Kong people. \n        The United States Government has a responsibility to ensure \n        that United States interests are protected during and after \n        this transition, and it has a profound interest in ensuring \n        that basic and fundamental human rights of the Hong Kong people \n        are also protected.\n            (7) The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public \n        Law 102-383; 22 U.S.C. 5701 et seq.) sets forth United States \n        policy concerning Hong Kong's reversion to the People's \n        Republic of China on July 1, 1997, and Hong Kong's special \n        status as a Special Administrative Region of that country. The \n        Act ensures the continuity of United States laws regarding Hong \n        Kong while establishing a mechanism in section 202 of that Act \n        (22 U.S.C. 5722) whereby the President can modify the \n        application of United States laws with respect to Hong Kong if \n        the President ``determines that Hong Kong is not sufficiently \n        autonomous to justify treatment under a particular law of the \n        United States, or any provision thereof, different from that \n        accorded the People's Republic of China''. In making this \n        determination, the President shall consider ``the terms, \n        obligations, and expectations expressed in the Joint \n        Declaration''.\n            (8) One of the principal purposes of Congress in enacting \n        the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 was to maintain \n        Hong Kong's autonomy by ensuring that the United States will \n        continue to treat Hong Kong as a distinct legal entity, \n        separate and apart from the People's Republic of China, for all \n        purposes, in those areas in which the People's Republic of \n        China has agreed that Hong Kong will continue to enjoy a high \n        degree of autonomy, unless the President makes a determination \n        under section 202 of that Act.\n            (9) The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 requires \n        the Secretary of State to evaluate the implementation of the \n        Joint Declaration.\n            (10) Ultimately, the future of Hong Kong will be determined \n        by the willingness of the Government of the People's Republic \n        of China to respect its commitments in the Joint Declaration to \n        maintain the freedoms now enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong \n        and to rely on the people of Hong Kong to govern themselves.\n\nSEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATIONS.\n\n    Congress makes the following declarations:\n            (1) Recognizing that the United States Government and the \n        Hong Kong Government have long enjoyed a close and beneficial \n        working relationship, for example, between the United States \n        Customs Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug \n        Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization \n        Service, the Secret Service, and their corresponding agencies \n        of the Hong Kong Government, the United States urges the two \n        governments to continue their effective cooperation.\n            (2) Recognizing that the preservation of Hong Kong's \n        autonomous customs territory has important security and \n        commercial implications for the United States and the people of \n        Hong Kong, the United States calls upon the People's Republic \n        of China to fully respect the autonomy of the Hong Kong customs \nterritory.\n            (3) Recognizing that Hong Kong has historically been an \n        important port of call for United States naval vessels, the \n        United States urges the Government of the People's Republic of \n        China to consider in a timely and routine manner United States \n        requests for port calls at Hong Kong.\n            (4) Recognizing that Hong Kong enjoys a robust and \n        professional free press with important guarantees on the \n        freedom of information, the United States declares that a free \n        press and access to information are fundamentally important to \n        the economic and commercial success of Hong Kong and calls upon \n        the Government of the People's Republic of China to fully \n        respect these essential rights of the Hong Kong people.\n            (5) Recognizing that the provisional legislature is not a \n        representative body and that its proposed election law is \n        designed to disadvantage the most popular political party and \n        political figures in Hong Kong, Congress declares that \n        elections for the Special Administrative Region legislature \n        should be conducted in accordance with laws drafted and \n        approved by the Hong Kong people or their democratically-\n        elected representatives.\n            (6) Recognizing that the Joint Declaration requires that \n        the Special Administrative Region legislature ``shall be \n        constituted by elections'', the United States declares that the \n        failure to have an elected legislature would be a violation of \n        the Joint Declaration and calls upon the Government of the \n        People's Republic of China to honor its treaty obligations.\n            (7) Recognizing that the Hong Kong people have long enjoyed \n        essential rights and freedoms as enumerated in the Universal \n        Declaration of Human Rights, the United States--\n                    (A) declares that the Bill of Rights Ordinance is \n                consistent with the Joint Declaration and that \n                strengthening controls on the freedom to associate or \n                assemble is a serious threat to the basic freedoms of \n                the Hong Kong people; and\n                    (B) calls upon the People's Republic of China, the \n                National People's Congress, and any groups appointed by \n                the Government of the People's Republic of China to \n                leave all revisions of Hong Kong law to a \n                democratically-elected legislature.\n            (8) Recognizing that under the terms of the Joint \n        Declaration the provisions of the International Covenant on \n        Civil and Political Rights will continue to apply in Hong Kong, \n        the United States--\n                    (A) welcomes the public statement by the Chief \n                Executive-designate of Hong Kong that the legislation \n                that will replace repealed or amended sections of the \n                Societies Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance will be \n                the subject of public consultation; and\n                    (B) urges that the new legislation should reflect \n                both the wishes of the people of Hong Kong, as clearly \n                expressed through their democratically-elected \n                representatives, and the provisions of the \n                International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n            (9) Recognizing that Hong Kong currently maintains an \n        efficient capitalist economy and trade system by strictly \n        adhering to the rule of law, by honoring the sanctity of \n        contract, and by operating without corruption and with minimum \n        and transparent regulation, the United States calls upon the \n        Government of the People's Republic of China to fully respect \n        the autonomy and independence of the chief executive, the civil \n        service, the judiciary, the police of Hong Kong, and the \n        Independent Commission Against Corruption.\n\nSEC. 5.
