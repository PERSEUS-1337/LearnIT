SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ADEQUATE CAPITAL FLOW FOR MORTGAGE \n              LOANS.\n\n    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) warehouse lending, which provides short-term lines of \n        credit to non-depository lenders for mortgage loans that are \n        eventually sold into the secondary market to Fannie Mae, \n        Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, is a critical link in the housing \n        finance chain;\n            (2) according to data obtained pursuant to the Home \n        Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, nondepository lenders that \n        utilize warehouse lines of credit account for as much as 40 \n        percent of all residential mortgage loans in the United States, \n        and nearly 55 percent of FHA loans, which are increasingly \n        popular;\n            (3) it is estimated that since 2006 warehouse lending \n        capacity available to the mortgage lending industry has \n        declined by nearly 90 percent to the current level of \n        approximately $20 billion to $25 billion;\n            (4) based upon projected 2009 lending volume, there could \n        be a shortfall of hundreds of billions of dollars in home \n        mortgage availability caused by a lack of warehouse lending \n        capacity; and\n            (5) unless Federal regulators promptly address the issue, \n        borrowers seeking to take advantage of today's low interest \n        rates will face rising costs and reduced credit access, which \n        could undermine the housing market recovery.\n    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Housing \n        and Urban Development, and the Director of the Federal Housing \n        Finance Agency should use their existing authorities under the \n        Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the Housing and \n        Economic Recovery Act of 2008, and other statutory and \n        regulatory authorities to provide financial support and \n        assistance to facilitate increased warehouse credit capacity by \n        qualified warehouse lenders;\n            (2) such financial support and assistance should--\n                    (A) be used only to expand the amount of credit or \n                lending capacity made available to qualified mortgage \n                lenders by qualified warehouse lenders for the purpose \n                of funding residential mortgage loans;\n                    (B) be provided in such form and manner as such \n                Secretaries or the Director, as applicable, consider \n                appropriate, which might include direct loans, \n                guarantees, credit enhancement, and other incentives; \n                and\n                    (C) comply with other requirements established by \n                such Secretaries or the Director, as applicable.\n    (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the following \ndefinitions shall apply:\n            (1) Qualified mortgage lender.--The term ``qualified \n        mortgage lender'' means an entity that--\n                    (A) is engaged in the business of making mortgage \n                loans for one- to four-family residences that are--\n                            (i) insured under title II of the National \n                        Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.);\n                            (ii) guaranteed, insured, or made under \n                        chapter 37 of title 38, United States Code;\n                            (iii) made, guaranteed, or insured under \n                        title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. \n                        1471 et seq.); or\n                            (iv) eligible for purchase by the Federal \n                        National Mortgage Association or the Federal \n                        Home Loan Mortgage Corporation; and\n                    (B) is not a depository institution.\n            (2) Qualified warehouse lender.--The term ``qualified \n        warehouse lender'' means an entity that extends credit to \n        qualified mortgage lenders for the purpose of originating \n        mortgage loans described in paragraph (1)(A), or that otherwise \n        facilitates the origination of such loans by a qualified \n        mortgage lender.\n\nSEC. 7.
