ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n            ``TITLE V--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN\n\n``SEC. 501. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            ``(1) public health and safety depends on citizens and \n        local officials knowing the toxic dangers that exist in their \n        homes, communities, and neighborhoods;\n            ``(2) children eat more food, drink more fluids, and \n        breathe more air in proportion to their body weight than \n        adults;\n            ``(3) these factors put children at greater risk from \n        environmental pollutants than adults, and as a result children \n        face unique health threats that need special attention;\n            ``(4) risk assessments of pesticides and other \n        environmental pollutants conducted by the Environmental \n        Protection Agency do not clearly differentiate between the \n        risks to children and the risks to adults;\n            ``(5) a study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences \n        on the effects of pesticides in the diets of infants and \n        children concluded that approaches to risk assessment typically \n        do not consider risks to children and, as a result, current \n        standards and tolerances often fail to adequately protect \n        infants and children;\n            ``(6) data are lacking that would allow adequate \n        quantification and evaluation of child-specific and other \n        vulnerable subpopulation-specific susceptibility and exposure \n        to environmental pollutants;\n            ``(7) data are lacking that would allow adequate \n        quantification and evaluation of child-specific and other \n        vulnerable subpopulation-specific bioaccumulation of \n        environmental pollutants;\n            ``(8) the absence of data precludes effective government \n        regulation of environmental pollutants, and denies individuals \n        the ability to exercise a right to know and make informed \n        decisions to protect their families; and\n            ``(9) research must be coordinated within the Environmental \n        Protection Agency and other Federal agencies to identify key \n        data needs to ensure the best science and to enhance the \n        Nation's understanding of environmental health and safety \n        threats to children.\n    ``(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that--\n            ``(1) policies, programs, activities, and standards of the \n        Environmental Protection Agency must address disproportionate \n        risks to children that result from environmental health risks;\n            ``(2) information, including a safer-for-children product \n        list, should be made readily available by the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to the general public and relevant Federal \n        and State agencies to advance the public's right-to-know, and \n        allow the public to avoid unnecessary and involuntary exposure; \n        and\n            ``(3) scientific research opportunities should be \n        identified by the Environmental Protection Agency, the \n        Department of Health and Human Services (including the National \n        Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the Agency for \n        Toxic Substances and Disease Registry), the National Institutes \n        of Health, and other Federal agencies, to study the short-term \n        and long-term health effects of cumulative, simultaneous, and \n        synergistic exposures of children and other vulnerable \n        subpopulations to environmental pollutants.\n\n``SEC. 502. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    ``In this title:\n            ``(1) Areas that are reasonably accessible to children.--\n        The term `areas that are reasonably accessible to children' \n        means homes, schools, day care centers, shopping malls, movie \n        theaters, and parks.\n            ``(2) Children.--The term `children' means individuals who \n        are 18 years of age or younger.\n            ``(3) Environmental pollutant.--The term `environmental \n        pollutant' means a hazardous substance, as defined in section \n        101 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, \n        and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601), or a pesticide, as \n        defined in section 2 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \n        Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136).\n            ``(4) Federal properties and areas.--The term `Federal \n        properties and areas' means areas owned or controlled by the \n        United States.\n            ``(5) Vulnerable subpopulations.--The term `vulnerable \n        subpopulations' means children, pregnant women, the elderly, \n        individuals with a history of serious illness, and other \n        subpopulations identified by the Administrator as likely to \n        experience elevated health risks from environmental pollutants.\n\n``SEC. 503.
