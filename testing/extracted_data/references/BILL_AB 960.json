    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 7613 of the Family Code is amended to read:\n7613.\n(a) If a woman conceives through assisted reproduction with semen or ova or both donated by a donor not her spouse, with the consent of another intended parent, that intended parent is treated in law as if he or she were the natural parent of a child thereby conceived. The other intended parent\u2019s consent shall be in writing and signed by the other intended parent and the woman conceiving through assisted reproduction.\n(b) (1) The donor of semen provided to a licensed physician and surgeon or to a licensed sperm bank for use in assisted reproduction by a woman other than the donor\u2019s spouse is treated in law as if he were not the natural parent of a child thereby conceived, unless otherwise agreed to in a writing signed by the donor and the woman prior to the conception of the child.\n(2) If the semen is not provided to a licensed physician and surgeon or a licensed sperm bank as specified in paragraph (1), the donor of semen for use in assisted reproduction by a woman other than the donor\u2019s spouse is treated in law as if he were not the natural parent of a child thereby conceived if either of the following are met:\n(A) The donor and the woman agreed in a writing signed prior to conception that the donor would not be a parent.\n(B) A court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived through assisted reproduction and that, prior to the conception of the child, the woman and the donor had an oral agreement that the donor would not be a parent.\n(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply to a man who provided semen for use in assisted reproduction by a woman other than the man\u2019s spouse pursuant to a written agreement signed by the man and the woman prior to conception of the child stating that they intended for the man to be a parent.\n(c) The donor of ova for use in assisted reproduction by a woman other than the donor\u2019s spouse or nonmarital partner is treated in law as if she were not the natural parent of a child thereby conceived unless the court finds satisfactory evidence that the donor and the woman intended for the donor to be a parent.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 7613.5 of the Family Code is amended to read:\n7613.5.\n(a) An intended parent may, but is not required to, use the forms set forth in this section to demonstrate his or her intent to be a legal parent of a child conceived through assisted reproduction. These forms shall satisfy the writing requirement specified in Section 7613, and are designed to provide clarity regarding the intentions, at the time of conception, of intended parents using assisted reproduction. These forms do not affect any presumptions of parentage based on Section 7611, and do not preclude a court from considering any other claims to parentage under California statute or case law.\n(b) These forms apply only in very limited circumstances. Please read the forms carefully to see if you qualify for use of the forms.\n(c) These forms do not apply to assisted reproduction agreements for gestational carriers or surrogacy agreements.\n(d) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the use of one of these forms to satisfy the writing requirement of Section 7613.\n(e) The following are the optional California Statutory Forms for Assisted Reproduction:\nCalifornia Statutory Forms for Assisted Reproduction, Form 1:\nTwo Married or Unmarried People Using Assisted Reproduction to Conceive a Child\nUse this form if: You and another intended parent, who may be your spouse or registered domestic partner, are conceiving a child through assisted reproduction using sperm and/or egg donation; and one of you will be giving birth.\nWARNING: Signing this form does not terminate the parentage claim of a sperm donor.
