FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Methamphetamine (meth) is an extremely dangerous and \n        highly addictive drug.\n            (2) Methamphetamine use contributes to the perpetration of \n        violent crimes, particularly burglary, child abuse, and crimes \n        of substantial cost and personal pain to the victims, including \n        identity theft.\n            (3) Methamphetamine labs produce hazardous conditions \n        because of their use of chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia, \n        ether, sulfuric acid, and other toxins which are volatile, \n        corrosive and poisonous. When these substances are illegally \n        disposed of in rivers, streams, and other dump areas, \n        explosions and serious environmental damage can and does \n        result.\n            (4) Since 2001, Federal funding was provided through the \n        Department of Justice COPS and Byrne Grant programs to address \n        methamphetamine enforcement and clean up. Since 2002, although \n        the methamphetamine problem has been growing and spreading \n        across the United States affecting more States each year, \n        funding has been cut each successive year, from $70,500,000 in \n        2002, to only $54,000,000 in 2004.\n            (5) As methamphetamine has impacted more States each year, \n        the dwindling Federal funds have been parsed into smaller \n        amounts. Each State deserves greater Federal support and a \n        permanent funding mechanism to combat the challenging problem \n        of methamphetamine abuse.\n            (6) Permanent Federal funding support for meth enforcement \n        and clean-up is critical to the efforts of State and local law \n        enforcement to reduce the use, manufacture, and sale of \n        methamphetamine, and thus, reduce the crime rate.\n            (7) It is necessary for the Federal Government to establish \n        a long-term commitment to combating methamphetamine use, sale, \n        and manufacture by creating a permanent funding mechanism to \n        assist States.\n\nSEC. 3. COMBATING THE USE OF METHAMPHETAMINE.\n\n     Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 \n(42 U.S.C. 3711 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n              ``PART HH--COMBATING USE OF METHAMPHETAMINE\n\n``SEC. 2991.
