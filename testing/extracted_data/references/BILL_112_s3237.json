FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In the United States, the chance of a woman developing \n        breast cancer during her lifetime has increased from 1 in 11 in \n        1975 to 1 in 8 today.\n            (2) Worldwide, breast cancer is the most frequently \n        diagnosed cancer in women with 1,300,000 cases each year. \n        Breast cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death in \n        women, with more than 500,000 women dying from the disease \n        worldwide in 2010.\n            (3) More than 90 percent of deaths from breast cancer are \n        caused by metastasis, which occurs when cancerous cells spread \n        to other organs or bone.\n            (4) The National Cancer Institute estimated that breast \n        cancer care in the United States cost $16,500,000,000 in 2009, \n        and cost the nation $12,100,000,000 in lost productivity.\n            (5) Over the past 40 years, very little has improved the \n        incidence, morbidity, and mortality rates of breast cancer.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There shall be established a commission to be known as the \nCommission to Accelerate the End of Breast Cancer (in this Act referred \nto as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.
