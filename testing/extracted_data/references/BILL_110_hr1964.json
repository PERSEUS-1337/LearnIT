FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States was founded on core principles, such \n        as liberty, personal privacy, and equality, which ensure that \n        individuals are free to make their most intimate decisions \n        without governmental interference and discrimination.\n            (2) One of the most private and difficult decisions an \n        individual makes is whether to begin, prevent, continue, or \n        terminate a pregnancy. Those reproductive health decisions are \n        best made by women, in consultation with their loved ones and \n        health care providers.\n            (3) In 1965, in Griswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479), and \n        in 1973, in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113) and Doe v. Bolton (410 \n        U.S. 179), the Supreme Court recognized that the right to \n        privacy protected by the Constitution encompasses the right of \n        every woman to weigh the personal, moral, and religious \n        considerations involved in deciding whether to begin, prevent, \n        continue, or terminate a pregnancy.\n            (4) The Roe v. Wade decision carefully balances the rights \n        of women to make important reproductive decisions with the \n        State's interest in potential life. Under Roe v. Wade and Doe \n        v. Bolton, the right to privacy protects a woman's decision to \n        choose to terminate her pregnancy prior to fetal viability, \n        with the State permitted to ban abortion after fetal viability \n        except when necessary to protect a woman's life or health.\n            (5) These decisions have protected the health and lives of \n        women in the United States. Prior to the Roe v. Wade decision \n        in 1973, an estimated 1,200,000 women each year were forced to \n        resort to illegal abortions, despite the risk of unsanitary \n        conditions, incompetent treatment, infection, hemorrhage, \n        disfiguration, and death. Before Roe, it is estimated that \n        thousands of women died annually in the United States as a \n        result of illegal abortions.\n            (6) In countries in which abortion remains illegal, the \n        risk of maternal mortality is high. According to the World \n        Health Organization, of the approximately 600,000 pregnancy-\n        related deaths occurring annually around the world, 80,000 are \n        associated with unsafe abortions.\n            (7) The Roe v. Wade decision also expanded the \n        opportunities for women to participate equally in society. In \n        1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (505 U.S. 833), the \n        Supreme Court observed that, ``[t]he ability of women to \n        participate equally in the economic and social life of the \n        Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their \n        reproductive lives.''.\n            (8) Even though the Roe v. Wade decision has stood for more \n        than 30 years, there are increasing threats to reproductive \n        health and freedom emerging from all branches and levels of \n        government. In 2006, South Dakota became the first State in \n        more than 15 years to enact a ban on abortion in nearly all \n        circumstances. Supporters of this ban have admitted it is an \n        attempt to directly challenge Roe in the courts. Other States \n        are considering similar bans.\n            (9) Further threatening Roe, the Supreme Court recently \n        upheld the first-ever Federal ban on abortion, which has no \n        exception to protect a woman's health. The majority decision in \n        Gonzales v. Carhart and Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood \n        Federation of America permits the government to interfere with \n        a woman's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy and \n        effectively overturns a core tenet of Roe v. Wade by abandoning \n        more than 30 years of protection for women's health. Dissenting \n        in that case, Justice Ginsburg called the majority's opinion \n        ``alarming,'' and stated that, ``[f]or the first time since \n        Roe, the Court blesses a prohibition with no exception \n        safeguarding a woman's health.'' Further, she said, the Federal \n        ban ``and the Court's defense of it cannot be understood as \n        anything other than an effort to chip away at a right declared \n        again and again by this Court.''.\n            (10) Legal and practical barriers to the full range of \n        reproductive services endanger women's health and lives. \n        Incremental restrictions on the right to choose imposed by \n        Congress and State legislatures have made access to abortion \n        care extremely difficult, if not impossible, for many women \n        across the country. Currently, 87 percent of the counties in \n        the United States have no abortion provider.\n            (11) While abortion should remain safe and legal, women \n        should also have more meaningful access to family planning \n        services that prevent unintended pregnancies, thereby reducing \n        the need for abortion.\n            (12) To guarantee the protections of Roe v. Wade, Federal \n        legislation is necessary.\n            (13) Although Congress may not create constitutional rights \n        without amending the Constitution, Congress may, where \n        authorized by its enumerated powers and not prohibited by the \n        Constitution, enact legislation to create and secure statutory \n        rights in areas of legitimate national concern.\n            (14) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of \n        article I of the Constitution and section 5 of the 14th \n        amendment to the Constitution to enact legislation to \n        facilitate interstate commerce and to prevent State \n        interference with interstate commerce, liberty, or equal \n        protection of the laws.\n            (15) Federal protection of a woman's right to choose to \n        prevent or terminate a pregnancy falls within this affirmative \n        power of Congress, in part, because--\n                    (A) many women cross State lines to obtain \n                abortions and many more would be forced to do so absent \n                a constitutional right or Federal protection;\n                    (B) reproductive health clinics are commercial \n                actors that regularly purchase medicine, medical \n                equipment, and other necessary supplies from out-of-\n                State suppliers; and\n                    (C) reproductive health clinics employ doctors, \n                nurses, and other personnel who travel across State \n                lines in order to provide reproductive health services \n                to patients.\n\nSEC. 3.
