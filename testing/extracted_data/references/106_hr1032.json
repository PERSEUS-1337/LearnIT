FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Citizens have a right, under the Second Amendment to \n        the United States Constitution, to keep and bear arms.\n            (2) Lawsuits have been commenced against manufacturers, \n        distributors, dealers, and importers of nondefective firearms, \n        which seek money damages and other relief for the harm caused \n        by the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \n        criminals.\n            (3) The manufacture, importation, possession, sale, and use \n        of firearms and ammunition in the United States is heavily \n        regulated by Federal, State, and local laws. Such Federal laws \n        include the Gun Control Act of 1968, the National Firearms Act, \n        and the Arms Export Control Act.\n            (4) Businesses in the United States that are engaged in \n        interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, \n        marketing, distribution, manufacture, importation, or sale to \n        the public of firearms or ammunition that have been shipped or \n        transported in interstate or foreign commerce are not, and \n        should not be, liable for the harm caused by those who \n        criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition \n        products.\n            (5) The possibility of imposing liability on an entire \n        industry for harm that is the sole responsibility of others is \n        an abuse of the legal system, erodes public confidence our \n        Nation's laws, threatens the diminution of a basic \n        constitutional right, invites the disassembly and \n        destabilization of other industries and economic sectors \n        lawfully competing in America's free enterprise system, and \n        constitutes an unreasonable burden on interstate and foreign \n        commerce.\n            (6) The liability actions commenced or contemplated by \n        municipalities and cities are based on theories without \n        foundation in hundreds of years of the common law and American \n        jurisprudence. The possible sustaining of these actions by a \n        maverick judicial officer would expand civil liability in a \n        manner never contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution. \n        The Congress further finds that such an expansion of liability \n        would constitute a deprivation of the rights, privileges, and \n        immunities guaranteed to a citizen of the United States under \n        the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To prohibit causes of action against manufacturers, \n        distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or ammunition \n        products for the harm caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse \n        of firearm products or ammunition products by others.\n            (2) To preserve a citizen's access to a supply of firearms \n        and ammunition for all lawful purposes, including hunting, \n        self-defense, collecting, and competitive or recreational \n        shooting.\n            (3) To guarantee a citizen's rights, privileges, and \n        immunities, as applied to the States, under the Fourteenth \n        Amendment to the United States Constitution, pursuant to \n        section five of that Amendment.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON BRINGING OF QUALIFIED CIVIL LIABILITY ACTIONS IN \n              FEDERAL OR STATE COURT.\n\n    (a) In General.--A qualified civil liability action may not be \nbrought in any Federal or State court.\n    (b) Dismissal of Pending Actions.--A qualified civil liability \naction that is pending on the date of the enactment of this Act shall \nbe dismissed immediately by the court in which the action was brought.\n\nSEC. 4.
