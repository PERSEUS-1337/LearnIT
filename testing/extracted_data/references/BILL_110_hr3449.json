FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Members of the Active Components of the United States \n        Military Services are eligible for an immediate annuity upon \n        attaining twenty years of creditable service.\n            (2) Members of the Reserve Components must wait to receive \n        their annuity until age 60.\n            (3) Over the last 15 years, the contributions in support of \n        Active Duty missions by both the Guard and the Reserve have \n        increased substantially.\n            (4) During the Global War on Terrorism Reserve Component \n        members have gone into harms way and fought alongside members \n        of the Active Duty.\n            (5) These contributions have been made under various forms \n        of active duty orders, including Active Duty for Training \n        (ADT), Active Duty for Special Work (ADSW), Presidential \n        Recall, and Partial Mobilization. Only a subset of mobilization \n        orders is being credited as being ``in support of contingency \n        operation.''\n            (6) Further contributions have been made to Active Duty \n        commands within the United States during consecutive periods of \n        Inactive Duty Training (IDT) and Annual Training (AT).\n            (7) Additionally, both enlisted and officers within the \n        Reserve Component are required for promotion to complete \n        professional training and/or Joint Professional Military \n        Education (JPME), often by taking non-paid correspondence or \n        on-line Distant Learning courses for only inactive duty points, \n        while Active Duty are often sent on Temporary Duty Assignment \n        (TDY) to complete such courses. Currently there is no mechanism \n        in place to compensate National Guard and Reserve Component \n        soldiers for required professional courses.\n            (8) Active Duty does not differentiate between stateside or \n        deployed duty when earning creditable duty toward retirement at \n        20 years.\n            (9) As defined by section 12733 of title 10, United States \n        Code, RC members earn one inactive duty point toward retirement \n        for each Reserve training drill. They can also earn one active \n        duty point for every day of active duty performed. An Active \n        Duty year is measured as 360 points. Professional courses are \n        assigned inactive duty points.\n            (10) Members of the Guard and Reserve understand the point \n        system.\n            (11) A minimum of 50 points is required for a creditable \n        service year.\n            (12) Basing a Reserve Component retirement system on the \n        accumulation of retirement points would remove differentiation \n        of duty, clarify eligibility, and by using an appropriately \n        structured matrix would encourage volunteerism and retention.\n\nSEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR RETIRED PAY FOR NONREGULAR SERVICE.\n\n    (a) Age and Service Requirements.--Subsection (a) of section 12731 \nof title 10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(a)(1) Except as provided in subsection (c), a person is \nentitled, upon application, to retired pay computed under section 12739 \nof this title, if the person--\n            ``(A) satisfies one of the combinations of requirements for \n        minimum age and minimum number of years of creditable service \n        (computed under section 12732 of this title) that are specified \n        in the table in paragraph (2);\n            ``(B) performed the last six years of qualifying service \n        while a member of any category named in section 12732(a)(1) of \n        this title, but not while a member of a regular component, the \n        Fleet Reserve, or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, except that \n        in the case of a person who completed 20 years of service \n        computed under section 12732 of this title before October 5, \n        1994, the number of years of qualifying service under this \n        subparagraph shall be eight; and\n            ``(C) is not entitled, under any other provision of law, to \n        retired pay from an armed force or retainer pay as a member of \n        the Fleet Reserve or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.\n    ``(2) The combinations of minimum age and minimum earned points (as \ndefined under section 12732 of this title) required of a person under \nsubparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) for entitlement to retired pay as \nprovided in such paragraph are as follows:\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    The minimum earned points required for that\n                   Age, in years, is at least:                                        age is:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                55                                 4500\n                                56                                 4225\n                                57                                 3950\n                                58                                 3675\n                                59                                 3400\n                                60                                 1000''.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    (b) 20-Year Letter.--Subsection (d) of such section is amended by \nstriking ``the years of service required for eligibility for retired \npay under this chapter'' in the first sentence and inserting ``20 years \nof service computed under section 12732 of this title''.\n\nSEC. 4.

EFFECTIVE DATE AND APPLICABILITY.\n\n    This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take effect on \nthe first day of the first month that begins no more than 180 days \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply with \nrespect to retired pay payable for that month and subsequent months.\n            ``(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a member or former \n        member entitled to retired pay for non-regular service under \n        chapter 1223 of this title who is under 60 years of age.''."
