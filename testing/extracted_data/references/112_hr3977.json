SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Violence \nJudicial Support Act of 2012''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The 2010 National Survey by the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention found that 1 in 4 women have been the \n        victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner, \n        while 1 in 7 men experienced severe physical violence by an \n        intimate partner. Female victims of intimate partner violence \n        experienced different patterns of violence than male victims. \n        Female victims experienced multiple forms of these types of \n        violence; male victims most often experienced physical \n        violence.\n            (2) A critical issue in domestic violence cases is the risk \n        of continued victimization during the pretrial period. \n        Offenders may violate no-contact orders, further injure \n        victims, or intimidate them. Such occurrences highlight a \n        critical need for efficiency in court proceedings.\n            (3) Of 3,750 intimate partner violence cases filed in State \n        courts in 16 large urban counties in 2002, children were \n        present during the violent incident in 36 percent of the cases. \n        Of those children who were present, 60 percent directly \n        witnessed the violence. Court collection of information and \n        statistics related to children who witnessed a violent incident \n        between intimate partners assists courts in identifying \n        children in need of services as a result of such an incident.\n            (4) Domestic violence cases involving spouses and other \n        intimate partners often entail complex processes that require \n        careful consideration by the criminal justice system. In the \n        1990s, many jurisdictions began to create specialized domestic \n        violence courts for judges to ensure follow-through on cases, \n        aid domestic violence victims, and hold offenders accountable, \n        with the assistance of justice and social service agencies. By \n        specializing in domestic violence offenses, these courts aim to \n        process cases more efficiently and deliver more consistent \n        rulings about domestic violence statutes. Some domestic \n        violence courts also incorporate a stronger focus on \n        rehabilitation of offenders and deterrence of repeat offenses. \n        These courts can also be more sensitive to the needs of victims \n        and be able to direct victims to additional community \n        resources.\n            (5) One-third of violent felony defendants in State \n        criminal courts have been charged with domestic violence.\n            (6) Teen dating violence cases are best handled by courts \n        who have had the training to make informed decisions and have \n        the resources to make services available, on-site and in the \n        community, including--\n                    (A) counseling;\n                    (B) victim witness services;\n                    (C) assistance with civil restraining orders, \n                paternity determinations, custody and access orders, \n                and child support orders; and\n                    (D) locating other assistance needed by teen \n                victims.\n            (7) There are more than 400,000 children in foster care in \n        the United States. Congress has charged juvenile courts with \n        oversight of child welfare cases. Highly trained and engaged \n        judges focused on effective case oversight and system reform \n        have been shown to save significant foster care costs for the \n        States.\n            (8) A 2009 study by the Department of Justice found that \n        Kentucky saved $85,000,000 in one year through the issuance of \n        protection orders and the reduction in violence resulting from \n        the issuance of such orders. Examples such as this are \n        prevalent across the Nation.\n            (9) Children with a Court Appointed Special Advocate \n        volunteer spend 7.5 months less in foster care, experience \n        fewer out of home placements, and have significantly improved \n        education performance, compared to their peers without a \n        volunteer advocate.\n            (10) By reducing long-term foster care placements, \n        subsequent victimization, and reentry into the foster care \n        system, the Court Appointed Special Advocate program \n        substantially reduces child welfare costs.\n\nSEC. 2.
