FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Over the past 2 years, the United States has lost more \n        than 2,000,000 decent-paying manufacturing jobs.\n            (2) With 14,731,000 total manufacturing jobs, the United \n        States now has the lowest number of factory jobs since October, \n        1958.\n            (3) According to Forrester Research, ``Over the next 15 \n        years, 3,300,000 United States service industry jobs and \n        $136,000,000,000 in wages will move offshore to countries like \n        India, Russia, China and the Philippines. The IT industry will \n        lead the initial overseas exodus.''.\n            (4) At the end of 2002, the United States had a record-\n        breaking trade deficit of $435,200,000,000, including a \n        $103,100,000,000 trade deficit with China.\n            (5) Preserving and increasing decent-paying jobs must be a \n        top priority of the United States Congress.\n            (6) Providing loan guarantees, direct loans, and technical \n        assistance to employees to buy their own companies will \n        preserve and increase employment in the United States.\n            (7) Just like the United States Export-Import Bank was \n        created in 1934 during the midst of the Great Depression as a \n        way to increase United States jobs through exports, the time \n        has come to establish the United States Employee Ownership Bank \n        within the Department of the Treasury to preserve and expand \n        jobs in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
