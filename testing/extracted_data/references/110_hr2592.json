    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Safe and Effective Drug Development \nAct of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide for one or more Critical Path \nPublic-Private Partnerships to accelerate the translation of new \nscientific discoveries into new medical products that will cure and \nbetter treat disease, improve health care, prolong longevity and \nwellness, reduce health care costs, and enhance American \ncompetitiveness in the 21st century.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Critical Path Initiative is the Food and Drug \n        Administration's effort to stimulate and facilitate a national \n        effort to modernize the process of innovation and \n        commercialization through which fundamental scientific \n        discoveries are transformed from ``proof of concept'' and \n        development into breakthrough medical products, therapies, and \n        cures.\n            (2) On March 16, 2004, the Food and Drug Administration \n        released a report entitled ``Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge \n        and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products'', \n        addressing the recent slowdown in innovative medical therapies \n        submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for approval. The \n        report describes the urgent need to modernize the medical \n        product development process--the Critical Path--to make product \n        development more predictable and efficient.\n            (3) The Food and Drug Administration has committed to \n        working with companies, patient groups, academic researchers, \n        and other stakeholders to coordinate, develop, and disseminate \n        solutions to scientific hurdles that are impairing the \n        efficiency of product development across the life science \n        industries. For example, the Food and Drug Administration has \n        released a Critical Path Opportunities List of over 75 research \n        priorities that, if accomplished, would modernize the drug \n        development process by 2010 and would help to make new medical \n        discoveries available to Americans faster and at a lower cost.\n            (4) The Food and Drug Administration has already initiated \n        partnerships to share knowledge, streamline the cost and time \n        of preclinical drug safety evaluation, and better inform the \n        use of ``personalized medicine''.\n            (5) However, much more must be done to foster the \n        collaborative culture that must exist to modernize the medical \n        product development process. Collective sharing of scientific \n        information and research methodology across the entire health \n        care community is crucial to igniting the medical innovation \n        required to keep pace with biomedical research.\n            (6) The power of public-private partnerships is vital to \n        accomplish these tasks and to ensure that new scientific \n        discoveries--in fields such as genomics and proteomics, \n        imaging, and bioinformatics--can be more rapidly and \n        effectively applied to cure diseases, enhance treatments, \n        improve health care, prolong longevity and wellness, reduce \n        health care costs, and enhance American competitiveness in the \n        21st century.\n\nSEC. 4. CRITICAL PATH PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n    Subchapter E of chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct (21 U.S.C. 360bbb et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 566.
