FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Inadequate land use planning at the State level \n        contributes to increased public and private capital costs for \n        infrastructure development, loss of community character, and \n        environmental degradation.\n            (2) Although land use planning is rightfully within the \n        jurisdiction of State and local governments, comprehensive land \n        use planning and urban development should be supported by the \n        Federal Government and State governments.\n            (3) States should provide a proper climate and context for \n        planning through legislation in order for appropriate \n        comprehensive land use planning and urban development to occur.\n            (4) Many States have outdated land use planning \n        legislation, and many States are undertaking efforts to update \n        and reform the legislation.\n            (5) Efforts to coordinate State and regional investments \n        with local plans require additional planning at the State \n        level.\n            (6) Housing is a critical component of sustainable urban \n        development, and land use planning should provide for a range \n        of housing options to offer choice in location, type, and \n        affordability to all members of the community.\n            (7) The Federal Government and State governments should \n        support the efforts of tribal governments and Native Hawaiian \n        organizations to implement land use planning and community \n        development to improve housing and socioeconomic conditions for \n        Indian tribes and Native Hawaiians.\n\nSEC. 3.
