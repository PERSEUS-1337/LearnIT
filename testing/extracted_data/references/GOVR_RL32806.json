    "content": "In general, in both federal and state judicial proceedings, every competent person may be compelled to testify. Testimonial privileges are exceptions to this rule; they are generally granted to allow concealment of communications made in confidence between persons holding certain relationships that have been deemed worthy of protection. Testimonial privileges are generally granted by common law or by statute; these include the lawyer-client and the doctor-patient privileges. There is also one testimonial privilege expressly granted in the United States Constitution: the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" Absent a statutory or constitutional recognition of journalists' privilege, a reporter may be compelled to testify in legal, administrative, or other governmental proceedings. Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have recognized a journalists' privilege through enactment of press \"shield laws,\" which protect the relationship between reporters, their source, and sometimes, the information that may be communicated in that relationship. Another 16 states have recognized a journalists' privilege through court decisions; Wyoming is the only state that has no legislatively or judicially adopted journalists' privilege. The journalists' privilege is distinct from other recognized privileges in that it vests only with the journalist, not with the source of the information. In Branzburg v. Hayes , 408 U.S. 665 (1972), the Supreme Court ruled for the first and only time on a claim of journalists' privilege. It held that journalists have no constitutional privilege to refuse to testify before a grand jury, unless the grand jury investigation was \"instituted or conducted other than in good faith.\" Id . at 707. The court reasoned that the public's interest in prosecuting crime outweighed its interest in journalists' being permitted to preserve their confidential relationships. In Branzburg , the Supreme Court noted that there was \"merit in leaving state legislatures free, within First Amendment limits, to fashion their own standards\" regarding journalists' privilege. Id . at 706. In addition, the court noted that \"[i]t goes without saying, of course, that we are powerless to bar state courts from responding in their own way and construing their own constitutions so as to recognize a newsman's privilege, either qualified or absolute.\" Id . It is with that understanding that, since Branzburg , 49 states and the District of Columbia have either enacted legislation or issued court rulings protecting the press, to varying degrees, from unfettered disclosure of sources, work product, and information generally. The various state statutes range in scope, from broad protections that provide an absolute journalistic privilege, to shield laws that offer a qualified privilege. The majority of state shield laws offer some form of a qualified privilege to reporters, protecting source information in judicial settings, unless the compelling party can establish that the information is (i) relevant or material; (ii) unavailable by other means, or through other sources; and (iii) that a compelling need exists for that information. States may vary this last prong, with some requiring the compelling party to establish whether the need exists as to the party's case, and others whether the need serves a broader public policy. Although the vast majority of states protect a confidential source's identity, a number of states also protect a reporter's notes, outtakes, or work product. A small minority of states further protect a reporter's personal observations. In addition to addressing what is covered, states differ as to who is covered and under what situations they are covered. For instance, many states require that a newsperson must be professionally engaged in the dissemination of information to the public, while other states use broader definitions of what constitutes a press person and may include individuals who are freelancers, authors, electronic publishers, or educators. Some states further require that, in order to qualify as a member of the news media, evidence or records must be kept documenting actual publication or broadcast, especially when radio or television media are concerned. Finally, Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides that, in civil cases that arise under state law but are brought in federal court, privileges shall be determined \"in accordance with State law.\" It also provides that, in federal courts, \"the privilege of a witness ... shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience. The federal courts have not resolved whether the common law provides a journalists' privilege. The remainder of this report sets forth the full text of the state shield statutes. ALABAMA (Ala. Code 1975 \u00a7 12-21-142 (2004)) Sec. 12-21-142 Exemption of news-gathering persons from disclosing sources. No person engaged in, connected with or employed on any newspaper, radio broadcasting station or television station, while engaged in a news-gathering capacity, shall be compelled to disclose in any legal proceeding or trial, before any court or before a grand jury of any court, before the presiding officer of any tribunal or his agent or agents or before any committee of the Legislature or elsewhere the sources of any information procured or obtained by him and published in the newspaper, broadcast by any broadcasting station, or televised by any television station on which he is engaged, connected with or employed. ALASKA (Alaska Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 09.25.300-390 (Matthew Bender 2004)) Sec. \u00a7 09.25.300 Claiming of privilege by public official or reporter. Except as provided in AS 09.25.300 - 09.25.390, a public official or reporter may not be compelled to disclose the source of information procured or obtained while acting in the course of duties as a public official or reporter. Sec. 09.25.310 Challenge of privilege before superior or supreme court. (a) When a public official or reporter claims the privilege in a cause being heard before the supreme court or a superior court of this state, a person who has the right to question the public official or reporter in that proceeding, or the court on its own motion, may challenge the claim of privilege. The court shall make or cause to be made whatever inquiry the court thinks necessary to a determination of the issue. The inquiry may be made instanter by way of questions put to the witness claiming the privilege and a decision then rendered, or the court may require the presence of other witnesses or documentary showing or may order a special hearing for the determination of the issue of privilege. (b) The court may deny the privilege and may order the public official or the reporter to testify, imposing whatever limits upon the testimony and upon the right of cross-examination of the witness as may be in the public interest or in the interest of a fair trial, if it finds the withholding of the testimony would (1) result in a miscarriage of justice or the denial of a fair trial to those who challenge the privilege; or (2) be contrary to the public interest. Sec. 09.25.320 Challenge of privilege before other bodies (a) This section is applicable to a hearing held under the laws of this state (1) before a court other than the supreme or a superior court; (2) before a court commissioner, referee, or other court appointee; (3) in the course of legislative proceedings or before a commission, agency, or committee created by the legislature; (4) before an agency or representative of an agency of the state, borough, city or other municipal corporation, or other body; or (5) before any other forum of this state. (b) If, in a hearing, a public official or a reporter should refuse to divulge the source of information, the agency body, person, official, or party seeking the information may apply to the superior court for an order divesting the official or reporter of the privilege. When the issue is raised before the supreme or a superior court, the application must be made to that court. (c) Application for an order shall be made by verified petition setting out the reasons why the disclosure is essential to the administration of justice, a fair trial in the instant proceeding, or the protection of the public interest. Upon application, the court shall determine the notice to be given to the public official or reporter and fix the time and place of hearing. The court shall make or cause to be made whatever inquiry the court thinks necessary, and make a determination of the issue as provided for in AS 09.25.310. Sec. 09.25.330 Order subject to review An order of the superior court entered under AS 09.25.300 - 09.25.390 shall be subject to review by the supreme court, by appeal or by certiorari, as the rules of that court may provide. During the pendency of the appeal, the privilege shall remain in full force and effect. Sec. 09.25.340 Extent of privilege When a public official or reporter claims the privilege conferred by AS 09.25.300 - AS 09.25.390 and the public official or reporter has not been divested of the privilege by order of the supreme or superior court, neither the public official or reporter nor the news organization with which the reporter was associated may thereafter be permitted to plead or prove the sources of information withheld, unless the informant consents in writing or in open court. Sec. 09.25.350 Application of privilege in other courts AS 09.25.300 - 09.25.390 also apply to proceedings held under the laws of the United States or any other state where the law of this state is being applied. Sec. 09.25.360 AS 09.25.300 - 09.25.390 do not abridge other privileges.

(j) Nothing in subsections (a) to (i), inclusive, of this section shall be construed to deny or infringe the rights of an accused in a criminal prosecution guaranteed under the sixth amendment to the Constitution of the United States and article twenty-ninth of the amendments to the Constitution of the state of Connecticut. DELAWARE (Del. Code Ann. Tit. 10, \u00a7\u00a7 4320-4326 (2004)) \u00a7 4320 Definitions. As used in this subchapter: (1) \"Adjudicative proceeding\" means any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding in which the rights of parties are determined but does not include any proceeding of a grand jury.

Obtained the information that is sought while serving in the capacity of an agent, assistant, employee, or supervisor of an individual who qualifies as a reporter under subparagraph a.

(6) \"Testify\" means give testimony, provide tangible evidence, submit to a deposition, or answer interrogatories. (7) \"Within the scope of his or her professional activities\" means any situation, including a social gathering, in which the reporter obtains information for the purpose of disseminating it to the public, but does not include any situation in which the reporter intentionally conceals from the source the fact that he or she is a reporter and does not include any situation in which the reporter is an eyewitness to or participant in an act involving physical violence or property damage. \u00a7 4321 Privilege in nonadjudicative proceedings. A reporter is privileged in a nonadjudicative proceeding to decline to testify concerning either the source or content of information that he obtained within the scope of his professional activities. \u00a7 4322 Privilege in adjudicative proceedings. A reporter is privileged in an adjudicative proceeding to decline to testify concerning the source or content of information that he or she obtained within the scope of his or her professional activities if the reporter states under oath that the disclosure of the information would violate an express or implied understanding with the source under which the information was originally obtained or would substantially hinder the reporter in the maintenance of existing source relationships or the development of new source relationships. \u00a7 4323 Exceptions to the privilege in adjudicative proceedings. (a) Unless the disclosure of the content of the information would substantially increase the likelihood that the source of the information will be discovered, the privilege provided by \u00a7 4322 shall not prevent a reporter from being required in an adjudicative proceeding to testify concerning the content, but not the source, of information that the reporter obtained within the scope of his or her professional activities if the judge determines that the public interest in having the reporter's testimony outweighs the public interest in keeping the information confidential. In making this determination, the judge shall take into account the importance of the issue on which the information is relevant, the efforts that have been made by the subpoenaing party to acquire evidence on the issue from alternative sources, the sufficiency of the evidence available from alternative sources, the circumstances under which the reporter obtained the information, and the likely effect that disclosure of the information will have on the future flow of information to the public. (b) The privilege provided by \u00a7 4322 shall not prevent a reporter from being required in an adjudicative proceeding to testify concerning either the source or the content of information that the reporter obtained within the scope of his or her professional activities if the party seeking to have the reporter testify proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the sworn statement submitted by the reporter as required by \u00a7 4322 is untruthful. \u00a7 4324 Determination of privilege claim. A person who invokes the privilege provided by this subchapter may not be required to testify in any proceeding except by court order. If a person invokes the privilege in any proceeding other than a court proceeding, the body or party seeking to have the person testify may apply to the Superior Court for an order requiring the claimant of the privilege to testify. If the Court determines that the claimant does not qualify for the privilege under the provisions of this subchapter, it shall order the claimant to testify. \u00a7 4325 Waiver. If a reporter waives the privilege provided by this subchapter with respect to certain facts, he or she may be cross-examined on the testimony or other evidence he or she gives concerning those facts but not on other facts with respect to which the reporter claims the privilege. A reporter does not waive or forfeit the privilege by disclosing all or any part of the information protected by the privilege to any other person. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (D.C.

Public policy In order to protect the public interest and the free flow of information, the news media should have the benefit of a substantial privilege not to reveal sources of information or to disclose unpublished information.

The purpose of sections 595.021 to 595.025 is to insure and perpetuate, consistent with the public interest, the confidential relationship between the news media and its sources. 595.023. Disclosure prohibited Except as provided in section 595.024, no person who is or has been directly engaged in the gathering, procuring, compiling, editing, or publishing of information for the purpose of transmission, dissemination or publication to the public shall be required by any court, grand jury, agency, department or branch of the state, or any of its political subdivisions or other public body, or by either house of the legislature or any committee, officer, member, or employee thereof, to disclose in any proceeding the person or means from or through which information was obtained, or to disclose any unpublished information procured by the person in the course of work or any of the person's notes, memoranda, recording tapes, film or other reportorial data whether or not it would tend to identify the person or means through which the information was obtained. 595.024.

The application shall be granted only if the court determines after hearing the parties that the person making application, by clear and convincing evidence, has met all three of the following conditions: (1) that there is probable cause to believe that the specific information sought (i) is clearly relevant to a gross misdemeanor or felony, or (ii) is clearly relevant to a misdemeanor so long as the information would not tend to identify the source of the information or the means through which it was obtained, (2) that the information cannot be obtained by alternative means or remedies less destructive of first amendment rights, and (3) that there is a compelling and overriding interest requiring the disclosure of the information where the disclosure is necessary to prevent injustice. Subdivision 3. Determination; appeal. The district court shall consider the nature of the proceedings, the merits of the claims and defenses, the adequacies of alternative remedies, the relevancy of the information sought, and the possibility of establishing by other means that which the source is expected or may tend to prove. The court shall make its appropriate order after making findings of fact. The order may be appealed directly to the court of appeals according to the rules of appellate procedure. The order is stayed and nondisclosure shall remain in full force and effect during the pendency of the appeal. Where the court finds that the information sought has been published or broadcast, there shall be no automatic stay unless an appeal is filed within two days after the order is issued. Either party may request expedited consideration. 595.025. Defamation Subdivision 1. Disclosure prohibition; applicability. The prohibition of disclosure provided in section 595.023 shall not apply in any defamation action where the person seeking disclosure can demonstrate that the identity of the source will lead to relevant evidence on the issue of actual malice.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 1, the identity of the source of information shall not be ordered disclosed unless the following conditions are met: (a) that there is probable cause to believe that the source has information clearly relevant to the issue of defamation; (b) that the information cannot be obtained by any alternative means or remedy less destructive of first amendment rights. Subdivision 3. Determination; appeal. The court shall make its order on the issue of disclosure after making findings of fact, which order may be appealed to the court of appeals according to the rules of appellate procedure. During the appeal the order is stayed and nondisclosure shall remain in full force and effect. MISSISSIPPI No shield statute exists for this state. MISSOURI No shield statute exists for this state.

WASHINGTON (H.B. 1366, to take effect July 22, 2007) (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, no judicial, legislative, administrative, or other body with the power to issue a subpoena or other compulsory process may compel the news media to testify, produce, or otherwise disclose: (a) The identity of a source of any news or information or any information that would tend to identify the source where such source has a reasonable expectation of confidentiality; or (b) Any news or information obtained or prepared by the news media in its capacity in gathering, receiving, or processing news or information for potential communication to the public, including, but not limited to, any notes, outtakes, photographs, video or sound tapes, film, or other data of whatever sort in any medium now known or hereafter devised. This does not include physical evidence of a crime. (2) A court may compel disclosure of the news or information described in subsection (1)(b) of this section if the court finds that the party seeking such news or information established by clear and convincing evidence: (a)(i) In a criminal investigation or prosecution, based on information other than that information being sought, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has occurred; or (ii) In a civil action or proceeding, based on information other than that information being sought, that there is a prima facie cause of action; and (b) In all matters, whether criminal or civil, that: (i) The news or information is highly material and relevant; (ii) The news or information is critical or necessary to the maintenance of a party's claim, defense, or proof of an issue material thereto; (iii) The party seeking such news or information has exhausted all reasonable and available means to obtain it from alternative sources; and (iv) There is a compelling public interest in the disclosure. A court may consider whether or not the news or information was obtained from a confidential source in evaluating the public interest in disclosure. (3) The protection from compelled disclosure contained in subsection (1) of this section also applies to any subpoena issued to, or other compulsory process against, a nonnews media party where such subpoena or process seeks records, information, or other communications relating to business transactions between such nonnews media party and the news media for the purpose of discovering the identity of a source or obtaining news or information described in subsection (1) of this section. Whenever a subpoena is issued to, or other compulsory process is initiated against, a nonnews media party where such subpoena or process seeks information or communications on business transactions with the news media, the affected news media shall be given reasonable and timely notice of the subpoena or compulsory process before it is executed or initiated, as the case may be, and an opportunity to be heard. In the event that the subpoena to, or other compulsory process against, the nonnews media party is in connection with a criminal investigation in which the news media is the express target, and advance notice as provided in this section would pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation, the governmental authority shall so certify to such a threat in court and notification of the subpoena or compulsory process shall be given to the affected news media as soon thereafter as it is determined that such notification will no longer pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation. (4) Publication or dissemination by the news media of news or information described in subsection (1) of this section, or a portion thereof, shall not constitute a waiver of the protection from compelled disclosure that is contained in subsection (1) of this section. In the event that the fact of publication of news or information must be proved in any proceeding, that fact and the contents of the publication may be established by judicial notice. (5) The term \"news media\" means: (a) Any newspaper, magazine or other periodical, book publisher, news agency, wire service, radio or television station or network, cable or satellite station or network, or audio or audiovisual production company, or any entity that is in the regular business of news gathering and disseminating news or information to the public by any means, including, but not limited to, print, broadcast, photographic, mechanical, internet, or electronic distribution; (b) Any person who is or has been an employee, agent, or independent contractor of any entity listed in (a) of this subsection, who is or has been engaged in bona fide news gathering for such entity, and who obtained or prepared the news or information that is sought while serving in that capacity; or (c) Any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of the entities listed in (a) or (b) of this subsection to the extent that the subpoena or other compulsory process seeks news or information described in subsection (1) of this section. (6) In all matters adjudicated pursuant to this section, a court of competent jurisdiction may exercise its inherent powers to conduct all appropriate proceedings required in order to make necessary findings of fact and enter conclusions of law.
