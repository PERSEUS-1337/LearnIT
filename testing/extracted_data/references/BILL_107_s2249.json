FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by \n        self-starvation and excessive weight loss.\n            (2) Anorexia Nervosa is common: an estimated .5 to 3.7 \n        percent of American women will suffer from this disorder in \n        their lifetime.\n            (3) Anorexia Nervosa is associated with serious health \n        consequences including heart failure, kidney failure, \n        osteoporosis, and death.\n            (4) Anorexia Nervosa has the highest mortality rate of all \n        psychiatric disorders. A young woman is 12 times more likely to \n        die than other women her age without Anorexia.\n            (5) Anorexia Nervosa usually appears in adolescence.\n            (6) Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by \n        excessive food consumption followed by inappropriate \n        compensatory behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse \n        of laxatives, fasting, or excessive exercise.\n            (7) Bulimia Nervosa is common: an estimated 1.1 to 4.2 \n        percent of American women will suffer from this disorder in \n        their lifetime.\n            (8) Bulimia Nervosa is associated with cardiac, \n        gastrointestinal, and dental problems including irregular \n        heartbeats, gastric rupture, peptic ulcer, and tooth decay.\n            (9) Bulimia Nervosa usually appears in adolescence.\n            (10) On the 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 7.5 percent of \n        high school girls reported recent use of laxatives or vomiting \n        to control their weight.\n            (11) Binge Eating Disorder is characterized by frequent \n        episodes of uncontrolled overeating.\n            (12) Binge Eating Disorder is common: an estimated 2 to 5 \n        percent of Americans experience this disorder in a 6-month \n        period.\n            (13) Binge Eating is associated with obesity, heart \n        disease, gall bladder disease, and diabetes.\n            (14) Eating disorders are commonly associated with \n        substantial psychological problems, including depression, \n        substance abuse, and suicide.\n            (15) Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions: 27 percent \n        of United States adults are obese and 13 percent of children \n        and 14 percent of adolescents are seriously overweight.\n            (16) Poor eating habits have led to a ``calcium crisis'' \n        among American youth: only 13.5 percent of adolescent girls get \n        the recommended daily amount of calcium, placing them at \n        serious risk for osteoporosis and other bone diseases. Because \n        nearly 90 percent of adult bone mass is established by the end \n        of this age range, the Nation's youth's insufficient calcium \n        intake is truly a calcium crisis.\n            (17) Eating disorders of all types are more common in women \n        than men.\n            (18) Eating preferences and habits are established in \n        childhood.\n            (19) Poor eating habits are a risk factor for the \n        development of eating disorders, obesity and osteoporosis.\n            (20) However, simply urging overweight youth to be thin has \n        not reduced the prevalence of obesity and may result in other \n        problems including body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and \n        eating disorders.\n            (21) Therefore, effective interventions for promoting \n        healthy eating behaviors in youth should promote healthy \n        lifestyle and not inadvertently promote unhealthy weight \n        management techniques.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To increase preventive health activities designed to \n        promote the development of healthy eating habits and behaviors \n        in youth.\n            (2) To support research to develop and test educational \n        curricula and intervention programs aimed at promoting healthy \neating habits and behaviors in youth.\n            (3) To identify and disseminate effective intervention \n        programs aimed at promoting healthy eating habits and behaviors \n        in youth.\n\nSEC. 4.
