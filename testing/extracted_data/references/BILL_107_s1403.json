FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that it is in the public interest to:\n            (1) Enable small businesses, residences, schools, churches, \n        farms with small electric generation units, and other retail \n        electric customers who generate electric energy to return or \n        sell surplus electric energy on the open market.\n            (2) Promote diversification of energy resources used in the \n        United States to reduce over reliance on any one resource, and \n        to mitigate our nation's dependence on imported fuels.\n            (3) Encourage private investment and stimulate economic \n        growth in renewable and alternate energy resources.\n            (4) Remove regulatory barriers for net metering.\n            (5) Provide uniform, national technical standards for the \n        interconnection of distributed electricity generating \n        facilities.\n\nSEC. 3. NET METERING.\n\n    Part II of the Federal Power Act is amended by adding the following \nnew section at the end thereof:\n\n``SEC. 215. NET METERING.\n\n    ``(a) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n            ``(1) The term `customer-generator' means the owner or \n        operator of an electric generation unit qualified for net \n        metering under this section.\n            ``(2) The term `net metering' means measuring the \n        difference between the electricity supplied to a customer-\n        generator and the electricity generated by a customer-generator \n        that is delivered to a local distribution section system at the \n        same point of interconnection during an applicable billing \n        period.\n            ``(3) The terms `electric generation unit qualified for net \n        metering' and `qualified generation unit' mean an electric \n        energy generation unit that meets the requirements of paragraph \n        (5) and each of the following requirements:\n                    ``(A) The unit is a fuel cell or produces \n                electricity using solar, wind, biomass,

           ``(E) The unit operates in parallel with the retail \n                electric supplier.\n            ``(4) The term `retail electric supplier' means any person \n        that sells electric energy to the ultimate consumer thereof.\n            ``(5) The term `local distribution system' means any system \n        for the distribution section of electric energy to the ultimate \n        consumer thereof, whether or not the owner or operator of such \n        system is also a retail electric supplier.\n            ``(6) The term `Commission' means the Federal Energy \n        Regulatory Commission.\n    ``(b) Adoption.--Not later than one year after the enactment of \nthis section, each retail electric supplier shall comply with each of \nthe following requirements and notify all of its retail customers of \nsuch requirements not less frequently than quarterly:\n            ``(1) The supplier shall offer to arrange (either directly \n        or through a local distribution company or other third party) \n        to make available, on a first-come-first-served basis, to each \n        of its retail customers that has installed an energy generation \n        unit that is intended for net metering, and that notifies the \n        supplier of its generating capacity, an electric energy meter \n        that is capable of net metering if the customer-generator's \n        existing electrical meter cannot perform that function.\n            ``(2) Rates and charges and contract terms and conditions \n        for the sale of electric energy to customer-generators shall be \n        the same as the rates and charges and contract terms and \n        conditions that would be applicable if the customer-generator \n        did not own or operate a qualified generation unit and use a \n        net metering system.\nAny retail electric supplier or local distribution company may, at its \nown expense, install one or more additional electric energy meters to \nmonitor the flow of electricity in either direction or to reflect the \ntime of generation or both.\n    ``(c) Net Energy Measurement and Billing.--Each retail electric \nsupplier subject to subsection (b) shall calculate the net energy \nmeasurement for a customer using a net metering system in the following \nmanner:\n            ``(1) The retail electric supplier shall measure the net \n        electricity produced or consumed during the billing period \n        using the metering referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) of \n        subsection (b).\n            ``(2) If the quantity of electricity supplied by a retail \n        electric suppler during a billing period exceeds the quantity \n        of electricity generated by an on-site generating facility and \n        fed back to the electric distribution system during the billing \n        period, the supplier may bill the owner or operator for the net \n        quantity of electricity supplied by the retail electric \n        supplier, in accordance with normal metering practices.\n            ``(3) If the quantity of electricity generated by an on-\n        site generating facility during a billing period exceeds the \n        quantity of electricity supplied by the retail electric \n        supplier during the billing period--\n                    ``(A) the retail electric supplier may only bill \n                the owner or operator of the on-site generating \n                facility for charges that would be applicable if the \n                customer-generator did not own or operate a qualified \n                generation unit and use a net metering system.\n                    ``(B) the owner or operator of the on-site \n                generating facility shall be credited for the excess \n                kilowatt-hours generated during the billing period, \n                with the kilowatt-hour credit appearing on the bill \n                during the following billing period.\n        If the customer-generator is using a meter that reflects the \n        time of generation (a `real time meter' or `smart meter'), the \n        credit shall be based on the retail rates for sale by the \n        retail electric supplier at the time of such generation.\nAfter a customer-generator has participated in a net-metering \narrangement with a retail electric supplier for at least one-\nconsecutive year, the customer-generator may request that any remaining \nunused kilowatt-hour credits accumulated by a customer-generator during \nthe previous year be sold by the customer-generator to any electric \nsupplier that agrees to purchase such credit. In the absence of any \nsuch purchase, the customer-generator may request that the retail \nelectric supplier that supplied electric energy to such customer-\ngenerator during the previous year purchase the credit at the avoided \ncost of electricity. If no action is requested by the customer-\ngenerator, any credit earned by the customer-generator will continue to \naccumulate.\n    ``(d) Percent Limitations.--\n            ``(1) Five percent limitation.--A local distribution \n        company retail electric supplier shall not be required to \n        provide local distribution service with respect to additional \n        customer-generators after the date during any calendar year on \n        which the total generating capacity of all customer-generators \n        with qualified generation facilities and net metering systems \n        served by that local distribution company is equal to or in \n        excess of 5 percent of the capacity necessary to meet the \n        company's average forecasted aggregate customer peak demand for \n        that calendar year.\n            ``(2) Two and a half percent limitation.--A local \n        distribution company retail electric supplier shall not be \n        required to provide local distribution service with respect to \n        additional customer-generators using a single type of qualified \n        energy generation system after the date during any calendar \n        year on which the total generating capacity of all customer-\n        generators with qualified generation facilities of that type \n        and net metering systems served by that local distribution \n        company is equal to or in excess of 2.5 percent of the capacity \n        necessary to meet the company's average forecasted aggregate \n        customer peak demand for that calendar year.\n            ``(3) Records and notice.--Each retail electric supplier \n        shall maintain, and make available to the public, records of \n        the total generating capacity of customer-generators of such \n        system that are using net metering, the type of generating \n        systems and energy source used by the electric generating \n        systems used by such customer-generators. Each such retail \n        electric supplier shall notify the Commission when the total \n        generating capacity of such customer-generators is equal to or \n        in excess of 2 percent of the capacity necessary to meet the \n        supplier's aggregate customer peak demand during the previous \n        calendar year and when the total generating capacity of such \n        customer-generators using a single type of qualified generation \n        is equal to or in excess of 1 percent of such capacity.\n    ``(e) Safety and Performance Standards.--\n            ``(1) A qualified generation unit and net metering system \n        used by a customer-generator shall meet all applicable safety \n        and performance and reliability standards established by the \n        national electrical code, the Institute of Electrical and \n        Electronics Engineers, Underwriters Laboratories, or the \n        American National Standards Institute.\n            ``(2) The Commission, after consultation with State \n        regulatory authorities and nonregulated local distribution \n        systems and after notice and opportunity for comment, may adopt \n        by regulation additional control and testing requirements for \n        customer-generators that the Commission determines are \n        necessary to protect public safety and system reliability.\n            ``(3) The Commission shall, after consultation with State \n        regulatory authorities and nonregulated local distribution \n        systems and after notice and opportunity for comment, prohibit \n        by regulation the imposition of additional charges by electric \n        suppliers and local distribution systems for equipment or \n        services for safety or performance that are additional to those \n        necessary to meet the standards referred to in subparagraphs \n        (A) and (B).\n    ``(f) State Authority.--Nothing in this section shall preclude a \nState from establishing or imposing additional incentives or \nrequirements to encourage qualified generation and net metering \nadditional to that required under this section.\n    ``(g) Interconnection Standards.--\n            ``(1) Within 6 months after the enactment of this section \n        the Commission shall publish model standards for the physical \n        connection between local distribution systems and qualified \n        generation units and electric generation units that would be \n        qualified generation units but for the fact that the unit has a \n        generating capacity of more than 100 kilowatts (but not more \n        than 250 kilowatts). Such model standards shall be designed to \n        encourage the use of qualified generation units and to insure \n        the safety and reliability of such units and the local \n        distribution systems interconnected with such units. Within 1 \n        year after the enactment of this section, each State shall \n        adopt such model standards, with or without modification, and \n        submit such standards to the Commission for approval. The \n        Commission shall approve a modification of the model standards \n        only if the Commission determines that such modification is \n        consistent with the purpose of such standards and is required \n        by reason of local conditions. If standards have not been \n        approved under this paragraph by the Commission for any State \n        within 1 year after the enactment of this section, the \n        Commission shall, by rule or order, enforce the Commission's \n        model standards in such State until such time as State \n        standards are approved by the Commission.\n            ``(2) The standards under this section shall establish such \n        measures for the safety and reliability of the affected \n        equipment and local distribution systems as may be appropriate. \n        Such standards shall be consistent with all applicable safety \n        and performance standards established by the national \n        electrical code, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics \n        Engineers, Underwriters Laboratories, or the American National \n        Standards Institute and with such additional safety and \n        reliability standards as the Commission shall, by rule, \n        prescribe. Such standards shall ensure that generation units \n        will automatically isolate themselves from the electrical \n        system in the event of an electrical power outage. Such \n        standards shall permit the owner or operator of the local \n        distribution system to interrupt or reduce deliveries of \n        available energy from the generation unit to the system when \n        necessary in order to construct, install, maintain, repair, \n        replace, remove, investigate, or inspect any of its equipment \n        or part of its system; or if it determines that curtailment, \n        interruption, or reduction is necessary because of emergencies, \n        forced outages, force majeure, or compliance with prudent \n        electrical practices.\n            ``(3) The model standards under this subsection prohibit \n        the imposition of additional charges by local distribution \n        systems for equipment or services for interconnection that are \n        additional to those necessary to meet such standards.\n    ``(h) Interconnection.--At the election of the owner or operator of \nthe generation unit concerned, connections meeting the standards \napplicable under subsection (g) may be made--\n            ``(1) by such owner or operator at such owner's or \n        operator's expense, or\n            ``(2) by the owner or operator of the local distribution \n        system upon the request of the owner or operator of the \n        generating unit and pursuant to an offer by the owner or \n        operator of the generating unit to reimburse the local \n        distribution system in an amount equal to the minimum cost of \n        such connection, consistent with the procurement procedures of \n        the State in which the unit is located, except that the work on \n        all such connections shall be performed by qualified electrical \n        personnel certified by a responsible body or licensed by a \n        State or local government authority.\n    ``(i) Consumer Friendly Contracts.--The Commission shall promulgate \nregulations insuring that simplified contracts will be used for the \ninterconnection of electric energy by electric energy transmission or \ndistribution systems and generating facilities that have a power \nproduction capacity not greater than 250 kilowatts.''."
