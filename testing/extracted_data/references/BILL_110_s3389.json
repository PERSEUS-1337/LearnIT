FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Each year corporations pay billions of dollars to \n        foreign governments and their affiliates for natural resources, \n        such as oil, gas, coal, copper, diamonds, and other extracted \n        minerals.\n            (2) Developing countries that derive a significant portion \n        of their revenues from natural resource extraction tend to have \n        higher poverty rates, weaker governance, higher rates of \n        conflict, and poorer development records than those countries \n        that do not rely on resource revenues. Since revenues derived \n        from natural resource extraction are often a singular \n        opportunity for some developing countries to structure programs \n        and institutions to broaden the collective and individual \n        wealth of their citizens, it is imperative that the uses of \n        such funds are closely monitored.\n            (3) There is a growing consensus among oil, gas, and mining \n        companies that transparency is good for business, since it \n        improves the business climate in which they work and fosters \n        good governance and accountability.\n            (4) Transparency benefits shareholders because of their \n        desire to know the amount of such payments in order to assess \n        financial risk, compare payments from country to country, and \n        assess whether such payments help to create a more stable \n        investment climate; moreover, undisclosed payments may be \n        perceived as corrupt and to the detriment of the image of the \n        corporation.\n            (5) It is in the United States best interest to promote \n        transparency, since transparency contributes to a better \n        investment climate, a more stable commodity supply, and greater \n        energy security.\n\nSEC. 3.
