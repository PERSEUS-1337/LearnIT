FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority \n        (Metro) maintains the second largest rail network in the \n        Nation.\n            (2) Local and State governments in the National Capital \n        Region have led efforts to extend Metrorail service, and any \n        future Metrorail extension will be provided only with their \n        collaboration, consistent with local planning objectives.\n            (3) In the most recent draft strategic plan, Momentum: The \n        Next Generation of Metro, Metro identifies future expansion \n        opportunities, including the Orange Line in Virginia from \n        Vienna to Centreville and the Blue Line in Virginia from \n        Franconia-Springfield to Prince William.\n            (4) More than 120,000 Federal employees ride Metro to work, \n        accounting for more than 40 percent of the morning rush-hour \n        ridership.\n            (5) More than half of Metro's current stations are located \n        on Federal property.\n            (6) The Federal Government has partnered with the State and \n        local governments to provide $300 million, consisting of $150 \n        million in Federal funds to match $50 million each from \n        Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia (Public Law \n        110-432), over a 10-year period for safety and other capital \n        improvements throughout the Metro system.\n            (7) Metro takes 580,000 cars off the road each day, \n        eliminates the need for 1,400 lane miles of highway, reduces \n        gas consumption by 75 million gallons annually, and eliminates \n        more than 10,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.\n            (8) Metrorail stations encourage transit-oriented \n        development, which is critical to protecting open space \n        throughout the region.\n            (9) Metro stimulates economic and job growth, and real \n        estate near Metrorail stations is worth in excess of $25 \n        billion.\n            (10) The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) and \n        the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transit (VDRPT) \n        completed a Major Investment Study that concluded that a \n        multimodal transportation strategy is required to accommodate \n        projected travel demand in Virginia along Interstate Route 66 \n        from Interstate Route 495 to the Centreville and Haymarket \n        communities, areas which would be served by the proposed Orange \n        Line extension.\n            (11) The Route 1 Multimodal Alternatives Analysis, a \n        partnership between VDOT, VDRPT, and Fairfax and Prince William \n        counties, in October 2014 endorsed recommendations for \n        improving the corridor to include extending Metro's Yellow Line \n        to Hybla Valley ``as expeditiously as possible''.\n            (12) The population of the area to be served by the \n        proposed Orange Line extension is expected to be 681,000 \n        individuals by 2025, while employment in the area is projected \n        to increase to 362,000 individuals.\n            (13) The population of the area to be served by the \n        proposed Blue and Yellow Line extensions grew by 120,000 people \n        between 2000 and 2010, and continued growth of another 100,000 \n        people is expected by 2020.\n            (14) The Comprehensive Plans for both Fairfax and Prince \n        William counties identify the need to develop alternative \n        transit concepts, including an extension of the existing \n        Metrorail lines.\n            (15) As a result of military base realignments and \n        closures, thousands of national defense-related Federal and \n        civilian jobs will shift from the area of Crystal City, \n        Virginia, which is served by Metrorail, to Fort Belvoir, \n        Virginia, and the Engineer Proving Ground in southern Fairfax, \n        neither of which is currently served by Metro.\n            (16) Department of Defense analysis shows many of those \n        employees are coming from points south and west.\n            (17) Additional job growth along the Richmond Highway \n        (Route 1) corridor and Interstate Route 95 in both Fairfax and \n        Prince William counties, including communities like Mount \n        Vernon, Woodbridge, and Potomac Mills, adds further urgency to \n        the need to expand Metro service in Northern Virginia.\n            (18) To ensure the regional transportation network can \n        accommodate projected growth, it is critical that extensions of \n        transit service are coordinated with local land use planning, \n        including the use of smart growth principles and transit-\n        oriented development.\n\nSEC. 3. NEW FIXED GUIDEWAY CAPITAL PROJECTS, NORTHERN VIRGINIA.\n\n    The following projects are deemed to have entered the project \ndevelopment phase under section 5309(d)(1) of title 49, United States \nCode:\n            (1) Northern Virginia--Extension of Metrorail Blue Line to \n        include the Engineer Proving Ground and the Interstate Route 95 \n        corridor in Fairfax and Prince William counties.\n            (2) Northern Virginia--Extension of Metrorail Orange Line \n        to Centreville.\n            (3) Northern Virginia--Extension of Metrorail Yellow Line \n        to the Richmond Highway (Route 1) corridor in Fairfax and \n        Prince William counties."
