Authorization of Appropriations.\nSec. 7. Audit Requirements.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The management of National Forest System lands in the \n        State of New Mexico must become proactive instead of passive or \n        delayed. The best proactive management approach to prevent \n        catastrophic fires would be to utilize the talents of local \n        communities for the process of thinning the forests. At the \n        same time, local communities will create businesses through \n        developing value-added products from the harvested wood.\n            (2) Increases in both the number and severity of wildfires \n        are occurring as a result of high tree densities, species \n        composition and structure that are outside the historic range \n        of variability. Fire disturbances contribute to significant \n        soil erosion, degradation of air and water quality, loss of \n        watershed values, loss of wildlife habitat and damage to other \n        forest resources.\n            (3) Serious destruction or degradation of important forest \n        resources occurs in all regions of New Mexico. The health of \n        the land is directly related to the economic health of the \n        communities it surrounds. Management activities of forests \n        should be designed to incorporate local communities in the \n        management process.\n            (4) The National Forest System lands in New Mexico are at \n        an unacceptable risk of destruction by catastrophic wildfire. \n        The condition of these forests can pose a significant threat of \n        destruction to human life and property as well as to the \n        habitat of fish, and wildlife (including threatened and \n        endangered species), public recreation areas, timber, watershed \n        and other important forest resources.\n            (5) Restoration and protection of important forest \n        resources require active forest management involving rural \n        communities who will integrate environmentally compatible \n        harvesting techniques and develop businesses which are operated \n        at the local level and driven by market forces.\n            (6) Many units of the National Forest System in New Mexico \n        have an increasing backlog of unfunded projects to restore and \n        protect degraded forest resources. Adequate funding, structured \n        so as to maximize allocation of monies on-the-ground projects, \n        is needed to address this backlog in an efficient, cost-\n        effective way.\n            (7) A comprehensive, Statewide effort is needed to restore \n        and protect important forest resources in an organized, \n        community wide, timely and scientific manner. There should be \n        immediate action to improve National Forest System lands in New \n        Mexico where serious resource degradation has been thoroughly \n        identified and assessed or where serious resource destruction \n        or degradation by natural disturbance is imminent.\n            (8) Inventory and analysis of the status and trends in the \n        fire conditions of forests and their resources are needed to \n        identify and reverse the destruction or degradation of \n        important forest resources in a timely and effective manner.\n\nSEC. 3.

This \n        formally established research area exemplifies the situation \n        and research stated in the findings specified in section 2. The \n        research implementation will require treatments to reduce small \n        diameter trees.
