FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) on July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched \n        from Launch Complex 39-A at the John F. Kennedy Space Center \n        carrying Neil Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin, and Michael \n        Collins, who would become the first of human kind to complete a \n        crewed lunar landing;\n            (2) the United States is the only country ever to have \n        attempted and succeeded in landing humans on a celestial body \n        off the Earth and safely returning them home, completing an \n        unprecedented engineering, scientific and political \n        achievement;\n            (3) the Apollo 11 mission, culminating in humanity's first \n        steps on the Moon on July 20, 1969, honored the fallen \n        astronauts of the Apollo 1 crew, whose innovative work and \n        bravery will be remembered forever;\n            (4) Apollo 11 accomplished the national goal set forth in \n        1961 by President John F. Kennedy, who stated at Rice \n        University the following year, ``We choose to go to the Moon. \n        We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other \n        things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, \n        because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best \n        of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that \n        we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and \n        one which we intend to win'';\n            (5) at the height of the Cold War, the Apollo space program \n        provided the United States and the free world with a powerful \n        symbolic win, demonstrating the strength, ambition, and \n        determination of the United States in technological and \n        economic advancement, and securing our Nation's leadership in \n        space for generations to come;\n            (6) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n        (referred to in this Act as ``NASA'') developed the most \n        powerful launch vehicle in history, the Saturn V rocket, which \n        was used for the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s;\n            (7) the Saturn V weighed 6,200,000 pounds and generated \n        7,600,000 million pounds of thrust, which NASA has equated to \n        generating more power than 86 Hoover Dams;\n            (8) during the time period from 1969 through 1972, NASA \n        completed 8 Apollo missions and landed 12 men on the Moon;\n            (9) the 6 missions that landed on the Moon returned with a \n        wealth of groundbreaking scientific data and over 800 pounds of \n        lunar samples;\n            (10) an estimated 400,000 Americans contributed to the \n        successful program that led to the lunar landing on July 20, \n        1969, including NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, \n        industry contractors and their engineering and manufacturing \n        workforce, as well as the political leadership of Republicans \n        and Democrats in Congress and the White House;\n            (11) the Apollo program, along with its predecessor Mercury \n        and Gemini programs, inspired generations of American students \n        to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and \n        mathematics, which has fueled innovation and economic growth \n        throughout a range of industries over the last 4 decades; and\n            (12) July 20, 2019, will mark the 50th anniversary of the \n        Apollo 11 landing of Neil Armstrong and Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin \n        on the lunar surface.\n\nSEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.\n\n    (a) Denominations.--In recognition and celebration of the 50th \nanniversary of the first manned Moon landing, the Secretary of the \nTreasury (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall \nmint and issue the following coins:\n            (1) $5 gold coins.--Not more than 50,000 $5 coins, which \n        shall--\n                    (A) weigh 8.359 grams;\n                    (B) be struck on a planchet having a diameter of \n                0.850 inches; and\n                    (C) contain not less than 90 percent gold.\n            (2) $1 silver coins.--Not more than 400,000 $1 coins, which \n        shall--\n                    (A) weigh 26.73 grams;\n                    (B) be struck on a planchet having a diameter of \n                1.500 inches; and\n                    (C) contain at least 90 percent silver.\n            (3) Half-dollar clad coins.--Not more than 750,000 half-\n        dollar coins which shall--\n                    (A) weigh 11.34 grams;\n                    (B) be struck on a planchet having a diameter of \n                1.205 inches; and\n                    (C) be minted to the specifications for half-dollar \n                coins contained in section 5112(b) of title 31, United \n                States Code.\n            (4) Proof silver $1 coins.--Not more than 100,000 proof $1 \n        silver coins which shall--\n                    (A) weigh 5 ounces;\n                    (B) be struck on a planchet having a diameter of 3 \n                inches; and\n                    (C) contain .999 fine silver.\n    (b) Legal Tender.--The coins minted under this Act shall be legal \ntender, as provided in section 5103 of title 31, United States Code.\n    (c) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and 5136 of \ntitle 31, United States Code, all coins minted under this Act shall be \nconsidered to be numismatic items.\n    (d) Convex Shape.--\n            (1) In general.--The coins minted under this Act shall be \n        produced in a fashion similar to the 2014 National Baseball \n        Hall of Fame 75th Anniversary Commemorative Coin, so that the \n        reverse of the coin is convex to more closely resemble the \n        faceplate of the astronaut's helmet of the time and the obverse \n        concave, providing a more dramatic display of the obverse \n        design chosen pursuant to section 4(c).\n            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n        to the extent possible without significantly adding to the \n        purchase price of the coins, the coins minted under this Act \n        should be produced with the design of the reverse of the coins \n        continuing over what would otherwise be the edge of the coins, \n        such that the reverse design extends all the way to the obverse \n        design.\n\nSEC. 4.
