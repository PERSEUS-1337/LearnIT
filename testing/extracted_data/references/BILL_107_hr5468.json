FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since time immemorial, the ancestors of the Eastern \n        Band of Cherokee Indians have lived in the Great Smoky \n        Mountains of North Carolina. The Eastern Band's ancestral \n        homeland includes much of seven eastern States and the land \n        that now constitutes the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n            (2) The Eastern Band has proposed a land exchange with the \n        National Park Service and has spent over $1,500,000 for studies \n        to thoroughly inventory the environmental and cultural \n        resources of the proposed land exchange parcels.\n            (3) Such land exchange would benefit the American public by \n        enabling the National Park Service to acquire the Yellow Face \n        tract, comprising 218 acres of land adjacent to the Blue Ridge \n        Parkway.\n            (4) Acquisition of the Yellow Face tract for protection by \n        the National Park Service would serve the public interest by \n        preserving important views for Blue Ridge Parkway visitors, \n        preserving habitat for endangered species and threatened \n        species including the northern flying squirrel and the rock \n        gnome lichen, preserving valuable high altitude wetland seeps, \n        and preserving the property from rapidly advancing residential \n        development.\n            (5) The proposed land exchange would also benefit the \n        Eastern Band by allowing it to reclaim the Ravensford tract, \n        comprising 144 acres adjacent to the Tribe's trust territory in \n        Cherokee, North Carolina, and currently within the Great Smoky \n        Mountains National Park. The Ravensford tract is part of the \n        Tribe's ancestral homeland as evidenced by archaeological finds \n        dating back no less than 6,000 years.\n            (6) The Eastern Band has a critical need to replace the \n        current Cherokee Elementary School, which was built by the \n        Department of the Interior over 40 years ago with a capacity of \n        480 students. The school now hosts 794 students in dilapidated \n        buildings and mobile classrooms at a dangerous highway \n        intersection in downtown Cherokee, North Carolina.\n            (7) The Eastern Band ultimately intends to build a new \n        three-school campus to serve as an environmental, cultural, and \n        educational ``village,'' where Cherokee language and culture \n        can be taught alongside the standard curriculum.\n            (8) The land exchange and construction of this educational \n        village will benefit the American public by preserving Cherokee \n        traditions and fostering a vibrant, modern, and well-educated \n        Indian nation.\n            (9) The land exchange will also reunify tribal lands now \n        separated between the Big Cove Community and the balance of the \n        Qualla Boundary, reestablishing the territorial integrity of \n        the Eastern Band.\n            (10) The Ravensford tract contains no threatened species or \n        endangered species listed pursuant to the Endangered Species \n        Act of 1973. The 218-acre Yellow Face tract has a number of \n        listed threatened species and endangered species and a higher \n        appraised value than the 144-acre Ravensford tract.\n            (11) The Congress and the Department of the Interior have \n        approved land exchanges in the past when the benefits to the \n        public and requesting party are clear, as they are in this \n        case.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To acquire the Yellow Face tract for protection by the \n        National Park Service, in order to preserve the Waterrock Knob \n        area's spectacular views, pristine wetlands, and endangered \nspecies and threatened species from encroachment by housing \ndevelopment, for the benefit and enjoyment of the American public.\n            (2) To transfer the Ravensford tract, to be held in trust \n        by the Department of the Interior for the benefit of the \n        Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, in order to provide for an \n        education facility that promotes the cultural integrity of the \n        Eastern Band and to reunify two Cherokee communities that were \n        historically contiguous.\n            (3) To promote cooperative activities and partnerships \n        between the Eastern Band and the National Park Service within \n        the Eastern Band's ancestral homelands.\n\nSEC. 3. LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Within 90 days after the effective date of this \nAct, the Secretary of the Interior shall exchange the Ravensford tract, \ncurrently in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, for the Yellow \nFace tract adjacent to the Waterrock Knob Visitor Center on the Blue \nRidge Parkway.\n    (b) Treatment of Exchanged Lands.--Effective upon receipt by the \nSecretary of a deed for the lands comprising the Yellow Face tract (as \ndescribed in subsection (c)) to the United States, all right, title, \nand interest of the United States in and to the Ravensford tract, (as \ndescribed in subsection (d)), including all improvements and \nappurtenances, are declared to be held in trust by the United States \nfor the benefit of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians as part of the \nCherokee Indian Reservation.\n    (c) Yellow Face Tract.--To effectuate this land exchange, the \nEastern Band shall cause the following lands to be deeded to the United \nStates.

The lands shall thereafter be \nincluded within the boundary of and managed as part of the Blue Ridge \nParkway by the National Park Service.\n    (d) Ravensford Tract.--The lands declared by subsection (b) to be \nheld in trust for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians are as follows: \nThe tract currently located within the Great Smoky Mountains National \nPark and identified on Map No. 133/80020, entitled ``Ravensford Land \nExchange Tract'', as on file and available for public inspection in the \nappropriate offices of the National Park Service and the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, consisting of 144 acres more or less.\n    (e) Legal Descriptions.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall file a legal \ndescription of the areas described in subsections (c) and (d) with the \nCommittee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources of the Senate. Such legal descriptions shall have the same \nforce and effect as if the information contained in the description \nwere included in those subsections except that the Secretary may \ncorrect clerical and typographical errors in such legal descriptions. \nThe legal descriptions shall be on file and available for public \ninspection in the offices of the National Park Service and the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs.\n\nSEC. 4.
