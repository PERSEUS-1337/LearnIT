FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among \n        people over 65.\n            (2) Sixty percent of fall-related deaths occur among \n        persons 75 and older.\n            (3) Twenty-five percent of elderly persons who sustain a \n        hip fracture die within 1 year.\n            (4) Hospital admissions for hip fractures among the elderly \n        have increased from 231,000 admissions in 1988 to 332,000 in \n        1999. The number of hip fractures is expected to exceed 500,000 \n        by 2040.\n            (5) The costs to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and \n        society as a whole from falls by elderly persons continue to \n        climb much faster than inflation and population growth. Direct \n        costs alone will exceed $32,000,000,000 in 2020.\n            (6) The Federal Government should devote additional \n        resources to research regarding the prevention and treatment of \n        falls in residential as well as institutional settings.\n            (7) A national approach to reducing elder falls, which \n        focuses on the daily life of senior citizens in residential, \n        institutional, and community settings is needed. The approach \n        should include a wide range of organizations and individuals \n        including family members, health care providers, social \n        workers, architects, employers and others.\n            (8) Reducing preventable adverse events, such as elder \n        falls, is an important aspect to the agenda to improve patient \n        safety.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to develop effective public education strategies in a \n        national initiative to reduce elder falls in order to educate \n        the elders themselves, family members, employers, caregivers, \n        and others who touch the lives of senior citizens;\n            (2) to expand needed services and gain information about \n        the most effective approaches to preventing and treating elder \n        falls; and\n            (3) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        to evaluate the effect of falls on the costs of medicare and \n        medicaid and the potential for reducing costs by expanding \n        services covered under these two programs.\n\nSEC. 4. PUBLIC EDUCATION.\n\n    Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Administration \non Aging within the Department of Health and Human Services shall--\n            (1) oversee and support a three-year national education \n        campaign to be carried out by the National Safety Council to be \n        directed principally to elders, their families, and health care \n        providers and focusing on ways of reducing the risk of elder \n        falls and preventing repeat falls; and\n            (2) provide grants to qualified organizations and \n        institutions for the purpose of organizing State-level \n        coalitions of appropriate State and local agencies, safety, \n        health, senior citizen and other organizations to design and \n        carry out local education campaigns, focusing on ways of \n        reducing the risk of elder falls and preventing repeat falls.\n\nSEC. 5.
