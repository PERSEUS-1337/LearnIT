    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Dietary Supplement Full \nImplementation and Enforcement Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Each year, more than 150,000,000 Americans regularly \n        consume dietary supplements to maintain and improve their \n        health.\n            (2) Consumer expenditures on dietary supplements exceeded \n        $25,000,000,000 in 2008.\n            (3) Given the growing awareness of the importance of \n        prevention and wellness in the health care system of the United \n        States, it is vital that laws governing the safety of, and \n        education about, dietary supplements be fully implemented and \n        enforced.\n            (4) In 1994, Congress approved, and the President signed \n        into law, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of \n        1994 (Public Law 103-417) (referred to in this Act as \n        ``DSHEA''). DSHEA balanced the importance of continuing \n        consumer access to vitamins, minerals, and other dietary \n        supplements, promoting scientific research on the benefits and \n        risks of dietary supplements, and fostering public education on \n        the benefits and risks of supplement use with the need for \n        regulatory safeguards to protect consumer health, including a \n        new standard for safety, penalties for mislabeled or \n        adulterated dietary supplements, rules to ensure scientific \n        substantiation of the claims made regarding dietary \n        supplements, and a notification requirement to the Food and \n        Drug Administration before dietary supplements that contain \n        certain new dietary ingredients may be marketed.\n            (5) DSHEA requires that claims made on dietary supplement \n        labels, packaging, and accompanying material be truthful, non-\n        misleading, and substantiated. Manufacturers are prohibited \n        from making claims that products are intended to diagnose, \n        treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a disease.\n            (6) DSHEA requires that dietary supplements comply with \n        good manufacturing practice (referred to in this section as \n        ``GMP'') requirements, and authorizes the Food and Drug \n        Administration to establish such requirements.\n            (7) In 2007, after many years of delay, the Food and Drug \n        Administration published regulations detailing the GMP \n        requirements for dietary supplements, including requirements \n        for identity, purity, strength, sanitary conditions, and \n        recordkeeping. The Food and Drug Administration began to \n        enforce those requirements in 2008.\n            (8) DSHEA requires that, before marketing a dietary \n        supplement containing certain new dietary ingredients, the \n        manufacturer or distributor must submit notice to the Food and \n        Drug Administration that includes information showing that the \n        dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe. \n        According to the Food and Drug Administration, the Food and \n        Drug Administration has raised objections to more than 70 \n        percent of all new dietary ingredient notifications submitted \n        to the agency.\n            (9) The Food and Drug Administration has successfully used \n        the adulteration provisions of DSHEA to remove from the \n        marketplace dietary supplements that present an unreasonable \n        risk of injury or illness.\n            (10) In 2002, Congress passed the Public Health Security \n        and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act (Public Law 107-\n        188). This law requires any facility engaged in manufacturing, \n        processing, packing, or holding food for consumption in the \n        United States, including dietary supplements, to be registered \n        with the Food and Drug Administration.\n            (11) In 2006, Congress supplemented DSHEA by approving the \n        Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection \n        Act (Public Law 109-462). This law requires dietary supplement \n        manufacturers, packers, and distributors to report promptly to \n        the Food and Drug Administration any reports the manufacturer \n        or other responsible person receives of serious adverse events \n        associated with the use of the products of such manufacturer or \n        other responsible person. Information the Food and Drug \n        Administration receives under this reporting requirement may \n        help the agency detect possible safety problems related to \n        dietary supplement products or ingredients.\n            (12) DSHEA created the Office of Dietary Supplements within \n        the National Institutes of Health to expand research and \n        consumer information about the health effects of dietary \n        supplements. The Office of Dietary Supplements has greatly \n        expanded the number of scientific studies of dietary \n        supplements and the availability of reliable information to \n        consumers.\n            (13) While the Food and Drug Administration has taken some \n        important steps to implement and enforce DSHEA and the other \n        laws governing the regulation of dietary supplements, the \n        agency has not fully implemented and enforced DSHEA and the \n        other laws governing the regulation of dietary supplements.\n            (14) Both the public and regulated industry would benefit \n        from more guidance from the Food and Drug Administration on the \n        procedures and definitions concerning the regulation of new \n        dietary ingredients under section 413 of the Federal Food, \n        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350b).\n            (15) If the Food and Drug Administration determines that a \n        product labeled as a dietary supplement includes an anabolic \n        steroid or an analogue of an anabolic steroid, the Food and \n        Drug Administration does not systematically notify the Drug \n        Enforcement Administration of that determination.\n            (16) The Food and Drug Administration needs adequate \n        resources to implement and enforce DSHEA and other laws \n        governing the regulation of dietary supplements appropriately. \n        Congress has appropriated additional funds over the last \n        several years to implement and enforce DSHEA, reaching more \n        than $14,000,000 for fiscal year 2009.\n            (17) According to the Food and Drug Administration, full \n        implementation of DSHEA and the other laws governing the \n        regulation of dietary supplements would require substantial \n        additional resources. In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration \n        reported to Congress in writing that the agency would need \n        between $24,000,000 and $65,000,000 per year to fully implement \n        DSHEA.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that:\n            (1) The Food and Drug Administration should increase \n        efforts to implement DSHEA more fully and effectively, by--\n                    (A) providing Congress with a professional judgment \n                estimate of the annual costs during the 5-year period \n                beginning on the date of enactment of this Act to fully \n                implement and enforce DSHEA and other dietary \n                supplement laws and regulations under the jurisdiction \n                of the Food and Drug Administration;\n                    (B) conducting inspections, using appropriately \n                trained inspection personnel, of all facilities in \n                which a dietary supplement is manufactured, processed, \n                packed, or held to ensure compliance with the new \n                dietary supplement good manufacturing practices \n                regulations;\n                    (C) using the authority under DSHEA to protect the \n                public from unsafe dietary supplement products and \n                ingredients and to ensure that claims made are \n                truthful, non-misleading, and substantiated, with \n                highest regulatory priority given to cases of clear \n                violations of the law (including the intentional \n                adulteration and spiking of products);\n                    (D) implementing the recommendations contained in \n                the January 2009 report of the Government \n                Accountability Office, entitled, ``Dietary Supplements: \n                FDA Should Take Further Actions To Improve Oversight \n                and Consumer Understanding'', (GAO 09-250) that the \n                Food and Drug Administration--\n                            (i) require all dietary supplement \n                        manufacturers, packers, and distributors to \n                        identify themselves specifically as such under \n                        existing registration requirements and to \n                        update such information annually;\n                            (ii) promptly issue guidance to clarify \n                        when a dietary supplement ingredient is a new \n                        dietary ingredient, the evidence needed to \n                        document the safety of new dietary ingredients, \n                        and appropriate methods for establishing the \n                        identity of a new dietary ingredient; and\n                            (iii) coordinate with stakeholder groups \n                        involved in consumer outreach to identify, \n                        implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of \n                        additional mechanisms for educating consumers \n                        about the safety, efficacy, and labeling of \n                        dietary supplements; and\n                    (E) notifying the Drug Enforcement Administration \n                if the Food and Drug Administration determines that the \n                information in a new dietary ingredient notification \n                submitted under section 413 of the Federal Food, Drug, \n                and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350b) is inadequate to \n                establish that the new dietary ingredient will \n                reasonably be expected to be safe, because the dietary \n                supplement may contain an anabolic steroid or an \n                analogue of an anabolic steroid.\n            (2) The manufacturers, packers, retailers, and distributors \n        of dietary supplements and dietary supplement ingredients \n        should increase efforts to--\n                    (A) comply fully with all requirements of DSHEA and \n                the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug \n                Consumer Protection Act;\n                    (B) cooperate fully and appropriately with the Food \n                and Drug Administration in implementation and \n                enforcement of Federal laws and regulations; and\n                    (C) provide the Food and Drug Administration with \n                appropriate input on known and suspected violations of \n                such laws and regulations.\n\nSEC. 4.
