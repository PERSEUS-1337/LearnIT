FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There are hospitals throughout the United States that \n        have inadequate staffing of registered nurses to protect the \n        well-being and health of the patients.\n            (2) Studies show that the health of patients in hospitals \n        is directly proportionate to the number of registered nurses \n        working in the hospital.\n            (3) There is a critical shortage of registered nurses in \n        the United States.\n            (4) The effect of that shortage is revealed in unsafe \n        staffing levels in hospitals.\n            (5) Patient safety is adversely affected by these unsafe \n        staffing levels, creating a public health crisis.\n            (6) Registered nurses are being required to perform \n        professional services under conditions that do not support \n        quality health care or a healthful work environment for \n        registered nurses.\n            (7) As a payer for inpatient and outpatient hospital \n        services for individuals entitled to benefits under the program \n        established under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, the \n        Federal Government has a compelling interest in promoting the \n        safety of such individuals by requiring any hospital \n        participating in such program to establish minimum safe \n        staffing levels for registered nurses.\n\nSEC. 3.
