FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) employment of private security officers in the United \n        States is growing rapidly;\n            (2) the private security industry provides numerous \n        opportunities for entry-level job applicants, including \n        individuals suffering from unemployment due to economic \n        conditions or dislocations;\n            (3) sworn law enforcement officers provide significant \n        services to the citizens of the United States in its public \n        areas, and are only supplemented by private security officers \n        who provide prevention and reporting services in support of, \n        but not in place of, regular sworn police;\n            (4) given the growth of large private shopping malls, and \n        the consequent reduction in the number of public shopping \n        streets, the American public is more likely to have contact \n        with private security personnel in the course of a day than \n        with sworn law enforcement officers;\n            (5) regardless of the differences in their duties, skill, \n        and responsibilities, the public has difficulty in discerning \n        the difference between sworn law enforcement officers and \n        private security personnel; and\n            (6) the American public demands the employment of \n        qualified, well-trained private security personnel as an \n        adjunct, but not a replacement for sworn law enforcement \n        officers.\n\nSEC. 3.
