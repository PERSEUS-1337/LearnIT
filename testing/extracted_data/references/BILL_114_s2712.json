FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Approximately 10,000 to 11,000 individuals are retired \n        from service in the Armed Forces for medical reasons each year.\n            (2) Some of such individuals are separated from service in \n        the Armed Forces for combat-related injuries (as defined in \n        section 104(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).\n            (3) Congress has recognized the tremendous personal \n        sacrifice of veterans with combat-related injuries by, among \n        other things, specifically excluding from taxable income \n        severance pay received for combat-related injuries.\n            (4) Since 1991, the Secretary of Defense has improperly \n        withheld taxes from severance pay for wounded veterans, thus \n        denying them their due compensation and a significant benefit \n        intended by Congress.\n            (5) Many veterans owed redress are beyond the statutory \n        period to file an amended tax return because they were not or \n        are not aware that taxes were improperly withheld.\n\nSEC. 3.
