SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Prostate Research, Outreach, \nScreening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2010'' \nor the ``PROSTATE Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n        death among men.\n            (2) In 2009, more than 190,000 new patients were diagnosed \n        with prostate cancer and more than 27,000 men died from this \n        disease.\n            (3) Roughly 2,000,000 Americans are living with a diagnosis \n        of prostate cancer and its consequences.\n            (4) While prostate cancer generally affects older \n        individuals, younger men are also at risk for the disease, and \n        when prostate cancer appears in early middle age it frequently \n        takes on a more aggressive form.\n            (5) There are significant racial and ethnic disparities \n        that demand attention, namely African-Americans have prostate \n        cancer mortality rates that are more than double those in the \n        White population.\n            (6) Underserved rural populations have higher rates of \n        mortality compared to their urban counterparts, and innovative \n        and cost-efficient methods to improve rural access to high \n        quality care should take advantage of advances in telehealth to \n        diagnose and treat prostate cancer when appropriate.\n            (7) Urologists may constitute the specialists who diagnose \n        and treat the vast majority of prostate cancer patients.\n            (8) Although much basic and translational research has been \n        completed and much is currently known, there are still many \n        unanswered questions. For example, it is not fully understood \n        how much of known disparities are attributable to disease \n        etiology, access to care, or education and awareness in the \n        community.\n            (9) Causes of prostate cancer are not known. There is not \n        good information regarding how to differentiate accurately, \n        early on, between aggressive and indolent forms of the disease. \n        As a result, there is significant overtreatment in prostate \n        cancer. There are no treatments that can durably arrest growth \n        or cure prostate cancer once it has metastasized.\n            (10) A significant proportion (roughly 23 to 54 percent) of \n        cases may be clinically indolent and ``overdiagnosed'', \n        resulting in significant overtreatment. More accurate tests \n        will allow men and their families to face less physical, \n        psychological, financial, and emotional trauma and billions of \n        dollars could be saved in private and public health care \n        systems in an area that has been identified by the Medicare \n        program as one of eight high volume, high cost areas in the \n        Resource Utilization Report program authorized by Congress \n        under the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act \n        of 2008.\n            (11) Prostate cancer research and health care programs \n        across Federal agencies should be coordinated to improve \n        accountability and actively encourage the translation of \n        research into practice, to identify and implement best \n        practices, in order to foster an integrated and consistent \n        focus on effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this \n        disease.\n\nSEC. 3.
