SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Defending Against Imitations and \nReplacements of Yogurt, Milk, and Cheese To Promote Regular Intake of \nDairy Everyday Act'' or the ``DAIRY PRIDE Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet \n        for both children and adults, according to the 2015-2020 \n        Dietary Guidelines for Americans (referred to in this section \n        as the ``Dietary Guidelines'') published by the Department of \n        Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture. \n        The Dietary Guidelines state that most Americans are not \n        meeting recommended intake for the dairy food group. \n        Consumption of dairy foods provides numerous health benefits, \n        including lowering the risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, \n        cardiovascular disease, and obesity.\n            (2) The Dietary Guidelines state that dairy foods are \n        excellent sources of critical nutrients for human health, \n        including vitamin D, calcium, and potassium, all of which are \n        under consumed by people of the United States. When consumed in \n        the amounts recommended by the Food Patterns of the Department \n        of Agriculture, on average across the calorie levels, dairy \n        foods contribute about 67 percent of calcium, 64 percent of \n        vitamin D, and 17 percent of magnesium.\n            (3) About 30 percent of adolescent boys meet or exceed the \n        recommended 3-cup equivalents per day, but less than 10 percent \n        of adolescent females meet or exceed this recommendation. An \n        age-related decline in dairy intake appears to begin in \n        adolescence and intakes persist at very low levels among adult \n        females across the age distribution. Less than 5 percent of \n        adult females consume the recommended 3-cup equivalents per \n        day. Overall, more than 80 percent of the entire population of \n        the United States does not meet the daily dairy intake \n        recommendation.\n            (4) The Dietary Guidelines state that vitamin D and \n        potassium amounts vary across plant-based milk alternatives. \n        The amount of calcium per calorie is lower for most plant-based \n        alternative milk products. To obtain the amount of calcium \n        contained in one cup of non-fat fluid milk from a plant-based \n        milk alternative, the portion size and calorie intake must be \n        greater.\n            (5) Imitation dairy products, such as plant-based products \n        derived from rice, nuts, soybeans, hemp, coconut, algae, and \n        other foods that imitate milk, yogurt, and cheese, often do not \n        provide the same nutrition content as real milk, cheese, and \n        yogurt derived from dairy cows.\n            (6) Plant-based products labeled as milk are misleading to \n        consumers.\n            (7) The Food and Drug Administration has regulations that \n        define milk and cream as the ``lacteal secretion, practically \n        free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or \n        more healthy cows'' (section 131.110 of title 21, Code of \n        Federal Regulations). This definition further applies to milk \n        used to create other dairy products, including yogurt and \n        cheese, as specified in sections 131 and 133 of title 21, Code \n        of Federal Regulations.\n            (8) Given the proliferation of plant-based products in the \n        marketplace that are mislabeled as milk despite the standard of \n        identity defined for this substance, enforcement by the Food \n        and Drug Administration against these practices should be \n        improved to avoid misleading consumers.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    No food may be introduced or delivered for introduction into \ninterstate commerce using a market name for a dairy product if the food \ndoes not meet the criterion set forth for dairy products under \nparagraph (z)(2) of section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct (21 U.S.C. 343) (as added by section 4(a)).\n\nSEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT OF DEFINITION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(z)(1) If it uses a market name for a dairy product described in \nsubparagraph (3) and the food does not meet the criterion for being a \ndairy product, as described in subparagraph (2).\n    ``(2) For purposes of this paragraph, a food is a dairy product \nonly if the food is, contains as a primary ingredient, or is derived \nfrom, the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained \nby the complete milking of one or more hooved mammals.\n    ``(3) A market name for a dairy product described in this \nsubparagraph means the dairy product terms described in parts 131 and \n133 of subchapter B of chapter I of title 21, Code of Federal \nRegulations, and sections 135.110, 135.115, and 135.140 of title 21, \nCode of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations), or any \nother term for which the Secretary has promulgated a standard of \nidentity with respect to a food that is formulated with a dairy product \n(as described in subparagraph (2)) as the primary ingredient.''.\n    (b) Guidance.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting \nthrough the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall--\n            (1) not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, issue draft guidance on how enforcement of the \n        amendment made by subsection (a) will be carried out; and\n            (2) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, issue final guidance on such enforcement.\n    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nacting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall report to \nCongress on enforcement actions taken under paragraph (z) of section \n403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343), as \namended by this Act, including warnings issued pursuant to such \nparagraph and penalties assessed under section 303 of such Act (21 \nU.S.C. 333) with respect to such paragraph. If food that is misbranded \nunder section 403(z) is offered for sale in interstate commerce at the \ntime of such report, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall include \nin such report an updated plan for enforcement with respect to such \nfood."
