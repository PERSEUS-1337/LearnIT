FINDINGS.\n\n    Section 2 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (26 U.S.C. 7601) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (3), by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(D) In 2007, the rate at which children accessed \n        treatment failed to keep pace with new pediatric infections. \n        While children account for almost 16 percent of all new HIV \n        infections, they make up only 9 percent of those receiving \n        treatment under this Act.'';\n            (2) by amending paragraph (16) to read as follows:\n            ``(16) Basic interventions to prevent new HIV infections \n        and to bring care and treatment to people living with AIDS, \n        such as voluntary counseling and testing, are achieving \n        meaningful results and are cost-effective. The challenge is to \n        expand these interventions to a national basis in a coherent \n        and sustainable manner.''; and\n            (3) by amending paragraph (20) to read as follows:\n            ``(20) With no medical intervention, mothers infected with \n        HIV have a 25 to 30 percent chance of passing the virus to \n        their babies during pregnancy and childbirth. A simple and \n        effective intervention can significantly reduce mother to child \n        transmission of HIV. A single dose of an anti-retroviral drug \n        given once to the mother at the onset of labor, and once to the \n        baby during the first 3 days of life reduces transmission by \n        approximately 50 percent. Other more complex drug regimens can \n        further reduce transmission from mother-to-child. A dramatic \n        expansion of access to prevention of mother-to-child \n        transmission services is critical to preventing thousands of \n        new pediatric HIV infections.''.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress makes the following findings:\n            ``(1) Every day, approximately 1,100 children around the \n        world are infected with HIV, the vast majority through mother-\n        to-child transmission during pregnancy, labor or delivery or \n        soon after through breast-feeding. Approximately 90 percent of \n        these infections occur in Africa.\n            ``(2) With no medical intervention, mothers infected with \n        HIV have a 25 to 30 percent chance of passing the virus to \n        their babies during pregnancy and childbirth. A single dose of \n        an anti-retroviral drug given once to the mother at the onset \n        of labor, and once to the baby during the first 3 days of life \n        reduces transmission by approximately 50 percent.\n            ``(3) Providing the full range of interventions, as is the \n        standard of care in the United States, could reduce the rate of \n        mother-to-child transmission of HIV to as little as 2 percent.\n            ``(4) Global coverage of services to prevent transmission \n        from mother-to-child remains unacceptably low. The Joint United \n        Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) reports that fewer than 10 \n        percent of pregnant women with HIV in resource-poor countries \n        have access to prevention of mother-to-child transmission \n        services.\n            ``(5) Prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs \n        provide health benefits for women and children beyond \n        preventing the vertical transmission of HIV. They serve as an \n        entry point for mothers to access treatment for their own HIV \n        infection, allowing them to stay healthy and to care for their \n        children. Efforts to connect and integrate prevention of \n        mother-to-child transmission and HIV care, treatment and \n        prevention programs are crucial to achieving improved outcomes \n        for HIV-affected and HIV-infected women and families.\n            ``(6) Access to comprehensive HIV prevention services must \n        be drastically scaled-up among pregnant women infected with HIV \n        and pregnant women not infected with HIV to further protect \n        themselves and their partners against the sexual transmission \n        of HIV/AIDS.\n            ``(7) Preventing unintended pregnancy among HIV-infected \n        women is recognized by the World Health Organization and the \n        Office of the United States Global AIDS Coordinator to be an \n        integral component of prevention of mother-to-child \n        transmission programs. To further reduce infection rates, women \n        accessing prevention of mother-to-child transmission services \n        must have access to a range of high-quality family planning and \n        reproductive health care, so they can make informed decisions \n        about future pregnancies and contraception.\n            ``(8) In 2007, the rate at which children were accessing \n        treatment failed to keep pace with new pediatric infections. \n        While children account for almost 16 percent of all new HIV \n        infections, they make up only 9 percent of those on treatment \n        under this Act.\n            ``(9) Of the more than 2,500,000 people who were newly \n        infected with HIV in 2007, more than 420,000 were children.\n            ``(10) Without proper care and treatment, half of newly \n        HIV-infected children will die before they reach 2 years of \n        age, and 75 percent will die before 5 years of age.\n            ``(11) Because children are not just small adults, \n        providing HIV care and treatment presents special challenges, \n        including--\n                    ``(A) limited access to reliable HIV testing for \n                the youngest children;\n                    ``(B) a shortage of providers trained in delivering \n                pediatric care;\n                    ``(C) weak linkages between services to prevent \n                mother-to-child transmission and care and treatment \n                programs; and\n                    ``(D) the need for low-cost pediatric formulations \n                of HIV/AIDS medications.\n\n``SEC. 312.
