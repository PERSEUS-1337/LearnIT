FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the number of rental dwelling units available for lower \n        income families is insufficient, and the physical condition of \n        a substantial portion of such dwelling units is inadequate;\n            (2) Federal housing assistance programs, such as rent \n        subsidies, vouchers, and other rental and mortgage assistance, \n        too frequently assist middle and higher income families and do \n        not meet the demand for housing by lower income families;\n            (3) such Federal housing assistance programs are not cost-\n        effective, due to a lack of suitable rental dwelling units \n        available for lower income families; and\n            (4) a significant number of families are paying more than \n        25 percent of their monthly income for rent.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure that all families in the United States have \n        access to rental dwelling units at rents that are not more than \n        25 percent of their monthly income, and that such rental \n        dwelling units are decent, safe, and sanitary;\n            (2) to ensure that all funds for housing assistance by the \n        Federal Government benefit lower income families by requiring \n        the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to propose that \n        Federal housing assistance be limited to lower income families; \n        and\n            (3) to encourage the establishment of a public housing \n        system that consists of--\n                    (A) projects located throughout metropolitan and \n                rural areas;\n                    (B) low-density projects, to the extent \n                practicable; and\n                    (C) dwelling units that are visually \n                indistinguishable from comparable privately owned \n                dwelling units.\n\nSEC. 3. CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC HOUSING.\n\n    Section 5 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. \n1437c) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(m)(1) The Secretary shall carry out a program for the \nconstruction of 500,000 new dwelling units in public housing during \neach of the fiscal years 1998 through 2007.\n    ``(2) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \nsubsection such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years \n1998 through 2007. Any amount appropriated under this paragraph shall \nremain available until expended.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REVITALIZATION OF PUBLIC HOUSING.\n\n    Section 14(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. \n1437l(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(3)(A) To the extent approved in appropriation Acts and subject \nto subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall make available and contract to \nmake available financial assistance under this subsection, in addition \nto financial assistance made available under paragraphs (1) and (2). In \nmaking assistance available under this paragraph, the Secretary shall \ngive particular preference to public housing agencies requesting such \nassistance for public housing projects that the Secretary determines \nwould likely have been subject to demolition or disposition under \nsection 18, as such section was in effect before the date of the \nenactment of the Jesse Gray Housing Act.\n    ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the aggregate amount of \nbudget authority that may be obligated for contracts for annual \ncontributions is increased on October 1 of each of the years 1997 \nthrough 2006 by the amount necessary to provide for the revitalization \nof 100,000 dwelling units in public housing during each of the fiscal \nyears 1998 through 2007, respectively.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
