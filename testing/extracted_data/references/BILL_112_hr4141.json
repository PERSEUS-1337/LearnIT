FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) For more than 55 years the United States, backed by the \n        support of the American people, has been committed to providing \n        life-saving food assistance to developing countries and \n        vulnerable populations around the world.\n            (2) As the largest donor of international food assistance, \n        an essential tool in tackling malnutrition, the United States \n        can lead the way in improving food aid quality to better target \n        undernourished women and children.\n            (3) The United States contributes over one-half of all food \n        aid supplies to alleviate hunger and support development and \n        plays an important role in responding to emergency food aid \n        needs and ensuring global food security.\n            (4) Over the past decade, increasing food prices and \n        protracted humanitarian crises around the world have made \n        United States food assistance even more critical and relevant. \n        At the same time, these factors, combined with advancements in \n        nutrition science, as well as severe and ongoing fiscal \n        constraints, have led to an increased demand by policymakers \n        and program implementers for new specially formulated and cost-\n        effective products to meet the nutritional needs of the world's \n        most vulnerable populations.\n            (5) While United States food assistance is effective in \n        providing critical calories and nutrients to millions of people \n        during short-term emergencies, the long-term impacts of these \n        programs have also been increasingly called into question for \n        not meeting the nutritional needs of recipient populations.\n            (6) Reducing maternal and child malnutrition, especially in \n        the critical 1,000 days between pregnancy and age 2, is a key \n        priority of United States global food security and health \n        initiatives, including food aid.\n            (7) Recent reports by the Government Accountability Office \n        and the United States Agency for International Development \n        recommended over 35 changes to United States food aid products \n        and programs to improve the nutritional quality, quality \n        control, and cost effectiveness of United States food \n        assistance.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) even in this time of fiscal austerity, the American \n        people support the United States Government's historic \n        commitment to providing life-saving food assistance to the \n        world's most vulnerable populations;\n            (2) high food prices, coupled with growing constraints on \n        available resources for foreign assistance require the United \n        States Government to focus on creating efficiencies, improving \n        quality controls, and maximizing cost-effectiveness and \n        nutritional impact of United States food assistance programs;\n            (3) improving maternal and child health with supplemental \n        nutrition products is a central objective of international food \n        assistance programs; and\n            (4) the United States has shown considerable leadership in \n        meeting the nutrition needs of pregnant women and small \n        children through the 1,000 Days Partnership to support the \n        Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement.\n\nSEC. 4. PROVISION OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES.\n\n    Section 202(h) of the Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1722(h)) is \namended by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\n            ``(1) In general.--The Administrator shall use funds made \n        available in fiscal year 2012 and subsequent fiscal years to \n        carry out this title to improve the nutritional quality of \n        United States food assistance, particularly for vulnerable \n        groups such as pregnant and lactating mothers, children under \n        the age of five, with a focus on the cost-effective 1,000 days \n        between pregnancy and age 2, when appropriate, and \n        beneficiaries under the President's Emergency Fund for AIDS \n        Relief in Africa (PEPFAR), including by--\n                    ``(A) adopting new specifications or improving \n                existing specifications for micronutrient fortified \n                food aid products, based on the latest developments in \n                food and nutrition science;\n                    ``(B) strengthening necessary systems to better \n                assess the types and quality of agricultural \n                commodities and products donated for food assistance;\n                    ``(C) adjusting products and formulations, \n                including potential introduction of new fortificants \n                and products, as necessary to cost effectively meet \n                nutrient needs of target populations;\n                    ``(D) testing prototypes;\n                    ``(E) developing new program guidance to facilitate \n                improved matching of products to purposes having \n                nutritional intent, including an updated commodity \n                reference guide and decision tools;\n                    ``(F) developing enhanced guidance, in coordination \n                with the Coordinator of United States Government \n                Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally and PEPFAR, to \n                support the allocation of food commodities and products \n                for nutrition support in HIV programming, using \n                standardized indicators of impact;\n                    ``(G) providing improved guidance to implementing \n                partners on how to address nutritional deficiencies \n                that emerge among recipients for whom food assistance \n                is the sole source of diet in emergency programs that \n                extend beyond one year;\n                    ``(H) considering options for using United States-\n                produced food fortification packages, including vitamin \n                and mineral mixes, to fortify local foods in recipient \n                countries, as appropriate; and\n                    ``(I) evaluating, in appropriate program settings \n                and as necessary, the performance and cost-\n                effectiveness of new or modified specialized food \n                products and program approaches designed to meet the \n                nutritional needs of the most vulnerable groups.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
