FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is a compelling need to establish national \n        protection for inventoried roadless areas of the National \n        Forest System in order to protect the unique social and \n        ecological values of those irreplaceable resources;\n            (2) roadless areas protect healthy watersheds and their \n        numerous benefits including--\n                    (A) protecting downstream communities from floods \n                and tempering the effects of drought;\n                    (B) ensuring a supply of clean water for domestic, \n                agricultural, and industrial uses;\n                    (C) helping maintain abundant and healthy fish and \n                wildlife populations and habitats;\n                    (D) providing the setting for many forms of outdoor \n                recreation; and\n                    (E) providing drinking water to millions of \n                citizens from the more than 354 municipal watersheds \n                found on roadless areas;\n            (3) maintaining roadless areas in a relatively undisturbed \n        condition--\n                    (A) saves downstream communities millions of \n                dollars in water filtration costs; and\n                    (B) is crucial to preserve the flow of affordable, \n                clean water to a growing population;\n            (4) the protection of roadless areas can maintain \n        biological strongholds and refuges for many imperiled species \n        by halting the ongoing fragmentation of the landscape into \n        smaller and smaller parcels of land divided by road corridors;\n            (5) roadless areas conserve native biodiversity by serving \n        as a bulwark against the spread of nonnative invasive species;\n            (6) roadless areas provide unparalleled opportunities for \n        hiking, camping, picnicking, wildlife viewing, hunting, \n        fishing, cross-country skiing, canoeing, mountain-biking, and \n        similar activities;\n            (7) while roadless areas may have many wilderness-like \n        attributes, unlike wilderness areas, the use of mechanized \n        means of travel is allowed in many roadless areas;\n            (8) roadless areas contain many sites sacred to Native \n        Americans and other groups that use roadless areas for \n        spiritual and religious retreats;\n            (9) from the inception of Federal land management, it has \n        been the mission of the Forest Service and other agencies to \n        manage the National Forest System for the dual purposes of \n        resource extraction and conservation;\n            (10) consistent with that dual mission, this Act--\n                    (A) protects social and ecological values, while \n                allowing for many multiple uses of inventoried roadless \n                areas; and\n                    (B) does not impose any limitations on the use of, \n                or access to National Forest System, State, or private \n                land outside inventoried roadless areas;\n            (11) establishing a consistent national policy for the \n        protection of inventoried roadless areas--\n                    (A) ensures that the considerable long-term \n                ecological and economic benefits of protecting roadless \n                areas for future generations are properly considered;\n                    (B) diminishes the likelihood of controversy at the \n                project level; and\n                    (C) enables the Chief of the Forest Service to \n                focus on the economic and environmental benefits of \n                reducing hazardous fuel buildups in portions of the \n                landscape that already have roads;\n            (12) the National Fire Plan indicates that fires are almost \n        twice as likely to occur in roaded areas as in roadless areas, \n        because roadless areas are generally located further away from \n        communities and are harder to access;\n            (13) the report entitled ``Protecting People and Sustaining \n        Resources in Fire-Adapted Ecosystems--A Cohesive Strategy'' (65 \n        Fed. Reg. 67480) advocates a higher priority for fuel reduction \n        on land that is near communities and readily accessible \n        municipal watersheds;\n            (14) the Forest Service has an enormous backlog of \n        maintenance needs for the existing 386,000 mile road system of \n        the Forest Service that will cost millions of dollars to \n        eliminate;\n            (15) no State or private land owner would continue to build \n        new roads in the face of such an enormous backlog;\n            (16) failure to maintain forest roads--\n                    (A) limits public access; and\n                    (B) causes degradation of water quality and \n                wildlife and fish habitat; and\n            (17) protection of roadless areas--\n                    (A) will impact less than 0.5 percent of the \n                national timber supply; and\n                    (B) will have a negligible impact on oil and gas \n                production because--\n                            (i) the entire National Forest System \n                        provides only approximately 0.4 percent of the \n                        quantity of oil and gas that is produced in the \n                        United States; and\n                            (ii) roadless areas provide only a fraction \n                        of the quantity of oil and gas that is produced \n                        in the National Forest System.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide, within the \ncontext of multiple-use management, lasting protection for inventoried \nroadless areas within the National Forest System.\n\nSEC. 3.
