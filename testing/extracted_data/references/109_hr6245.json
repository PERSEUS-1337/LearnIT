land 200 feet on each side of \n        the marginal limits of the Grand River Ditch, where the 200 \n        foot exclusion on each side of the Grand River Ditch shall not \n        follow the topography of the land, but rather, shall be \n        measured by a horizontal, level projection from the marginal \n        limits of the Grand River Ditch; and the land down-slope from \n        the Grand River Ditch upon which rock, debris, and other \n        materials have been deposited during the construction, \n        improvement, maintenance, and repair of the Grand River Ditch.\n            (2) Land owned by the St. Vrain & Left Hand Water \n        Conservancy District, including Copeland Reservoir and the \n        Inlet Ditch to such reservoir from the North St. Vrain Creek, \n        amounting to approximately 35.38 acres.\n            (3) Land owned by the Wincentsen-Harms Trust, amounting to \n        approximately 2.75 acres.\n            (4) Land within the area depicted as ``East Shore Trail \n        Area'' on the map described in subsection (b).\n    (d) East Shore Trail Area.--\n            (1) Alignment line and trail.--\n                    (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the \n                date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n                establish an alignment line for a trail, to be known as \n                the ``East Shore Trail'', located within the East Shore \n                Trail Area, to maximize the opportunity for sustained \n                use of the trail without harm to affected resources.\n                    (B) Boundaries.--After establishing the alignment \n                line under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall \n                identify the boundaries of the trail, but the trail \n                shall not extend more than 25 feet east of the \n                alignment line or be located within the Wilderness.\n                    (C) Effect.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \n                to--\n                            (i) require the construction of a trail \n                        along the alignment line established pursuant \n                        to this paragraph;

MANAGEMENT OF ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK WILDERNESS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subject to valid existing rights, land designated \nas wilderness by section 2(a) or subsequently included in the \nWilderness shall be managed by the Secretary in a manner that preserves \nthe wilderness character of the land, in accordance with this Act.\n    (b) Water Rights.--\n            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n                    (A) According to decisions of the courts of the \n                State of Colorado, the United States has existing \n                rights to water within the Rocky Mountain National \n                Park.\n                    (B) Those rights are sufficient for the purposes of \n                the Wilderness as designated by section 2.\n                    (C) In light of the findings in subparagraphs (A) \n                and (B), there is no need for this Act to effect a \n                reservation by the United States of any additional \n                water rights to fulfill the purposes for which the \n                Wilderness is designated.\n            (2) No reservation.--Nothing in this Act or any action \n        taken pursuant to this Act shall constitute either an express \n        or implied reservation of water or water rights for any \n        purpose.\n            (3) No exemption from state water laws.--Nothing in this \n        Act constitutes an express or implied claim or denial on the \n        part of the Federal Government as to exemption from State water \n        laws.\n    (c) Colorado-Big Thompson Project.--\n            (1) Current activities.--Activities on, under, or affecting \n        the Wilderness relating to the monitoring, operation, \n        maintenance, repair, replacement, and use of the Colorado-Big \n        Thompson Project and its facilities which were allowed as of \n        June 1, 1998, shall be allowed to continue and shall not be \n        affected by the designation of the land as wilderness.\n            (2) New activities.--In addition to the activities \n        described in paragraph (1), any other activities on, under, or \n        affecting the Wilderness that because of emergencies or \n        catastrophic events become necessary for the operation, \n        maintenance, repair, replacement, and continued use of the \n        Colorado-Big Thompson Project and its facilities shall be \n        allowed, subject only to reasonable restrictions which are \n        established by the Secretary to protect the wilderness values \n        of the land. In implementing this paragraph, the Secretary \n        shall not establish any restrictions on the activities that \n        would prevent the occurrence of such necessary activities or \n        that would reduce the water supply provided by the Colorado-Big \n        Thompson Project or the Windy Gap Project.\n            (3) Relation to authority in act establishing park.--\n        Nothing in the first section of the Act of January 26, 1915 (16 \n        U.S.C. 191), shall be construed to allow development within the \n        Wilderness of any reclamation project not in existence as of \n        the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (d) No Buffer Zones.--Congress does not intend that the designation \nby this Act of the Wilderness creates or implies the creation of \nprotective perimeters or buffer zones around the Wilderness. The fact \nthat nonwilderness activities or uses can be seen or heard from within \nthe Wilderness shall not, of itself, preclude such activities or uses \nup to the boundary of the Wilderness.\n    (e) Trails.--The Secretary may upgrade trails or construct new \ntrails in the Wilderness, including primitive, unpaved, and wheelchair-\naccessible trails.\n    (f) Prohibition of Certain Uses.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as specifically provided for in \n        this Act, and subject to existing private rights--\n                    (A) no commercial enterprises or permanent roads \n                shall be allowed within the Wilderness;
