FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Educators, parents, and the general public cite \n        ineffective school discipline policies as a leading challenge \n        facing many public schools.\n            (2) Overly harsh, nondiscretionary school discipline \n        practices that address even minor misbehavior through \n        suspension, expulsion, metal detectors, surveillance cameras, \n        and arrest are ineffective and counterproductive.\n            (3) Research shows that ``get tough'' approaches to \n        discipline reinforce bad behavior and predict higher future \n        rates of misbehavior among suspended students.\n            (4) However, suspensions and expulsions are on the rise \n        nationally, and according to the United States Department of \n        Education Office of Civil Rights during the 2005-2006 school \n        year over 3,300,000 students were suspended at least once and \n        over 100,000 students were expelled.\n            (5) Students of color and students with disabilities are \n        more likely to be suspended or expelled than their peers for \n        similar disciplinary incidents.\n            (6) There is a high correlation between school discipline \n        and the student dropout rate. Suspended students are more \n        likely to be retained, to dropout, to engage in delinquent \n        activity, and to become involved in the juvenile or criminal \n        justice system.\n            (7) Teachers are also more likely to ``dropout'' of our \n        schools because of school discipline issues. A 2005 national \n        survey found that 44 percent of teachers, and 39 percent of \n        highly qualified teachers, listed school discipline as a reason \n        for leaving the profession.\n            (8) Learning is linked to student behavior. Successful \n        schools implement high academic and behavior standards, where \n        improvements in student behavior and school climate are \n        correlated with improved academic outcomes.\n            (9) Evidence-based and scientifically valid practices for \n        improving behavior and creating a school climate more conducive \n        to learning such as school-wide positive behavior supports, \n        have not been widely adopted, accurately implemented, or \n        sustained.\n            (10) Effective implementation of school-wide positive \n        behavior supports is linked to greater academic achievement, \n        significantly fewer disciplinary problems, lower suspension and \n        expulsion rates, and increased time for instruction.\n            (11) Early intervening services are an effective strategy \n        for instructional support. Following implementation of school-\n        wide positive behavior supports, out-of-school suspensions at \n        an elementary school in Illinois decreased 85 percent, from 243 \n        to 37 or fewer in 2 subsequent years, with a resultant gain of \n        386 days of instructional time. The percentage of students \n        meeting or exceeding proficiency on State standards increased \n        measurably.\n            (12) Many problems can be prevented or minimized with early \n        intervening services that have been shown to be effective and \n        reduce the need for more intensive and more costly \n        interventions. Upon implementing such supports, an elementary \n        school in Maryland witnessed a decrease in office discipline \n        referrals for major rule violations by 42 percent, recouping \n        119 days of instructional time for students, and 40 days of \n        administrator time within 1 school year.\n            (13) Schools that implement school-wide positive behavior \n        supports are perceived by teachers to be safer teaching \n        environments. In South Carolina, a school using a system of \n        positive behavior supports found that teacher transfer requests \n        declined by 100 percent and teacher absence days decreased by \n        36 percent.\n            (14) When approaches such as school-wide positive behavior \n        supports are employed, all students, including those with \n        significant and challenging behaviors, can succeed.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to expand the use of \nschool-wide positive behavior supports in schools in order to \nsystematically create a school climate that is highly conducive to \nlearning, to reduce discipline referrals, and to improve student \nacademic outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORTS.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``positive behavior supports'' means a \nsystematic approach to embed proven practices for early intervening \nservices, including a range of systemic and individualized strategies \nto reinforce desired behaviors and eliminate reinforcement for problem \nbehaviors, in order to achieve important social outcomes and increase \nlearning, while preventing problem behaviors for all students including \nthose with the most complex and intensive behavioral needs.\n\nSEC. 4.
