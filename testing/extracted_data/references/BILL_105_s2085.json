SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness for Small Business and \nEmployees Act of 1998''.\n\n                      TITLE I--TRUTH IN EMPLOYMENT\n\nSEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) An atmosphere of trust and civility in labor-management \n        relationships is essential to a productive workplace and a \n        healthy economy.\n            (2) The tactic of using professional union organizers and \n        agents to infiltrate a targeted employer's workplace, a \n        practice commonly referred to as ``salting'' has evolved into \n        an aggressive form of harassment not contemplated when the \n        National Labor Relations Act was enacted and threatens the \n        balance of rights which is fundamental to our system of \n        collective bargaining.\n            (3) Increasingly, union organizers are seeking employment \n        with nonunion employers not because of a desire to work for \n        such employers but primarily to organize the employees of such \n        employers or to inflict economic harm specifically designed to \n        put nonunion competitors out of business, or to do both.\n            (4) While no employer may discriminate against employees \n        based upon the views of employees concerning collective \n        bargaining, an employer should have the right to expect job \n        applicants to be primarily interested in utilizing the skills \n        of the applicants to further the goals of the business of the \n        employer.\n\nSEC. 102. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this title are--\n            (1) to preserve the balance of rights between employers, \n        employees, and labor organizations which is fundamental to our \n        system of collective bargaining;\n            (2) to preserve the rights of workers to organize, or \n        otherwise engage in concerted activities protected under the \n        National Labor Relations Act; and\n            (3) to alleviate pressure on employers to hire individuals \n        who seek or gain employment in order to disrupt the workplace \n        of the employer or otherwise inflict economic harm designed to \n        put the employer out of business.\n\nSEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS.\n\n    Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 158(a)) \nis amended by adding after paragraph (5) the following flush sentence:\n``Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring an \nemployer to employ any person who is not a bona fide employee \napplicant, in that such person seeks or has sought employment with the \nemployer with the primary purpose of furthering another employment or \nagency status: Provided, That this sentence shall not affect the rights \nand responsibilities under this Act of any employee who is or was a \nbona fide employee applicant, including the right to self-organization, \nto form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively \nthrough representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other \nconcerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other \nmutual aid or protection.''.\n\n                         TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Bargaining unit determinations by their nature require \n        the type of fact-specific analysis that only case-by-case \n        adjudication allows.\n            (2) The National Labor Relations Board has for decades held \n        hearings to determine the appropriateness of certifying a \n        single location bargaining unit.\n            (3) The imprecision of a blanket rule limiting the factors \n        considered material to determining the appropriateness of a \n        single location bargaining unit detracts from the National \n        Labor Relations Act's goal of promoting stability in labor \n        relations.\n\nSEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this title is to ensure that the National Labor \nRelations Board conducts a hearing process and specific analysis of \nwhether or not a single location bargaining unit is appropriate, given \nall of the relevant facts and circumstances of a particular case.\n\nSEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS.\n\n    Section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 159(c)) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(6) If a petition for an election requests the Board to certify a \nunit which includes the employees employed at one or more facilities of \na multi-facility employer, and in the absence of an agreement by the \nparties (stipulation for certification upon consent election or \nagreement for consent election) regarding the appropriateness of the \nbargaining unit at issue for purposes of subsection (b), the Board \nshall provide for a hearing upon due notice to determine the \nappropriateness of the bargaining unit. In making its determination, \nthe Board shall consider functional integration, centralized control, \ncommon skills, functions and working conditions, permanent and \ntemporary employee interchange, geographical separation, local \nautonomy, the number of employees, bargaining history, and such other \nfactors as the Board considers appropriate.''.\n\n                       TITLE III--ATTORNEYS FEES\n\nSEC. 301. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Certain small businesses and labor organizations are at \n        a great disadvantage in terms of expertise and resources when \n        facing actions brought by the National Labor Relations Board.\n            (2) The attempt to ``level the playing field'' for small \n        businesses and labor organizations by means of the Equal Access \n        to Justice Act has proven ineffective and has been \n        underutilized by these small entities in their actions before \n        the National Labor Relations Board.\n            (3) The greater expertise and resources of the National \n        Labor Relations Board as compared with those of small \n        businesses and labor organizations necessitate a standard that \n        awards fees and costs to certain small entities when they \n        prevail against the National Labor Relations Board.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title--\n            (1) to ensure that certain small businesses and labor \n        organizations will not be deterred from seeking review of, or \n        defending against, actions brought against them by the National \n        Labor Relations Board because of the expense involved in \n        securing vindication of their rights;\n            (2) to reduce the disparity in resources and expertise \n        between certain small businesses and labor organizations and \n        the National Labor Relations Board; and\n            (3) to make the National Labor Relations Board more \n        accountable for its enforcement actions against certain small \n        businesses and labor organizations by awarding fees and costs \n        to these entities when they prevail against the National Labor \n        Relations Board.\n\nSEC. 302.
