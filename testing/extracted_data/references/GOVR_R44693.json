    "content": "The FMLA requires that covered employers grant up to 12 workweeks of leave in a 12-month period to eligible employees for one or more of the following reasons: the birth and care of the employee's newborn child, provided that leave is taken within 12 months of the child's birth; the placement of an adopted or fostered child with the employee, provided that leave is taken within 12 months of the child's placement; to care for a spouse, child (generally a minor child), or parent with a serious health condition; the employee's own serious health condition that renders the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job; and qualified military exigencies if the employee's spouse, child, or parent is a covered military member on covered active duty. In addition, the act provides up to 26 workweeks of leave in a single 12-month period to eligible employees for the care of a covered military servicemember (including certain veterans) with a serious injury or illness that was sustained or aggravated in the line of duty while on active duty.  In general, to be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must work for a covered employer; have 1,250 hours of service in the 12 months prior to the start of leave; work at a location where the employer has 50 or more employees within 75 miles of the worksite; and have worked for the employer for 12 months. Private-sector employers are covered by the act if they engaged in commerce and had 50 or more employees for 20 weeks in the current or last calendar year. The FMLA also applies to public agencies (i.e., federal, state, and local governments), which are covered employers regardless of their staffing levels in the previous or current calendar year. However, public-sector employees must still meet the worksite coverage requirement (i.e., 50 employees within 75 miles of the worksite) to be eligible for FMLA leave. Since its passage in 1993, the FMLA has been amended four times to cover certain legislative branch employees ( P.L. 104-1 ); create and then modify a new entitlement for military family leave ( P.L. 110-181 and P.L. 111-84 , respectively); and modify the hours-of-service eligibility requirement for airline flight crew ( P.L. 111-119 ). Table 1 summarizes the act's legislative history. Several bills were introduced in the 114 th Congress to amend the FMLA. These proposals sought to create new entitlements (i.e., provide additional leave time), expand categories of permissible leave by creating new FMLA-qualifying uses of leave or expanding the circumstances under which existing leave categories may be used, and modify employee eligibility requirements. Some proposals would have amended the act in multiple areas; bill-by-bill summaries are in Table A-1 . Currently, eligible employees are entitled to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave in a 12-month period to address certain family and medical needs and 26 workweeks in a single 12-month period to provide care to a seriously ill or injured servicemember. Two bills would have created an additional entitlement to leave for similar purposes, with some differences:  Parental Involvement and Family Wellness Leave. H.R. 5518 would, among other things, have entitled eligible employees to up to four hours of leave during any 30-day period, with a maximum of 24 hours during any 12-month period to (1) participate in or attend a school conference or an activity that is sponsored by a school or community organization attended by the employee's child or grandchild, or (2) to attend to the employee's own routine medical care needs (including appointments) or those of a spouse, minor child, or grandchild, or the general care needs of an \"elderly relative.\" Parental Involvement Leave. H.R. 5535 would have entitled eligible employees to up to eight hours of leave during any 30-day period, with a maximum of 48 hours during any 12-month period, to participate in or attend a school conference or an activity that is sponsored by a school or community organization attended by the employee's child or grandchild.  In both cases, employees would be required to notify employers of their intention to use such leave at least seven days in advance of the leave, where possible. This 7-day notice requirement is shorter than the 30-day notice required, where possible, for a foreseeable need to use FMLA leave for the arrival of a new child, a serious health condition, or the serious injury or illness of a servicemember.  Under current law, eligible employees may use FMLA leave to care for and bond with a new child, for a serious health condition that renders the employee unable to perform at least one essential function of his or her job, to provide care to a close family member with a serious health condition, and for certain military family needs. The 114 th Congress considered several proposals to expand this set of qualifying uses of FMLA leave by (1) creating new leave categories, and (2) broadening the circumstances under which employees may use existing leave categories.  Bills introduced in the 114 th Congress would have allowed employees to use the existing FMLA leave entitlement for bereavement, needs related to domestic violence experienced by the employee or a close family member, family involvement, and medical needs related to certain service-connected disabilities for veterans.  The following proposals would have permitted eligible employees to use the existing FMLA leave entitlement for the death of a close family member (or members):  S. 1302 / H.R. 2260 would have allowed employees to use their 12-week entitlements for the death of a son or daughter. S. 473 would have allowed employees to use their 12-week entitlements for the death of a son or daughter (of any age), parent, or sibling. The bill would not have allowed employees to use FMLA for the death of a spouse.  S. 473 would have further allowed employees to use the existing 12-workweek entitlement to address medical, legal, and other needs related to domestic violence experienced by the employee or the employee's child (including an adult child) or parent.  S. 473 would have granted employees limited use of the existing 12-workweek leave entitlement for family involvement, which the bill defined as leave to (1) participate in school-related activities or school-sponsored extracurricular activities for a son or daughter, where school refers to an elementary or secondary school, Head Start program, or a licensed child care facility; or (2) provide transportation to or attend a medical or dental appointment for a spouse, child of any age, or a parent. Employees would be able to use family involvement leave for up to 24 hours in a 12-month period. The bills discussed in the \" Proposals to Create New FMLA Leave Entitlements \" section of this report would have created an additional entitlement to leave for similar family involvement purposes. H.R. 5165 would have permitted employees to use the current 12 - workweek entitlement for \" hospital care or medical services as a veteran for a service-connected disability\" that is currently rated at 30% or for which the veteran retired from the Armed Forces by reason of service-connected disability and which was rated at 30% or higher at the time of retirement.  Several proposals sought to expand employees' options for using the current set of FMLA-qualifying uses of leave by either (1) expanding the set of relationships for which an employee may use family leave or (2) amending definitions related to the current entitlement.  Under current law, an employee may use FMLA leave to assist or provide care to the following sets of family members: Leave for the arrival of a new son or daughter by birth or placement. A son or daughter, as defined by the act, is a \"biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is (A) under 18 years of age; or (B) 18 years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.\" Leave related to a family member's serious health condition may be taken for the employee's spouse, son or daughter, or parent. Military exigency leave (i.e., related to the deployment of certain military members to a foreign country) may be used in relation to a covered military member who is the employee's spouse, son or daughter, or parent. Military caregiver leave (i.e., care of a servicemember with a serious illness or injury) may be used for a servicemember who is the employee's spouse, son or daughter, or parent, or for whom the employee is next of kin.  The following legislative proposals would have expanded the groups of family members for whom FMLA leave may be used for caregiving purposes. For the arrival of a new son or daughter by birth or placement (within 12 months of arrival): S. 473 and H.R. 5519 would have amended the definition of son or daughter to include the child of a domestic partner (as well as adult children) and would therefore allow the employee to use leave for the arrival by birth or placement of a domestic partner's new child , and the placement of an adult child. H.R. 5701 would have allowed an employee to use leave for the arrival by birth or placement of a grandchild, including the placement of an adult grandchild. Because the bill would have amended the FMLA definition of son or daughter to include adult children, leave would also be permitted for the placement of an adult child. For needs related to a family member's serious health condition:  S. 473 proposed to add a domestic partner, adult child, child of a domestic partner, parent-in-law, grandparent, and sibling. H.R. 5519 proposed to add domestic partner, adult child, child of a domestic partner, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, and \"any other individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.\" H.R. 5701 proposed to add adult child, grandchild, and grandparent. For military exigency leave: S. 473 proposed to add a domestic partner, adult child, child of a domestic partner, parent-in-law, grandchild, and sibling. H.R. 5519 proposed to add domestic partner, adult child, child of a domestic partner, parent-in-law, grandchild, sibling, and \"any other individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.\" H.R. 5701 proposed to add adult child, grandchild, and grandparent. For military caregiver leave: S. 473 proposed to add a domestic partner, adult child, child of a domestic partner, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparent, and sibling. H.R. 5519 proposed to add domestic partner, adult child, child of a domestic partner, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, parent-in-law, grandparent, sibling, and any covered servicemember for whom the employee is in a relationship that is \"the equivalent of a family relationship.\" H.R. 5701 proposed to add adult child, grandchild, and grandparent. The 114 th Congress considered legislation that would have broadened or clarified current FMLA-qualifying uses of leave by amending FMLA definitions of son or daughter and serious health condition .  Under current law, FMLA defines son or daughter as a \"biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is (A) under 18 years of age; or (B) 18 years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.\" As noted elsewhere in this report, S. 473 , H.R. 5519 , and H.R. 5701 would have amended the FMLA definition of son or daughter to include children of \"any age,\" effectively expanding current FMLA-qualifying uses of leave to include adult children. S. 473 and H.R. 5519 would also have amended the definition to include a child of a domestic partner; likewise broadening the applicability of this leave. The act defines serious health condition as \"an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves (A) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or (B) continuing treatment by a health care provider.\" Neither the act nor its accompanying regulations provide an exhaustive list of conditions that meet this definition; consequently, the determination of a serious health condition is typically treated on a case-by-case basis. S. 2584 and H.R. 4616 would have , among other things , amend ed the act to specify that a \" physical or mental condition\" as referenced in the statutory definition of a serious health condition includes recovery from surgery related to organ donation . S. 2584 and H.R. 4616 would not have provided that such recovery, on its own, constitutes a serious health condition; statutory tests concerning inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider would still need to be met.  The 114 th Congress considered two proposals to amend general eligibility requirements for employees seeking to use FMLA leave and two proposals to amend eligibility requirements for specific worker groups. In general, to be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must work for a covered employer; have at least 1,250 hours of service in the 12 months prior to the start of leave; have worked for the employer for 12 months; and work at a location where the employer has 50 or more employees within 75 miles of the worksite. The 114 th Congress considered two proposals to amend these general eligibility requirements for employees seeking to use FMLA leave. They are 1. H.R. 5518 , which would have reduce d the minimum number of employees (of the same employer) within 75 miles of an employee's worksite from 50 employees to 15 employees ; and 2. H.R. 5496 , which proposed to amend the general hours - of - service requirement to remove reference to \" 1,250 hours of service ... during the previous 12-month period\" , and include part-time and full-time employees as \"eligible employees . \" The bill did not propose changes to hours-of-service requirements for airline flight crew.  Two bills proposed new eligibility requirements for certain veterans with service-connected disabilities and for education support professionals.  As described earlier, H.R. 5165 proposed to provide a new FMLA-qualifying use of leave for veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher. The bill further provided separate eligibility requirements that would have allowed certain veterans to access this new FMLA-protected leave without meeting the standard 12 months and 1,250 hours (over the last 12 months) of employment requirement.  The bill proposed that for employees who are veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs:  A veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30%-50% would be eligible to use leave for medical care related to his or her service-connected disability if employed for 8 months (with the current employer) and for least 833 hours in the previous 8 month period. A veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 60% or higher would be eligible to use leave for medical care related to his or her service-connected disability if employed for 6 months (with the current employer) and for least 625 hours in the previous 6-month period. Employees using leave for medical needs related to a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher would be required to provide certification from a VA medical provider or from a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facility \"through which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has furnished hospital care or medical services\".  For employees who are veterans with a service-connected disability that is not currently rated at 30% or higher by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, but retired from the Armed Forces by reason of service-connected disability that was rated at 30% or higher using the schedule in use by the VA at the time of retirement, the bill proposed that:  A veteran whose service-connected disability was rated at 30%-50% at the time of retirement would be eligible to use leave for medical care related to his or her service-connected disability if employed for 8 months (with the current employer) and for least 833 hours in the previous 8-month period. A veteran whose service-connected disability was rated at 60% or higher at the time of retirement would be eligible to use leave for medical care related to his or her service-connected disability if employed for 6 months (with the current employer) and for least 625 hours in the previous 6-month period. Employees using leave for medical needs related to a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher at the time of retirement would be required to provide certification from the Department of Defense that describes the terms of the veteran's retirement from the Armed Forces. The effect of the separate eligibility requirement is twofold. First, it would have permitted veterans (e.g., who are new employees) to access FMLA leave for service-connected-disability medical needs sooner than the standard 12-month requirement. Second, because the hours-of-service requirement is also adjusted, it might have facilitated some veterans' year-to-year use of this leave.  S. 3444 would have created a separate hours-of-service requirement for educational support professionals (ESP). The bill defined an ESP as an employee of \"a public elementary or secondary school or public institution of higher education, that may include (aa) a para educator that provides instructional or non-instructional support; and (bb) a member of the secretarial, clerical, or administrative support staff.\"  Pursuant to S. 3444 , an ESP would meet the hours-of-service requirement for eligibility if during the previous 12 months, the employee worked (for the current employer), at least (1) an average of 60 hours per month or (2) 60% of the \"applicable total monthly hours expected for the employee's job description and duties (as assigned for the school year preceding the school year during which the hours of service are calculated)\" on average. The proposal would also have allowed the Secretary of Labor to create separate rules for calculating the leave entitlement of ESPs, but would not change the size of the entitlement available to them."
