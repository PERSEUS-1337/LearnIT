FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The social security account number is a very effective \n        and powerful method of identifying individuals in modern \n        society and its use must therefor be restricted if reasonable \n        levels of privacy are to be maintained.\n            (2) Numerous citizens concerned for their privacy have \n        petitioned the Congress that use of their social security \n        account numbers at all levels of government be restricted.\n    (b) Declaration of Policy.--It is therefore the policy of the \nCongress to restrict the use of the social security account number to \npurposes most directly related to social security and other social \nservices.\n\nSEC. 3.
