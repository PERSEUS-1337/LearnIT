directly in cash,\n                    (B) under which a participant is treated as having \n                elected to have the plan sponsor or the employer make \n                such contributions in an amount equal to a uniform \n                percentage of compensation provided under the plan \n                until the participant specifically elects not to have \n                such contributions made (or specifically elects to have \n                such contributions made at a different percentage), and\n                    (C) under which the notice and election \n                requirements of paragraph (3), and the investment \n                requirements of paragraph (4), are satisfied.\n            (3) Notice requirements.--\n                    (A) In general.--The plan sponsor of, or plan \n                administrator or employer maintaining, an automatic \n                contribution arrangement shall, within a reasonable \n                period before the first day of each plan year, provide \n                to each participant to whom the arrangement applies for \n                such plan year notice of the participant's rights and \n                obligations under the arrangement which--\n                            (i) is sufficiently accurate and \n                        comprehensive to apprise the participant of \n                        such rights and obligations, and\n                            (ii) is written in a manner calculated to \n                        be understood by the average participant to \n                        whom the arrangement applies.\n                    (B) Election requirements.--A notice shall not be \n                treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraph (A) \n                with respect to a participant unless--\n                            (i) the notice includes an explanation of \n                        the participant's right under the arrangement \n                        not to have elective contributions made on the \n                        participant's behalf (or to elect to have such \n                        contributions made at a different percentage),\n                            (ii) the participant has a reasonable \n                        period of time, after receipt of the \n                        explanation described in clause (i) and before \n                        the first elective contribution is made, to \n                        make such election, and\n                            (iii) the notice explains how contributions \n                        made under the arrangement will be invested in \n                        the absence of any investment election by the \n                        participant.\n            (4) Default investment.--If no affirmative investment \n        election has been made with respect to any automatic \n        contribution arrangement, contributions to such arrangement \n        shall be invested in a default investment selected with the \n        care, skill, prudence, and diligence that a prudent person \n        selecting an investment option would use.\n            (5) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect on \n        the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (d) Allow Certain Plan Transfers and Mergers.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 414 of the
