The fee shall be \n        calculated to provide for recovery of costs incurred by the \n        United States associated with processing, issuing, and \n        monitoring the permit.\n            (2) Annual fee.--The Secretary shall charge an annual fee \n        related to each permit which requires payment, in advance, of \n        the fair market rental value of permitted use as determined by \n        the Secretary.\n    (d) Term.--\n            (1) Initial term.--The Secretary shall determine the \n        initial fixed term for a permit issued under this section, \n        taking into consideration the following:\n                    (A) The cost of planning, approval, construction, \n                operation, and maintenance of the pipeline and its \n                related facility (in terms of time and money).\n                    (B) The useful life of the pipeline and its related \n                facility.\n                    (C) The public or economic purpose served by the \n                pipeline and its related facility.\n            (2) Renewals.--The Secretary shall renew any right-of-way \n        issued under this section, in accordance with the provisions of \n        this section, if the pipeline and its related facility is in \n        commercial operation and operated and maintained in accordance \n        with this section and the permit issued under this section for \n        that pipeline and its related facility.\n    (e) Enforcement.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary may impose citations or \n        fines or suspend or revoke any authority under a permit issued \n        under this section for failure to comply with or for violation \n        of any term or condition of the permit.\n            (2) Suspension or termination of the right-of-way.--\n        Abandonment of a permit or deliberate noncompliance with any \n        provision of this section or of a permit issued under this \n        section may be grounds for suspension or termination of the \n        permit if the Secretary determines that such grounds exist and \n        that suspension or termination is justified after the permittee \n        has been given--\n                    (A) due notice;\n                    (B) a reasonable opportunity to remedy the \n                abandonment or noncompliance; and\n                    (C) an appropriate administrative proceeding \n                pursuant to section 554 of title 5, United States Code.\n            (3) Misuse or nonuse of permit.--Deliberate failure to use \n        a permit for the purpose for which it was granted or renewed \n        for any continuous two-year period shall constitute a \n        rebuttable presumption of abandonment of the permit. Where the \n        failure to use the permit is due to circumstances not within \n        the permittee's control, the Secretary is not required to \n        commence proceedings to suspend or terminate the permit.\n            (4) Judicial review.--Not later than 90 days after a final \n        decision by the Secretary under this subsection, a permittee \n        may file a suit to challenge that decision in the United States \n        court of appeals for the circuit in which the Federal land \n        which is the subject of the permit is located. Such court shall \n        have jurisdiction to hear and determine any suit brought as \n        provided in this subsection.\n    (f) Modifications.--The Secretary may modify a permit issued under \nthis section if the modification is agreed upon by the permittee and \ncomplies with this section.
