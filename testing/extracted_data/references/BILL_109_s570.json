FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Every year 2,500,000 people die in the United States. \n        Eighty percent of those people die in institutions such as \n        hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities. Chronic \n        illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, account for 2 out \n        of every 3 deaths.\n            (2) In January 2004, a study published in the Journal of \n        the American Medical Association concluded that many people \n        dying in institutions have unmet medical, psychological, and \n        spiritual needs. Moreover, family members of decedents who \n        received care at home with hospice services were more likely to \n        report a favorable dying experience.\n            (3) In 1997, the Supreme Court of the United States, in its \n        decisions in Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, \n        reaffirmed the constitutional right of competent adults to \n        refuse unwanted medical treatment. In those cases, the Court \n        stressed the use of advance directives as a means of \n        safeguarding that right should those adults become incapable of \n        deciding for themselves.\n            (4) A study published in 2002 estimated that the overall \n        prevalence of advance directives is between 15 and 20 percent \n        of the general population, despite the passage of the Patient \n        Self-Determination Act in 1990, which requires that health care \n        providers tell patients about advance directives.\n            (5) Competent adults should complete advance care plans \n        stipulating their health care decisions in the event that they \n        become unable to speak for themselves. Through the execution of \n        advance directives, including living wills and durable powers \n        of attorney for health care according to the laws of the State \n        in which they reside, individuals can protect their right to \n        express their wishes and have them respected.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to improve access to \ninformation about individuals' health care options and legal rights for \ncare near the end of life, to promote advance care planning and \ndecisionmaking so that individuals' wishes are known should they become \nunable to speak for themselves, to engage health care providers in \ndisseminating information about and assisting in the preparation of \nadvance directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \nattorney for health care, and for other purposes.\n\nSEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF POLICIES RELATED TO THE USE AND PORTABILITY OF \n              ADVANCE DIRECTIVES.\n\n    (a) Medicare.--Section 1866(f) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395cc(f)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``and if \n                presented by the individual (or on behalf of the \n                individual), to include the content of such advance \n                directive in a prominent part of such record'' before \n                the semicolon at the end;\n                    (B) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``and'' after \n                the semicolon at the end;\n                    (C) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at \n                the end and inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (D) by inserting after subparagraph (E) the \n                following new subparagraph:\n            ``(F) to provide each individual with the opportunity to \n        discuss issues relating to the information provided to that \n        individual pursuant to subparagraph (A) with an appropriately \n        trained professional.'';\n            (2) in paragraph (3), by striking ``a written'' and \n        inserting ``an''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(5)(A) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), a \nprovider of services, Medicare Advantage organization, or prepaid or \neligible organization (as the case may be) shall give effect to an \nadvance directive executed outside the State in which such directive is \npresented, even one that does not appear to meet the formalities of \nexecution, form, or language required by the State in which it is \npresented to the same extent as such provider or organization would \ngive effect to an advance directive that meets such requirements, \nexcept that a provider or organization may decline to honor such a \ndirective if the provider or organization can reasonably demonstrate \nthat it is not an authentic expression of the individual's wishes \nconcerning his or her health care. Nothing in this paragraph shall be \nconstrued to authorize the administration of medical treatment \notherwise prohibited by the laws of the State in which the directive is \npresented.\n    ``(B) The provisions of this paragraph shall preempt any State law \nto the extent such law is inconsistent with such provisions. The \nprovisions of this paragraph shall not preempt any State law that \nprovides for greater portability, more deference to a patient's wishes, \nor more latitude in determining a patient's wishes.''.\n    (b) Medicaid.--Section 1902(w) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(w)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (B)--\n                            (i) by striking ``in the individual's \n                        medical record'' and inserting ``in a prominent \n                        part of the individual's current medical \n                        record''; and\n                            (ii) by inserting ``and if presented by the \n                        individual (or on behalf of the individual), to \n                        include the content of such advance directive \n                        in a prominent part of such record'' before the \n                        semicolon at the end;\n                    (B) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``and'' after \n                the semicolon at the end;\n                    (C) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at \n                the end and inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (D) by inserting after subparagraph (E) the \n                following new subparagraph:\n            ``(F) to provide each individual with the opportunity to \n        discuss issues relating to the information provided to that \n        individual pursuant to subparagraph (A) with an appropriately \n        trained professional.'';\n            (2) in paragraph (4), by striking ``a written'' and \n        inserting ``an''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following paragraph:\n    ``(6)(A) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), a \nprovider or organization (as the case may be) shall give effect to an \nadvance directive executed outside the State in which such directive is \npresented, even one that does not appear to meet the formalities of \nexecution, form, or language required by the State in which it is \npresented to the same extent as such provider or organization would \ngive effect to an advance directive that meets such requirements, \nexcept that a provider or organization may decline to honor such a \ndirective if the provider or organization can reasonably demonstrate \nthat it is not an authentic expression of the individual's wishes \nconcerning his or her health care.
