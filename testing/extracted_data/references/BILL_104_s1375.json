FINDINGS, POLICY, AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the future prosperity of United States agriculture \n        increasingly will be determined by access to foreign markets \n        and, as agricultural producers of the United States move into \n        the world market, the producers are becoming more dependent on \n        agricultural exports;\n            (2) despite gains made in the recently concluded Uruguay \n        Round of trade negotiations as well as pre-existing rules under \n        the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, world agricultural \n        trade is neither free nor fair and United States agriculture \n        will continue to face unfair trade practices in the \n        international marketplace;\n            (3) 11 of the major agricultural trade competitors of the \n        United States spend a total of $500,000,000 annually on foreign \n        market development programs for the benefit of their producers;\n            (4) the foreign market development cooperator program of \n        the Foreign Agricultural Service and the activities of \n        individual foreign market cooperator organizations--\n                    (A) have been among the most successful and cost-\n                effective means of expanding United States agricultural \n                exports; and\n                    (B) provide ongoing, long-term market development \n                services to advance the economic interests of the \n                United States;\n            (5) the program and the activities of the cooperator \n        organizations should be supported;\n            (6) the Secretary of Agriculture and the private sector \n        should work together to ensure that the program, and the \n        activities of the cooperator organizations, are expanded in the \n        future; and\n            (7) as agricultural producers move into the world market, \n        it is timely and appropriate to take steps to preserve and \n        strengthen the foreign market development cooperator program of \n        the Department of Agriculture and the activities of the \n        cooperator organizations.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that it is \nessential and in the public interest to preserve and strengthen the \nforeign market development cooperator program of the Department of \nAgriculture under which eligible trade organizations funded primarily \nby agricultural producers cooperate with the Department in an \neffective, continuous, and coordinated effort to maintain and develop \nforeign markets for United States agricultural commodities and \nproducts.\n    (c) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide specific \nauthorization for the foreign market development cooperator program of \nthe Department of Agriculture, and establish terms governing the \nprogram, to ensure the continued effective and efficient operation of \nthe program.\n\nSEC. 3.
