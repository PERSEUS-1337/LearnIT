COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF DEVELOPMENT OF DIRECTED ENERGY \n              TECHNOLOGIES, SYSTEMS, AND WEAPONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Directed energy systems are available to address many \n        current challenges with respect to military weapons, including \n        offensive weapons and defensive weapons.\n            (2) Directed energy weapons offer the potential to maintain \n        an asymmetrical technological edge over adversaries of the \n        United States for the foreseeable future.\n            (3) It is in the national interest that funding for \n        directed energy science and technology programs be increased in \n        order to support priority acquisition programs and to develop \n        new technologies for future applications.\n            (4) It is in the national interest that the level of \n        funding for directed energy science and technology programs \n        correspond to the level of funding for such large-scale \n        demonstration programs in order to ensure the growth of \n        directed energy science and technology programs and to ensure \n        the successful development of other weapons systems utilizing \n        directed energy systems.\n            (5) The industrial base for several critical directed \n        energy technologies is in fragile condition and lacks \n        appropriate incentives to make the large-scale investments that \n        are necessary to address current and anticipated Department of \n        Defense requirements for such technologies.\n            (6) It is in the national interest that the Department of \n        Defense utilize and expand upon directed energy research \n        currently being conducted by the Department of Energy, other \n        Federal agencies, the private sector, and academia.\n            (7) It is increasingly difficult for the Federal Government \n        to recruit and retain personnel with skills critical to \n        directed energy technology development.\n            (8) The implementation of the recommendations contained in \n        the High Energy Laser Master Plan of the Department of Defense \n        will address these critical issues and is in the national \n        interest.\n            (9) Implementation of the management structure outlined in \n        the Master Plan will facilitate the development of \n        revolutionary capabilities in directed energy weapons by \n        achieving a coordinated and focused investment strategy under a \n        new management structure featuring a joint technology office \n        with senior-level oversight provided by a technology council \n        and a board of directors.\n    (b) Coordination and Oversight Under High Energy Laser Master \nPlan.--(1) Subchapter II of Chapter 8 of title 10, United States Code, \nis amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 204.
