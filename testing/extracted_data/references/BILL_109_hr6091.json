EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION OF ALIEN SMUGGLERS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Recent experience shows that alien smuggling is \n        flourishing, is increasingly violent, and is highly profitable.\n            (2) Alien smuggling operations also present terrorist and \n        criminal organizations with opportunities for smuggling their \n        members into the United States practically at will.\n            (3) Alien smuggling is a lucrative business. Each year, \n        criminal organizations that smuggle or traffic in persons are \n        estimated to generate $9,500,000,000 in revenue worldwide.\n            (4) Alien smuggling frequently involves dangerous and \n        inhumane conditions for smuggled aliens. Migrants are \n        frequently abused or exploited, both during their journey and \n        upon reaching the United States. Consequently, aliens smuggled \n        into the United States are at significant risk of physical \n        injury, abuse, and death.\n            (5) Notwithstanding that alien smuggling poses a risk to \n        the United States as a whole, uniform guidelines for the \n        prosecution of smuggling offenses are not employed by the \n        various United States attorneys. Understanding that border-area \n        United States attorneys face an overwhelming workload, a lack \n        of sufficient prosecutions by certain United States attorneys \n        has encouraged additional smuggling, and demoralized Border \n        Patrol officers charged with enforcing our anti-smuggling laws.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nAttorney General should adopt, not later than 3 months after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, uniform guidelines for the prosecution of \nsmuggling offenses to be followed by each United States attorney in the \nUnited States.\n    (c) Additional Personnel.--In each of the fiscal years 2008 through \n2013, the Attorney General shall, subject to the availability of \nappropriations, increase by not less than 20 the number of attorneys in \nthe offices of United States attorneys employed to prosecute cases \nunder section 274 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1324), as compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n                  TITLE II--CRIMINAL ALIEN REMOVAL ACT\n\nSEC. 201. EXPEDITED REMOVAL FOR ALIENS INADMISSIBLE ON CRIMINAL \n              GROUNDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 238(b) of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct (8 U.S.C. 1228(b)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)--\n                    (A) by striking ``Attorney General'' and inserting \n                ``Secretary of Homeland Security in the exercise of \n                discretion''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``set forth in this subsection or'' \n                and inserting ``set forth in this subsection, in lieu \n                of removal proceedings under'';\n            (2) in paragraph (3), by striking ``paragraph (1) until 14 \n        calendar days'' and inserting ``paragraph (1) or (3) until 7 \n        calendar days'';\n            (3) by striking ``Attorney General'' each place it appears \n        in paragraphs (3) and (4) and inserting ``Secretary of Homeland \n        Security'';\n            (4) in paragraph (5)--\n                    (A) by striking ``described in this section'' and \n                inserting ``described in paragraph (1) or (2)''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``the Attorney General may grant in \n                the Attorney General's discretion'' and inserting ``the \n                Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General \n                may grant, in the discretion of the Secretary or \n                Attorney General, in any proceeding'';\n            (5) by redesignating paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) as \n        paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), respectively; and\n            (6) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(3) The Secretary of Homeland Security in the exercise of \n        discretion may determine inadmissibility under section \n        212(a)(2) (relating to criminal offenses) and issue an order of \n        removal pursuant to the procedures set forth in this \n        subsection, in lieu of removal proceedings under section 240, \n        with respect to an alien who--\n                    ``(A) has not been admitted or paroled;\n                    ``(B) has not been found to have a credible fear of \n                persecution pursuant to the procedures set forth in \n                section 235(b)(1)(B); and\n                    ``(C) is not eligible for a waiver of \n                inadmissibility or relief from removal.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall \ntake effect on the date of the enactment of this Act but shall not \napply to aliens who are in removal proceedings under section 240 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act as of such date.\n\n            TITLE III--BORDER TUNNEL PREVENTION ACT OF 2006\n\nSEC. 301. CONSTRUCTION OF BORDER TUNNEL OR PASSAGE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 27 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 554. Border tunnels and passages\n    ``(a) Any person who knowingly constructs or finances the \nconstruction of a tunnel or subterranean passage that crosses the \ninternational border between the United States and another country, \nother than a lawfully authorized tunnel or passage known to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security and subject to inspection by the Bureau \nof Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall be imprisoned for not \nmore than 20 years.\n    ``(b) Any person who recklessly permits the construction or use of \na tunnel or passage described in subsection (a) on land that the person \nowns or controls shall be imprisoned for not more than 10 years.\n    ``(c) Any person who uses a tunnel or passage described in \nsubsection (a) to unlawfully smuggle an alien, goods (in violation of \nsection 545), controlled substances, weapons of mass destruction \n(including biological weapons), or a member of a terrorist organization \n(as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B)(vi) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi))) shall be subject to twice \nthe penalty that would have otherwise been imposed had the unlawful \nactivity not made use of such a tunnel or passage.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 27 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n\n``Sec. 554.
