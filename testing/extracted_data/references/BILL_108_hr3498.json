FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The battlefields of the American Revolutionary War and \n        the War of 1812 provide a unique means for the people of the \n        United States to relate to these epic struggles in the history \n        of the United States and to understand their importance in the \n        establishment and early development of the United States.\n            (2) Urbanization, suburban sprawl, and unplanned commercial \n        and residential development are constantly encroaching on many \n        of the nationally significant battlefields of the American \n        Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, as well as on associated \n        sites, and this encroachment poses a severe and growing risk to \n        the preservation of such battlefields and related sites.\n            (3) According to the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 \n        Historical Preservation Study, prepared by the National Park \n        Service, and dated September 2003, of the 825 principal \n        nationally significant battlefields and associated sites of the \n        American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812--\n                    (A) thirteen percent are lost;\n                    (B) thirty percent are fragmented or in poor \n                condition; or\n                    (C) twenty-seven percent may be destroyed or \n                impaired within the next ten years, and nine percent of \n                this percentage figure are in imminent danger of damage \n                occurring within the next three years.\n\nSEC. 3.
