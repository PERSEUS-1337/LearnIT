FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Private sector funding and expertise can help address \n        the energy efficiency challenges facing the United States.\n            (2) The Federal Government spends more than $6 billion \n        annually in energy costs.\n            (3) Reducing Federal energy costs can help save money, \n        create jobs, and reduce waste.\n            (4) Energy savings performance contracts and utility energy \n        service contracts are tools for utilizing private sector \n        investment to upgrade Federal facilities without any up-front \n        cost to the taxpayer.\n            (5) Performance contracting is a way to retrofit Federal \n        buildings using private sector investment in the absence of \n        appropriated dollars.\n            (6) Retrofits that reduce energy use also improve \n        infrastructure, protect national security, and cut facility \n        operations and maintenance costs.\n\nSEC. 3. USE OF ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY MEASURES IN FEDERAL \n              BUILDINGS.\n\n    (a) Energy Management Requirements.--Section 543(f)(4) of the \nNational Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8253(f)(4)) is \namended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n        (i) and (ii), respectively and by moving the margins 2 ems to \n        the right;\n            (2) by striking ``Not later than'' and inserting the \n        following:\n                    ``(A) In general.--Not later than'';
