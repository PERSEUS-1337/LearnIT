FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The growth of electronic commerce and electronic \n        government transactions represent a powerful force for economic \n        growth, consumer choice, improved civic participation and \n        wealth creation.\n            (2) The promotion of growth in private sector electronic \n        commerce through Federal legislation is in the national \n        interest because that market is globally important to the \n        United States.\n            (3) A consistent legal foundation, across multiple \n        jurisdictions, for electronic commerce will promote the growth \n        of such transactions, and that such a foundation should be \n        based upon a simple, technology neutral, nonregulatory, and \n        market-based approach.\n            (4) The nation and the world stand at the beginning of a \n        large scale transition to an information society which will \n        require innovative legal and policy approaches, and therefore, \n        States can serve the national interest by continuing their \n        proven role as laboratories of innovation for quickly evolving \n        areas of public policy, provided that States also adopt a \n        consistent, reasonable national baseline to eliminate obsolete \n        barriers to electronic commerce such as undue paper and pen \n        requirements, and further, that any such innovation should not \n        unduly burden interjurisdictional commerce.\n            (5) To the extent State laws or regulations do not \n        currently provide a consistent, reasonable national baseline or \n        in fact create an undue burden to interstate commerce in the \n        important burgeoning area of electronic commerce, the national \n        interest is best served by Federal preemption to the extent \n        necessary to provide such consistent national baseline and \n        eliminate said burden, but that absent such lack of a \n        consistent, reasonable national baseline or such undue burdens, \n        the best legal system for electronic commerce will result from \n        continuing experimentation by individual jurisdictions.\n            (6) With due regard to the fundamental need for a \n        consistent national baseline, each jurisdiction that enacts \n        such laws should have the right to determine the need for any \n        exceptions to protect consumers and maintain consistency with \n        existing related bodies of law within a particular \n        jurisdiction.\n            (7) Industry has developed several electronic signature \n        technologies for use in electronic transactions, and the public \n        policies of the United States should serve to promote a dynamic \n        marketplace within which these technologies can compete. \n        Consistent with this Act, States should permit the use and \n        development of any authentication technologies that are \n        appropriate as practicable as between private parties and in \n        use with State agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to permit and encourage the continued expansion of \n        electronic commerce through the operation of free market forces \n        rather than proscriptive governmental mandates and regulations;\n            (2) to promote public confidence in the validity, integrity \n        and reliability of electronic commerce and online government \n        under Federal law;\n            (3) to facilitate and promote electronic commerce by \n        clarifying the legal status of electronic records and \n        electronic signatures in the context of writing and signing \n        requirements imposed by law;\n            (4) to facilitate the ability of private parties engaged in \n        interstate transactions to agree among themselves on the terms \n        and conditions on which they use and accept electronic \n        signatures and electronic records; and\n            (5) to promote the development of a consistent national \n        legal infrastructure necessary to support of electronic \n        commerce at the Federal and State levels within existing areas \n        of jurisdiction.\n\nSEC. 4.

INTERSTATE CONTRACT CERTAINTY.\n\n    (a) Interstate Commercial Contracts.--A contract relating to an \ninterstate transaction shall not be denied legal effect solely because \nan electronic signature or electronic record was used in its formation.\n    (b) Methods.--Notwithstanding any rule of law that specifies one or \nmore acceptable or required technologies or business models, including \nlegal or other procedures, necessary to create, use, receive, validate, \nor invalidate electronic signatures or electronic records, the parties \nto an interstate transaction may establish by contract, electronically \nor otherwise, such technologies or business models, including legal or \nother procedures, to create, use, receive, validate, or invalidate \nelectronic signatures and electronic records.\n    (c) Not Preempt State Law.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to preempt the law of a State that enacts legislation \ngoverning electronic transactions that is consistent with subsections \n(a) and (b). A State that enacts, or has in effect, uniform electronic \ntransactions legislation substantially as reported to State \nlegislatures by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \nState Law shall be deemed to have satisfied this criterion, provided \nsuch legislation as enacted is not inconsistent with subsections (a) \nand (b).\n    (d) Intent.--The intent of a person to execute or adopt an \nelectronic signature shall be determined from the context and \nsurrounding circumstances, which may include accepted commercial \npractices.\n\nSEC. 7. STUDY OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY BARRIERS TO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE.\n\n    (a) Barriers.--Each Federal agency shall, not later than 6 months \nafter the date of enactment of this Act, provide a report to the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of \nCommerce identifying any provision of law administered by such agency, \nor any regulations issued by such agency and in effect on the date of \nenactment of this Act, that may impose a barrier to electronic \ntransactions, or otherwise to the conduct of commerce online or be \nelectronic means. Such barriers include, but are not limited to, \nbarriers imposed by a law or regulation directly or indirectly \nrequiring that signatures, or records of transactions, be accomplished \nor retained in other than electronic form. In its report, each agency \nshall identify the barriers among those identified whose removal would \nrequire legislative action, and shall indicate agency plans to \nundertake regulatory action to remove such barriers among those \nidentified as are caused by regulations issued by the agency.\n    (b) Report to Congress.--The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation \nwith the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, within \n18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, and after the \nconsultation required by subsection (c) of this section, report to the \nCongress concerning--\n            (1) legislation needed to remove any existing barriers to \n        electronic transactions or otherwise to the conduct of commerce \n        online or by electronic means; and\n            (2) actions being taken by the Executive Branch and \n        individual Federal agencies to remove such barriers as are \n        caused by agency regulations or policies.\n    (c) Consultation.--In preparing the report required by this \nsection, the Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the General \nServices Administration, the National Archives and Records \nAdministration, and the Attorney General concerning matters involving \nthe authenticity of records, their storage and retention, and their \nusability for law enforcement purposes.\n    (d) Include Findings If No Recommendations.--If the report required \nby this section omits recommendations for actions needed to fully \nremove identified barriers to electronic transactions or to online or \nelectronic commerce, it shall include a finding or findings, including \nsubstantial reasons therefor, that such removal is impracticable or \nwould be inconsistent with the implementation or enforcement of \napplicable laws."
