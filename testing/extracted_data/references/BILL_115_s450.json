and\n            (20) the people of the United States are forever indebted \n        to these men and women for--\n                    (A) the courage they demonstrated during the first \n                4 months of World War II in fighting against enemy \n                soldiers; and\n                    (B) the perseverance they demonstrated during \n                subsequent years of capture and imprisonment under \n                brutal conditions, while maintaining their dignity, \n                honor, patriotism, and loyalty.\n\nSEC. 3.
