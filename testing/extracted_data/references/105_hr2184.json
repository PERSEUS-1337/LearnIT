    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Private Security Officer Quality \nAssurance Act of 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) employment of private security officers in the United \n        States is growing rapidly;\n            (2) private security officers function as an adjunct to \n        public law enforcement by helping to reduce and prevent crime;\n            (3) the private security industry provides numerous \n        opportunities for entry-level job applicants, including \n        individuals suffering from unemployment due to economic \n        conditions or dislocations;\n            (4) such private security officers protect individuals, \n        tangible and intangible property and proprietary information \n        and provide protection to such diverse operations as banks, \n        hospitals, chemical companies, oil and gas refineries, \n        airports, communication facilities and operations, office \n        complexes, schools, residential properties, apartment \n        complexes, gated communities and many others;\n            (5) sworn law enforcement officers provide significant \n        services to the citizens of the United States in its public \n        areas, and are only supplemented by private security officers \n        who provide prevention and reporting services in support of, \n        but not in place of, regular sworn police;\n            (6) given the growth of large private shopping malls, and \n        the consequent reduction in the number of public shopping \n        streets, the American public is more likely to have contact \n        with private security personnel in the course of a day than \n        with sworn law enforcement officers;\n            (7) the trend in the Nation toward growth in such security \n        services has accelerated rapidly as the per capita number of \n        public sector law enforcement officers has decreased;\n            (8) such growth serves important public policy goals in \n        making available more public sector law enforcement officers to \n        combat serious and violent crimes;\n            (9) regardless of the differences in their duties, skill, \n        and responsibilities, the public has difficulty in discerning \n        the difference between sworn law enforcement officers and \n        private security personnel;\n            (10) the American public demands the employment of \n        qualified, well-trained private security personnel as an \n        adjunct, but not a replacement for sworn law enforcement \n        officers; and\n            (11) private security officers and applicants for private \n        security officer positions should be screened as thoroughly as \n        possible, particularly since many private security officers \n        bear weapons.\n\nSEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS.\n\n    (a) In General.--(1) At the request of an employer of private \nsecurity officers, an association of employers of private security \nofficers, designated for the purpose of this section by the Attorney \nGeneral, must submit to the Attorney General fingerprints or other \nmethods of positive identification of an employee of such employer for \npurposes of a background check.\n    (2) An employer may seek authorization from its employees to submit \ntheir fingerprints for purposes of a background check.\n    (3) Upon receipt of fingerprints from an association designated \nunder this section, the Attorney General shall search the records of \nthe Interstate Information Index of the National Crime Information \nCenter and the Identification Division of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, and shall provide any identification and criminal \nhistory records corresponding to the fingerprints to the requesting \nassociation within 30 business days.\n    (4) The Attorney General shall, to the maximum extent possible, \nencourage the use of the best technology available in compiling \ncriminal history information and in responding to requests under this \nsection.\n    (5) An association designated under this section shall submit \nemployee fingerprints to the Attorney General for identification and \nappropriate processing within one business day of receiving them. Such \nan association shall also transfer a copy of the identification and \ncriminal history records that it receives from the Attorney General to \nthe requesting employer within one business day of receiving them.\n    (6) An association designated under this section shall provide a \ncopy to the appropriate licensing authorities or regulatory agencies in \nthe States of the requests it makes on behalf of employers for \nidentification and criminal history records. The association shall also \nprovide a copy of the information it transfers to employers to such \nStates.\n    (b) Regulations.--The Attorney General may prescribe such \nregulations as may be necessary to carry out this section, including \nmeasures relating to the security, confidentiality, accuracy, use, and \ndissemination of information and audits and recordkeeping and the \nimposition of fees necessary for the recovery of costs.\n    (c) Report.--The Attorney General shall report to the Senate and \nHouse Committees on the Judiciary 2 years after the date of enactment \nof this bill on the number of inquiries made by the association of \nemployers under this section and their disposition.\n\nSEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n    Subsection (d) of section 534 of title 28, United States Code, is \namended by adding the following paragraph:\n            ``(3) an association of employers of private security \n        officers designated by the Attorney General for purposes of \n        conducting background checks on employees or prospective \n        employees.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
