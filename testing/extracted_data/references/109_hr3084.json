In establishing such \n                criteria, the Secretary shall consider the policies and \n                practices of the World Anti-Doping Agency regarding \n                reduced penalties for exceptional circumstances. Such \n                criteria shall not require a professional sports \n                association to adopt a policy providing for reductions \n                in penalties for any circumstances.\n            (6) Appeals process.--\n                    (A) Hearing and final adjudication.--An athlete who \n                tests positive and is subject to penalty under \n                paragraph (5) shall be afforded an opportunity for a \n                prompt hearing and a right to appeal.

The association shall hold a hearing \n                before an arbiter established under subparagraph (B) \n                and such arbiter shall reach a final adjudication not \n                later than 45 days after receiving notice of the \n                appeal. The penalties specified in paragraph (5) shall \n                be stayed pending an appeal and final adjudication.\n                    (B) Arbiter.--The arbiter of the appeals process \n                described in subparagraph (A) shall be agreed upon \n                mutually by the professional sports association and the \n                athletes who participate in the activities of such \n                professional sports association (or the representatives \n                of such athletes), and shall be approved by the \n                Secretary, and such approval shall not be unreasonably \n                withheld.\n    (b) Consultation.--In prescribing regulations under this section, \nthe Secretary may consult with anti-doping authorities, medical \nexperts, and professional sports associations.\n\nSEC. 4.
