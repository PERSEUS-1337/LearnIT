The department shall work with stakeholders to incorporate public comment into the waiver or demonstration project application.\n14197.3.\nThe department shall develop a plan for the collection and expenditure of CCIQIF moneys according to all of the following guidelines:\n(a) The CCIQIF program may be financed through voluntary contributions from Medi-Cal managed care plans that shall be used to draw down federal financial participation consistent with federal law.\n(b) The department shall allocate 33.3 percent of CCIQIF expenditures\nfor provider support payments\nfor use by the department for administrative staff, training, and other resources\nto support providers in employing strategies to improve immunization rates in their practices, which may include patient reminders, promotion of colocation vaccination delivery with other services, and other strategies as specified by the department after consideration of public comment.\nThe funds shall also be used to pay for the department\u2019s staffing and administrative costs directly attributable to implementing this article, including costs related to developing and seeking federal approval for the CCIQIF and administering the fund.\n(c) (1) The department shall allocate 66.7 percent of CCIQIF expenditures for reward payments to Medi-Cal managed care plans. The rate of the reward shall be\n$125\none hundred twenty-five dollars ($125)\nfor each enrollee who receives all recommended vaccinations by the time he or she reaches two years of age, as determined by the Childhood Immunization Status measure of the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS).\n(2) Any unearned reward payment expenditures shall roll over to the subsequent demonstration project year. If all reward payment expenditures are earned within a demonstration project year, no additional reward payments shall be distributed until the next demonstration project year begins.\n(d) At least 20 percent of the CCIQIF expenditures used for reward payments pursuant to subdivision (c) shall be passed through to contracted providers based on the number of Medi-Cal enrollees who are under two years of age in each provider\u2019s respective panel.\n14197.4.\n(a) The department shall contract with the University of California or any other researchers to develop and submit, in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code, to the Legislature an evaluation of the effectiveness of the demonstration project using data collected from the first three years of the waiver period or demonstration project. That evaluation shall be submitted within the fourth year of the waiver period or demonstration project.\n(b) The evaluation shall, at a minimum, include an assessment of the most effective administrative support strategies.\n(c) The evaluation shall be financed with no more than five percent of the total annual CCIQIF program expenditure dollars. During the waiver or demonstration project year that the evaluation is commissioned, CCIQIF provider support expenditures shall be reduced, commensurate with available funds, to offset the cost of the evaluation contract.\n14197.5.\nThis\nchapter\narticle\nshall be implemented only if and to the extent that federal financial participation is available and any necessary federal approvals have been obtained.\n14197.6.\n(a) This\nchapter\narticle\nshall become inoperative on the date that the Director of Health Care Services executes a declaration, which shall be retained by the director, stating that the demonstration project has concluded, and shall, six months after the date the declaration is executed, be repealed.\n(b) In addition to the requirements specified in subdivision (a), the director shall post the declaration on the department\u2019s Internet Web site and the director shall send the declaration to the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature and to the Legislative Counsel."
