FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2005 there were over 3,000,000 reports of child \n        abuse and neglect, and only 60 percent of the children from the \n        substantiated reports received follow-up services and 20 \n        percent were placed in foster care as a result of an \n        investigation.\n            (2) Each year there are nearly 900,000 substantiated \n        reports of child abuse and neglect.\n            (3) Each year approximately 60 percent of such \n        substantiated reports are reports of neglect, 30 percent are \n        physical and sexual abuse reports, and more than 20 percent are \n        reports that involve other forms of abuse.\n            (4) Almost 500,000 children and youth were in foster care \n        at the end of the Federal fiscal year 2004 and nearly 800,000 \n        spent at least some time in foster care throughout the year.\n            (5) While 51,000 children are adopted from the foster care \n        system each year, more than 117,000 children are waiting to be \n        adopted.\n            (6) Each year approximately 22,000 youth leave the foster \n        care system not because they have found permanent placements, \n        but because they have reached the age at which foster care \n        ends.\n            (7) The child welfare system includes State and local \n        governments, tribal governments, child welfare agencies, child \n        welfare caseworkers, private agencies, social workers, the \n        courts, volunteer court appointed special advocates, mental \n        health and health care professionals, educators, and advocates.\n            (8) There is an over-representation of certain populations, \n        including Native Americans and African-Americans, in the child \n        welfare system.\n            (9) The number of children being raised by grandparents and \n        other relatives is increasing and exceeds more than 6,000,000 \n        children cared for in this way, and the Government recognizes \n        that kinship care is a permanency option through the enactment \n        of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.\n            (10) The State courts make key decisions in the lives of \n        children involved in the child welfare system, including \n        decisions of whether children have been victims of child abuse, \n        whether parental rights should be terminated, and whether \n        children should be reunified with their families, adopted, or \n        placed in other settings.\n            (11) The child welfare system will never fully address its \n        primary mission unless the courts are an integral and \n        functioning component of a statewide system of care and \n        protection.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the Congress that--\n            (1) the Government should work jointly with the States and \n        their residents to develop recommendations and plans for action \n        to meet the challenges and needs of children and families \n        involved with the child welfare system, consistent with this \n        Act;\n            (2) in developing such recommendations and plans, emphasis \n        should be directed toward the role of the Government, State and \n        local child welfare systems, State family courts systems, child \n        welfare advocates, guardians, and other key participants in \n        such child welfare systems, with a goal of enhancing and \n        protecting the lives and well-being of children and families \n        who are involved with such child welfare systems; and\n            (3) Federal, State, and local programs and policies should \n        be developed to reduce the number of children who are abused \n        and neglected, to reduce the number of children in foster care, \n        and to dramatically increase the number of children in \n        permanent placements through family reunification, kinship \n        placement, and adoption.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF THE CONFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Authority To Call the Conference.--The President shall call a \nWhite House Conference on Children and Youth in 2010 (in this Act \nreferred to as ``the Conference''), to be convened not later than 18 \nmonths after the selection of the Policy Committee established in \nsection 4, to encourage improvements in each State and local child \nwelfare system, and to develop recommendations for actions to implement \nthe policy set forth in section 2(b).\n    (b) Planning and Direction.--The Secretary shall plan, conduct, and \nconvene the Conference in cooperation with the heads of other \nappropriate Federal entities, including the heads of the Department of \nJustice, the Department of Education, and the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development.\n    (c) Purposes of the Conference.--The purposes of the Conference \nare--\n            (1) to identify the problems and challenges of child abuse \n        and neglect, and the needs of the children and families \n        affected by decisions made through the child welfare system;\n            (2) to strengthen the use of research-based best practices \n        that can prevent child abuse and neglect with a special focus \n        on younger children;\n            (3) to strengthen the use of research-based best practices \n        that can increase the placement permanency for children removed \n        from their homes, including practices involving family \n        reunification, kinship placement, and adoption;\n            (4) to promote the role of State family courts in each \n        State child welfare system;\n            (5) to develop recommendations that will reduce the number \n        of children who are in out-of-home care and who fail to leave \n        foster care before the age of majority, and to reduce the \n        overrepresentation of certain populations in the child welfare \n        system;\n            (6) to examine the role of the Government in building an \n        equal partnership in assisting and encouraging State, local, \n        and tribal coordination;\n            (7) to develop such specific and comprehensive \n        recommendations for State-level executive and legislative \n        action as may be appropriate for maintaining and improving the \n        well-being of children in such system; and\n            (8) to review the status of recommendations regarding child \n        welfare made by previous White House conferences.\n\nSEC. 4.
