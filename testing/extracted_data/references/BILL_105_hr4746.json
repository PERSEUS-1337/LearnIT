FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Santa Clara River, a tributary of the Virgin River, \n        flows through the reservation of the Shivwits Paiute Indian \n        Band.\n            (2) The Santa Clara River is subject to erratic flows and \n        in most years does not supply sufficient water to satisfy all \n        existing water rights. The annual flow of the Santa Clara River \n        is characterized by either low flows or extremely high flood \n        flows, with very few average water years.\n            (3) The Virgin River system is the subject of a Statutory \n        Adjudication of Water Rights pending in the Fifth Judicial \n        Court in and for Washington County, Utah (Civil No. 800507596).\n            (4) The United States has been joined as a party in the \n        Statutory Adjudication of Water Rights and has filed a water \n        users claim asserting a reserved water right claim on behalf of \n        the Shivwits.\n            (5) It is the official policy of the United States, in \n        fulfillment of its trust responsibility to Indian tribes, to \n        promote Indian self-determination and economic self-\n        sufficiency, and to settle the water rights claims of Indian \n        tribes to avoid lengthy and costly litigation.\n            (6) Any meaningful policy of Indian self-determination and \n        economic self-sufficiency requires the development of viable \n        Indian reservation economies.\n            (7) The quantification of water rights and the development \n        of water use and storage facilities is essential to the \n        development of viable Indian reservation economies, \n        particularly in arid western States.\n            (8) Recognizing that final resolution of pending Statutory \n        Adjudication litigation will take many years and entail great \n        expense to all parties, as well as prolong uncertainty as to \n        the availability of water supplies and impair the long-term \n        economic planning and development of all parties, the Shivwits, \n        the State of Utah and local water users have sought to settle \n        disputes over water and reduce the burdens of litigation.\n            (9) After more than 5 years of negotiation (which included \n        participation by representatives of the United States \n        Government), the Shivwits, the Washington County Water \n        Conservancy District, the State of Utah, the City of St. \n        George, the Towns of Ivins and Santa Clara and local water user \n        companies have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding \n        executed by the Shivwits Band on March 26, 1998, to resolve all \n        water rights claims between and among themselves, to quantify \n        the Shivwits' entitlement to water, and to provide for the \n        construction of water projects to facilitate the settlement of \n        all claims.\n            (10) Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding, the \n        Shivwits Band will receive a total of 4,000 acre-feet of water \n        from a combination of the Santa Clara drainage and the Virgin \n        River drainage which will be provided through the construction \n        of the Santa Clara Project and the St. George Water Reuse \n        Project (which are identified in the Memorandum of \n        Understanding).\n            (11) To advance the goals of Federal Indian policy and to \n        fulfill the trust responsibility of the United States to the \n        Shivwits Band, it is appropriate that the United States \n        participate in the implementation of the Settlement Agreement \n        and contribute funds for the construction of such project \n        facilities.\n\nSEC. 3.
