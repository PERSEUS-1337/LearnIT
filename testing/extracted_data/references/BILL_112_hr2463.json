REAUTHORIZATION OF HOMELAND SECURITY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY \n              ADVISORY COMMITTEE.\n\n    Section 311(j) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. \n191(j)) is amended by striking ``on December 31, 2008'' and inserting \n``on December 31, 2014''.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT ON BASIC RESEARCH NEEDS FOR BORDER/MARITIME SECURITY.\n\n    (a) Assessment.--The Comptroller General shall assess the basic \nscience research needs in the border and maritime security domain. The \nassessment shall include consideration of the need for research on--\n            (1) detection, tracking, and identification technologies \n        for cargo and people;\n            (2) personal protective equipment;\n            (3) document security and authentication technologies;\n            (4) nonradiological advanced screening technologies at \n        ports of entry; and\n            (5) technologies for real time tactical scene awareness.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Comptroller General shall transmit to the Committee on \nScience, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a \nreport on the assessment under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 6. INCORPORATING UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES INTO BORDER/MARITIME \n              AIRSPACE.\n\n    (a) Research and Development.--Using amounts made available under \nsection 307 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 187), the \nSecretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the Joint Planning \nand Development Office shall continue to research and develop \ntechnologies to permit routine operation of unmanned aerial vehicles, \nincluding autonomously piloted drones, within the national airspace for \nborder and maritime security missions without any degradation of \nexisting levels of safety for all national airspace system users.\n    (b) Pilot Projects.--The Secretary shall coordinate with the \nAdministrator of the Federal Aviation Administration acting through the \nDirector of the Joint Planning and Development Office to enter into \npilot projects in designated test ranges in sparsely populated, low-\ndensity air traffic airspace to conduct research, experiments, and data \ncollection in order to accelerate the safe integration of unmanned \naircraft systems into the national airspace system as part of research \nactivities of the Joint Planning and Development Office.\n\nSEC. 7. RESEARCH PROGRAM IN TUNNEL DETECTION.\n\n    (a) Research and Development.--Using amounts made available under \nsection 307 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 187), the \nUnder Secretary shall continue to research and develop technologies to \npermit detection of near surface voids, such as tunnels, with an \nemphasis on technologies with real time capability.\n    (b) Coordination.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall \ncoordinate with other appropriate Federal agencies, including the \nDepartment of Defense and the United States Geological Survey, and \nensure the integration of activities under subsection (a) with relevant \nefforts of such other agencies and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Centers of Excellence Program.\n\nSEC. 8. RESEARCH IN ANTICOUNTERFEIT TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n    (a) Research and Development.--Using amounts made available under \nsection 307 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 187), the \nUnder Secretary, in coordination with the Director of the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, shall continue a joint research \nand development program on anticounterfeit technologies and standards. \nThe program may include development of counterfeit-resistant \ndocumentation, counterfeit-resistant devices, document validation \ntechnologies, and document identification standards.\n    (b) Consultation.--In carrying out the program in subsection (a), \nthe Under Secretary or his designee shall consult with other Federal \nagencies engaged in similar activities, including Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, the Department of State, the Department of \nDefense, and the Department of Justice.\n    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 12 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Under Secretary and the Director of the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology shall provide to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Science, Space, and \nTechnology of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Government Affairs of the Senate, a report \ndetailing the actions taken by the Under Secretary and the Director \nunder this section.\n\nSEC. 9. STUDY OF MOBILE BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES AT THE BORDER.\n\n    (a) In General.--Using amounts made available under section 307 of \nthe Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 187), the Under Secretary, \nin coordination with the Commissioner of United States Customs and \nBorder Protection, shall continue research on the use of mobile \nbiometric technology at the Nation's borders between the ports of \nentry, including--\n            (1) conducting an analysis of existing mobile biometric \n        technologies and the extent to which they can be deployed in \n        Border Patrol agents' vehicles and used at the border, in terms \n        of operability, reliability, cost, and overall benefit to \n        border operations;\n            (2) undertaking an examination of the potential end-user \n        requirements of mobile biometric technology by the Border \n        Patrol and other relevant end-users;\n            (3) developing recommendations for addressing capability \n        gaps in mobile biometric technologies; and\n            (4) examining the feasibility of implementing a pilot \n        program for use of mobile biometric technologies at the border.\n    (b) Consultation.--In conducting the research program under \nsubsection (a), the Under Secretary shall consult the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, other appropriate Federal \nagencies, and appropriate Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nofficials.\n    (c) Coordination.--The Secretary shall ensure that the research \nprogram is coordinated with other biometric identification programs \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security.\n    (d) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Under Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report on \nthe findings of the research program conducted under this section."
