    "content": "The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA; P.L. 105-220 ) is the primary federal program that supports workforce development. WIA includes four main titles: Title I\u2014Workforce Investment Systems\u2014provides job training and related services to unemployed or underemployed individuals. Title I programs, which are primarily administered through the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), include three state formula grant programs, multiple national programs, Job Corps, and demonstration programs. In addition, Title I authorizes the establishment of a One-Stop delivery system through which state and local WIA training and employment activities are provided and through which certain partner programs must be coordinated; Title II\u2014Adult Education and Literacy\u2014provides education services to assist adults in improving their literacy and completing secondary education; Title III\u2014Workforce Investment-Related Activities\u2014amends the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 to integrate the U.S. Employment Service (ES) into the One-Stop system established by WIA; and Title IV\u2014Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998\u2014amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which provides employment-related services to individuals with disabilities. The authorizations for appropriations for most programs under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 ( P.L. 105-220 ) expired at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2003. Since that time, WIA programs have been funded through the annual appropriations process. In the 108 th and 109 th Congresses, bills to reauthorize WIA were passed in both the House and the Senate; however, no further action was taken. In the 112 th Congress, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) released discussion drafts in June 2011 of legislation to amend and reauthorize WIA. While markup of this legislation was scheduled, it was ultimately postponed indefinitely. No legislation has been introduced. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce, however, has ordered reported H.R. 4297 \u2014the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012. This bill was introduced on March 29, 2012, by Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the chair of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, (for herself, Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon of California, and Representative Joseph Heck of Nevada). A legislative hearing on H.R. 4297 was held before the full Committee on Education and the Workforce on April 17, 2012. On June 7, 2012, the committee, after considering 23 amendments to H.R. 4297 , ordered the bill reported by a vote of 23 to 15. This report summarizes each of the WIA titles and highlights the major features of H.R. 4297 pertaining to each title. The report also compares the proposed provisions of H.R. 4297 to current law in the following tables:  Table 1 . Major Provisions of Title I. This table covers provisions governing the \"workforce investment systems\" that provide for, among other things, state formula grants, state and local planning procedures, and the establishment of the One-Stop delivery system. WIA established the One-Stop delivery system as a way to co-locate and coordinate the activities of multiple employment programs for adults, youth, and various targeted subpopulations. The delivery of these services occurs primarily through more than 3,000 career centers nationwide.  Table 2 . Major Provisions of Title II. This table covers provisions for adult education and literacy activities.  Table 3 . Major Provisions of Title III. This table covers changes to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, which was also amended in Title III of WIA. Wagner-Peyser provides authorization for the Employment Service.  Table 4 . Major Provisions of Title IV of WIA and Title V of H.R. 4297 . This table addresses amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, in particular to the Vocational Rehabilitation and other employment-related provisions of that act, which authorizes various employment services for individuals with disabilities. Title I of the Workforce Investment Act\u2014Workforce Investment Systems\u2014authorizes the establishment of a One-Stop delivery system through which state and local WIA training and employment activities are provided and through which certain partner programs must be coordinated. Title I also authorizes funding for the three major state formula grant programs (Adult, Youth, and Dislocated Worker), Job Corps (a DOL-administered program for low-income youth), and several other national programs that are directed toward subpopulations with barriers to employment (e.g., Native Americans). H.R. 4297 takes a fundamentally different approach from current law to the federal role in the delivery of workforce development services by consolidating multiple programs into a single block grant that is allocated to states by formula. At the same time, H.R. 4297 maintains the One-Stop delivery system as the delivery mechanism for employment and training services. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) is the current law that authorizes funds supporting programs related to basic education (i.e., instruction at the secondary school level and below) for individuals who are beyond school age, not enrolled in school, and lacking a high school diploma or equivalent. The program also funds educational services for English learners. The largest portion of AEFLA funds are grants to states that are subsequently allotted to local entities that conduct educational programs. H.R. 4297 reauthorizes Title II programs through 2018. It limits the annual authorized appropriation level to FY2012 levels and changes several AEFLA provisions to emphasize the relationship between adult education and employment. AEFLA is also amended to align with the new WIA performance indicators. Title III of the Workforce Investment Act\u2014Workforce Investment-Related Activities\u2014makes amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 (29 U.S.C. 49 et seq. ), which authorizes the Employment Service (ES). The ES is the central component of most states' One-Stop delivery systems, as ES services are universally accessible to job seekers and employers and ES offices may not exist outside of the One-Stop delivery system. Although the ES is one of the required partners in the One-Stop delivery system, its central mission\u2014to facilitate the match between individuals seeking work and employers seeking workers\u2014makes it critical to the functioning of the workforce development system under WIA. Title III adds Section 15 (\"Employment Statistics\") to Wagner-Peyser, which requires the Secretary of Labor to develop, provide, and improve various types of labor market information. H.R. 4297 repeals Sections 1-14, which authorize the Employment Service. Funding from the ES is consolidated into the new Workforce Investment Fund. The Rehabilitation Act, as amended, authorizes grants to support programs related to employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities. Most programs under the Rehabilitation Act are administered by the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) of the Department of Education (ED). In FY2012, the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) grants to the states program accounted for the majority of the funds that were appropriated under the Rehabilitation Act. VR is a mandatory One-Stop partner program. Title V of H.R. 4297 reauthorizes the VR grants to the states program through FY2018 and limits authorization to the prior year's appropriation plus an increase equal to inflation. It also increases emphasis on students transitioning out of school by requiring state plans to address how they will serve this population and requiring that 10% of each state's federal allotments be set aside for services to transitioning students. H.R. 4297 also repeals several smaller programs that were authorized under the Rehabilitation Act."
