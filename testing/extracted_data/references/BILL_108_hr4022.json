FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One of the legacies of the horrific attacks of \n        September 11, 2001, is the greatly enhanced need for security \n        of the homeland. Meeting this need has imposed serious stresses \n        on government agencies at all levels and entities whose primary \n        task is protection of the Nation's key assets and the life, \n        health, and property of its populace.\n            (2) President Bush stated, in a February 2003 report titled \n        ``The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical \n        Infrastructures and Key Assets'' (in this section referred to \n        as the ``Report''), that there is an increased need to assess \n        the Nation's vulnerabilities and to provide additional security \n        for its key assets. Providing such security will require \n        increased cooperation between Government and the private \n        sector.\n            (3) The Report also recognized that terrorists, in the \n        pursuit of their long-term, strategic objectives, will likely \n        continue to attack critical infrastructures and key assets, the \n        vast majority of which are owned and operated by the private \n        sector.\n            (4) Because of enhanced security needs, the use of private \n        security companies in guarding the Nation's key assets and the \n        life, health, and property of its populace has increased \n        significantly since September 11, 2001, and will continue to do \n        so.\n            (5) Also because of the enhanced security needs, businesses \n        generally have increased their security efforts and the number \n        of internal employees dedicated to securing their facilities.\n            (6) As reliance on private security companies to guard the \n        Nation's key assets and to protect the life, health, and \n        property of its populace continues to grow, the hiring and \n        placement decisions of these companies--which employ more than \n        500,000 private security officers nationwide--have become \n        critical, as they determine which individuals will protect the \n        Nation and have access to its key assets. Similarly, businesses \n        providing their own internal security services have experienced \n        a heightened need to improve their internal security measures \n        and to obtain more information about the individuals who \n        provide their internal security. It has, therefore, become \n        imperative that companies employing or hiring security \n        personnel have access to and be permitted to use a criminal \n        background checking system that is efficient, inclusive, \n        nationwide in scope, dependable, and technologically advanced, \n        so as to minimize the occurrence of dangerous if not disastrous \n        placement and hiring decisions.\n            (7) Companies cannot properly and effectively evaluate \n        their prospective and current employees providing private \n        security services without access to the criminal history \n        records available through the National Crime Information Center \n        (in this section referred to as ``NCIC''). Access to the NCIC \n        for the purpose of reviewing the background of current and \n        prospective employees is currently enjoyed by the banking \n        industry, the nuclear power industry, public housing \n        authorities, and others and should be made available to private \n        security companies and to businesses providing their own \n        security so that they can safely and effectively partner with \n        Federal, State, and local governments in the effort to protect \n        the homeland.\n            (8) Given its critical role in the security of the \n        homeland, the Department of Homeland Security, working in \n        conjunction with the Department of Justice, is best suited to \n        act as the clearinghouse for obtaining and disseminating NCIC \n        criminal history records for the purposes set forth in this \n        section.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n            (1) Covered employee.--The term ``covered employee'' means \n        any individual, other than an active law enforcement officer \n        for any governmental unit, who is--\n                    (A) employed by, or seeking employment with, a \n                nongovernmental company that provides security guard \n                services; or\n                    (B) employed as an internal security employee by, \n                or seeking employment as an internal security employee \n                with, a nongovernmental company that has more than 50 \n                employees, of which 3 or more are internal security \n                employees.\n            (2) Covered employer.--The term ``covered employer'' \n        means--\n                    (A) any nongovernmental company that--\n                            (i) provides security guard services;\n                            (ii) for each jurisdiction in which it \n                        provides such services, is licensed by such \n                        jurisdiction to provide such services, to the \n                        extent such jurisdiction permits or requires it \n                        to be so licensed; and\n                            (iii) provides such services--\n                                    (I) in interstate or foreign \n                                commerce;\n                                    (II) at any site where there is \n                                located any element of the Federal \n                                Government; or\n                                    (III) for any person engaged in \n                                interstate or foreign commerce; or\n                    (B) any nongovernmental company that--\n                            (i) has more than 50 employees, of which 3 \n                        or more are internal security employees;\n                            (ii) for each jurisdiction in which it \n                        provides internal security services with \n                        respect to itself, is licensed by such \n                        jurisdiction to provide such services, to the \n                        extent such jurisdiction permits or requires it \n                        to be so licensed; and\n                            (iii) is either engaged in interstate or \n                        foreign commerce or provides any product or \n                        service to any element of the Federal \n                        Government.\n            (3) Internal security employee.--The term ``internal \n        security employee'' means an employee whose primary \n        responsibility is to provide internal security with respect to \n        the company employing such employee.\n            (4) NCIC.--The term ``NCIC'' means the National Crime \n        Information Center of the Department of Justice.\n            (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Homeland Security.\n            (6) State.--The term ``State'' includes the District of \n        Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other \n        territory or possession of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4.
