FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy \n        production--\n                    (A) increasing domestic investment and jobs; and\n                    (B) establishing the United States as a world \n                leader in crude oil production;\n            (2) the United States upholds a commitment to free trade \n        and open markets and has consistently opposed attempts by other \n        nations to restrict the free flow of energy;\n            (3) independent studies have concluded that allowing the \n        export of domestically produced crude oil--\n                    (A) will increase the globally available supply of \n                crude oil; and\n                    (B) will tend to reduce domestic prices for \n                gasoline and other refined petroleum products in the \n                United States;\n            (4) gasoline and other refined petroleum products are \n        already eligible for export from the United States without \n        restriction;\n            (5) gasoline prices in the United States reflect the price \n        paid on the global market for crude oil and not a separate \n        crude oil price in the United States;\n            (6) exports of crude oil produced in the United States \n        would provide an alternative stable supplier for crude oil to \n        allies of the United States around the world--\n                    (A) allowing United States crude oil exports to \n                compete on equal footing with other international \n                crudes;\n                    (B) allowing United States crude oil exports to \n                compete with and potentially displace crude oil exports \n                from Iran, as potential easing of sanctions could lead \n                to Iran regaining market share;\n                    (C) facilitating assistance to the countries of \n                Europe and Eurasia to diversify their energy sources \n                and achieve energy security by providing another option \n                to protect against possible unstable supply flows; and\n                    (D) allowing the United States to use national \n                energy policy to further United States interests \n                abroad; and\n            (7) the United States should remove all restrictions on the \n        export of domestically produced crude oil or crude oil of any \n        origin, which will increase economic benefits, enhance energy \n        security, improve the trade deficit, and promote key national \n        security interests of the United States domestically and around \n        the world.\n\nSEC. 3.
