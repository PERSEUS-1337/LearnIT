FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) federalism is rooted in the knowledge that political \n        liberties are best assured by limiting the size and scope of \n        the national government;\n            (2) the people of the States created the national \n        government when the people delegated those enumerated \n        governmental powers relating to matters beyond the competence \n        of the individual States;\n            (3) all other sovereign powers, except those expressly \n        prohibited the States by the United States Constitution, are \n        reserved to the States or to the people as the tenth amendment \n        to the United States Constitution requires;\n            (4) the constitutional relationship among sovereign \n        governments, State and national, is formalized in and protected \n        by the tenth amendment to the United States Constitution;\n            (5) the people of the States are free, subject only to \n        restrictions in the United States Constitution or in \n        constitutionally authorized Acts of Congress, to define the \n        moral, political, and legal character of their lives;\n            (6) in most areas of governmental concern, the States \n        uniquely possess the constitutional authority, resources, and \n        the competence to discern the sentiments of the people and to \n        govern accordingly;\n            (7) the nature of the constitutional system of the United \n        States encourages a healthy diversity in the public policies \n        adopted by the people of the several States according to their \n        conditions, needs, and desires;\n            (8) in the search for enlightened public policy, individual \n        States and communities are free to experiment with a variety of \n        approaches to public issues;\n            (9) acts of the national government, whether executive, \n        legislative, or judicial in nature, that exceed the enumerated \n        powers of that government under the United States Constitution \n        violate the principle of federalism established by the framers;\n            (10) policies of the national government should recognize \n        the responsibility of, and should encourage opportunities for, \n        individuals, families, neighborhoods, local governments, and \n        private associations to achieve their personal, social, and \n        economic objectives through cooperative effort;\n            (11) in the absence of clear constitutional or statutory \n        authority, the presumption of sovereignty should rest with the \n        individual States; and\n            (12) uncertainties regarding the legitimate authority of \n        the national government should be resolved against regulation \n        at the national level.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERALISM POLICYMAKING CRITERIA.\n\n    The executive departments and agencies shall consider, to the \nextent permitted by law, the following criteria to inform agency \ndiscretion when formulating and implementing policies that have \nfederalism implications:\n            (1) There should be strict adherence to constitutional \n        principles. Executive departments and agencies should closely \n        examine the constitutional and statutory authority supporting \n        any Federal action that would limit the policymaking discretion \n        of the States, and should carefully assess the necessity for \n        such action. To the extent practicable, the States should be \n        consulted before any such action is implemented.\n            (2) Federal action limiting the policymaking discretion of \n        the States should be taken only where constitutional authority \n        for the action is clear and certain, and the national activity \n        is necessitated by the presence of a problem of national scope.\n            (3) There should be recognition of the distinction between \n        problems of national scope (which may justify Federal action) \n        and problems that are merely common to the States (which will \n        not justify Federal action because individual States, acting \n        individually or together, can effectively manage such issues).\n            (4) Constitutional authority for Federal action is clear \n        and certain only when authority for the action may be found in \n        a specific provision of the Constitution, when there is no \n        provision in the Constitution prohibiting Federal action, and \n        when the action does not encroach upon authority reserved to \n        the States.\n            (5) With respect to national policies administered by the \n        States, the national government should grant the States the \n        maximum administrative discretion possible. Intrusive Federal \n        oversight of State administration is neither necessary nor \n        desirable.\n            (6) When undertaking to formulate and implement policies \n        that have federalism implications, executive departments and \n        agencies shall--\n                    (A) encourage States to develop policies to achieve \n                program objectives and to work with appropriate \n                officials in other States;\n                    (B) refrain, to the maximum extent possible, from \n                establishing uniform, national standards for programs \n                and, when possible, defer to the States to establish \n                standards; and\n                    (C) when national standards are required, consult \n                with appropriate officials and organizations \n                representing the States in developing those standards.\n\nSEC. 4. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PREEMPTION.\n\n    The executive departments and agencies shall consider, to the \nextent permitted by law, the following criteria to inform agency \ndiscretion when formulating and implementing policies that have \npreemption implications:\n            (1) Executive departments and agencies should construe, in \n        regulations and otherwise, a Federal statute to preempt a State \n        law only when the statute contains an express preemption \n        provision, when there is some other firm and palpable evidence \n        compelling the conclusion that Congress intended preemption of \n        State law, or when the exercise of State authority directly \n        conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority under the \n        Federal statute.\n            (2) If a Federal statute does not preempt State law under \n        paragraph (1), executive departments and agencies should \n        construe any authorization in the statute for the issuance of \n        regulations as authorizing preemptive regulations only when the \n        statute expressly authorizes issuance of preemptive regulations \n        or when there is some other firm and palpable evidence \n        compelling the conclusion that Congress intended to delegate to \n        the department or agency the authority to issue regulations \n        preempting State law.\n            (3) Any regulatory preemption of State law should be \n        restricted to the minimum level necessary to achieve the \n        objectives of the statute pursuant to which the regulations are \n        promulgated.\n            (4) When an executive department or agency foresees the \n        possibility of a conflict between State law and federally \n        protected interests within its area of regulatory \n        responsibility, the department or agency should consult, to the \n        extent practicable, with appropriate officials and \n        organizations representing the States in an effort to avoid \n        such a conflict.\n            (5) When an executive department or agency proposes to act \n        through adjudication or rulemaking to preempt State law, the \n        department or agency should provide all affected States notice \n        and an opportunity for appropriate participation in the \n        proceedings.\n\nSEC. 5. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that executive departments and agencies \nshould not submit to Congress legislation that would--\n            (1) directly regulate the States in ways that would \n        interfere with functions essential to the States' separate and \n        independent existence or operate to directly displace the \n        States' freedom to structure integral operations in areas of \n        traditional governmental functions;\n            (2) attach to Federal grants conditions that are not \n        directly related to the purpose of the grant; or\n            (3) preempt State law, unless preemption is consistent with \n        the fundamental federalism principles set forth in section 2, \n        and unless a clearly legitimate national purpose, consistent \n        with the federalism policymaking criteria set forth in section \n        3, cannot otherwise be met.\n\nSEC. 6. AGENCY IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The head of each executive department and agency \nshall designate an official to be responsible for ensuring the \nimplementation of this Act.\n    (b) Federalism Assessment.--In addition to whatever other actions \nthe designated official may take to ensure implementation of this Act, \nthe designated official shall determine which proposed policies have \nsufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a \nfederalism assessment. With respect to each such policy for which an \naffirmative determination is made, a federalism assessment, as \ndescribed in subsection (c) of this section, shall be prepared. The \ndepartment or agency head shall consider any such assessment in all \ndecisions involved in promulgating and implementing the policy.\n    (c) Contents.--Each federalism assessment shall accompany any \nsubmission concerning the policy that is made to the Office of \nManagement and Budget pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866, and \nshall--\n            (1) contain the designated official's certification that \n        the policy has been assessed in light of the principles, \n        criteria, and requirements stated in sections 2 through 5 of \n        this Act;\n            (2) identify any provision or element of the policy that is \n        inconsistent with the principles, criteria, and requirements \n        stated in sections 2 through 5 of this Act;\n            (3) identify the extent to which the policy imposes \n        additional costs or burdens on the States, including the likely \n        source of funding for the States and the ability of the States \n        to fulfill the purposes of the policy; and\n            (4) identify the extent to which the policy would affect \n        the States' ability to discharge traditional State governmental \n        functions, or other aspects of State sovereignty.\n\nSEC. 7. GOVERNMENT-WIDE FEDERALISM COORDINATION AND REVIEW.\n\n    (a) In General.--In implementing Executive Order No. 12866, the \nOffice of Management and Budget, to the extent permitted by law and \nconsistent with the provisions of such order, shall take action to \nensure that the policies of the executive departments and agencies are \nconsistent with the principles, criteria, and requirements stated in \nsections 2 through 5 of this Act.\n    (b) Federalism Concerns.--In submissions to the Office of \nManagement and Budget pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866, executive \ndepartments and agencies shall identify proposed regulatory and \nstatutory provisions that have significant federalism implications and \nshall address any substantial federalism concerns. Where the \ndepartments or agencies determines it appropriate, substantial \nfederalism concerns shall also be addressed in notices of proposed \nrulemaking and messages transmitting legislative proposals to Congress."
