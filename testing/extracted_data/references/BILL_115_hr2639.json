FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the American Journal of Public Health, at \n        least 10 percent of older Americans experience elder abuse.\n            (2) Victims of elder financial abuse are estimated to lose \n        at least $2.9 billion a year.\n            (3) Victims of elder abuse are three times more likely to \n        end up in a hospital and four times more likely to end up in a \n        nursing home than nonvictims.\n            (4) Adult protective services which operate in all 50 \n        States to help prevent elder abuse and investigate cases have \n        no dedicated Federal funding or any designated Federal agency \n        home.\n            (5) Underreporting of elder abuse cases, especially \n        financial abuse, remains a major issue combined with a dearth \n        of comprehensive and reliable data which collectively leads to \n        a vast underestimation of the real amount of elder abuse in the \n        Nation.\n            (6) Differences in State laws and practices in the areas of \n        abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older adults lead to \n        significant disparities in prevention, protective and social \n        services, treatment systems, and law enforcement, and lead to \n        other inequities.\n            (7) Starting with the 1974 enactment of the Child Abuse \n        Prevention and Treatment Act, the Federal Government has played \n        an important role in promoting research, training, public \n        safety, data collection, the identification, development, and \n        dissemination of promising health care, social, and protective \n        services, and law enforcement practices, relating to child \n        abuse and neglect, domestic violence, and violence against \n        women. The Federal Government should promote similar efforts \n        and protections relating to elder abuse, neglect, and \n        exploitation.\n            (8) The Federal Government should provide leadership to \n        assist States and communities in their efforts to prevent elder \n        abuse, including the promotion of coordinated planning between \n        all levels of government and nongovernment entities and \n        generating and sharing knowledge relevant to protecting elders.\n            (9) The problem of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation \n        requires a comprehensive approach that--\n                    (A) recognizes the statutory role of State and \n                local adult protective services and long-term care \n                ombudsman programs to respond to elder abuse;\n                    (B) integrates the work of health, legal, and \n                social service agencies and organizations;\n                    (C) emphasizes the need for prevention, detection, \n                reporting, investigation, assessment and treatment, and \n                prosecution of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation \n                at all levels of government;\n                    (D) ensures that sufficient numbers of properly \n                trained personnel with specialized knowledge are in \n                place to treat, assess, and provide services related to \n                elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and carry out \n                elder protection duties;\n                    (E) ensures there is cultural competency to address \n                the unique needs of a diverse older adult population \n                with respect to elder abuse; and\n                    (F) balances an elder's right to self-determination \n                with society's responsibility to protect elders.\n            (10) The future well-being of millions of older adults may \n        be challenged by elder abuse and a coordinated and \n        comprehensive Federal response is needed. Elder abuse \n        prevention is a sound investment that can produce savings to \n        the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the future.\n            (11) A victim of elder abuse is never the same after being \n        victimized.\n\nSEC. 3.
