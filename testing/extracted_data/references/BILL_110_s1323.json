FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the food and beverage industries are a significant part \n        of our national economy;\n            (2) the activities of manufacturers and sellers of foods \n        and beverages substantially affect interstate and foreign \n        commerce;\n            (3) a person's weight gain, obesity, or a health condition \n        associated with a person's weight gain or obesity is based on a \n        multitude of factors, including genetic factors and the \n        lifestyle and physical fitness decisions of individuals, such \n        that a person's weight gain, obesity, or a health condition \n        associated with a person's weight gain or obesity cannot be \n        attributed to the consumption of any specific food or beverage; \n        and\n            (4) because fostering a culture of acceptance of personal \n        responsibility is one of the most important ways to promote a \n        healthier society, lawsuits seeking to blame individual food \n        and beverage providers for a person's weight gain, obesity, or \n        a health condition associated with a person's weight gain or \n        obesity are not only legally frivolous and economically \n        damaging, but also harmful to a healthy America.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to allow Congress, State \nlegislatures, and regulatory agencies to determine appropriate laws, \nrules, and regulations to address the problems of weight gain, obesity, \nand health conditions associated with weight gain or obesity.\n\nSEC. 3.

A party aggrieved by \n        the failure of an opposing party to comply with this paragraph \n        shall have the applicable remedies made available by such \n        applicable rules, provided that no remedy shall be afforded \n        that conflicts with the terms of paragraph (1).\n            (3) Expedited consideration.--In any action in which a stay \n        is entered pursuant to paragraph (1), the court is encouraged \n        to expedite consideration of the motion to dismiss.\n    (d) Pleadings.--In any action that is allegedly of the type \ndescribed in section 4(5) seeking to impose liability of any kind based \non accumulative acts of consumption of a qualified product, the \ncomplaint initiating such action shall state with particularity for \neach defendant and cause of action--\n            (1) each element of the cause of action and the specific \n        facts alleged to satisfy each element of the cause of action;\n            (2) the Federal and State statutes or other laws that \n        allegedly create the cause of action; and\n            (3) the section 4(5)(B) exception being relied upon and the \n        specific facts that allegedly satisfy the requirements of that \n        exception.\n    (e) Rule of Construction.--No provision of this Act shall be \nconstrued to create a public or private cause of action or remedy.\n\nSEC. 4.
