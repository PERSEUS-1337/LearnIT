FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Private sector business concerns, which are free to \n        respond to the private or public demands of the marketplace, \n        constitute the strength of the United States economic system.\n            (2) Competitive private enterprises are the most \n        productive, efficient, and effective sources of goods and \n        services.\n            (3) Unfair Government competition with the private sector \n        of the economy is detrimental to the United States economic \n        system.\n            (4) Unfair Government competition with the private sector \n        of the economy is at an unacceptably high level, both in scope \n        and in dollar volume.\n            (5) Current law and policy have failed to address \n        adequately the problem of unfair Government competition with \n        the private sector of the economy.\n            (6) It is in the public interest that the Federal \n        Government establish a consistent policy to rely on the private \n        sector of the economy to provide goods and services necessary \n        for or beneficial to the operation and management of Federal \n        agencies and to avoid unfair Government competition with the \n        private sector of the economy.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``agency'' means--\n            (1) an executive department as defined by section 101 of \n        title 5, United States Code;\n            (2) a military department as defined by section 102 of such \n        title; and\n            (3) an independent establishment as defined by section \n        104(l) of such title.\n\nSEC. 4. PROCUREMENT FROM PRIVATE SOURCES.\n\n    (a) Policy.--In the process of governing, the Federal Government \nshould not compete with its citizens. The competitive enterprise \nsystem, characterized by individual freedom and initiative, is the \nprimary source of national economic strength. In recognition of this \nprinciple, it has been and continues to be the general policy of the \nFederal Government--\n            (1) to rely on commercial sources to supply the products \n        and services the Government needs;\n            (2) to refrain from providing a product or service if the \n        product or service can be procured more economically from a \n        commercial source; and\n            (3) to utilize Federal employees to perform inherently \n        governmental functions (as that term is defined in section 5 of \n        the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 (Public Law \n        105-270; 112 Stat. 2384)).\n    (b) General Rule.--Except as provided in subsection (c) and \nnotwithstanding any other provision of law, each agency shall obtain \nall goods and services necessary for or beneficial to the \naccomplishment of its authorized functions by procurement from private \nsources.\n    (c) Exemptions.--Subsection (b) shall not apply to an agency with \nrespect to goods or services if--\n            (1) the goods or services are required by law to be \n        produced or performed, respectively, by the agency; or\n            (2) the head of the agency determines and certifies to \n        Congress in accordance with regulations promulgated by the \n        Director of the Office of Management and Budget that--\n                    (A) Federal Government production, manufacture, or \n                provision of a good or service is necessary for the \n                national defense or homeland security;\n                    (B) a good or service is so inherently governmental \n                in nature that it is in the public interest to require \n                production or performance, respectively, by Government \n                employees; or\n                    (C) there is no private source capable of providing \n                the good or service.\n    (d) Method of Procurement.--The provision of goods and services not \nexempt by subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2) shall be performed by an entity \nin the private sector through--\n            (1) the divestiture of Federal involvement in the provision \n        of a good or service;\n            (2) the award of a contract to an entity in the private \n        sector, using competitive procedures, as defined in section 309 \n        of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 \n        (41 U.S.C. 259) and section 2302 of title 10, United States \n        Code;\n            (3) converting an activity to performance by a qualified \n        firm under at least 51 percent ownership by an Indian tribe, as \n        defined in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and \n        Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)), or a Native \n        Hawaiian Organization, as defined in section 8(a)(15) of the \n        Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(15)); or\n            (4) conducting a public-private competitive sourcing \n        analysis in accordance with the procedures established by the \n        Office of Management and Budget and determining that using the \n        assets, facilities, and performance of the private sector is in \n        the best interest of the United States and that production or \n        performance, respectively, by the private sector provides the \n        best value to the taxpayer.\n    (e) Contracted Activities.--The head of an agency may utilize \nFederal employees to provide goods or services previously provided by \nan entity in the private sector upon completion of a public-private \ncompetitive sourcing analysis described in subsection (d)(4), and after \nmaking a determination that the provision of such goods or services by \nFederal employees provides the best value to the taxpayer.\n    (f) Regulations.--The Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget shall promulgate such regulations as the Director considers \nnecessary to carry out this section. In promulgating such regulations, \nthe Director shall assure that any State or territory, or political \nsubdivision of a State or territory, complies with the policy and \nimplements the requirements of this section when expending Federal \nfunds.\n\nSEC. 5.
