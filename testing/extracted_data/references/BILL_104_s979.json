Wade, 410 U.S. 113 \n                (1973).\n                    (I) Fairness in insurance.\n                    (J) The ability of military personnel overseas to \n                purchase abortion services at military facilities with \n                private funds.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH \n              ISSUES.\n\n    (a) Rape and Incest Victim Protection.--It is the sense of Congress \nthat current provisions of law (in effect as of October 1, 1993) \nrequiring Federal and State governments to provide funding for abortion \nservices in cases of life endangerment, and for victims of rape or \nincest, to women eligible for assistance through the medicaid program \nunder title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) are \nessential to the health and well-being of the women and must not be \nrepealed.\n    (b) Clinic Violence.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) Federal resources are necessary to ensure that women \n        have safe access to reproductive health facilities and that \n        health professionals can deliver services in a secure \n        environment free from violence and threats of force; and\n            (2) it is necessary and appropriate to use Federal \n        resources to combat the nationwide campaign of violence and \n        harassment against reproductive health centers.\n    (c) Preventive Health Measures Regarding Breast and Cervical \nCancer.--It is the sense of Congress that the program of grants under \ntitle XV of the Public Health Service Act should receive a level of \nfunding that is adequate for all States to receive grants under such \ntitle.\n    (d) Programs Regarding Contraception and Infertility.--\n            (1) Research centers.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n        program of research centers under section 452A of the Public \n        Health Service Act should receive a level of funding that is \n        adequate for a reasonable number of research centers to be \n        operated under the program.\n            (2) Loan repayment program regarding conduct of research.--\n        It is the sense of Congress that the program of loan-repayment \n        contracts under section 487B of the Public Health Service Act \n        should receive a level of funding that is adequate for a \n        reasonable number of individuals to conduct research under the \n        program.\n\nSEC. 4. FAMILY PLANNING AMENDMENTS.\n\n    Section 1001(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300(d)) \nis amended to read as follows:\n    ``(d) For the purpose of grants and contracts under this section, \nthere are authorized to be appropriated $220,000,000 for fiscal year \n1996, $250,000,000 for fiscal year 1997, and such sums as may be \nnecessary for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2000.''.\n\nSEC. 5.

INFORMATION ABOUT AVAILABILITY OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE \n              SERVICES.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \ngovernmental authority shall, in or through any program or activity \nthat is administered or assisted by such authority and that provides \nhealth care services or information, limit the right of any person to \nprovide, or the right of any person to receive, nonfraudulent \ninformation about the availability of reproductive health care \nservices, including family planning, prenatal care, adoption, and \nabortion services.\n    ``(b) Definition.--As used in this section the term `governmental \nauthority' means any authority of the United States.''.\n\nSEC. 6. FAIRNESS IN EVALUATION OF RU-486.\n\n    The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall--\n            (1) assure that the Food and Drug Administration evaluates \n        the drug called Mifepristone or RU-486 only on the basis \n        provided by law; and\n            (2) assess initiatives by which the Department of Health \n        and Human Services can promote the testing, licensing, and \n        manufacturing in the United States of the drug or other \n        antiprogestins.\n\nSEC. 7. FREEDOM OF CHOICE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 \n        U.S. 113 (1973) established constitutionally based limits on \n        the power of States to restrict the right of a woman to choose \n        to terminate a pregnancy. Under the strict scrutiny standard \n        enunciated in the Roe v. Wade decision, States were required to \n        demonstrate that laws restricting the right of a woman to \n        choose to terminate a pregnancy were the least restrictive \n        means available to achieve a compelling State interest. Since \n        1989, the Supreme Court has no longer applied the strict \n        scrutiny standard in reviewing challenges to the \n        constitutionality of State laws restricting such rights.\n            (2) As a result of the recent modification by the Supreme \n        Court of the strict scrutiny standard enunciated in the Roe v. \n        Wade decision, certain States have restricted the right of \n        women to choose to terminate a pregnancy or to utilize some \n        forms of contraception, and the restrictions operate \n        cumulatively to--\n                    (A)(i) increase the number of illegal or medically \n                less safe abortions, often resulting in physical \n                impairment, loss of reproductive capacity, or death to \n                the women involved;\n                    (ii) burden interstate and international commerce \n                by forcing women to travel from States in which legal \n                barriers render contraception or abortion unavailable \n                or unsafe to other States or foreign nations;\n                    (iii) interfere with freedom of travel between and \n                among the various States;\n                    (iv) burden the medical and economic resources of \n                States that continue to provide women with access to \n                safe and legal abortion; and\n                    (v) interfere with the ability of medical \n                professionals to provide health services;\n                    (B) obstruct access to and use of contraceptive and \n                other medical techniques that are part of interstate \n                and international commerce;\n                    (C) discriminate between women who are able to \n                afford interstate and international travel and women \n                who are not, a disproportionate number of whom belong \n                to racial or ethnic minorities; and\n                    (D) infringe on the ability of women to exercise \n                full enjoyment of rights secured to the women by \n                Federal and State law, both statutory and \n                constitutional.\n            (3) Although Congress may not by legislation create \n        constitutional rights, Congress may, where authorized by the \n        enumerated powers of Congress and not prohibited by a \n        constitutional provision, enact legislation to create and \n        secure statutory rights in areas of legitimate national \n        concern.\n            (4) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of \n        article I of the Constitution and under section 5 of the 14th \n        amendment to the Constitution to enact legislation to prohibit \n        State interference with interstate commerce, liberty, or equal \n        protection of the laws.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish, as a \nstatutory matter, limitations on the power of a State to restrict the \nfreedom of a woman to terminate a pregnancy in order to achieve the \nsame limitations as were provided, as a constitutional matter, under \nthe strict scrutiny standard of review enunciated in the Roe v. Wade \ndecision and applied in subsequent cases from 1973 through 1988.\n    (c) In General.--A State--\n            (1) may not restrict the freedom of a woman to choose \n        whether or not to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability;\n            (2) may restrict the freedom of a woman to choose whether \n        or not to terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability unless \n        such a termination is necessary to preserve the life or health \n        of the woman; and\n            (3) may impose requirements on the performance of abortion \n        procedures if such requirements are medically necessary to \n        protect the health of women undergoing such procedures.\n    (d) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to--\n            (1) prevent a State from protecting unwilling individuals \n        or private health care institutions from being required to \n        participate in the performance of abortions to which the \n        individuals or institutions are conscientiously opposed;\n            (2) prevent a State from declining to pay for the \n        performance of abortions; or\n            (3) prevent a State from requiring a minor to involve a \n        parent, guardian, or other responsible adult before terminating \n        a pregnancy.\n    (e) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``State'' \nincludes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and \neach other territory or possession of the United States.\n\nSEC. 8. FAIRNESS IN INSURANCE.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal law shall be \nconstrued to prohibit a provider of health insurance from offering \ncoverage for the full range of reproductive health care services, \nincluding abortion services.\nSEC. 9. ABORTIONS IN FACILITIES OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES NOT \n              PROHIBITED IF NOT FEDERALLY FUNDED.\n\n    Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a) Limitation.--'' before ``Funds''; \n        and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Abortions in Facilities Overseas.--Subsection (a) does not \nlimit the performing of an abortion in a facility of the uniformed \nservices located outside the 48 contiguous States of the United States \nif--\n            ``(1) the cost of performing the abortion is fully paid \n        from a source or sources other than funds available to the \n        Department of Defense;\n            ``(2) abortions are not prohibited by the laws of the \n        jurisdiction where the facility is located; and\n            ``(3) the abortion would otherwise be permitted under the \n        laws applicable to the provision of health care to members and \n        former members of the uniformed services and their dependents \n        in such facility.''."
