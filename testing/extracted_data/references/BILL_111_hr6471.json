REPORT ON FOREIGN DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE WEAPONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Director of National Intelligence shall submit \nto the appropriate congressional committees a report--\n            (1) on the research, development, testing, and deployment \n        programs of foreign countries relating to--\n                    (A) electromagnetic pulse weapons;\n                    (B) delivery systems for EMP weapons; and\n                    (C) platforms for carrying EMP weapons delivery \n                systems; and\n            (2) that identifies each foreign country that is pursuing \n        an EMP weapons program, including the means of delivery and the \n        platforms, and describes the scope of such program.\n    (b) Contents.--The report required under subsection (a) shall \ninclude, with respect to each country identified in subsection (a)(2) \nthe following:\n            (1) An estimate of when the EMP weapon program began.\n            (2) An estimate of the scope of such program.\n            (3) A description of the technical characteristics of the \n        weapons that are being pursued under such program.\n            (4) A description of how far such program has advanced.\n            (5) A description of any sources of assistance with respect \n        to EMP weapons provided to or by such country and, in the case \n        of assistance provided by such country, a description of to \n        whom such assistance was provided.\n            (6) An assessment of how EMP weapons have been or are being \n        incorporated into the national security and military strategies \n        of such country, with a specific focus on whether such \n        strategies assume that an EMP weapons attack can achieve \n        effects similar to a direct nuclear attack, but not be subject \n        to the deterrence calculations normally applied to nuclear \n        weapons.\n            (7) A description of what kind of tests such country has \n        conducted with delivery systems, including ballistic missiles \n        and satellite launch vehicles, that demonstrate the capability \n        to deliver EMP weapons.\n            (8) An assessment of whether such country is conducting \n        research and development on the effects of EMP weapons, \n        including whether such country is assessing the vulnerabilities \n        of such country to EMP weapons and the ability of such country \n        to survive an attack making use of EMP weapons.\n            (9) An assessment of whether such country has tested an EMP \n        delivery system from a platform (including a ship or aircraft) \n        that could serve to expedite the achievement of an active EMP \n        weapons capability against the United States.\n            (10) An assessment of whether such country perceives the \n        United States to be particularly vulnerable to an EMP weapons \n        attack.\n            (11) A description of the elements of the research, \n        development, test, and deployment program for EMP weapons of \n        such country, if any, that are designed as countermeasures to \n        defensive options for defeating EMP weapons attacks.\n    (c) References to Other Reports.--The report submitted under \nsubsection (a) shall include a copy of any other report that is \nincorporated by reference into the report submitted under subsection \n(a).\n    (d) Unclassified Summary.--The report submitted under subsection \n(a) shall include an unclassified summary of such report.\n    (e) Submission to Congress.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n        Director of National Intelligence shall submit to the \n        appropriate congressional committees the first report required \n        under subsection (a) not later than 180 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Notification of delay in submission.--If the Director \n        of National Intelligence determines that it will not be \n        possible for the Director to submit the report required under \n        subsection (a) by the date required under paragraph (1), the \n        Director shall, not later than 30 days prior to the expiration \n        of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of \n        this Act, submit to the appropriate congressional committees a \n        notice--\n                    (A) that such report will not be submitted by the \n                date required under paragraph (1); and\n                    (B) setting forth the date by which the Director \n                will submit such report.\n    (f) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n                    (A) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \n                and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of \n                Representatives; and\n                    (B) the Select Committee on Intelligence and the \n                Committee on Armed Services of the Senate.\n            (2) Delivery system.--The term ``delivery system'' means \n        any means for placing an EMP weapon in a location where the \n        explosion of the weapon will have an intended damaging impact \n        on electrical power systems, electronics, information systems, \n        and other infrastructure that depends on such systems.\n            (3) Electromagnetic pulse weapon.--The terms \n        ``electromagnetic pulse weapon'' and ``EMP weapon'' mean an \n        explosive weapon that generates electromagnetic fields that \n        have a high likelihood of damaging electrical power systems, \n        electronics, information systems, and other infrastructure that \n        depends on such systems.\n            (4) Platform.--The term ``platform'' means any system \n        capable of serving as the launch point of an EMP weapon \n        delivery system."
