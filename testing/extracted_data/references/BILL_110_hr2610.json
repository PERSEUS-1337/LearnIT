CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Millions of Americans enjoy competing with other \n        players in a variety of games of skill, including bridge, mah-\n        jong, backgammon, and poker, over the Internet, where the \n        operator provides the Internet venue for competition and \n        receives a fee for such service.\n            (2) For some Americans, these games provide their primary \n        source of income.\n            (3) While each of these games contains an element of \n        chance, over any substantial interval, a player's success at \n        any of these games is determined by that player's relative \n        level of skill and is widely recognized as such.\n            (4) Games where success is predominantly determined by the \n        skill of the players involved, as a matter of law and of \n        policy, are distinct from the games of chance traditionally \n        described and addressed in Federal and State gambling statutes.\n            (5) Despite the fact that the language in section 1084 of \n        title 18, United States Code, commonly referred to as the \n        ``Wire Act'', has been interpreted by Federal courts as \n        applying only to betting on sports, some in law enforcement \n        interpret the section as prohibiting the acceptance of both \n        sports and non-sports betting through a communications device.\n            (6) The Federal Government should take appropriate steps to \n        ensure that, with respect to skill games--\n                    (A) minors are prevented from playing for money;\n                    (B) persons with compulsive behavior should be \n                identified and referred to treatment;\n                    (C) operators of such games should not be \n                vulnerable to, or participate in criminal or terrorist \n                money laundering; and\n                    (D) appropriate taxes are collected.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFICATION.\n\n    Section 1084 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following new subsection: (f)\n    ``(f) As used in this section, the term `bets or wagers' does not \ninclude operating, or participation in, poker, chess, bridge, mahjong \nor any other game where success is predominantly determined by a \nplayer's skill, to the extent that--\n            ``(1) the game provides for competition only between and \n        among participants, and not against the person operating the \n        game; and\n            ``(2) the operator is in compliance with regulations issued \n        pursuant to section 5368 of title 31, United States Code.''.\n\nSEC. 4. SAFEGUARDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subchapter IV of chapter 53 of title 31, United \nStates Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 5368.
