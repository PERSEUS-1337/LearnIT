SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Lost Boys and Girls Rebuilding \nInfrastructure to Sustain Enduring Peace in South Sudan Act'' or the \n``Lost Boys and Girls RISE Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 21-year civil war between the North and the South \n        in Sudan, which ended with the signing of the Comprehensive \n        Peace Agreement on January 9, 2005, caused many Sudanese people \n        to flee their homes to seek refuge elsewhere in Sudan, in \n        neighboring countries, and in the United States.\n            (2) During the civil war, government troops burned villages \n        in southern Sudan, killed the adults, and enslaved both women \n        and girls. Among the refugees from the conflict was a group of \n        at least 20,000 children, aged 5 to 17 years, who were homeless \n        orphans as a result of the war.\n            (3) The children suffered tremendous hardships during their \n        flight, enduring attacks not only from the army and marauding \n        bandits but also from lions and hyenas. Many others died from \n        starvation or thirst.\n            (4) A few years after the children arrived at the Panyindo \n        refugee camp in Ethiopia, armed soldiers forced them to leave \n        the camp by crossing the swollen Gilo River, and at least 1,000 \n        children either drowned or were eaten by crocodiles while they \n        crossed. The children then began their journey to a refugee \n        camp in Kenya.\n            (5) In 1999, the United Nations High Commissioner for \n        Refugees determined that repatriation was no longer an option \n        for these children. Approximately 3,800 of the 20,000 children \n        were granted priority resettlement status in the United States, \n        with minors placed in foster homes and those over 18 resettled \n        as adults throughout the United States with assistance from the \n        Department of Health and Human Services.\n            (6) The story of these children, known as the ``Lost Boys \n        and Lost Girls of Sudan'', has been documented in a number of \n        books and films in the United States.\n            (7) The Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan have acquired a \n        reputation for being a resilient and highly motivated group of \n        individuals, with many of them gaining employment and pursuing \n        higher education simultaneously.\n            (8) Many of the Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan have \n        publically expressed interest in returning to their homeland to \n        contribute to reconstruction efforts.\n            (9) South Sudan is currently engulfed in a new civil war \n        and faces a humanitarian catastrophe and an upsurge of violence \n        between ethnic groups. Many of the Lost Boys and Lost Girls \n        have gained experience, education, and skills in the United \n        States, and want to return to South Sudan to assist in efforts \n        to rebuild the infrastructure of the country.\n\nSEC. 3.
