FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Stewart Lee Udall was born on January 31, 1920, in \n        Saint Johns, Arizona, the son of former Arizona Supreme Court \n        Justice Levi Stewart Udall and Louise Lee Udall.\n            (2) Stewart L. Udall began serving his country in 1942, \n        when he joined the United States Army Air Corps (predecessor of \n        the United States Air Force) in World War II, serving as an \n        enlisted B24 waist gunner in Italy. He flew more than 50 \n        missions over Western Europe over four years, receiving the Air \n        Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters.\n            (3) After coming home from war, Stewart L. Udall returned \n        to the University of Arizona where he received a bachelors and \n        law degree and was admitted to the Arizona State Bar. After \n        graduating from law school, he began his own private practice \n        and eventually established the law firm of Udall and Udall with \n        his brother Morris K. Udall.\n            (4) Stewart L. Udall's first elected office was as a member \n        of the Amphitheater School Board (1951), where he participated \n        in desegregating the Amphitheater School District before the \n        United States Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of \n        Education.\n            (5) Beginning in 1954, Stewart L. Udall was elected to \n        serve four terms as United States Representative from Arizona's \n        second district.\n            (6) Upon the 1960 Presidential election, President Kennedy \n        appointed Stewart L. Udall as Secretary of the Interior. He \n        maintained this position for eight years, where his \n        accomplishments under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson made him a \n        hero for the environmental and conservation communities.\n            (7) Among the legislative accomplishments during his \n        cabinet career, Stewart L. Udall helped guide numerous landmark \n        environmental measures through Congress, including the \n        Wilderness Act of 1964, the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n        Act of 1965, the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966, \n        the National Trail System Act of 1968, the Solid Waste Disposal \n        Act of 1965, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, and the \n        Clear Air, Water Quality and Clean Water Restoration Acts and \n        Amendments.\n            (8) Furthermore, Secretary Udall was a coauthor of the \n        Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. This legislation created \n        several new social programs that helped promote the health, \n        education, and general welfare of the impoverished. Some of the \n        programs remaining today include Head Start and the Job Corps.\n            (9) As Secretary of the Interior in the Kennedy and Johnson \n        administrations, Stewart L. Udall expanded the National Park \n        Service by presiding over the acquisition of 3.85 million acres \n        of new holdings, including 4 national parks (Canyonlands in \n        Utah, Redwood in California, North Cascades in Washington \n        State, and Guadalupe Mountains in Texas), 6 national monuments, \n        9 national recreation areas, 20 historic sites, 50 wildlife \n        refuges, and 8 national seashores.\n            (10) Furthermore, Stewart L. Udall established the Bureau \n        of Outdoor Recreation to coordinate all Federal outdoor \n        programs.\n            (11) In September 1966, Secretary Stewart Udall announced \n        the creation of Project EROS, which led the United States to \n        state of the art science and technology that includes Landsat, \n        the longest running acquisition of satellite imagery. Project \n        EROS began as a revolutionary program that utilized earth-\n        orbiting satellites that map the planet to gather data about \n        the Earth's natural resources along with changes in weather and \n        climate.\n            (12) During his tenure as Secretary of the Interior, \n        Stewart L. Udall also became a champion of the arts, convincing \n        President Kennedy to invite the renowned poet Robert Frost to \n        speak at his inauguration and setting in motion initiatives \n        that led to the creation of the Kennedy Center, Wolf Trap Farm \n        Park, the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities, \n        and the revived Ford's Theatre.\n            (13) Additionally, while Stewart L. Udall was Secretary of \n        the Interior, he continued to fight against segregation, when \n        he threatened to refuse the all-white Washington Redskins \n        access to the new DC stadium, of which he was the Federal \n        landlord.\n            (14) After he left government service, Stewart L. Udall \n        continued helping the American people by becoming a crusader \n        for victims of radiation exposure (particularly Native \n        Americans) resulting from the government's Cold War nuclear \n        programs. He helped to pass the Radiation Exposure Compensation \n        Act in 1990, which was signed by President George Bush.\n            (15) Moreover, Stewart L. Udall was a prolific writer, \n        penning countless articles, essays, and op-eds. He also co-\n        authored nine books, and wrote nine of his own, including the \n        seminal title in the conservation movement, ``The Quiet \n        Crisis''.\n            (16) Among his many honors, Stewart L. Udall was a \n        recipient of the Ansel Adams Award, the Wilderness Society's \n        highest conservation award, the Common Cause Public Service \n        Achievement Award for his lifelong protection of the \n        environment and the defense of American citizens who were \n        victims of nuclear weapons testing, and the United Nations Gold \n        Medal for Lifetime Achievement.\n            (17) Until his passing in 2010, Stewart L. Udall continued \n        his devotion to public service as an author, historian, \n        scholar, lecturer, environmental activist, lawyer, and citizen \n        of the outdoors.\n\nSEC. 3.
