FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n            (1) The Weyerhaeuser Company has offered to the United \n        States Government an exchange of lands under which Weyerhaeuser \n        would receive approximately 50,000 acres of Federal land in \n        Arkansas and Oklahoma in return for conveying to the United \n        States lands owned by Weyerhaeuser consisting of approximately \n        165,000 acres of forested wetlands and other forest land of \n        public interest in Arkansas and Oklahoma, consisting of--\n                    (A) certain Arkansas Ouachita lands located near \n                Lake Ouachita, Little Missouri Wild and Scenic River, \n                Flatside Wilderness and the Ouachita National Forest;\n                    (B) certain lands in Oklahoma located near the \n                McCurtain County Wilderness, the Broken Bow Reservoir, \n                the Glover River, and the Ouachita National Forest; and\n                    (C) certain Arkansas Cossatot lands located on the \n                Little and Cossatot Rivers and identified as the ``Pond \n                Creek Bottoms'' in the Lower Mississippi River Delta \n                section of the North American Waterfowl Management \n                Plan.\n            (2) Acquisition of the Arkansas Cossatot lands by the \n        United States will remove the lands in the heart of a critical \n        wetland ecosystem from sustained timber production and other \n        development.\n            (3) The acquisition of the Arkansas Ouachita lands and the \n        Oklahoma lands by the United States for administration by the \n        Forest Service will provide an opportunity for enhancement of \n        ecosystem management of the National Forest System lands and \n        resources.\n            (4) The Arkansas Ouachita lands and the Oklahoma lands have \n        outstanding wildlife habitat and important recreational values \n        and should continue to be made available for activities such as \n        public hunting, fishing, trapping, nature observation, \n        enjoyment, education, and timber management.\n            (5) Private use of the lands the United States will convey \n        to Weyerhaeuser will not conflict with established management \n        objectives on adjacent Federal lands.\n            (6) The lands the United States will convey to Weyerhaeuser \n        as part of the exchange described in paragraph (1) do not \n        contain comparable fish, wildlife, or wetland values.\n            (7) The United States will convey all mineral interests and \n        oil and gas interests to Weyerhaeuser on or under all surface \n        acres designated to be exchanged pursuant to the exchange \n        described in paragraph (1) in which the Federal Government owns \n        such interests.\n            (8) Pursuant to such exchange, Weyerhaeuser will convey to \n        the United States all mineral interests and equivalent oil and \n        gas interests on or under all surface acres designated to be \n        exchanged pursuant to the exchange described in paragraph (1) \n        in which Weyerhaeuser owns such interests.\n            (9) The United States and Weyerhaeuser have agreed to the \n        values and boundaries of all lands, mineral interests, and oil \n        and gas interests to be conveyed in the exchange and concur \n        that the lands, mineral interests, and oil and gas interests to \n        be conveyed by Weyerhaeuser and the lands, mineral interests, \n        and oil and gas interests to be conveyed by the United States \n        area approximately equal in value.\n            (10) The exchange of lands, mineral interests, and oil and \n        gas interests between Weyerhaeuser and the United States is in \n        the public interest.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize and direct \nthe Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to enter \ninto an exchange of lands, mineral interests, and oil and gas interests \nthat will provide environmental, land management, recreational, and \neconomic benefits to the States of Arkansas and Oklahoma and to the \nUnited States.\n\nSEC. 2.
