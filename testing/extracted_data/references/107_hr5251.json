FINDINGS AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Aviation Administration (in this section \n        referred to as the ``FAA'') requested an exemption from Federal \n        personnel regulations to create a performance-based system.\n            (2) The Administrator of the FAA elected to implement a \n        system adversely impacting air traffic employees and contrary \n        to the basic tenets of fairness and Federal employment in \n        general.\n            (3) The report of the General Accounting Office on managers \n        and supervisors identified the FAA as worse, in general, than \n        the rest of the Government in multiple aspects.\n            (4) The Inspector General of the Department of \n        Transportation found that the new FAA compensation system is \n        inequitable, imposes disparate compensation on employees, has \n        no link between pay and performance, and is not based on \n        experience, qualifications, position, duties, or \n        responsibilities.\n            (5) The Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n        Representatives concluded that the personnel reform efforts of \n        the FAA have been a failure and should receive special review \n        in future reauthorizations.\n            (6) An independent study by the National Academy of Public \n        Administration found that the FAA has not met many of the key \n        goals of personnel reform.\n            (7) The Administrator of the FAA has ignored all \n        applications for redress to correct these ongoing disparities \n        and the inequitable treatment of employees.\n            (8) These actions elicit from FAA employees a sense of \n        betrayal of trust and commitment at a critical juncture in the \n        national response to security events.\n            (9) The actions of the Administrator of the FAA violate the \n        basic tenets from which the exemption to Federal personnel \n        regulations were requested and authorized.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this Act, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n            (2) Air traffic control specialized compensation system.--\n        The term ``air traffic control specialized compensation \n        system'' means the compensation system implemented beginning on \n        October 1, 1998, for air traffic controllers in conjunction \n        with a collective bargaining agreement with the National Air \n        Traffic Controllers Association.\n            (3) Air traffic controller.--The term ``air traffic \n        controller'' means an employee of the Federal Aviation \n        Administration in a position classified in the 2152 occupation \n        series in the Federal Wage System, regardless of the employee's \n        assigned location or position.\n            (4) Air traffic mss employee.--The term ``air traffic MSS \n        employee'' means an air traffic controller assigned as a \n        manager, supervisor, or staff specialist or any additional \n        employee designated by the Administrator or the Director of the \n        Air Traffic Service as critical to accomplishing the air \n        traffic control mission of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n            (5) Covered air traffic mss employee.--The term ``covered \n        air traffic MSS employee'' means an air traffic MSS employee \n        covered by the air traffic control specialized compensation \n        system.\n            (6) FAA field facilities.--The term `FAA field facilities' \n        means the air traffic control towers, terminal radar approach \n        controls, and enroute centers of the Federal Aviation \n        Administration.\n            (7) FAA headquarters.--The term ``FAA headquarters'' means \n        the headquarters of the Federal Aviation Administration in \n        Washington, D.C., including organizations that have elements \n        that are physically resident at other locations (such as the \n        Federal Aviation Administration Academy and the William J. \n        Hughes Technical Center).\n            (8) FAA regional offices.--The term ``FAA regional \n        offices'' means the 9 regional offices of the Federal Aviation \n        Administration.\n            (9) Uncovered air traffic mss employee.--The term \n        ``uncovered air traffic MSS employee'' means an air traffic MSS \n        employee not covered by the air traffic control specialized \n        compensation system.\n\nSEC. 3.
