FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Federal agencies cannot be run effectively if those \n        agencies practice or tolerate discrimination;\n            (2) in August 2000, a jury found that the Environmental \n        Protection Agency had discriminated against a senior social \n        scientist, and awarded that scientist $600,000;\n            (3) in October 2000, an Occupational Safety and Health \n        Administration investigation found that the Environmental \n        Protection Agency had retaliated against a senior scientist for \n        disagreeing with that agency on a matter of science and for \n        helping Congress to carry out its oversight responsibilities;\n            (4) notifying Federal employees of their rights under \n        discrimination and whistleblower statutes should increase \n        agency compliance with the law;\n            (5) requiring annual reports to Congress on the number and \n        severity of discrimination and whistleblower cases brought \n        against each Federal agency should enable Congress to improve \n        its oversight over agencies' compliance with the law; and\n            (6) penalizing a Federal agency by requiring that agency to \n        pay for any discrimination or whistleblower judgment, award, or \n        settlement should improve agency accountability with respect to \n        whistleblower and discrimination laws.\n\nSEC. 3.
