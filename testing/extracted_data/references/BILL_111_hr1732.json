FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Of all the electricity generated in the United States, \n        4.4 percent is consumed for outdoor lighting.\n            (2) Outdoor lighting represents approximately 20 percent of \n        all electricity consumed for lighting purposes in the United \n        States.\n            (3) Efficient outdoor lighting technologies provide light \n        quality equal or superior to other technologies in common use \n        today.\n            (4) Efficient outdoor lighting technologies often have \n        longer product lifetimes than other technologies in common use \n        today.\n            (5) The use of efficient outdoor lighting technologies will \n        substantially reduce waste and emissions from power generation, \n        and reduce the cost of electricity used in certain commercial \n        and government applications, such as lighting the Nation's \n        roadways and parking lots.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Section 340(1) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 \nU.S.C. 6311(1)) is amended by striking subparagraph (L) and inserting \nthe following:\n                    ``(L) Outdoor luminares.\n                    ``(M) Outdoor high light output lamps.\n                    ``(N) Any other type of industrial equipment which \n                the Secretary classifies as covered equipment under \n                section 341(b).''.\n    (b) Section 340 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 \nU.S.C. 6311) is amended as adding at the end the following:\n            ``(25) The term `luminaire' means a complete lighting unit \n        consisting of a lamp or lamps, together with parts designed to \n        distribute the light, to position and protect such lamps, and \n        to connect such lamps to the power supply.\n            ``(26) The term `outdoor luminaire' means a luminaire that \n        is listed as suitable for wet locations pursuant to \n        Underwriters Laboratories Inc. standard UL 1598 and is labeled \n        as `Suitable for Wet Locations' consistent with section \n        410.4(A) of the National Electrical Code 2005, except for--\n                    ``(A) luminaires designed solely for signs that \n                cannot be used in general lighting applications;\n                    ``(B) portable luminaires designed for use at \n                theatrical and television performance areas and \n                construction sites;\n                    ``(C) luminaires designed for continuous immersion \n                in swimming pools and other water features;\n                    ``(D) seasonal luminaires incorporating solely \n                individual lamps rated at 10 watts or less;\n                    ``(E) luminaires designed solely to be used in \n                emergency conditions;\n                    ``(F) landscape luminaries, with an integrated \n                photoelectric switch or programmable time switch, with \n                a nominal voltage of 15 volts or less; and\n                    ``(G) components used for repair of installed \n                luminaries.\n            ``(27) The term `outdoor high light output lamp' means a \n        lamp that--\n                    ``(A) has a rated lumen output not less than 2601 \n                lumens and not greater than 35,000 lumens;\n                    ``(B) is capable of being operated at a voltage not \n                less than 110 volts and not greater than 300 volts, or \n                driven at a constant current of 6.6 amperes; and\n                    ``(C) is not a Parabolic Aluminized Reflector lamp.\n            ``(28) The term `outdoor lighting control' means a device \n        incorporated in a luminaire that receives a signal, from either \n        a sensor (such as an occupancy sensor, motion sensor, or \n        daylight sensor) or an input signal (including analog or \n        digital signals communicated through wired or wireless \n        technology), and can adjust the light level according to the \n        signal.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
