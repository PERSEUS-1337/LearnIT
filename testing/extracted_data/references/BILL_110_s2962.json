FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement have \n        created barriers to care for seniors and the disabled.\n            (2) The regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement \n        penalize States that have cost-effective health care delivery \n        systems and reward those States with high utilization rates and \n        that provide inefficient care.\n            (3) Comparatively, in 2003, per capita spending under \n        traditional Medicare was $5,661 for beneficiaries in Seattle, \n        $9,752 for those in Los Angeles, and $11,340 for those in \n        Miami.\n            (4) Over a lifetime, regional inequities can mean as much \n        as a $125,000 difference in the cost of care provided per \n        beneficiary.\n            (5) Regional inequities have resulted in creating very \n        different Medicare programs and amount of care received for \n        seniors and the disabled based on where they live.\n            (6) Because the Medicare Advantage rate is based on the \n        fee-for-service reimbursement rate, regional inequities have \n        allowed some Medicare beneficiaries access to plans with \n        significantly more benefits and reduced cost sharing. \n        Beneficiaries in States with lower reimbursement rates have not \n        benefitted to the same degree as beneficiaries in other parts \n        of the country.\n            (7) Regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement have \n        created an unfair competitive advantage for hospitals and other \n        health care providers in States that receive above average \n        payments. Higher payments mean that those providers can pay \n        higher salaries in a tight, competitive market.\n            (8) Regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement are not \n        just a rural versus urban problem. Many States with large urban \n        centers are at the bottom of the national average for per \n        beneficiary costs.\n\nSEC. 3. IMPROVING FAIRNESS OF PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS UNDER THE MEDICARE \n              FEE-FOR-SERVICE PROGRAM.\n\n    Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``improving payment equity under the original medicare fee-for-service \n                                program\n\n    ``Sec. 1898.
