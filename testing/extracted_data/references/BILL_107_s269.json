FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 1997, there were an estimated 25,800,000 foreign-\n        born individuals residing in the United States. That number is \n        the largest number of such foreign-born individuals in United \n        States history and represents a 6,000,000, or 30 percent, \n        increase over the 1990 census figure of 19,800,000 of such \n        foreign-born individuals. The Bureau of the Census estimates \n        that the recently arrived immigrant population (including the \n        refugee population) currently residing in the Nation will \n        account for 75 percent of the population growth in the United \n        States over the next 50 years.\n            (2) For millions of immigrants settling into the Nation's \n        hamlets, towns, and cities, the dream of ``life, liberty, and \n        the pursuit of happiness'' has become a reality. The wave of \n        immigrants, of various nationalities, who have chosen the \n        United States as their home, has positively influenced the \n        Nation's image and relationship with other nations. The diverse \n        cultural heritage of the Nation's immigrants has helped define \n        the Nation's culture, customs, economy, and communities. By \n        better understanding the people who have immigrated to the \n        Nation, individuals in the United States better understand what \n        it means to be an American.\n            (3) There is a critical shortage of teachers with the \n        skills needed to educate immigrant students and their families \n        in nonconcentrated, nontraditional, immigrant communities as \n        well as communities with large immigrant populations. The large \n        influx of immigrant families over the last decade presents a \n        national dilemma: The number of such families with school-age \n        children requiring assistance to successfully participate in \n        elementary schools, secondary schools, and communities in the \n        United States, is increasing without a corresponding increase \n        in the number of teachers with skills to accommodate their \n        needs.\n            (4) Immigrants arriving in communities across the Nation \n        generally settle into high-poverty areas, where funding for \n        programs to provide immigrant students and their families with \n        the services the students and families need to successfully \n        participate in elementary schools, secondary schools, and \n        communities in the United States is inadequate.\n            (5) The influx of immigrant families settling into many \n        United States communities is often the result of concerted \n        efforts by local employers who value immigrant labor. Those \n        employers realize that helping immigrants to become productive, \n        prosperous members of a community is beneficial for the local \n        businesses involved, the immigrants, and the community. \n        Further, local businesses benefit from the presence of the \n        immigrant families because the families present businesses with \n        a committed and effective workforce and help open up new market \n        opportunities. However, many of the communities into which the \n        immigrants have settled need assistance in order to give \n        immigrant students and their families the services the students \n        and families need to successfully participate in elementary \n        schools, secondary schools, and communities in the United \n        States.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a grant program, within the \nDepartment of Education, that provides funding to partnerships of local \neducational agencies and community-based organizations for the \ndevelopment of model programs to provide immigrant students and their \nfamilies with the services the students and families need to \nsuccessfully participate in elementary schools, secondary schools, and \ncommunities in the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n            (1) Immigrant.--In this Act, the term ``immigrant'' has the \n        meaning given the term in section 101 of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101).\n            (2) Other terms.--Other terms used in this Act have the \n        meanings given the terms in section 14101 of the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801).\n\nSEC. 5.
