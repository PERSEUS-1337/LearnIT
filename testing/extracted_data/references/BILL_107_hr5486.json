Priorities under the State \n        component shall be based upon the recommendations of State \n        panels representing a broad range of users of hydrogeologic \n        data and information, which shall be appointed by the Governor \n        of the State or the Governor's designee.\n            (2) Awards.--Twenty percent of the Federal funds available \n        under the State component shall be equally divided among the \n        State geological surveys of the High Plains Aquifer States to \n        carry out the purposes of the program provided under this Act. \n        The remaining funds under the State component shall be \n        competitively awarded to State or local agencies or entities in \n        the High Plains Aquifer States, including State geological \n        surveys, State water management agencies, institutions of \n        higher education, or consortia of such agencies or entities. \n        Such funds shall be awarded by the Director only for proposals \n        that have been recommended by the State panels referred to in \n        paragraph (1), subject to independent peer review, and given \n        final recommendation by the Federal Review Panel established \n        under subsection (e).

The Federal Review \n        Panel shall review and coordinate the Federal component \n        priorities under subsection (c)(1), Federal interdisciplinary \n        studies under subsection (c)(2), and the State component \n        priorities under subsection (d)(1).\n            (2) Composition and support.--Not later than 3 months after \n        the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall appoint \n        to the Federal Review Panel the following:\n                    (A) Two representatives of the United States \n                Geological Survey, at least one of which shall be a \n                hydrologist or hydrogeologist.\n                    (B) Three representatives of the geological surveys \n                and water management agencies of the High Plains \n                Aquifer States from lists of nominees provided by the \n                Association and the Western States Water Council, so \n                that there is representation of both the State \n                geological surveys and the State water management \n                agencies.\nAppointment to the Panel shall be for a term of 3 years. The Director \nshall provide technical and administrative support to the Federal \nReview Panel. Expenses for the Federal Review Panel shall be paid from \nfunds available under the Federal component of the program.\n    (f) Limitation.--The United States Geological Survey shall not use \nany of the Federal funds to be made available under the State component \nfor any fiscal year to pay indirect, servicing, or program management \ncharges. Recipients of awards granted under subsection (d)(2) shall not \nuse more than 18 percent of the Federal award amount for any fiscal \nyear for indirect, servicing, or program management charges.\n\nSEC. 4. PLAN.\n\n    The Secretary, acting through the Director, shall, with the \nparticipation and review of the Association, the Western States Water \nCouncil, the Federal Review Panel, and the State panels, prepare a plan \nfor the High Plains Aquifer Hydrogeologic Characterization, Mapping, \nModeling, and Monitoring Program. The plan shall address overall \npriorities for the program and a management structure and program \noperations, including the role and responsibilities of the United \nStates Geological Survey and the States in the program, and mechanisms \nfor identifying priorities for the Federal component and the State \ncomponent.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Report on Program Implementation.--One year after the date of \nenactment of this Act, and every 2 years thereafter through fiscal year \n2011, the Secretary shall submit a report on the status of \nimplementation of the program established by this Act to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate, the Committee on \nResources of the House of Representatives, and the Governors of the \nHigh Plains Aquifer States.\n    (b) Report on High Plains Aquifer.--One year after the date of \nenactment of this Act and every year thereafter through fiscal year \n2011, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources of the Senate, the Committee on Resources of the \nHouse of Representatives, and the Governors of the High Plains Aquifer \nStates on the status of the High Plains Aquifer, including aquifer \nrecharge rat"
