FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Renewable energy technology will be critical for the \n        United States and the world in overcoming dependence on oil and \n        reducing levels of dangerous global warming pollution.\n            (2) The institutional support for renewable energy \n        technology needs to be strengthened to match this growing level \n        of importance to the United States and the world.\n            (3) International agencies have been formed on two \n        occasions to address the unique problems and geopolitical \n        dynamics associated with different energy sources: the \n        International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International \n        Energy Agency (IEA).\n            (4) The IAEA, formed in 1957, represents the culmination of \n        President Eisenhower's ``Atoms for Peace'' proposal, \n        emphasizing safe, secure, and peaceful use of nuclear \n        technologies. Under the guidance and oversight of the IAEA, \n        nuclear power has grown from supplying almost none of the \n        world's electricity at the IAEA's founding to nearly 16 percent \n        in 2004.\n            (5) The IEA, formed during the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, \n        enhances energy security among oil consuming countries through \n        an oil reserve and sharing program triggered in the event of an \n        actual or potentially severe oil supply disruption. With IEA \n        helping to counterbalance the Organization of Petroleum \n        Exporting Countries, global oil consumption has surged 47 \n        percent over IEA's lifetime.\n            (6) Renewable generating capacity grew 26 gigawatts in \n        2005, expanding worldwide nonhydro renewable capacity to over \n        182 gigawatts. However, nearly two-thirds of this capacity lies \n        in just six countries. Meeting the world's energy demands in \n        the coming century while simultaneously reducing heat-trapping \n        emissions and growing the global economy will require actions \n        across nations to reform policy, expand markets for renewable \n        energy technologies, and gather and disseminate information and \n        best practices regarding renewable energy resources, and \n        appropriate technologies.\n            (7) From 1970 to 2005, the direct cost to the United States \n        of dependence on foreign oil was $7,000,000,000,000 (in \n        constant 2000 dollars).\n            (8) Oil dependence harms the economy and consumers, \n        entangles the military in foreign conflicts, and endangers \n        public health and the environment through the threat of global \n        warming.\n            (9) Significant public health, national security, and \n        environmental costs are associated with the emission of \n        greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. In the \n        United States and many other countries, these costs are not \n        currently paid by the polluters--a failure of competitive \n        markets which leads to the overuse of carbon-emitting energy \n        and the under-production of carbon-free energy.\n            (10) Annual revenue of solar, wind, and biofuel energy \n        companies increased to $55,000,000,000 in 2006, a 39 percent \n        increase over 2005. Venture capital directed towards energy \n        technology has grown from less than $50,000,000 a year in 1996 \n        to over $2,400,000,000 in 2006, representing nearly 10 percent \n        of total venture capital investment in the United States.\n            (11) In the United States alone, over a billion tons of \n        greenhouse gas emissions could be eliminated each year at a \n        profit through energy efficiency measures by 2030, avoiding the \n        construction of hundreds of power plants.\n            (12) Renewable energy tends to have higher construction and \n        maintenance costs and low or zero fuel costs, while fossil \n        energy has an opposite cost structure. This results in a higher \n        number of jobs per unit of energy generated from renewable \n        energy than conventional fossil fuels. The construction, \n        manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance jobs \n        produced by a megawatt of photovoltaic solar, for example, is 7 \n        to 11 times greater than the jobs generated by an equivalent \n        amount of coal or gas generated electricity.\n            (13) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has \n        stated that to stabilize greenhouse gases at CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; \n        equivalent concentrations of roughly 450-500 parts per \n        million--where global temperature rise could be limited to 3.6-\n        4.3\u000fF and sea-level rise due to thermal expansion limited to \n        4.6 feet--global emissions would need to peak by 2015 and \n        decline to as little as 15 percent of 2000 levels by the year \n        2050.\n            (14) In 2004, carbon dioxide emissions from Organization \n        for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were \n        surpassed for the first time by emissions from non-OECD \n        countries. Carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries \n        are projected to account for over 75 percent of global \n        emissions growth by 2030. Encouraging growth of renewable \n        energy in developing countries reduces the extent and \n        likelihood that these economies will follow a carbon-intensive, \n        fossil energy development path.\n            (15) At least $20,000,000,000,000 of investment in energy \n        generation and infrastructure will be needed worldwide in order \n        to meet the world's energy needs in 2030 (in constant 2005 \n        dollars). Energy generation and infrastructure typically turns \n        over every 40 years, making near-term energy investment \n        decisions instrumental in determining future emissions of \n        greenhouse gases.\n\nSEC. 3.
