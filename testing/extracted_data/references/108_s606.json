    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-Employee \nCooperation Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n    The Congress declares that the following is the policy of the \nUnited States:\n            (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n        based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n        consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n        management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n        parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating as \n        a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a quality \n        work environment. In many public safety agencies it is the \n        union that provides the institutional stability as elected \n        leaders and appointees come and go.\n            (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n        mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n        employers and their employees to reach and maintain agreements \n        concerning rates of pay, hours, and working conditions, and to \n        make all reasonable efforts through negotiations to settle \n        their differences by mutual agreement reached through \n        collective bargaining or by such methods as may be provided for \n        in any applicable agreement for the settlement of disputes.\n            (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n        safety employers and employees has implications for the \n        security of employees and can affect interstate and intrastate \n        commerce. The lack of such labor-management cooperation can \n        detrimentally impact the upgrading of police and fire services \n        of local communities, the health and well-being of public \n        safety officers, and the morale of the fire and police \n        departments. Additionally, these factors could have significant \n        commercial repercussions. Moreover, providing minimal standards \n        for collective bargaining negotiations in the public safety \n        sector can prevent industrial strife between labor and \n        management that interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\nSEC. 3.

In making such \n        determinations, the Authority shall consider and give weight, \n        to the maximum extent practicable, to the opinion of affected \n        parties.\n            (2) Subsequent determinations.--\n                    (A) In general.--A determination made pursuant to \n                paragraph (1) shall remain in effect unless and until \n                the Authority issues a subsequent determination, in \n                accordance with the procedures set forth in \n                subparagraph (B).\n                    (B) Procedures for subsequent determinations.--Upon \n                establishing that a material change in State law or its \n                interpretation has occurred, an employer or a labor \n                organization may submit a written request for a \n                subsequent determination.
