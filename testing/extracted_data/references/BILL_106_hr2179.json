FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Government, through the Atomic Energy \n        Commission, acquired the Rocky Flats site in 1951 and began \n        operations there in 1952. Since 1992, the mission of the Rocky \n        Flats site has changed from the production of nuclear weapons \n        components to managing wastes and materials and cleaning up and \n        converting the site to beneficial uses in a manner that is \n        safe, environmentally and socially responsible, physically \n        secure, and cost-effective.\n            (2) The buffer zone has generally remained undisturbed \n        since the acquisition of the Rocky Flats site. The buffer zone \n        possesses an impressive diversity of plant and animal species \n        and provides important wildlife habitat for a number of \n        threatened and endangered species.\n            (3) The State of Colorado is experiencing increasing growth \n        and development, especially in the metropolitan Denver Front \n        Range area in the vicinity of the Rocky Flats site. This growth \n        and development reduces the amount of open space and thereby \n        diminishes for many metropolitan Denver communities the vistas \n        of the striking Front Range mountain backdrop.\n            (4) The national interest requires that the ongoing cleanup \n        and closure of the Rocky Flats site be completed without \n        unnecessary delay and that the site thereafter be retained by \n        the United States and managed so as to preserve its value for \n        open space and wildlife habitat.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \nmanagement of the buffer zone at the Rocky Flats site as open space and \nto establish a process for determining and implementing appropriate \npolicies for the management of the Rocky Flats site after the ongoing \ncleanup and closure is completed.\n\nSEC. 3. FUTURE OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT.\n\n    (a) Federal Ownership.--Unless Congress provides otherwise in an \nAct enacted after the date of the enactment of this Act, all right, \ntitle, and interest of the United States, held on or acquired after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, to lands within the boundaries of \nthe Rocky Flats site shall be retained by the United States.\n    (b) Open Space Management of Buffer Zone.--(1) Except as provided \nin paragraph (2), the buffer zone shall be managed as open space.\n    (2) The structures that comprise the former Lindsay Ranch homestead \nsite within the Rock Creek Reserve area of the buffer zone shall be \npreserved and maintained to protect their historic significance and \nprovide appropriate enjoyment for visitors.\n    (c) Management of Industrial Area.--Subsection (b) shall not be \nconstrued to affect the management of the industrial area or to \npreclude the management of the industrial area as open space after \ncleanup and closure is completed.\n\nSEC. 4.
