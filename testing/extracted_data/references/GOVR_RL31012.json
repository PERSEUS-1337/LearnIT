The Senate version, S. 1172 , passed on July 19, contained $1.9 billion forlegislative activities. (1) This was a 5.6% ($103.1 million) increase over FY2001's funding level of $1.8 billion and 5.0%($103.9 million) below the request considered by the Senate of $2.1 billion ( S.Rept. 107-37 ). (2) On July 31, the Senate tookup H.R. 2647 and amended it to contain the language of S. 1172 , as passedon July 19. (3)  The House version, H.R. 2647 , passed on July 31, contained $2.2 billion, (4) a 4.4% ($95 million) increase,from $2.144 billion in FY2001 to $2.239 billion in FY2002. (5) The FY2002 appropriationwas a 2.5% decrease from the budget request considered by the House of $2.296 billion ( H.Rept.107-169 ). The terrorists' attacks of September 11, 2001, prompted moves toward an even more stringentsecurity environment on Capitol Hill. On September 18, President Bush signed a $40 billionFY2001 terrorist supplemental appropriations bill ( H.R. 2888 ) into P.L. 107-38 . Pursuant to P.L. 107-38 , the President has released $376.9 million in terrorist emergency funds forincreased security at the Capitol. The President requested the release of an additional allocation forlegislative branch security of $265.1 million, which unlike the other allocations for security, requiredcongressional approval. Congress approved the funds, as requested, as part of the FY2002 defensedepartment appropriations bill, which was signed into P.L. 107-117 on January 10, 2002.  Effective in FY1978, the legislative branch appropriations bill was divided into two titles. Title I, Congressional Operations, contains budget authorities for activities directly serving Congress. Included in this title are the budgets of the House, the Senate, Joint Items (joint House and Senateactivities), the Office of Compliance, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Architect of theCapitol (AOC) (except the Library of Congress (LOC) buildings and grounds), the CongressionalResearch Service (CRS) within the Library of Congress, and congressional printing and bindingactivities of the Government Printing Office (GPO). Title II, Related Agencies, contains budgets for activities not directly supporting Congress. Included in this title are the budgets of the Botanic Garden, the Library of Congress (except theCongressional Research Service), the Library buildings and grounds maintained by the Architect ofthe Capitol, the Government Printing Office (except congressional printing and binding costs), andthe General Accounting Office (GAO). Periodically since FY1978, the legislative bill has containedadditional titles for such purposes as capital improvements and special one-time functions. As Figure 1 illustrates, in FY2001, Title I budget authority was 68% of the totalappropriation of $2.730 billion, including a rescission and supplementals. Title II budget authoritywas 32% of the total appropriation. In addition, there was legislative budget authority that was notincluded in the annual legislative branch appropriations act or supplemental appropriations acts. Itincluded permanent budget authority for both federal funds and trust funds, and other budgetauthority. (6)  Figure 1. Title I and Title II of the FY2001 LegislativeBranch Appropriations Act (Including P.L. 106-554, a0.22% Rescission, and Supplementals) Permanent federal funds are available as the result of previously enacted legislation and donot require annual action. (7)  Permanent trust funds are monies held in accounts credited with collections from specificsources earmarked by law for a defined purpose. Trust funds do not appear in the annual legislativebill since they are not budget authority. They are included in the U.S. Budget either as budgetreceipts or offsetting collections. (8)  The Budget also contains non-legislative entities within the legislative branch budget. Theyare funded in other appropriation bills, but are placed in the legislative section by the Office ofManagement and Budget for bookkeeping purposes. (9)   Table 1.

Thefunding was added in the conference on H.R. 4328 , the FY1999Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L.105-277 ).  The conference report on H.R. 4328 stipulated that appropriatedfunds for the project are to be supplemented by private funds, and the clerk of theHouse and the secretary of the Senate were directed by the Capitol PreservationCommission to develop a fund-raising plan. The clerk and secretary presented a planon February 9, 2000, which the commission accepted, to authorize the PewCharitable Trusts to establish a nonprofit 501(c)(3) foundation to seek privatefunds. (42)  As of the end of calendar year 2001, an additional $64.3 million was availablefor the center. This included $26.6 million in Capitol Preservation Commissionfunds; (43) $35 million in private sector donations; (44) and $2.7 million (45) from thesale of a recently approved commemorative coin program marking the 200thanniversary of the convening of Congress in the Capitol.

Information security has been an element of interestduring consideration of the FY2002 bill. This was especially true during recenthearings by the Senate Subcommittee on Legislative Branch. Chairman Robert F.Bennett expressed his concern with the state of computer security and questioned theheads of legislative branch entities on attempts by hackers to infiltrate theircomputers. Those questioned were officials of the Library of Congress (LOC),Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Government Printing Office (GPO), GeneralAccounting Office (GAO), and Senate. Some officials reported a number ofunsuccessful attempts. The public printer of the Government Printing Office (GPO),for example, responded that over 300,000 attempts were made to infiltrate GPOACCESS within four months, but that no one was able to get beyond the agency'sprotective firewall. A number of legislative entities included funds for securityenhancement in their budget requests. The head of the General Accounting Office(GAO), for example, requested $750,000 to upgrade the agency's computer securityfacility. The LOC requested $686,088 and five FTEs to support its security program.Some legislative branch entities are conducting required technology security trainingfor their employees. The Congressional Research Service (CRS), for example, isrequiring its employees to attend a one-hour training session on ensuring security ofinformation provided to Congress. In calendar year 2000, the House Committee on Appropriations addressed itsconcern for the security of electronically formatted legislative information in itsreport language on the FY2001 legislative branch appropriations bill. The HouseCommittee directed the clerk of the House, in consultation with the secretary of theSenate, to meet with legislative entities that electronically create or store legislative information, to prepare information security standards and procedures forthese entities, and to establish a process to routinely evaluate security risks.  The clerk was required to submit proposed standards and procedures to theCommittee on House Administration and the Senate Committee on Rules andAdministration for approval. Upon approval, the clerk's plans were to be submittedto the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The Library of Congress (LOC) and the Government Printing Office (GPO) are directed to \"work with the clerk and secretary of the Senate to test, develop, andimplement ... systems that will enable them to confirm the authenticity of suchlegislative information.\" (49)  House Committee Funding.
