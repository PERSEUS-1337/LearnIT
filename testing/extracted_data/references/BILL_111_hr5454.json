GRANTS OF AND LIMITATIONS ON PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY.\n\n    ``(a) Presidential Authority To Withhold Funding.--If the President \nproposes a rescission of funding under this part, then notwithstanding \nany other provision of law, OMB is hereby authorized, subject to the \ntime limits of subsection (c), to temporarily withhold that funding \nfrom obligation.\n    ``(b) Expedited Procedures Available Only Once Per Bill.--The \nPresident may not invoke the procedures of this part, or the authority \nto withhold funding granted by subsection (a), on more than one \noccasion for any Act providing funding.\n    ``(c) Time Limits.--OMB shall make available for obligation any \nfunding withheld under subsection (a) on the earliest of--\n            ``(1) the day on which the President determines that the \n        continued withholding or reduction no longer advances the \n        purpose of legislative consideration of the rescission request;\n            ``(2) starting from the day on which OMB transmitted a \n        message to Congress requesting the rescission of funding, 25 \n        calendar days in which the House of Representatives has been in \n        session or 25 calendar days in which the Senate has been in \n        session, whichever occurs second; or\n            ``(3) the last day after which the obligation of the \n        funding in question can no longer be fully accomplished in a \n        prudent manner before its expiration.\n\n``SEC. 1026. CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF RESCISSION REQUESTS.\n\n    ``(a) Preparation of Legislation To Consider a Package of Expedited \nRescission Requests.--When the House of Representatives receives a \npackage of expedited rescission requests, the Clerk shall prepare a \nHouse bill that only rescinds the amounts requested. The bill shall \nread as follows:\n            ```There is hereby enacted the rescissions numbered [insert \n        number or numbers] as set forth in the Presidential message of \n        [insert date] transmitted under part C of the Impoundment \n        Control Act of 1974 as amended.'.\nThe Clerk shall include in the bill each numbered rescission request \nlisted in the Presidential package in question, except that the Clerk \nshall omit a numbered rescission request if the Chairman of the House \nBudget Committee, after consulting with the Senate Budget Committee, \nCBO, GAO, and the House and Senate committees that have jurisdiction \nover the funding, determines that the numbered rescission does not \nrefer to funding or includes matter not permitted under a request to \nrescind funding.\n    ``(b) Introduction and Referral of Legislation To Enact a Package \nof Expedited Rescissions.--The majority leader or the minority leader \nof the House of Representatives, or a designee, shall (by request) \nintroduce each bill prepared under subsection (a) not later than 4 days \nof session of the House after its transmittal, or, if no such bill is \nintroduced within that period, any member of the House may introduce \nthe required bill in the required form on the fifth or sixth day of \nsession of the House after its transmittal. When such an expedited \nrescission bill is introduced in accordance with the prior sentence, it \nshall be referred to the House committee of jurisdiction. A copy of the \nintroduced House bill shall be transmitted to the Secretary of the \nSenate, who shall provide it to the Senate committee of jurisdiction.\n    ``(c) House Report and Consideration of Legislation To Enact a \nPackage of Expedited Rescissions.--The House committee of jurisdiction \nshall report without amendment the bill referred to it under subsection \n(b) not more than 5 days of session of the House after the referral. \nThe Committee may order the bill reported favorably, unfavorably, or \nwithout recommendation. If the Committee has not reported the bill by \nthe end of the 5-day period, the Committee shall be automatically \ndischarged from further consideration of the bill and it shall be \nplaced on the appropriate calendar.\n    ``(d) House Motion To Proceed.--After a bill to enact an expedited \nrescission package has been reported or the committee of jurisdiction \nhas been discharged under subsection (c), it shall be in order to move \nto proceed to consider the bill in the House. A Member who wishes to \nmove to proceed to consideration of the bill must announce that fact, \nand the motion to proceed shall be in order only during a time \ndesignated by the Speaker within the legislative schedule for the next \ncalendar day of legislative session or the one immediately following \nit. If the Speaker does not designate such a time, then 3 or more \ncalendar days of legislative session after the bill has been reported \nor discharged, it shall be in order for any Member to move to proceed \nto consider the bill. A motion to proceed shall not be in order after \nthe House has disposed of a prior motion to proceed with respect to \nthat package of expedited rescissions. The previous question shall be \nconsidered as ordered on the motion to proceed, without intervening \nmotion. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion to proceed \nhas been disposed of shall not be in order. If 5 calendar days of \nlegislative session have passed since the bill was reported or \ndischarged under this subsection and no Member has made a motion to \nproceed, the bill shall be removed from the calendar.\n    ``(e) House Consideration.--A bill consisting of a package of \nrescissions shall be considered as read. All points of order against \nthe bill are waived, except that a point of order may be made that one \nor more numbered rescissions included in the bill would enact language \ncontaining matter not requested by the President or not permitted under \nthis Act as part of that package. If the Presiding Officer sustains \nsuch a point of order, the numbered rescission or rescissions that \nwould enact such language are deemed to be automatically stripped from \nthe bill and consideration proceeds on the bill as modified. The \nprevious question shall be considered as ordered on the bill to its \npassage without intervening motion, except that 4 hours of debate \nequally divided and controlled by a proponent and an opponent are \nallowed, as well as one motion to further limit debate on the bill. A \nmotion to reconsider the vote on passage of the bill shall not be in \norder.\n    ``(f) Senate Consideration.--If the House of Representatives \napproves a House bill enacting a package of rescissions, that bill as \npassed by the House shall be sent to the Senate and referred to the \nSenate committee of jurisdiction. That committee shall report without \namendment the bill referred to it under this subsection not later than \n3 days of session of the Senate after the referral. The committee may \norder the bill reported favorably, unfavorably, or without \nrecommendation. If the committee has not reported the bill by the end \nof the 3-day period, the committee shall be automatically discharged \nfrom further consideration of the bill and it shall be placed on the \nappropriate calendar. On the following day and for 3 subsequent \ncalendar days in which the Senate is in session, it shall be in order \nfor any Senator to move to proceed to consider the bill in the Senate. \nUpon such a motion being made, it shall be deemed to have been agreed \nto and the motion to reconsider shall be deemed to have been laid on \nthe table. Debate on the bill in the Senate under this subsection, and \nall debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall not \nexceed 10 hours, equally divided and controlled in the usual form. \nDebate in the Senate on any debatable motion or appeal in connection \nwith such a bill shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to be \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form. A motion to further \nlimit debate on such a bill is not debatable. A motion to amend such a \nbill or strike a provision from it is not in order. A motion to \nrecommit such a bill is not in order.\n    ``(g) Senate Point of Order.--It shall not be in order for the \nSenate to employ the procedures in this part while considering a bill \napproved by the House enacting a package of rescissions under this part \nif any numbered rescission in the bill would enact matter not requested \nby the President or not permitted under this Act as part of that \npackage. If a point of order under this section is sustained, \nconsideration of the bill shall no longer be governed by subsection \n(f); instead, consideration shall be governed by the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate and any other rules applicable to Senate consideration of \nlegislation.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents set forth in \nsection 1(b) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of \n1974 is amended by striking the items relating to part C of title 10 \nand inserting the following new items:\n\n       ``Part C--Expedited Consideration of Proposed Rescissions\n\n``Sec. 1021.
