    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Health Insurance for \nLong-Term Development Act of 1996''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this act is to provide health insurance coverage for \nchildren during the Infant Neurological Risk Exposure Period (INREP). \nThe INREP extends through age 3 and encompasses the period of most \nrapid neurological changes in young children. Health coverage will \nimprove children's health and, through routine health supervision, \npromote parents' caregiving skills through these critical years.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) 86 percent of children with private health insurance \n        are under-insured with respect to well-child care;\n            (2) because the human brain develops rapidly until the age \n        of 3, children need regular screenings and follow-up care to \n        detect neurological abnormalities and ensure normal \n        development;\n            (3) regular pediatric visits enable physicians to provide \n        guidance on parental activities, such as reading, that \n        stimulate the brain development of infants; and\n            (4) children deserve health care coverage that promotes \n        normal brain and nervous system development.\n\nSEC. 4.
