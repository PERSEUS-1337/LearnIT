FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Immunization is an inexpensive and effective public \n        health intervention that has had a profound life-saving impact \n        around the world.\n            (2) During the 20th century, global immunization efforts \n        have successfully led to the eradication of smallpox and the \n        elimination of polio from the Western Hemisphere, Europe, and \n        most of Asia. Vaccines for diseases such as measles and tetanus \n        have dramatically reduced childhood mortality worldwide, and \n        vaccines for diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, and \n        hepatitis help prevent sickness and death of adults as well as \n        children.\n            (3) According to the World Health Organization, combined, \n        AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria kill more than 5,000,000 people \n        a year, most of whom are in the developing world, yet there are \n        no vaccines for these diseases.\n            (4) Other, less well-known neglected diseases, such as \n        pneumococcal disease, lymphatic filariasis, leptospirosis, \n        leprosy, and onchocerciasis, result in severe health \n        consequences for individuals afflicted with them, such as \n        anemia, blindness, malnutrition and impaired childhood growth \n        and development. In addition, these diseases result in lost \n        productivity in developing countries costing in the billions of \n        dollars.\n            (5) Infants, children, and adolescents are among the \n        populations hardest hit by AIDS, malaria, and many other \n        neglected diseases. Nearly 11,000,000 children under age 5 die \n        each year due to these diseases, primarily in developing \n        countries. Existing and future vaccines that target children \n        could prevent more than 2,500,000 of these illnesses and \n        deaths.\n            (6) The devastating impact of neglected diseases in \n        developing countries threatens the political and economic \n        stability of these countries and constitutes a threat to United \n        States economic and security interests.\n            (7) Of more than $100,000,000,000 spent on health research \n        and development across the world, only $6,000,000,000 is spent \n        each year on diseases that are specific to developing \n        countries, most of which is from public and philanthropic \n        sources.\n            (8) Despite the devastating impact these and other diseases \n        have on developing countries, it is estimated that only 10 \n        percent of the world's research and development on health is \n        targeted on diseases affecting 90 percent of the world's \n        population.\n            (9) Because the developing country market is small and \n        unpredictable, there is an insufficient private sector \n        investment in research for vaccines for neglected diseases that \n        disproportionately affect populations in developing countries.\n            (10) Creating a broad range of economic incentives to \n        increase private sector research on neglected diseases is \n        critical to the development of vaccines for neglected diseases.\n            (11) In recognition of the need for more economic \n        incentives to encourage private sector investment in vaccines \n        for neglected diseases, an international group of health, \n        technical, and economic experts has developed a framework for \n        an advance market commitment pilot program for pneumococcal \n        vaccines. Pneumococcal disease, a cause of pneumonia and \n        meningitis, kills 1,600,000 people every year, an estimated \n        1,000,000 of whom are children under age 5. This pilot program \n        will seek to stimulate investments to develop and produce \n        pneumococcal vaccines that could prevent between 500,000 and \n        700,000 deaths by the year 2020.\n            (12) On February 9, 2007, 5 countries, Britain, Canada, \n        Italy, Norway, and Russia, together with the Bill and Melinda \n        Gates Foundation, pledged, under a plan called an Advance \n        Market Commitment, to purchase pneumococcal vaccines now under \n        development. Together, these countries and the Bill and Melinda \n        Gates Foundation have committed $1,500,000,000 for this \n        program. Experts believe that this initiative could accelerate \n        by a decade the widespread use of such a vaccine in the \n        developing world and could prevent the deaths of an estimated \n        5,400,000 children by 2030.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT FOR NEGLECTED DISEASES.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the President should continue to encourage efforts to \n        support the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise, a virtual consortium \n        of scientists and organizations committed to accelerating the \n        development of an effective HIV vaccine;\n            (2) the United States should work with the Global Fund to \n        Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Joint United Nations \n        Programme on HIV/AIDS (``UNAIDS''), the World Health \n        Organization, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, the \n        GAVI Alliance, and the World Bank to ensure that all countries \n        heavily affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic have national AIDS \n        vaccine plans;\n            (3) the United States should support and encourage the \n        carrying out of the agreements of the Group of 8 made at the \n        2005 Summit at Gleneagles, Scotland, to increase direct \n        investment and create market incentives, including through \n        public-private partnerships and advance market commitments, to \n        complement public research in the development of vaccines, \n        microbicides, and drugs for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, \n        and other neglected diseases;\n            (4) the United States should support the development of \n        effective vaccines for infants, children, and adolescents as \n        early as is medically and ethically appropriate, in order to \n        avoid significant delays in the availability of pediatric \n        vaccines at the cost of thousands of lives;\n            (5) the United States should continue supporting the work \n        of the GAVI Alliance and the Global Fund for Children's \n        Vaccines as appropriate and effective vehicles to purchase and \n        distribute vaccines for neglected diseases at an affordable \n        price once such vaccines are discovered in order to distribute \n        them to the developing world;\n            (6) the United States should work with others in the \n        international community to address the multiple obstacles to \n        the development of vaccines for neglected diseases including \n        scientific barriers, insufficient economic incentives, \n        protracted regulatory procedures, lack of delivery systems for \n        products once developed, liability risks, and intellectual \n        property rights; and\n            (7) the United States should contribute to the pilot \n        Advance Market Commitment for pneumococcal vaccines launched in \n        Rome on February 9, 2007, which could prevent some 500,000 to \n        700,000 child deaths by the year 2020 and an estimated \n        5,400,000 child deaths by 2030.\n\nSEC. 5. PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Partnerships between governments and the private sector \n        (including foundations, universities, corporations, community-\n        based organizations, and other nongovernmental organizations) \n        are playing a critical role in the area of global health, \n        particularly in the fight against neglected diseases, including \n        HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.\n            (2) These public-private partnerships improve the delivery \n        of health services in developing countries and accelerate \n        research and development of vaccines and other preventive \n        medical technologies essential to combating infectious diseases \n        that disproportionately kill people in developing countries.\n            (3) These public-private partnerships maximize the unique \n        capabilities of each sector while combining financial and other \n        resources, scientific knowledge, and expertise toward common \n        goals which cannot be achieved by either sector alone.\n            (4) Public-private partnerships such as the International \n        AIDS Vaccine Initiative, PATH's Malaria Vaccine Initiative, and \n        the Global TB Drug Facility are playing cutting edge roles in \n        the efforts to develop vaccines for these diseases.\n            (5) Public-private partnerships serve as incentives to the \n        research and development of vaccines for neglected diseases by \n        providing biotechnology companies, which often have no \n        experience in developing countries, with technical assistance \n        and on the ground support for clinical trials of the vaccine \n        through the various stages of development.\n            (6) Sustaining existing public-private partnerships and \n        building new ones where needed are essential to the success of \n        the efforts by the United States and others in the \n        international community to find a cure for these and other \n        neglected diseases.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the sustainment and promotion of public-private \n        partnerships must be a central element of the strategy pursued \n        by the United States to create effective incentives for the \n        development of vaccines and other preventive medical \n        technologies for neglected diseases debilitating the developing \n        world; and\n            (2) the United States Government should take steps to \n        address the obstacles to the development of these technologies \n        by increasing investment in research and development and \n        establishing market and other incentives.\n\nSEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF \n              VACCINES FOR NEGLECTED DISEASES.\n\n    (a) Requirement for Strategy.--The President shall establish a \ncomprehensive strategy to accelerate efforts to develop vaccines and \nmicrobicides for neglected diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and \ntuberculosis.
