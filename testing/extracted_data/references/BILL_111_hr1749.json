FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are more than 2,000,000,000 manufactured homes \n        constructed prior to 1976 still occupied as permanent \n        residences throughout the United States.\n            (2) Manufactured homes constructed prior to 1976 generally \n        have very poor energy efficiency, as such homes pre-date any \n        Federal energy efficiency standards for manufactured homes.\n            (3) Replacing manufactured homes constructed prior to 1976 \n        with new Energy Star qualified manufactured homes will \n        dramatically lower energy consumption and costs for residents \n        of such homes, most of whom are in low-income households.\n\nSEC. 3.
