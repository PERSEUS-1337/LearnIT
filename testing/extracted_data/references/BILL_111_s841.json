DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act--\n        (1) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n    Transportation;\n        (2) the term ``alert sound'' (herein referred to as the \n    ``sound'') means a vehicle-emitted sound to enable pedestrians to \n    discern vehicle presence, direction, location, and operation;\n        (3) the term ``cross-over speed'' means the speed at which tire \n    noise, wind resistance, or other factors eliminate the need for a \n    separate alert sound as determined by the Secretary;\n        (4) the term ``motor vehicle'' has the meaning given such term \n    in section 30102(a)(6) of title 49, United States Code, except that \n    such term shall not include a trailer (as such term is defined in \n    section 571.3 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations);\n        (5) the term ``conventional motor vehicle'' means a motor \n    vehicle powered by a gasoline, diesel, or alternative fueled \n    internal combustion engine as its sole means of propulsion;\n        (6) the term ``manufacturer'' has the meaning given such term \n    in section 30102(a)(5) of title 49, United States Code;\n        (7) the term ``dealer'' has the meaning given such term in \n    section 30102(a)(1) of title 49, United States Code;\n        (8) the term ``defect'' has the meaning given such term in \n    section 30102(a)(2) of title 49, United States Code;\n        (9) the term ``hybrid vehicle'' means a motor vehicle which has \n    more than one means of propulsion; and\n        (10) the term ``electric vehicle'' means a motor vehicle with \n    an electric motor as its sole means of propulsion.\n\nSEC. 3. MINIMUM SOUND REQUIREMENT FOR MOTOR VEHICLES.\n\n    (a) Rulemaking Required.--Not later than 18 months after the date \nof enactment of this Act the Secretary shall initiate rulemaking, under \nsection 30111 of title 49, United States Code, to promulgate a motor \nvehicle safety standard--\n        (1) establishing performance requirements for an alert sound \n    that allows blind and other pedestrians to reasonably detect a \n    nearby electric or hybrid vehicle operating below the cross-over \n    speed, if any; and\n        (2) requiring new electric or hybrid vehicles to provide an \n    alert sound conforming to the requirements of the motor vehicle \n    safety standard established under this subsection.\nThe motor vehicle safety standard established under this subsection \nshall not require either driver or pedestrian activation of the alert \nsound and shall allow the pedestrian to reasonably detect a nearby \nelectric or hybrid vehicle in critical operating scenarios including, \nbut not limited to, constant speed, accelerating, or decelerating. The \nSecretary shall allow manufacturers to provide each vehicle with one or \nmore sounds that comply with the motor vehicle safety standard at the \ntime of manufacture. Further, the Secretary shall require manufacturers \nto provide, within reasonable manufacturing tolerances, the same sound \nor set of sounds for all vehicles of the same make and model and shall \nprohibit manufacturers from providing any mechanism for anyone other \nthan the manufacturer or the dealer to disable, alter, replace, or \nmodify the sound or set of sounds, except that the manufacturer or \ndealer may alter, replace, or modify the sound or set of sounds in \norder to remedy a defect or non-compliance with the motor vehicle \nsafety standard. The Secretary shall promulgate the required motor \nvehicle safety standard pursuant to this subsection not later than 36 \nmonths after the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Consideration.--When conducting the required rulemaking, the \nSecretary shall--\n        (1) determine the minimum level of sound emitted from a motor \n    vehicle that is necessary to provide blind and other pedestrians \n    with the information needed to reasonably detect a nearby electric \n    or hybrid vehicle operating at or below the cross-over speed, if \n    any;\n        (2) determine the performance requirements for an alert sound \n    that is recognizable to a pedestrian as a motor vehicle in \n    operation; and\n        (3) consider the overall community noise impact.\n    (c) Phase-in Required.--The motor vehicle safety standard \nprescribed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall establish a \nphase-in period for compliance, as determined by the Secretary, and \nshall require full compliance with the required motor vehicle safety \nstandard for motor vehicles manufactured on or after September 1st of \nthe calendar year that begins 3 years after the date on which the final \nrule is issued.\n    (d) Required Consultation.--When conducting the required study and \nrulemaking, the Secretary shall--\n        (1) consult with the Environmental Protection Agency to assure \n    that the motor vehicle safety standard is consistent with existing \n    noise requirements overseen by the Agency;\n        (2) consult consumer groups representing individuals who are \n    blind;\n        (3) consult with automobile manufacturers and professional \n    organizations representing them;\n        (4) consult technical standardization organizations responsible \n    for measurement methods such as the Society of Automotive \n    Engineers, the International Organization for Standardization, and \n    the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, World Forum for \n    Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations.\n    (e) Required Study and Report to Congress.--Not later than 48 \nmonths after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \ncomplete a study and report to Congress as to whether there exists a \nsafety need to apply the motor vehicle safety standard required by \nsubsection (a) to conventional motor vehicles. In the event that the \nSecretary determines there exists a safety need, the Secretary shall \ninitiate rulemaking under section 30111 of title 49, United States \nCode, to extend the standard to conventional motor vehicles.\n\nSEC. 4. FUNDING.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, $2,000,000 of any \namounts made available to the Secretary of Transportation under under \nsection 406 of title 23, United States Code, shall be made available to \nthe Administrator of the National Highway Transportation Safety \nAdministration for carrying out section 3 of this Act.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
