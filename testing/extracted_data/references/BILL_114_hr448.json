FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Access to safe, legal abortion services is essential to \n        women's health and central to women's ability to participate \n        equally in the economic and social life of the United States.\n            (2) Access to safe, legal abortion services has been \n        hindered in the United States in various ways, including \n        blockades of health care facilities and associated violence; \n        restrictions on insurance coverage; restrictions on minors' \n        ability to obtain services; and requirements and restrictions \n        that single out abortion providers and those seeking their \n        services, and which do not further women's health or the safety \n        of abortion, but harm women by reducing the availability of \n        services.\n            (3) In the early 1990s, protests and blockades at health \n        care facilities where abortions were performed, and associated \n        violence, increased dramatically and reached crisis level, \n        requiring Congressional action. Congress passed the Freedom of \n        Access to Clinic Entrances Act (Public Law 103-259) to address \n        that situation and ensure that women could physically access \n        abortion services.\n            (4) Since 2010, there has been an equally dramatic increase \n        in the number of laws and regulations singling out abortion \n        that threaten women's health and their ability to access safe \n        abortion services by interfering with health care \n        professionals' ability to provide such services. Congressional \n        action is now necessary to put an end to these restrictions. In \n        addition, there has been a dramatic increase in the passage of \n        laws that blatantly violate the constitutional protections \n        afforded women, such as bans on abortion prior to viability.\n            (5) Legal abortion is one of the safest medical procedures \n        in the United States. That safety is furthered by regulations \n        that are based on science and are generally applicable to the \n        medical profession or to medically comparable procedures.\n            (6) Many State and local governments are imposing \n        restrictions on the provision of abortion that are neither \n        science-based nor generally applicable to the medical \n        profession or to medically comparable procedures. Though \n        described by their proponents as health and safety regulations, \n        many of these abortion-specific restrictions do not advance the \n        safety of abortion services and do nothing to protect women's \n        health. Also, these restrictions interfere with women's \n        personal and private medical decisions, make access to abortion \n        more difficult and costly, and even make it impossible for some \n        women to obtain those services.\n            (7) These restrictions harm women's health by reducing \n        access not only to abortion services but also to the other \n        essential health care services offered by the providers \n        targeted by the restrictions, including contraceptive services, \n        which reduce unintended pregnancies and thus abortions, and \n        screenings for cervical cancer and sexually transmitted \n        infections. These harms fall especially heavily on low-income \n        women, women of color, and women living in rural and other \n        medically underserved areas.\n            (8) The cumulative effect of these numerous restrictions \n        has been widely varying access to abortion services such that a \n        woman's ability to exercise her constitutional rights is \n        dependent on the State in which she lives. Federal legislation \n        putting a stop to harmful restrictions throughout the United \n        States is necessary to ensure that women in all States have \n        access to safe abortion services, an essential constitutional \n        right repeatedly affirmed by the United States Supreme Court.\n            (9) Congress has the authority to protect women's ability \n        to access abortion services pursuant to its powers under the \n        Commerce Clause and its powers under section 5 of the \n        Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution to enforce the \n        provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to protect women's \nhealth by ensuring that abortion services will continue to be available \nand that abortion providers are not singled out for medically \nunwarranted restrictions that harm women by preventing them from \naccessing safe abortion services. It is not the purpose of this Act to \naddress all threats to access to abortion (for example, this Act does \nnot apply to clinic violence, restrictions on insurance or medical \nassistance coverage of abortion, or requirements for parental consent \nor notification before a minor may obtain an abortion) which Congress \nshould address through separate legislation as appropriate.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Abortion.--The term ``abortion'' means any medical \n        treatment, including the prescription of medication, intended \n        to cause the termination of a pregnancy except for the purpose \n        of increasing the probability of a live birth, to remove an \n        ectopic pregnancy, or to remove a dead fetus.\n            (2) Abortion provider.--The term ``abortion provider'' \n        means a health care professional who performs abortions.\n            (3) Government.--The term ``government'' includes a branch, \n        department, agency, instrumentality, or individual acting under \n        color of law of the United States, a State, or a subdivision of \n        a State.\n            (4) Health care professional.--The term ``health care \n        professional'' means a licensed medical professional (including \n        physicians, certified nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, and \n        physician assistants) who is competent to perform abortions \n        based on clinical training.\n            (5) Medically comparable procedures.--The term ``medically \n        comparable procedures'' means medical procedures that are \n        similar in terms of risk, complexity, duration, or the degree \n        of sterile precaution that is indicated.\n            (6) Pregnancy.--The term ``pregnancy'' refers to the period \n        of the human reproductive process beginning with the \n        implantation of a fertilized egg.\n            (7) State.--The term ``State'' includes each of the 50 \n        States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n        Rico, and each territory or possession of the United States.\n            (8) Viability.--the term ``viability'' means the point in a \n        pregnancy at which, in the good-faith medical judgment of the \n        treating health care professional, based on the particular \n        facts of the case before her or him, there is a reasonable \n        likelihood of sustained fetal survival outside the uterus with \n        or without artificial support.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITED MEASURES AND ACTIONS.\n\n    (a) General Prohibitions.--The following limitations or \nrequirements are unlawful and shall not be imposed or applied by any \ngovernment because they single out the provision of abortion services \nfor restrictions that are more burdensome than those restrictions \nimposed on medically comparable procedures, they do not significantly \nadvance women's health or the safety of abortion services, and they \nmake abortion services more difficult to access:\n            (1) A requirement that a medical professional perform \n        specific tests or medical procedures in connection with the \n        provision of an abortion, unless generally required for the \n        provision of medically comparable procedures.\n            (2) A requirement that the same clinician who performs a \n        patient's abortion also perform specified tests, services or \n        procedures prior, or subsequent, to the abortion.\n            (3) A limitation on an abortion provider's ability to \n        prescribe or dispense drugs based on current evidence-based \n        regimens or her or his good-faith medical judgment, other than \n        a limitation generally applicable to the medical profession.\n            (4) A limitation on an abortion provider's ability to \n        provide abortion services via telemedicine, other than a \n        limitation generally applicable to the provision of medical \n        services via telemedicine.\n            (5) A requirement or limitation concerning the physical \n        plant, equipment, staffing, or hospital transfer arrangements \n        of facilities where abortions are performed, or the credentials \n        or hospital privileges or status of personnel at such \n        facilities, that is not imposed on facilities or the personnel \n        of facilities where medically comparable procedures are \n        performed.\n            (6) A requirement that, prior to obtaining an abortion, a \n        patient make one or more medically unnecessary in-person visits \n        to the provider of abortion services or to any individual or \n        entity that does not provide abortion services.\n            (7) A requirement or limitation that prohibits or restricts \n        medical training for abortion procedures, other than a \n        requirement or limitation generally applicable to medical \n        training for medically comparable procedures.\n    (b) Other Prohibited Measures or Actions.--\n            (1) In general.--A measure or action directed at \n        restricting the provision of abortion services or the \n        facilities that provide abortion services that is similar to \n        any of the prohibited limitations or requirements described in \n        subsection (a) shall be unlawful if such measure or action \n        singles out abortion services or makes abortion services more \n        difficult to access and does not significantly advance women's \n        health or the safety of abortion services.\n            (2) Prima facie case.--To make a prima facie showing that a \n        measure or action is unlawful under paragraph (1) a plaintiff \n        shall demonstrate that the measure or action involved--\n                    (A) singles out the provision of abortion services \n                or facilities in which abortion services are performed; \n                or\n                    (B) impedes women's access to abortion services \n                based on one or more of the factors described in \n                paragraph (3).\n            (3) Factors.--Factors for a court to consider in \n        determining whether a measure or action impedes access to \n        abortion services for purposes of paragraph (2)(B) include the \n        following:\n                    (A) Whether the measure or action interferes with \n                an abortion provider's ability to provide care and \n                render services in accordance with her or his good-\n                faith medical judgment.\n                    (B) Whether the measure or action is reasonably \n                likely to delay some women in accessing abortion \n                services.\n                    (C) Whether the measure or action is reasonably \n                likely to directly or indirectly increase the cost of \n                providing abortion services or the cost for obtaining \n                abortion services (including costs associated with \n                travel, childcare, or time off work).\n                    (D) Whether the measure or action requires, or is \n                reasonably likely to have the effect of necessitating, \n                a trip to the offices of the abortion provider that \n                would not otherwise be required.\n                    (E) Whether the measure or action is reasonably \n                likely to result in a decrease in the availability of \n                abortion services in the State.\n                    (F) Whether the measure or action imposes criminal \n                or civil penalties that are not imposed on other health \n                care professionals for comparable conduct or failure to \n                act or that are harsher than penalties imposed on other \n                health care professionals for comparable conduct or \n                failure to act.\n                    (G) The cumulative impact of the measure or action \n                combined with other new or existing requirements or \n                restrictions.\n            (4) Defense.--A measure or action shall be unlawful under \n        this subsection upon making a prima facie case (as provided for \n        under paragraph (2)), unless the defendant establishes, by \n        clear and convincing evidence, that--\n                    (A) the measure or action significantly advances \n                the safety of abortion services or the health of women; \n                and\n                    (B) the safety of abortion services or the health \n                of women cannot be advanced by a less restrictive \n                alternative measure or action.\n    (c) Other Prohibitions.--The following restrictions on the \nperformance of abortion are unlawful and shall not be imposed or \napplied by any government:\n            (1) A prohibition or ban on abortion prior to fetal \n        viability.\n            (2) A prohibition on abortion after fetal viability when, \n        in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating physician, \n        continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant \n        woman's life or health.\n            (3) A restriction that limits a pregnant woman's ability to \n        obtain an immediate abortion when a health care professional \n        believes, based on her or his good-faith medical judgment, that \n        delay would pose a risk to the woman's health.\n            (4) A measure or action that prohibits or restricts a woman \n        from obtaining an abortion prior to fetal viability based on \n        her reasons or perceived reasons or that requires a woman to \n        state her reasons before obtaining an abortion prior to fetal \n        viability.\n    (d) Limitation.--The provisions of this Act shall not apply to laws \nregulating physical access to clinic entrances, requirements for \nparental consent or notification before a minor may obtain an abortion, \ninsurance coverage or medical assistance of abortion, or the procedure \ndescribed in section 1531(b)(1) of title 18, United States Code.\n    (e) Effective Date.--This Act shall apply to government \nrestrictions on the provision of abortion services, whether statutory \nor otherwise, whether they are enacted or imposed prior to or after the \ndate of enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.
