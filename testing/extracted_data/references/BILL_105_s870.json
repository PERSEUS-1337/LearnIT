SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medical \nTechnology, Public Health, and Innovation Act of 1997''.\n    (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \nexpressed in terms of an amendment to, or a repeal of, a section or \nother provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a \nsection or other provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(21 U.S.C. 321 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; MISSIONS STATEMENT.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) While the United States appropriately puts a top \n        priority on the regulation of medical technologies to ensure \n        the safety and efficacy of medical technologies that are \n        introduced into the marketplace, the administration of such \n        regulatory effort is causing the United States to lose its \n        leadership role in producing innovative, top-quality medical \n        devices.\n            (2) One of the key components of the medical device \n        regulatory process that contributes to the United States losing \n        its leadership role in medical device development is the \n        inordinate amount of time it takes for medical technologies to \n        be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration.\n            (3) The most important result of the United States losing \n        its leadership role is that patients in the United States do \n        not have access to new medical technology in a timely manner.\n            (4) Delayed patient access to new medical technology \n        results in lost opportunities to save lives, to reduce \n        hospitalization and recovery time, and to improve the quality \n        of life of patients.\n            (5) The economic benefits that the United States medical \n        device industry, which is composed principally of smaller \n        companies, has provided through growth in jobs and global trade \n        are threatened by the slow and unpredictable regulatory process \n        at the Food and Drug Administration.\n            (6) The pace and predictability of the medical device \n        regulatory process are in part responsible for the increasing \n        tendency of United States medical device companies to shift \n        research, product development, and manufacturing offshore, at \n        the expense of American jobs, patients, and leading edge \n        clinical research.\n    (b) Mission Statement.--This legislation seeks to improve the \ntimeliness, effectiveness, and predictability of the medical device \napproval process for the benefit of United States patients and the \nUnited States economy by--\n            (1) providing for the use of nationally and internationally \n        recognized performance standards to assist the Food and Drug \n        Administration in determining the safety and effectiveness of \n        medical devices;\n            (2) facilitating communication between medical device \n        companies and the Food and Drug Administration;\n            (3) targeting the use of Food and Drug Administration \n        resources on medical devices that are likely to have serious \n        adverse health consequences; and\n            (4) requiring the Food and Drug Administration to determine \n        the least costly, most efficient approach to reasonably \n        assuring the safety and effectiveness of devices.\n\nSEC. 3. DEVICE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.\n\n    (a) Alternative Procedure.--Section 514 (21 U.S.C. 360d) is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n\n                ``recognition of a performance standard\n\n    ``(c)(1)(A) The Secretary may, through publication in the Federal \nRegister, issue notices identifying and listing nationally and \ninternationally recognized performance standards for which persons may \nprovide a certification of a device's conformity under paragraph (3) in \norder to meet the premarket submission requirements or other \nrequirements under the Act to which the standards are applicable.\n    ``(B) Any person may elect to utilize data other than data required \nby the standards described in subparagraph (A) to meet any requirement \nunder the Act to which the standards are applicable.\n    ``(2) The Secretary may remove from the list of standards described \nin paragraph (1) a standard that the Secretary determines is no longer \nappropriate for making determinations with respect to the regulation of \ndevices.\n    ``(3)(A) A person may provide a certification that a device \nconforms to an applicable standard listed under paragraph (1) to meet \nthe requirements described in paragraph (1) and the Secretary shall \naccept such certification.\n    ``(B) The Secretary may, at any time, request a person who submits \na certification described in subparagraph (A) to submit the data or \ninformation that the person relied on in making the certification.\n    ``(C) A person who submits a certification described in \nsubparagraph (A) shall maintain the data and information upon which the \ncertification was made for a period of 2 years after the submission of \nthe certification or a time equal to the expected design life of a \ndevice, whichever is longer.''.\n    (b) Section 301.--Section 301 (21 U.S.C. 331) is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(x) The falsification of a certification submitted under section \n514(c)(3) or the failure or refusal to provide data or information \nrequested by the Secretary under such section.''.\n    (c) Section 501.--Section 501(e) (21 U.S.C. 351(e)) is amended by \nstriking ``established'' and inserting ``established or listed''.\n\nSEC. 4.
