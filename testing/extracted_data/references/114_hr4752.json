    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Space Exploration, Development, and \nSettlement Act of 2016''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) America's activities in space have challenged mankind \n        to travel beyond planet Earth and have provided us the \n        opportunity to expand human knowledge, to extend the limits of \n        human consciousness, and to improve the human condition;\n            (2) Section 217(a) of the National Aeronautics and Space \n        Administration Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 states, \n        ``The Congress declares that the extension of human life beyond \n        Earth's atmosphere, leading ultimately to the establishment of \n        space settlements, will fulfill the purposes of advancing \n        science, exploration, and development and will enhance the \n        general welfare.'';\n            (3) numerous independent commissions, chartered by Congress \n        or established by the President, have declared space \n        settlements as a long-range objective of the American space \n        program;\n            (4) exploring, developing, and settling new physical areas \n        are parts of our heritage and will most assuredly be parts of \n        our future;\n            (5) United States space policy requires long-range goals \n        and strategic direction in order to provide context for near-\n        term space projects and programs;\n            (6) increasing awareness of planetary-scale existential \n        risks to human civilization and the survival of the species \n        make it prudent to develop a means to diversify the human \n        population beyond Earth;\n            (7) the development of space will create new jobs, catalyze \n        new industries, accelerate innovation and new technologies, and \n        enable America to tap vast new resources that will generate new \n        wealth, enhance national security, and provide Americans with \n        new and limitless opportunities;\n            (8) the establishment of space settlements will inspire \n        generations of future Americans;\n            (9) the human settlement of space is fully consistent with \n        the policies and objectives articulated in the National \n        Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958; and\n            (10) the adoption of a ``pioneering'' orientation by the \n        National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an essential \n        step toward enabling the establishment of space settlements.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ACT.\n\n    (a) Declaration of Policy and Purpose.--Section 20102 of title 51, \nUnited States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (d) through (h) as \n        subsections (e) through (i), respectively;\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(d) Exploration, Development, and Settlement of Space.--The \nCongress declares that expanding permanent human presence beyond low-\nEarth orbit in a way that enables human settlement and a thriving space \neconomy will enhance the general welfare of the United States and \nrequires the Administration to encourage and support the development of \npermanent space settlements.'';\n            (3) in subsection (e), as so redesignated by paragraph (1) \n        of this subsection, by inserting after paragraph (9) the \n        following new paragraph:\n            ``(10) The expansion of permanent human presence beyond \n        low-Earth orbit in a way that enables human settlement and a \n        thriving space economy.''; and\n            (4) in subsection (i), as so redesignated by paragraph (1) \n        of this subsection, by striking ``to (g)'' and inserting in \n        lieu thereof ``to (h)''.\n    (b) Definitions.--Section 20103 of title 51, United States Code, is \namended--\n            (1) by inserting, in paragraph (1)(D), ``and development'' \n        after ``exploration''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(3) Space settlement.--The term `space settlement' means \n        any community of humans living beyond Earth's atmosphere that \n        is able to economically sustain its population through a \n        neutral or positive balance of trade of goods and services, and \n        is able to expand its habitable real estate as need and desire \n        of the community may warrant and international law permits.''.\n\nSEC. 4. SPACE SETTLEMENT ACTIVITIES.\n\n    (a) Space Development and Settlement Information.--Consistent with \nthe national security interests of the United States, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration shall, in close cooperation with \nother appropriate agencies, the private sector, academia, and the \ninternational community, obtain, produce, and provide information \nrelating to all issues important for the development of a thriving \nspace economy and the development and establishment of human space \nsettlements.\n    (b) Report.--Once every two years after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Administrator shall submit a report to the President, the \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of \nRepresentatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation of the Senate which describes the progress made toward \nexpanding permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit in a way that \nenables human settlement and a thriving space economy.\n    (c) Metrics.--The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \nshall, as part of its first report as required by subsection (b), \ninclude one or more metrics by which to determine progress made toward \nspace settlement against which all subsequent reports as required by \nsubsection (b) shall be compared. The metrics may be revised as \nappropriate over time to reflect emerging technological, economic, and \nother trends.\n\nSEC. 5. REVIEW OF NATIONAL SPACE POLICY AS IT MAY RELATE TO SPACE \n              SETTLEMENT AND A THRIVING SPACE ECONOMY.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the President should conduct a \nreview of national space policy to incorporate as a long-term goal of \nthe human spaceflight and exploration program to expand human presence \nbeyond low-Earth orbit in a way that will enable human settlement and a \nthriving space economy."
