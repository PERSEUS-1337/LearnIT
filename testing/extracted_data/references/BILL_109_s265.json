FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Federal Government and State governments have \n        established a history of cooperation in the development, \n        implementation, and monitoring of integrated, comprehensive \n        systems for the provision of emergency medical services.\n            (2) Trauma is the leading cause of death of Americans \n        between the ages of 1 and 44 years and is the third leading \n        cause of death in the general population of the United States.\n            (3) In 1995, the total direct and indirect cost of \n        traumatic injury in the United States was estimated at \n        $260,000,000,000.\n            (4) There are 40,000 fatalities and 5,000,000 nonfatal \n        injuries each year from motor vehicle-related trauma, resulting \n        in an aggregate annual cost of $230,000,000,000 in medical \n        expenses, insurance, lost wages, and property damage.\n            (5) Barriers to the receipt of prompt and appropriate \n        emergency medical services exist in many areas of the United \n        States.\n            (6) The number of deaths from trauma can be reduced by \n        improving the systems for the provision of emergency medical \n        services in the United States.\n            (7) Trauma care systems are an important part of the \n        emergency preparedness system needed for homeland defense.\n\nSEC. 3.
