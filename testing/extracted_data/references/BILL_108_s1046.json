SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Preservation of Localism, Program \nDiversity, and Competition in Television Broadcast Service Act of \n2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The principle of localism is embedded in the \n        Communications Act in section 307(b) of the Communications Act \n        of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 307(b)). It has been the pole star for \n        regulation of the broadcast industry by the Federal \n        Communications Commission for nearly 70 years.\n            (2) In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \n        directed the Federal Communications Commission to increase the \n        limitations on national multiple television ownership so that \n        one party could not own or control television stations whose \n        aggregate national audience reach exceeded 35 percent. Congress \n        did so because it recognized that--\n                    (A) further national concentration could not be \n                undone;\n                    (B) other regulatory changes, such as the repeal by \n                the Commission of its financial and syndication \n                regulations, would heighten the power of the national \n                television networks; and\n                    (C) the independence of non-network-owned stations \n                would be threatened if network ownership exceeded 35 \n                percent.\n            (3) If a limit to the national audience reach of television \n        stations that one party may own or control is not codified at \n        this time--\n                    (A) further national concentration may occur whose \n                pernicious effects may be difficult to eradicate; and\n                    (B) the independence of non-network-owned stations \n                will be threatened, placing local stations in danger of \n                becoming mere passive conduits for network \n                transmissions.\n            (4) A cap on national multiple television ownership will \n        help preserve localism by limiting the networks' ability to \n        dictate programming aired on local stations.\n            (5) The landscape of national ownership has changed \n        dramatically over the past two decades since the time when the \n        networks were limited to owning just seven television stations \n        nationwide:\n                    (A) the Commission's financial and syndication \n                regulations have been repealed;\n                    (B) the networks can own more than one television \n                station in many local markets;\n                    (C) the networks have embraced programming ventures \n                from studios to syndication to foreign sales; and\n                    (D) the networks own the most popular cable and \n                Internet content businesses.\n        Together these changes have strengthened the networks' hands \n        and given them strong incentives to override local interests.\n            (6) Unlike non-network-owned stations which are only \n        concerned with local viewers, network-owned stations have \n        multiple interests they must consider: national advertising \n        interests, syndicated programming interests, foreign sales \n        interests, cable programming interests, and, lastly, local \n        station interests.\n            (7) The possibility of further nationalization threatens \n        the current give-and-take between non-network-owned affiliates \n        and networks which can result in programming being edited, \n        scheduled, or promoted in ways that are more appropriate for \n        local audiences.\n            (8) As network power has grown in recent years, the \n        networks have forced affiliation agreements to tilt the balance \n        of power even more in their favor. Contract provisions encroach \n        on the ability of non-network-owned affiliates to reject \n        programming that local stations determine not to be in the best \n        interests of their local communities, and local stations are \n        penalized for unauthorized preemptions (as determined by the \n        network) and for exceeding preemption baskets.\n            (9) This Act will help to preserve localism in and to \n        prevent the further nationalization of the television broadcast \n        service.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to promote the values of localism in the television \n        broadcast service;\n            (2) to promote diversity of television programming and \n        viewpoints;\n            (3) to promote competition; and\n            (4) to prevent excessive concentration of ownership by \n        establishing a limit to the national audience reach of the \n        television stations that any one party may own or control.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL TELEVISION MULTIPLE OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS.\n\n    (a) Establishment of National Television Multiple Ownership \nLimitations.--Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 is \namended by inserting after section 339 (47 U.S.C. 339) the following \nnew section:\n\n``SEC. 340. NATIONAL TELEVISION MULTIPLE OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS.\n\n    ``(a) National Audience Reach Limitation.--The Commission shall not \npermit any license for a commercial television broadcast station to be \ngranted, transferred, or assigned to any party (including all parties \nunder common control) if the grant, transfer, or assignment of such \nlicense would result in such party or any of its stockholders, \npartners, or members, officers, or directors, directly or indirectly, \nowning, operating or controlling, or having a cognizable interest in \ntelevision stations which have an aggregate national audience reach \nexceeding 35 percent.\n    ``(b) No Grandfathering.--The Commission shall require any party \n(including all parties under common control) that holds licenses for \ncommercial television broadcast stations in excess of the limitation \ncontained in subsection (a) to divest itself of such licenses as may be \nnecessary to come into compliance with such limitation within one year \nafter the date of enactment of this section.\n    ``(c) Section Not Subject to Forbearance.--Section 10 of this Act \nshall not apply to the requirements of this section.\n    ``(d) Definitions.--\n            ``(1) National audience reach.--The term `national audience \n        reach' means--\n                    ``(A) the total number of television households in \n                the Nielsen Designated Market Area (DMA) markets in \n                which the relevant stations are located, or as \n                determined under a successor measure adopted by the \n                Commission to delineate television markets for purposes \n                of this section; divided by\n                    ``(B) the total national television households as \n                measured by such DMA data (or such successor measure) \n                at the time of a grant, transfer, or assignment of a \n                license.\n        No market shall be counted more than once in making this \n        calculation.\n            ``(2) Cognizable interest.--Except as may otherwise be \n        provided by regulation by the Commission, the term `cognizable \n        interest' means any partnership or direct ownership interest \n        and any voting stock interest amounting to 5 percent or more of \n        the outstanding voting stock of a licensee.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 202(c)(1) of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1934 (Public Law 104-104; 110 Stat. 111) is \namended--\n            (1) by striking ``its regulations'' and all that follows \n        through ``by eliminating'' and inserting ``its regulations (47 \n        C.F.R. 73.3555) by eliminating'';\n            (2) by striking ``; and'' at the end of subparagraph (A) \n        and inserting a period; and\n            (3) by striking subparagraph (B).\n\nSEC. 4. NO GRANDFATHERING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any provision that permits a party \nto exceed the caps on local radio ownership established by the Federal \nCommunications Commission in its media ownership proceeding, no party \nshall exceed those caps 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) In general.--Any term used in this section that is \n        defined in section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n        U.S.C. 153) has the meaning given that term in that section.\n            (2) Media ownership proceeding.--The term ``media ownership \n        proceeding'' means the Federal Communications Commission \n        proceeding on broadcast media ownership rules (MB Docket No. \n        02-277, MM Docket No. 01-235, MM Docket No. 01-317, and MM \n        Docket No. 00-244).\n\nSEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL INTENT WITH RESPECT TO OWNERSHIP \n              RULES REVIEW.\n\n    Section 202(h) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is amended to \nread as follows:\n    ``(h) Further Commission Review.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Commission shall review its rules \n        adopted pursuant to this section, and all of its ownership \n        rules biennially as part of its regulatory reform review under \n        section 11 of the Communications Act of 1934 and shall \n        determine whether--\n                    ``(A) any rule requires strengthening or \n                broadening;\n                    ``(B) any rule requires limiting or narrowing;\n                    ``(C) any rule should be repealed; or\n                    ``(D) any rule should be retained.\n            ``(2) Change, repeal, or retain.--The Commission shall \n        change, repeal, or retain such rules pursuant to its review \n        under paragraph (1) as it determines to be in the public \n        interest.''.\n\nSEC. 6. PUBLIC HEARING REQUIREMENT.\n\n    Section 202(h) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is amended by \nadding at the end ``Before making any determination under this \nsubsection concerning an ownership rule or regulation, the Commission \nshall hold no less than 5 public hearings in different areas of the \nUnited States with respect to that rule or regulation.''.\n\nSEC. 7. RESTORATION OF CROSS-OWNERSHIP RULES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The cross-media limits rule adopted by the Federal \nCommunications Commission on June 2, 2003 pursuant to its proceeding on \nbroadcast media ownership rules (MB Docket No. 02-277, MM Docket No. \n01-235, MM Docket No. 01-317, and MM Docket No. 00-244) is hereby \ndeclared null and void. The rules pertaining to broadcast-newspaper and \nradio-television cross-ownership in effect on June 1, 2003 are hereby \nreinstated as they were in effect on June 1, 2003, and shall be applied \nby the Commission retroactively to June 2, 2003.\n    (b) Rural State Exemption.--Notwithstanding anything to the \ncontrary under the Commission's broadcast-newspaper cross-ownership \nrules, in a small market with a Designated Market Area of 150 or \nhigher, the public utility commission of the State or States in which \nsuch market is located may recommend, on a case-by-case basis, that the \nCommission grant a waiver of such cross-ownership rules if the public \nutility commission finds that the proposed transaction for which the \nwaiver is required will enhance local news and information, promote the \nfinancial stability of a newspaper, radio station, or television \nstation, or otherwise promote the public interest. The Commission may \napprove such recommendation within 60 days after the Commission \nreceives it unless there is compelling evidence that the transaction to \nwhich the recommendation relates would be contrary to the public \ninterest. If the Commission grants the recommended waiver each \nnewspaper, radio station, and television station covered by the waiver \nshall maintain a separate editorial board and the editorial views of \neach of those boards shall be broadcast or printed, as the case may be, \nwhenever the editorial views of one of the other boards are broadcast \nor printed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       "
