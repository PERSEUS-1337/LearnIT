FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Free trade agreements improve the income and prosperity \n        of the citizens of participating countries because open markets \n        increase competition, eliminate inefficiencies, and result in \n        lower costs to manufacturers and consumers.\n            (2) The 21 member economies of APEC represent over half of \n        world production and almost half of global trade. In November \n        of 1994, leaders of members economies of APEC declared their \n        commitment to achieving ``free and open trade'' in the region \n        by the year 2020 in the case of developing countries and 2010 \n        in the case of developed countries.\n            (3) Continued economic growth through the creation of new \n        opportunities for trade and investment, and the economic and \n        political stability resulting from diminishing the proclivity \n        of governments to establish and maintain tariff and nontariff \n        trade barriers, is vital to the strategic and economic \n        interests of the United States in the Pacific Rim region.\n            (4) The financial crisis affecting Asia, and associated \n        macroeconomic factors, have resulted in a severe disruption of \n        the pattern of rapid United States export growth that was the \n        dominant pattern of United States trade with the region during \n        the years 1989-1997.\n            (5) At a difficult time in the world economy, which is \n        increasing pressures on countries to turn inward and adopt \n        protectionist policies, free trade agreement negotiations \n        provide additional leverage to achieve market opening measures \n        for United States goods and services.\n            (6) Many countries in the region, including New Zealand, \n        Australia, and Singapore, are long-time allies of the United \n        States in working to increase economic growth through trade \n        liberalization, both in the World Trade Organization and in \n        APEC.\n            (7) Building closer ties and coordinating with countries \n        whose interests are largely friendly to the United States will \n        have immense payoffs as the trade negotiations to achieve trade \n        liberalization described in paragraph (6) proceed early in the \n        next century.\n            (8) In particular, the United States must continue to \n        promote its interests in the Asia-Pacific region through an \n        aggressive short- and long-term trade and investment \n        negotiating agenda.\n            (9) Bilateral trade agreement negotiations have been shown \n        to exert constructive influence on multilateral and regional \n        trade negotiations. Typically, bilateral trade talks enlarge \n        common areas of agreement on trade disciplines that can then be \n        advanced more successfully in the context of a larger \n        negotiation, among additional trading partners.\n            (10) Trade and investment disputes between the United \n        States and Pacific Rim countries could be more effectively \n        resolved in the context of mutually agreed-upon disciplines and \n        dispute settlement mechanisms rather than issue-by-issue \n        confrontations under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 or \n        other trade remedy laws.\n            (11) By providing a firm foundation for enhanced \n        cooperation, free trade agreements between the United States \n        and Pacific Rim countries, whose economies are becoming \n        increasingly complementary and interdependent, will help ensure \n        mutually beneficial economic and political relations.\n            (12) Free trade agreements, by enhancing market access and \n        the understanding of United States firms with respect to \n        competing effectively in Pacific Rim markets, will thereby \n        assist in stabilizing the bilateral trade balance between the \n        United States and countries in the Pacific Rim.\n\nSEC. 2. UNITED STATES TRADE POLICY WITH ELIGIBLE PACIFIC RIM COUNTRIES.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States to seek the elimination \nof tariff and nontariff barriers and to achieve more open, equitable, \nand reciprocal market access through the negotiation of bilateral free \ntrade agreements with eligible Pacific Rim countries. These nontariff \nbarriers include--\n            (1) regulatory and other barriers that deny national \n        treatment and the right of establishment for trade in services;\n            (2) denial of national treatment to foreign direct \n        investment;\n            (3) lack of adequate protection for copyrights, patents, \n        trademarks, semiconductor chips, layout designs, trade secrets, \n        and other forms of intellectual property;\n            (4) arbitrary and discriminatory sanitary, phytosanitary, \n        or technical standards;\n            (5) government measures such as price controls, reference \n        pricing, and unreasonable restrictions on listings for \n        government-established formularies which deny full market \n        access for United States products; and\n            (6) unfair or trade-distorting activities of State trading \n        enterprises and other administrative mechanisms.\n\nSEC. 3. PRENEGOTIATION CONSULTATIONS.\n\n    (a) Preliminary Consultations.--Within 60 days after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, the President shall identify, and initiate \npreliminary consultations with the government of, each eligible Pacific \nRim country.\n    (b) Ministerial Meeting.--If preliminary consultations indicate \nthat the establishment of a free trade area between the United States \nand an eligible Pacific Rim country is potentially feasible and \ndesirable, the President shall, within 60 days after the preliminary \nconsultations are completed, request a meeting at the ministerial level \nwith the government of that country to consider the conditions under \nwhich formal negotiations regarding a free trade agreement could be \ncommenced.\n    (c) ITC Advice.--Within 6 months after the end of each ministerial \nmeeting held under subsection (b) with the government of an eligible \nPacific Rim country, the United States International Trade Commission \nshall advise the President regarding the probable economic effects of \nproviding duty-free treatment for such articles that are products of \nthat country on industries in the United States producing like or \ndirectly competitive articles and on consumers in the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. MINISTERIAL MEETING RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n    At each ministerial meeting convened pursuant to section 3(b), the \nPresident shall recommend the establishment of a council comprised of \nappropriate public and private sector officials from the respective \ncountries. The functions of the council are--\n            (1) to review and analyze the aspects of the existing \n        bilateral relationship as they relate to the negotiation of a \n        free trade agreement, including--\n                    (A) trade and investment practices and impediments;\n                    (B) differences in customs laws and procedures;\n                    (C) the harmonization of trade statistics and other \n                economic data; and\n                    (D) the status of bilateral disputes and exchange \n                of information on disputed practices; and\n            (2) within 6 months after its establishment, to issue a \n        report on the overall bilateral relationship and the prospects \n        for a successful negotiation of a free trade agreement that \n        addresses the possible benefits and adverse effects of \n        concluding a free trade agreement and examines the types of \n        dispute settlement mechanisms that would be appropriate to \n        effectively resolve bilateral trade problems.\n\nSEC. 5.
