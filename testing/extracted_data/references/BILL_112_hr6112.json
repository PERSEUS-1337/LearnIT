FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of Homeland Security estimates that \n        there were 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the United States \n        in 2011, a population with a traditionally high rate of labor \n        force participation. During this time, 13.7 million Americans \n        were unemployed.\n            (2) Pursuant to Executive Order 12989, as amended by \n        Executive Order 13465, contractors and subcontractors that do \n        business with the Federal Government must use the E-Verify \n        Program to verify that their employees are authorized to work \n        in the United States. Additionally, all Federal employees must \n        be screened through the E-Verify Program.\n            (3) The E-Verify Program is accurate, effective, and \n        currently in use by more than 350,000 employers. Ninety-eight \n        and three-tenths percent of employees are automatically \n        confirmed as work-authorized either instantly or within 24 \n        hours, requiring no employee or employer action.\n            (4) The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \n        Circuit decided in Chamber of Commerce v. Janet Napolitano that \n        entities that solicit and voluntarily enter into contracts or \n        agreements with the Federal Government can be subject to a \n        requirement for electronic verification of employment \n        eligibility.\n\nSEC. 3.
