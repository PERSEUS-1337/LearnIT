FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Despite the removal of the Taliban from power, women in \n        Afghanistan continue to experience brutal violation of their \n        human rights, generally outside of Kabul where warlords are \n        reexerting control.\n            (2) Strong and continued United States support can ensure \n        that the advances made by Afghan women since the fall of the \n        Taliban will continue and grow, rather than recede.\n            (3) The United States has made a substantial contribution \n        to the emergency relief and humanitarian efforts for \n        Afghanistan. Completing the United States mission in \n        Afghanistan will also require significant and long-term \n        investments in development and reconstruction assistance.\n            (4) The maternal mortality rate in Afghanistan is the \n        second highest in the world, with recent reports estimating \n        that every 30 minutes an Afghan woman dies of pregnancy related \n        causes, or approximately 15,000 women every year. The estimated \n        maternal mortality rate of 1,600 deaths per 100,000 live births \n        can be significantly reduced through access to primary health \n        care services, including safe birthing supplies, emergency \n        obstetric care, prenatal and postnatal care, contraception, and \n        prevention and treatment for the effects of sexual coercion and \n        rape.\n            (5) Women comprise 75 percent or more of the refugees and \n        internally displaced in camps, urban areas, and villages in \n        Afghanistan.\n            (6) 85 percent of Afghanistan's population lives in rural \n        areas. The women in rural areas perform vital roles in food \n        production, processing, and preparation. Successful \n        reconstruction and development assistance must target rural \n        women as part of any agricultural interventions.\n            (7) Within Afghanistan and outside of Afghanistan, local \n        women's organizations are delivering critical services and have \n        the knowledge and experience to assist the United States in \n        delivering effective relief aid.\n            (8) The Afghan Ministry for Women's Affairs is an important \n        ministry that is essential for re-establishing women's human \n        rights, ensuring that women are included in all development \n        efforts, and delivering critical legal, health, education, and \n        economic services to women throughout Afghanistan's 30 \n        provinces.\n            (9) Afghan women are taking the initiative to reach across \n        the conflict divide and foster peace. Women's perspectives and \n        experiences in seeking solutions to conflicts are necessary to \n        ensure lasting peace.\n            (10) Adequate security in both urban and rural areas is \n        essential if women and girls are to exercise their human \n        rights, work, attend school, and otherwise participate in and \n        benefit from humanitarian and development programs sponsored by \n        the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
