FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Affordable, comprehensive health insurance that \n        includes coverage for a full range of pregnancy-related care, \n        including abortion, is critical to the health of every woman.\n            (2) Neither a woman's income level nor her type of \n        insurance should prevent her from having access to a full range \n        of pregnancy-related care, including abortion services.\n            (3) No woman should have the decision to have, or not to \n        have, an abortion made for her based on her ability or \n        inability to afford the procedure.\n            (4) Since 1976, the Federal Government has withheld funds \n        for abortion coverage in most circumstances. As a 2017 analysis \n        by the Guttmacher Institute shows, this affects women of \n        reproductive age in the United States who are insured through \n        the Medicaid program, as well as women who receive insurance or \n        care through other Federal health plans and programs. Of women \n        aged 15-44 enrolled in Medicaid in 2015, 58 percent lived in \n        the 35 States and the District of Columbia that do not cover \n        abortion, except in limited circumstances. This amounts to \n        roughly 7.5 million women of reproductive age, including 3.5 \n        million women living below the Federal poverty level. Women of \n        color are disproportionately likely to be insured by the \n        Medicaid program: Nationwide, 31 percent of Black women and 27 \n        percent of Hispanic women aged 15-44 were enrolled in Medicaid \n        in 2015, compared with 15 percent of White women.\n            (5) Moreover, 25 States also prohibit abortion coverage in \n        private insurance plans within or beyond health insurance \n        marketplaces under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n        Act, according to an analysis of State policies by the \n        Guttmacher Institute.\n            (6) A report by the Center for Reproductive Rights details \n        how restrictions on abortion coverage interfere with a woman's \n        personal decisionmaking, with her health and well-being, and \n        with her constitutionally protected right to a safe and legal \n        medical procedure.\n            (7) Restrictions on abortion coverage have a \n        disproportionate impact on low-income women, women of color, \n        immigrant women, and young women, according to reports by both \n        the Center for American Progress and the Guttmacher Institute. \n        Also according to the reports, these women are already \n        disadvantaged in their access to the resources, information, \n        and services necessary to prevent an unintended pregnancy or to \n        carry a healthy pregnancy to term.\n\nSEC. 3. ABORTION COVERAGE AND CARE REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR SOURCE OF \n              INSURANCE.\n\n    (a) Ensuring Abortion Coverage and Care Through the Federal \nGovernment in Its Role as an Insurer, Employer, or Health Care \nProvider.--The Federal Government shall--\n            (1) ensure coverage for abortion care in public health \n        insurance programs including Medicaid, Medicare, and the \n        Children's Health Insurance Program;\n            (2) in its role as an employer or health plan sponsor, \n        ensure coverage for abortion care for participants and \n        beneficiaries; and\n            (3) in its role as a provider of health services, ensure \n        abortion care is made available to individuals who are eligible \n        to receive services in its own facilities or in facilities with \n        which it contracts to provide medical care.\n    (b) Prohibiting Restrictions on Private Insurance Coverage of \nAbortion Care.--\n            (1) Federal restrictions.--The Federal Government shall not \n        prohibit, restrict, or otherwise inhibit insurance coverage of \n        abortion care by State or local government or by private health \n        plans.\n            (2) State and local government restrictions.--State and \n        local governments shall not prohibit, restrict, or otherwise \n        inhibit insurance coverage of abortion care by private health \n        plans.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the Federal Government, acting in its capacity as an \n        insurer, employer, or health care provider, should serve as a \n        model for the Nation to ensure coverage of abortion care; and\n            (2) moreover, restrictions on coverage of abortion care in \n        the private insurance market must end.\n\nSEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to have any effect on any \nFederal, State, or local law that includes more protections for \nabortion coverage or care than those set forth in this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. SEVERABILITY.\n\n    If any portion of this Act or the application thereof to any person \nor circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the \nportions or applications of this Act which can be given effect without \nthe invalid portion or application."
