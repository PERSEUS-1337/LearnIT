TRIBAL FUNDING SHARES.\n\n    Title III of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance \nAct (25 U.S.C. 450f note) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \nfollowing new sections:\n    ``Sec. 311. (a) Unless directed otherwise by an express provision \nof law enacted after the date of the enactment of this section, the \nSecretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, as the case may be, shall make available, through \nnegotiations, a tribal share of all funds and resources requested by a \ntribe which are specifically or functionally related to the provision \nof services and benefits to the tribe or its members, including all \nfunds and resources available to the Department of the Interior or the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, as the case may be, to support \nthe provision of services and benefits to Indian tribes and Indian \nindividuals regardless of the organizational level where the affected \nSecretary would have otherwise spent the funds or provided the \nresources, and regardless of the origin of the funds or resources.\n    ``(b) Unless directed otherwise by an express provision of law \nspecific to a distribution or allocation enacted after the date of the \nenactment of this section, the Secretary of the Interior or the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, as the case may be, shall make \navailable, through negotiations, a tribal share of all funds and \nresources requested by a tribe which are available to Indian tribes or \nIndian individuals and which the affected Secretary could have \notherwise distributed or allocated by competitive procedure, formula, \npriority list, or other mechanism. Tribal shares of such funds shall be \ndetermined by the Secretary in a manner similar to that used with other \nfunds under this title.\n    ``(c) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services shall designate the Director of the Office of Self-\nGovernance, established pursuant to section 315 of this title, to be \nthe Federal negotiator for any agreement with each such Secretary, and \ndelegate to the Director authority to initial and execute any agreement \nauthorized under this title. The Director shall determine a specific \nFederal program residual and a tribe's tribal share after good faith \nconsideration of the positions of the tribe and the appropriate Federal \nagency. The Director shall cooperate with the negotiating tribe to \nprepare and initial the appropriate Federal agency's and the tribe's \npreliminary approval of a negotiated agreement in accordance with \nsection 315 of this title. Upon expiration of the appeal rights \nprovided in subsection (d), the Secretary shall execute the agreement, \nthe tribe shall execute the agreement on its own behalf, and the \nagreement shall be forwarded to Congress for review as provided in this \ntitle.\n    ``(d) The tribe or the affected Federal agency may appeal the \nDirector's determination of a specific Federal program residual or a \ntribe's tribal share by filing a written appeal to the appropriate \nSelf-Governance Policy Council within 10 days of the initialing of the \nagreement by the tribe and the Director. The Council shall render a \ndecision within 15 days of receipt of the appeal, after according the \nDirector, the tribe, and the affected Federal agency the opportunity to \nfile responses and make brief oral presentations to the Council. The \nDirector shall have no vote on appeal decisions of the Council. Appeal \ndecisions of the Council shall be final.\n    ``(e) Unless otherwise agreed to by a tribe in negotiations, a \ntribal share of a tribe shall be determined as follows:\n            ``(1) A residual amount for programs, activities, functions \n        and services directly related to the natural or financial trust \n        resources of a tribe or to the executive direction and \n        administrative services functions of the affected Federal \n        agency shall be determined and subtracted from the total funds \n        estimated to be available for the next fiscal year, which \n        estimate shall be based either upon the total in that agency's \n        budget request for that year or upon the total made available \n        by Congress for the appropriate year. The residual amount shall \n        be that amount which, if all Federal funds benefiting Indian \n        tribes and Indian individuals were administered by tribes under \n        agreements authorized by this title, would be necessary to \n        support an efficiently restructured Federal implementation of \n        the minimum core Federal activities specifically required by \n        law to be carried out by a Federal official.\n            ``(2) The tribal share of a tribe shall be determined in \n        negotiations using factors directly related to the budget \n        account, fund or program being allocated, and shall be \n        separately calculated at each administrative level of the \n        Federal agency using factors specific to that level. In lieu of \n        negotiating a tribal share of funds from the central office or \n        other national-scope administrative level of a Federal agency, \n        a tribe may elect to receive the sum of $45,000 per year.\n    ``(f) In preparing to negotiate a tribe's third and successive \nannual agreements under this title, the affected Secretary shall \npresent a base budget to the tribe as the minimum amount to be \nnegotiated. The base budget shall be calculated as the amount the tribe \nnegotiated in the prior year, plus pay cost adjustment increases \nrelated to employee costs identical to those applied to Federal \nemployees, and plus inflation increases on the remaining funds. The \naffected Secretary shall add to a tribe's base budget further increases \nand additions sought by the tribe in negotiations under the terms and \nconditions of this title.\n    ``Sec. 312. (a) Subject to the availability of funds, the affected \nSecretary shall ensure that the contract support costs associated with \na tribe's operation of its annual funding agreement with the Secretary \nare fully funded by the Secretary. Such costs shall be estimated at the \ntime of negotiation by multiplying the tribe's most recent indirect \ncost rate negotiated with the inspector general of the tribe's \ncognizant Federal agency times the total amount of funds included \nwithin the annual funding agreement regardless of the origin of the \nfunds and regardless of the purpose for which the funds are spent by \nthe tribe; except that contract support costs shall be separately \ncalculated for direct funds flowing through the tribe to an intertribal \norganization at the intertribal organization's negotiated indirect cost \nrate. The estimated contract support funds provided to a tribe shall be \nsubsequently adjusted to a final amount based upon the tribe's final \napproved indirect cost rate for that funding year. The total amount of \nfunds other than contract support included within an annual funding \nagreement shall be an agreement's direct funds base without exclusions.\n    ``(b) Upon request of the appropriate tribe, a minimum of 80 \npercent of the full amount of such tribe's estimated annual contract \nsupport cost funds shall be made available to it at the beginning of \nits funding year and the remainder made available either at the \nbeginning of the second half of its funding year or when the tribe's \nfinal indirect cost rate has been approved for that funding year, \nwhichever comes later.\n    ``(c) If a tribe's indirect cost rate negotiated with the inspector \ngeneral has not fluctuated more than 10 percent during the preceding \n36-month period, the affected Secretary shall, at the request of a \ntribe, negotiate a lump sum of contract support funds equal to the \ntribe's most recent indirect cost rate times the annual funding \nagreement's total direct funds base, which lump sum shall be added to \nthe agreement and shall remain part of the tribe's base budget in \nsuccessive years and be adjusted under the provisions of section \n311(f).\n    ``Sec. 313. (a) The provisions of section 106 of this Act (25 \nU.S.C. 450j(b)) shall apply to agreements under this title.\n    ``(b) The provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of section 102 of \nthis Act (25 U.S.C. 450f (c) and (d)) shall apply to agreements under \nthis title, and in all such cases, an Indian tribe and its employees \ncarrying out an agreement under this title shall be deemed to be part \nof the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior or \nthe Indian or Public Health Service in the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, as the case may be, while carrying out any such \nagreement and the tribe's employees (including those acting on behalf \nof the tribe as provided in section 2671 of title 28, United States \nCode) are deemed employees of the Bureau or Service while acting within \nthe scope of their employment in carrying out the agreement.\n    ``Sec. 314. (a) General Federal program rules, the Office of \nFederal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), and all Federal \nacquisition regulations promulgated pursuant to such Act, shall not \napply to agreements under this title, nor shall they apply to a tribe's \nactivities, including construction and a tribe's contracts or \nsubcontracts involving such activities, carried out with funds obtained \nfrom agreements under this title.\n    ``(b) The Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, as the case may be, shall, within 60 days after receipt \nof the request from an Indian tribe, approve the tribe's request to \nwaive the application of a Federal regulation to the tribe's carrying \nout of activities under an agreement unless, within 30 days of receipt \nof the request, the affected Secretary makes a specific waiver \ndeclination finding, based upon a clear and convincing evidence \nstandard, that--\n            ``(1) adequate protection of trust resources will not \n        otherwise be provided under the terms of the agreement; or\n            ``(2) specific language in the regulation sought to be \n        waived is expressly mandated by law.\n    ``(c) Unless specific language in the regulation sought to be \nwaived is expressly mandated by law, a tribe's request for waiver shall \nbe treated as approved unless declined under the procedures of the \nforegoing subsection (b). In declining a waiver request, the Secretary \nshall--\n            ``(1) immediately state all the Secretary's objections in \n        writing to the tribe;\n            ``(2) within 30 days provide assistance to the tribe to \n        revise its waiver request to overcome the stated objections; \n        and\n            ``(3) within 60 days provide the tribe with a hearing on \n        the record and the opportunity for appeal on the objections \n        raised under rules and regulations governing hearings and \n        appeals for self-determination contracts.\n    ``Sec. 315. (a) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services shall establish an Office of Self-Governance \nfor the appropriate department within the Office of the affected \nSecretary. The affected Secretary shall consult with all tribes with \nwhom the affected Secretary has an agreement authorized under this \ntitle before making personnel hiring decisions concerning the Office of \nSelf-Governance. The requirements of section 2 of Public Law 96-135 (25 \nU.S.C. 472a) shall apply to all positions within each Office of Self-\nGovernance, except that, notwithstanding any provision of the Indian \npreference laws, such laws shall not apply in the case of any personnel \naction respecting an applicant or employee not entitled to Indian \npreference if a majority of the tribes with whom the affected Secretary \nhas an agreement authorized under this title at the time the personnel \naction is initially implemented concur in writing with suspending the \napplication of such laws with respect to such personnel action.\n    ``(b) The Secretary of the Interior, with respect to the Department \nof the Interior, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with \nrespect to the Department of Health and Human Services, shall vest in \nthe Director all of the functions of the appropriate department with \nrespect to formulation and establishment of Federal policy and \nprocedure, and the supervision of Federal programs and expenditures of \nFederal funds supporting the Federal implementation of the self-\ngovernance demonstration project. The Secretary shall carry out such \nfunctions through the Director under the provisions of this title.\n    ``(c) The Secretary of the Interior, with respect to the Department \nof the Interior, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with \nrespect to the Department of Health and Human Services, shall establish \na Self-Governance Policy Council for each department, which shall meet \nin regularly scheduled monthly meetings to finally resolve departmental \npolicy and administrative issues during the demonstration project. The \nSelf-Governance Policy Council of the Department of the Interior shall \nbe chaired by the Director of the Office of Self-Governance, with \nadditional members including the Assistant Secretary for Indian \nAffairs, a representative of the Secretary of the Interior, the \nAssociate Solicitor for Indian Affairs, and 2 non-Federal members \nappointed by the Secretary of the Interior representing tribes with \nself-governance agreements with the Department of the Interior.
