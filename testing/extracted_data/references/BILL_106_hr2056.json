FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The people of Lebanon have a rich, proud, and honorable \n        history dating from biblical times to the present, and Lebanon \n        has been a free and democratic nation for much of its modern \n        history.\n            (2) Lebanon and the United States have enjoyed a history of \n        friendship and cooperation which has been witnessed by the \n        immigration of millions of Lebanese to the United States where \n        they and their descendants have contributed greatly to the \n        fabric of American life.\n            (3) Lebanon witnessed foreign incursions and occupations \n        during its 15-year civil war. Although that war ended in 1990, \n        non-Lebanese forces still control much of the country. These \n        forces include an Israeli force that controls a 9-mile wide \n        security zone in Lebanon contiguous with Israel's northern \n        border, and approximately 30,000 Syrian troops, several armed \n        Palestinian factions, and other terrorist groups that control \n        the remainder of the country.\n            (4) There is a crucial distinction between the presence of \n        Syrian and Israeli military forces in Lebanon. Israel exercises \n        no control over the Government of Lebanon and in 1998 offered \n        to withdraw unilaterally from the security zone in return for \n        security guarantees, whereas Syria has never recognized \n        Lebanon's independence, or exchanged ambassadors with Lebanon, \n        and effectively dictates the major policies and actions of the \n        Government of Lebanon.\n            (5) Various Lebanese factions signed a peace settlement in \n        Taif, Saudi Arabia, in 1989 as a step toward ending the civil \n        war. This accord provided for the phased redeployment and \n        withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon beginning in 1992.\n            (6) The Government of Syria has refused to carry out any \n        redeployment as envisioned by the Taif Accord. Syrian \n        domination over Lebanese politics and political leaders is at \n        the root of the Lebanese Government's failure to press Syria \n        for a withdrawal of Syria's occupying forces.\n            (7) In addition to its armed forces, Syria maintains a \n        massive intelligence service presence in Lebanon to enforce its \n        control over the Lebanese people.\n            (8) Syrian domination is so pervasive that Lebanon has \n        effectively become a Syrian satellite state. This relationship \n        with Syria does not reflect the will of the majority of the \n        Lebanese public. Moreover, Syria has sought to change Lebanon's \n        demographic balance by the population transfer of as many as \n        1,000,000 Syrian laborers to Lebanon.\n            (9) Syrian domination has prevented Lebanon from developing \n        direct contacts with Israel and participating in the \n        multilateral track of the Middle East peace process.\n            (10) Syrian domination has been associated with a \n        deterioration in Lebanon's human rights situation. Syria has \n        engineered Lebanese election results to its liking, Syrian \n        intelligence units have been implicated in the disappearance of \n        Lebanese citizens, and the Syrian-controlled Lebanese \n        Parliament has imposed curbs on Lebanon's media, once the \n        freest in the Arab world.\n            (11) Syrian domination has failed to curtail international \n        narcotics traffickers or terrorist groups, including Hizballah \n        and the Kurdish Workers Party, that operate in Lebanon under \n        Syrian control.\n            (12) Syrian domination has prevented the Lebanese Army from \n        entering southern Lebanon to restore order and stability in \n        that region. Consequently, southern Lebanon has been a staging \n        area for military provocations against Israel by terrorist \n        groups supported by Syria and Iran.\n            (13) The United States Congress is concerned about the \n        potential for a miscalculation between Israel and Syria that \n        could inadvertently lead to large-scale hostilities, especially \n        in southern Lebanon. In this regard the Congress views with \n        grave concern Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass \n        destruction, especially chemical and biological weapons and \n        missile delivery systems. Syrian surface-to-surface missiles \n        can reach major urban centers in Israel, Turkey, and Jordan.\n            (14) The United States Congress has expressed itself \n        repeatedly in resolutions that insist that Syria make good on \n        its commitments to withdraw its military and security forces \n        from Lebanon.\n            (15) It is not in the interest of the United States that \n        freedom and democracy depart irreversibly from Lebanon. Lebanon \n        has a constructive role to play in the search for Middle East \n        peace. It can only do so when it is free, sovereign, and \n        governed by a truly representative government.\n            (16) The withdrawal of Syrian and other foreign forces from \n        Lebanon would not only promote regional stability, but also \n        would create the necessary conditions for the restoration of \n        Lebanon's independence, freedom, and democracy. Truly free \n        elections are not possible with the presence of foreign \n        military and security forces and terrorist groups in Lebanon.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    The Congress calls for the following:\n            (1) A complete, immediate, and unconditional withdrawal of \n        all Syrian military, intelligence, and security forces and \n        their proxies and all Palestinian and other terrorist forces \n        from Lebanon, to be followed by the eventual withdrawal of \n        Israeli forces.\n            (2) Following the withdrawals described in paragraph (1) \n        and restoration of a freely elected, democratic government in \n        Lebanon, the deployment of the Lebanese Army to southern \n        Lebanon to restore order and stability in that region, and for \n        disbanding all armed groups in Lebanon with the exception of \n        the legitimate national armed forces.\n            (3) At the same time as the deployment described in \n        paragraph (2), the assurance by the Government of Lebanon for \n        the safety and well-being of all members of the South Lebanon \n        Army (SLA) and their families.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS RELATING TO FUTURE PEACE AGREEMENT \n              BETWEEN SYRIA AND ISRAEL.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the United States should not \nratify or in any other way affirm, support, recognize, or participate \nin any peace agreement between Syria and Israel that does not provide \nfor the full and verifiable withdrawal of Syrian military, \nintelligence, and security forces and their proxies from Lebanon.\n\nSEC. 5.
