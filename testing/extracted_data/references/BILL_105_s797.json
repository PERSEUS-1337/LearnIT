Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts', numbered 844/82563a \nand dated May 22, 1997)''.\n\nSEC. 5. CONSTRUCTION OF A CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has an enriched legacy of Hispanic \n        influence in politics, government, economic development, and \n        cultural expression.\n            (2) The Hispanic culture in what is now the United States \n        can be traced to 1528 when a Spanish expedition from Cuba to \n        Florida was shipwrecked on the Texas coast.\n            (3) The Hispanic culture in New Mexico can be traced to \n        1539 when a Spanish Franciscan Friar, Marcos de Niza, and his \n        guide, Estevanico, traveled into present day New Mexico in \n        search of the fabled city of Cibola and made contact with the \n        people of Zuni.\n            (4) The Hispanic influence in New Mexico is particularly \n        dominant and a part of daily living for all the citizens of New \n        Mexico, who are a diverse composite of racial, ethnic, and \n        cultural peoples. Don Juan de Oarte and the first New Mexican \n        families established the first capital in the United States, \n        San Juan de los Cabelleros, in July of 1598.\n            (5) Based on the 1990 census, there are approximately \n        650,000 Hispanics in New Mexico, the majority having roots \n        reaching back ten or more generations.\n            (6) There are an additional 200,000 Hispanics living \n        outside of New Mexico with roots in New Mexico.\n            (7) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center is a living \n        tribute to the Hispanic experience and will provide all \n        citizens of New Mexico, the Southwestern United States, the \n        entire United States, and around the world, an opportunity to \n        learn about, partake in, and enjoy the unique Hispanic culture, \n        and the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will assure that \n        this 400-year old culture is preserved.\n            (8) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will teach, \n        showcase, and share all facets of Hispanic culture, including \n        literature, performing arts, visual arts, culinary arts, and \n        language arts.\n            (9) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will promote a \n        better cross-cultural understanding of the Hispanic culture and \n        the contributions of individuals to the society in which we all \n        live.\n            (10) In 1993, the legislature and Governor of New Mexico \n        created the Hispanic Cultural Division as a division within the \n        Office of Cultural Affairs. One of the principal \n        responsibilities of the Hispanic Cultural Division is to \n        oversee the planning, construction, and operation of the New \n        Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center.\n            (11) The mission of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n        is to create a greater appreciation and understanding of \n        Hispanic culture.\n            (12) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will serve as \n        a local, regional, national, and international site for the \n        study and advancement of Hispanic culture, expressing both the \n        rich history and the forward-looking aspirations of Hispanics \n        throughout the world.\n            (13) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will be a \n        Hispanic arts and humanities showcase to display the works of \n        national and international artists, and to provide a venue for \n        educators, scholars, artists, children, elders, and the general \n        public.\n            (14) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will provide a \n        venue for presenting the historic and contemporary \n        representations and achievements of the Hispanic culture.\n            (15) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will sponsor \n        arts and humanities programs, including programs related to \n        visual arts of all forms (including drama, dance, and \n        traditional and contemporary music), research, literary arts, \n        genealogy, oral history, publications, and special events such \n        as, fiestas, culinary arts demonstrations, film video \n        productions, storytelling presentations and education programs.\n            (16) Phase I of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n        complex is scheduled to be completed by August of 1998 and is \n        planned to consist of an art gallery with exhibition space and \n        a museum, administrative offices, a restaurant, a ballroom, a \n        gift shop, an amphitheater, a research and literary arts \n        center, and other components.\n            (17) Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n        complex is planned to include a performing arts center \n        (containing a 700-seat theater, a stage house, and a 300-seat \n        film/video theater), a 150-seat black box theater, an art \n        studio building, a culinary arts building, and a research and \n        literary arts building.\n            (18) It is appropriate for the Federal Government to share \n        in the cost of constructing the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n        Center because Congress recognizes that the New Mexico Hispanic \n        Cultural Center has the potential to be a premier facility for \n        performing arts and a national repository for Hispanic arts and \n        culture.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Center.--The term ``Center'' means the Center for \n        Performing Arts, within the complex known as the New Mexico \n        Hispanic Cultural Center, which Center for the Performing Arts \n        is a central facility in Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic \n        Cultural Center complex.\n            (2) Hispanic cultural division.--The term ``Hispanic \n        Cultural Division'' means the Hispanic Cultural Division of the \n        Office of Cultural Affairs of the State of New Mexico.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior.\n    (c) Construction of Center.--The Secretary shall award a grant to \nNew Mexico to pay for the Federal share of the costs of the design, \nconstruction, furnishing, and equipping of the Center for Performing \nArts that will be located at a site to be determined by the Hispanic \nCultural Division, within the complex known as the New Mexico Hispanic \nCultural Center.\n    (d) Grant Requirements.--\n            (1) In general.--In order to receive a grant awarded under \n        subsection (c), New Mexico, acting through the Director of the \n        Hispanic Cultural Division--\n                    (A) shall submit to the Secretary, within 30 days \n                of the date of enactment of this section, a copy of the \n                New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center Program document \n                dated January 1996; and\n                    (B) shall exercise due diligence to expeditiously \n                execute, in a period not to exceed 90 days after the \n                date of enactment of this section, the memorandum of \n                understanding under paragraph (2) recognizing that time \n                is of the essence for the construction of the Center \n                because 1998 marks the 400th anniversary of the first \n                permanent Spanish settlement in New Mexico.\n            (2) Memorandum of understanding.--The memorandum of \n        understanding described in paragraph (1) shall provide--\n                    (A) the date of completion of the construction of \n                the Center;\n                    (B) that Antoine Predock, an internationally \n                recognized architect, shall be the supervising \n                architect for the construction of the Center;\n                    (C) that the Director of the Hispanic Cultural \n                Division shall award the contract for architectural \n                engineering and design services in accordance with the \n                New Mexico Procurement Code;
