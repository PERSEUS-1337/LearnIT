FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) mobile device theft costs consumers $30,000,000,000 \n        each year, according to the Federal Communications Commission;\n            (2) 1 in 3 robberies include the theft of a mobile device;\n            (3) carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, and the \n        Federal Communications Commission have worked to address the \n        growing trend of mobile device theft, but more remains to be \n        done;\n            (4) consumers deserve to have the most secure technology \n        available to protect them and their information;\n            (5) technological protections continue to develop, evolve, \n        and improve in ways that are good for the economy and the \n        consumers of the United States, and for public safety in the \n        United States;\n            (6) the wireless industry should work with law enforcement \n        to educate consumers about the security tools that are \n        available to them and how to keep their data, their devices, \n        and themselves safe; and\n            (7) because engineering and security needs change rapidly, \n        the mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer \n        advocates are best suited to proactively develop solutions to \n        protect consumers, drive innovation, and deter theft.\n\nSEC. 3.
