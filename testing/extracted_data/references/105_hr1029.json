Coordination with State law.\nSec. 8. Enforcement.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) property and casualty insurers annually collect \n        information pertaining to the claims filed by millions of \n        policyholders and other individuals;\n            (2) this information is generally provided to industry \n        organizations for the purpose of assisting insurers to quickly \n        pay a claim or, alternatively, to determine whether a pattern \n        of claim filings exists that warrants further investigation;\n            (3) there is a legitimate need for insurers to pool claims \n        information among themselves and to work with law enforcement \n        agencies in order to assure the integrity of the claims \n        decisionmaking process;\n            (4) while the insurance industry has historically taken \n        strong and effective measures to prevent the improper \n        disclosure of personal claims information to law enforcement \n        agencies, it is now preparing to eliminate those protections \n        and provide individual claims information on innocent \n        individuals, as well as their doctors and lawyers, to law \n        enforcement agencies;\n            (5) although insurance is generally regulated by the \n        individual States pursuant to the Act of March 9, 1945 \n        (referred to as the ``McCarran-Ferguson Act''), and despite the \n        fact that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \n        has proposed model privacy legislation which has been adopted \n        in certain States and addresses the provision of individual \n        information to law enforcement agencies, the Association's \n        model legislation has not been enacted in most of the States \n        and has not prevented the insurance industry from proceeding \n        with its current plans;\n            (6) the unfettered disclosure of personal claims \n        information by insurers to law enforcement agencies on innocent \n        individuals violates fundamental principles of individual \n        privacy and may result in intimidating individuals in \n        exercising their rights to file claims; and\n            (7) in the absence of effective State regulation, a uniform \n        rule, established through congressional enactment, is the only \n        method for assuring the protection of personal privacy rights.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect the personal privacy rights of insurance \n        customers and claimants by making certain that property and \n        casualty insurers do not improperly provide personal \n        information about innocent insurance claimants to law \n        enforcement agencies;\n            (2) to establish clear rules for separating the operation \n        of an insurance crime bureau from the operation of an insurance \n        data support organization in order to prevent the inappropriate \n        use of insurance claims information; and\n            (3) to establish strong and effective remedies for \n        violations of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
