    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that pilot projects are demonstrating that schools have significantly lower special education costs when schools partner with county-funded Medi-Cal mental health services providers to address the mental health problems of pupils in a comprehensive multitiered model that includes services for pupils at the earliest time, usually years before they would require special education, which can often be prevented. Thus, the Legislature encourages the partnerships authorized by this act to, whenever possible, look for opportunities and funding to provide pupils who do not have individualized education programs, but are in need of, and could benefit from, prevention and early intervention services, with those services. The Legislature further encourages the State Department of Education and the State Department of Health Care Services to work toward the development of protocols to identify students who are Medi-Cal beneficiaries receiving educationally related mental health services as part of an individual educational plan for the purposes of data tracking.\nSEC. 2.\nPart 6 (commencing with Section 5920) is added to Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:\nPART 6.
