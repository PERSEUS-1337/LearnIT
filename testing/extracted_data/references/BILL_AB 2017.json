    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Students, faculty, health practitioners, and college administrators are reporting increased rates of mental health needs by students attending public colleges in California.\n(b) One in four students has a diagnosable mental illness and 40 percent of students do not seek mental health services when they need it.\n(c) Eight out of 10 people who experience psychosis have their first episode between 15 and 30 years of age.\n(d) The demand for mental health services by public college students far outpaces the ability of colleges to provide them. California public college campuses and higher education systems do not meet national staffing standards for psychiatric services and other mental health professionals.\n(e) The lack of services directly impacts college students\u2019 success and academic performance as well as their ability to develop socially as productive members of society.\n(f) The effects of untreated mental health needs are long lasting and can include college students dropping out of school, experiencing homelessness, and dying of suicide.\n(g) One in 10 college students has considered suicide and suicide is the second leading cause of death among college students, claiming more than 1,100 lives every year nationally.\n(h) Research shows that for each dollar invested in student prevention and early intervention mental health services, California will see a return of at least $6 and up to $11 as a result of more students graduating.\n(i) Under the Prevention and Early Intervention component of the Mental Health Services Act, subdivision (b) of Section 3706 of Title 9 of the California Code of Regulations states that at least 51 percent of the Prevention and Early Intervention Fund shall be used to serve individuals who are 25 years old or younger.\n(j) Since the approval of the Mental Health Services Act in 2004, there has been limited interaction between college campuses and county mental health departments.
