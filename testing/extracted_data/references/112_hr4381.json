    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Planning for American Energy Act of \n2012''.\n\nSEC. 2. ONSHORE DOMESTIC ENERGY PRODUCTION STRATEGIC PLAN.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) is \namended by redesignating section 44 as section 45, and by inserting \nafter section 43 the following:\n\n``SEC. 44. QUADRENNIAL STRATEGIC FEDERAL ONSHORE ENERGY PRODUCTION \n              STRATEGY.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--\n            ``(1) The Secretary of the Interior (hereafter in this \n        section referred to as `Secretary'), in consultation with the \n        Secretary of Agriculture with regard to lands administered by \n        the Forest Service, shall develop and publish every 4 years a \n        Quadrennial Federal Onshore Energy Production Strategy. This \n        Strategy shall direct Federal land energy development and \n        department resource allocation in order to promote the energy \n        security of the United States.\n            ``(2) In developing this Strategy, the Secretary shall \n        consult with the Administrator of the Energy Information \n        Administration on the projected energy demands of the United \n        States for the next 30-year period, and how energy derived from \n        Federal onshore lands can put the United States on a trajectory \n        to meet that demand during the next 4-year period. The \n        Secretary shall consider how Federal lands will contribute to \n        ensuring national energy security, with a goal for increasing \n        energy independence and production, during the next 4-year \n        period.\n            ``(3) The Secretary shall determine a domestic strategic \n        production objective for the development of energy resources \n        from Federal onshore lands. Such objective shall be--\n                    ``(A) the best estimate, based upon commercial and \n                scientific data, of the expected increase in domestic \n                production of oil and natural gas from the Federal \n                onshore mineral estate, with a focus on lands held by \n                the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service;\n                    ``(B) the best estimate, based upon commercial and \n                scientific data, of the expected increase in domestic \n                coal production from Federal lands;\n                    ``(C) the best estimate, based upon commercial and \n                scientific data, of the expected increase in domestic \n                production of strategic and critical energy minerals \n                from the Federal onshore mineral estate;\n                    ``(D) the best estimate, based upon commercial and \n                scientific data, of the expected increase in megawatts \n                for electricity production from each of the following \n                sources: wind, solar, biomass, hydropower, and \n                geothermal energy produced on Federal lands \n                administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the \n                Forest Service;\n                    ``(E) the best estimate, based upon commercial and \n                scientific data, of the expected increase in \n                unconventional energy production, such as oil shale; \n                and\n                    ``(F) the best estimate, based upon commercial and \n                scientific data, of the expected increase in domestic \n                production of oil, natural gas, coal, and other \n                renewable sources from tribal lands for any federally \n                recognized Indian tribe that elects to participate in \n                facilitating energy production on its lands.\n            ``(4) The Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of \n        the Energy Information Administration regarding the methodology \n        used to arrive at its estimates for purposes of this section.\n            ``(5) The Secretary has the authority to expand the energy \n        development plan to include other energy production technology \n        sources or advancements in energy on Federal lands.\n    ``(b) Tribal Objectives.--It is the sense of Congress that \nfederally recognized Indian tribes may elect to set their own \nproduction objectives as part of the Strategy under this section. The \nSecretary shall work in cooperation with any federally recognized \nIndian tribe that elects to participate in achieving its own strategic \nenergy objectives designated under this subsection.\n    ``(c) Execution of the Strategy.--The relevant Secretary shall have \nall necessary authority to make determinations regarding which \nadditional lands will be made available in order to meet the production \nobjectives established by strategies under this section. The Secretary \nshall also take all necessary actions to achieve these production \nobjectives unless the President determines that it is not in the \nnational security and economic interests of the United States to \nincrease Federal domestic energy production and to further decrease \ndependence upon foreign sources of energy. In administering this \nsection, the relevant Secretary shall only consider leasing Federal \nlands available for leasing at the time the lease sale occurs.\n    ``(d) State, Federally Recognized Indian Tribes, Local Government, \nand Public Input.--In developing each strategy, the Secretary shall \nsolicit the input of affected States, federally recognized Indian \ntribes, local governments, and the public.\n    ``(e) Reporting.--The Secretary shall report annually to the \nCommittee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate on the progress \nof meeting the production goals set forth in the strategy. The \nSecretary shall identify in the report projections for production and \ncapacity installations and any problems with leasing, permitting, \nsiting, or production that will prevent meeting the goal. In addition, \nthe Secretary shall make suggestions to help meet any shortfalls in \nmeeting the production goals.\n    ``(f) Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement.--Not later than \n12 months after the date of enactment of this section, in accordance \nwith section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)), the Secretary shall complete a programmatic \nenvironmental impact statement. This programmatic environmental impact \nstatement will be deemed sufficient to comply with all requirements \nunder that Act for all necessary resource management and land use plans \nassociated with the implementation of the strategy.\n    ``(g) Congressional Review.--At least 60 days prior to publishing a \nproposed strategy under this section, the Secretary shall submit it to \nthe President and the Congress, together with any comments received \nfrom States, federally recognized Indian tribes, and local governments. \nSuch submission shall indicate why any specific recommendation of a \nState, federally recognized Indian tribe, or local government was not \naccepted.''.\n    (b) First Quadrennial Strategy.--Not later than 18 months after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall \nsubmit to Congress the first Quadrennial Federal Onshore Energy \nProduction Strategy under the amendment made by subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act, the term ``strategic and critical energy \nminerals'' means those that are necessary for the Nation's energy \ninfrastructure including pipelines, refining capacity, electrical power \ngeneration and transmission, and renewable energy production and those \nthat are necessary to support domestic manufacturing, including but not \nlimited to, materials used in energy generation, production, and \ntransportation.\n                                                 "
