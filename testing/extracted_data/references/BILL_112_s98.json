FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) President Barack Obama launched the National Export \n        Initiative under Executive Order 13534 (75 Fed. Reg. 12433), an \n        ambitious plan to double exports within 5 years and boost the \n        dominant goods, agriculture, and services sectors of the United \n        States by leveraging the power of global markets to create more \n        jobs in the United States.\n            (2) The United States leads all other countries with \n        respect to the exportation of goods and services, with total \n        exports valued at almost $1,600,000,000,000 in 2009.\n            (3) Exports of goods and services from the United States \n        supported more than 10,000,000 jobs in 2008.\n            (4) United States exports exceeded 12 percent of the gross \n        domestic product in the first half of 2010.\n            (5) Ninety-five percent of the world population lives \n        outside the United States, and it is essential that businesses \n        based in the United States have the ability to access global \n        customers on a level playing field.\n            (6) Exports from the United States face barriers at every \n        turn and a recent study found that exports from 120 other \n        countries face fewer barriers than exports from the United \n        States, effectively making goods manufactured in the United \n        States, corn, hogs, and soybeans raised in the United States, \n        and services based in the United States more expensive than \n        comparable exports from other countries.\n            (7) Ninety percent of products imported into the United \n        States from Colombia and Panama enter the United States duty-\n        free, while the 10,000 United States businesses, 85 percent of \n        which are small- or medium-sized businesses, that export to \n        those markets face high tariffs.\n            (8) The Office of the United States Trade Representative \n        estimates that the pending United States-Korea Free Trade \n        Agreement will increase annual exports of goods from the United \n        States by up to $11,000,000,000, support at least 70,000 jobs \n        in the United States, and allow providers of services based in \n        the United States to compete in the services market of South \n        Korea, which is valued at more than $500,000,000,000.\n            (9) The European Union, whose companies compete head-to-\n        head with United States employers globally, has completed free \n        trade negotiations with Colombia, South Korea, and Panama, and \n        delay in the implementation of the free trade agreements \n        between those countries and the United States will result in a \n        loss in the competitiveness of exports from United States in \n        those markets when those countries' agreements with the \n        European Union go into effect.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the President should continue the National Export \n        Initiative to increase global export and investment \n        opportunities for the businesses that create jobs in the United \n        States; and\n            (2) the President should submit the United States-Korea \n        Free Trade Agreement, the United States-Colombia Trade \n        Promotion Agreement, and the United States-Panama Trade \n        Promotion Agreement to Congress, and Congress should approve \n        those agreements, to create jobs in the United States and \n        stimulate the economy by eliminating the barriers to trade \n        faced by United States exports that result in the loss of jobs \n        in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
