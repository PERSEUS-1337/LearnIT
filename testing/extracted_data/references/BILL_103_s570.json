FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) a ubiquitous high quality public switched network will \n        promote--\n                    (A) universal service at reasonable rates;\n                    (B) the universal availability of advanced public \n                switched network capabilities and information services;\n                    (C) the public health, safety, national defense, \n                education and security and emergency preparedness;\n                    (D) the economic development and quality of life by \n                bringing access to advanced public switched network \n                capabilities to the American people regardless of their \n                location;\n                    (E) new services and motivate new service providers \n                by providing uniform accessibility and \n                interoperability;\n                    (F) the international competitiveness of American \n                industry; and\n                    (G) a seamless, nationwide, coordinated and state-\n                of-the-art public switched network that will enhance \n                the quality of life for all Americans;\n            (2) the increasing technological complexity and need for \n        ubiquitous infrastructure capability and interoperability of \n        the public switched network requires--\n                    (A) sharing of the public switched network \n                infrastructure and functionality between and among \n                local exchange carriers;\n                    (B) joint coordinated network planning, design and \n                cooperative implementation among all local exchange \n                carriers; and\n                    (C) development of standards for interconnection \n                between the local exchange carrier public switched \n                network and others by appropriate standards-setting \n                bodies;\n            (3) the access services provided by the local exchange \n        carrier public switched network to competitive carriers, \n        information service providers and others, tie these diverse \n        elements into an interoperable national telecommunications \n        network;\n            (4) a ubiquitous, advanced local exchange carrier public \n        switched network enhances the function and availability of \n        services provided by all carriers and all other persons \n        accessing the local exchange carrier public switched network; \n        and\n            (5) it is in the public interest to promote development of \n        the public switched network by local exchange carriers because \n        they--\n                    (A) have universal service obligations for \n                geographically specific serving areas for which they \n                must construct a ubiquitous infrastructure;\n                    (B) provide public switched network services that \n                are subject to regulation with respect to rates, terms \n                and conditions;\n                    (C) must provide network access to their own \n                competitors on nondiscriminatory rates, terms and \n                conditions; and\n                    (D) are suppliers of last resort to customers in \n                their serving areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
