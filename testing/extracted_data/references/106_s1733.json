    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Benefit Transfer \nInteroperability and Portability Act of 2000''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n        (1) to protect the integrity of the food stamp program;\n        (2) to ensure cost-effective portability of food stamp benefits \n    across State borders without imposing additional administrative \n    expenses for special equipment to address problems relating to the \n    portability;\n        (3) to enhance the flow of interstate commerce involving \n    electronic transactions involving food stamp benefits under a \n    uniform national standard of interoperability and portability; and\n        (4) to eliminate the inefficiencies resulting from a patchwork \n    of State-administered systems and regulations established to carry \n    out the food stamp program.\nSEC. 3.
