STEM FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Director of the National Science Foundation \nshall establish a program to provide grants on a merit-reviewed, \ncompetitive basis for research on programming that engages \nunderrepresented students in grades kindergarten through 8 in STEM in \norder to prepare these groups to pursue undergraduate and graduate \ndegrees or careers in STEM.\n    (b) Use of Funds.--\n            (1) In general.--Grants awarded under this section shall be \n        used toward research to advance the engagement of \n        underrepresented students grades kindergarten through 8 in STEM \n        through providing before-school, after-school, out-of-school, \n        or summer activities, including programs (if applicable to the \n        target population) provided in a single-gender environment, \n        that are designed to encourage interest, engagement, and skills \n        development of underrepresented students in STEM. Such research \n        shall be conducted in learning environments that actively \n        provide programming to underrepresented students in grades \n        kindergarten through 8 in STEM.\n            (2) Permitted activities.--Such activities may include--\n                    (A) the provision of programming described in \n                subsection (a) for the purpose of research;\n                    (B) the use of a variety of engagement methods \n                including cooperative and hands-on learning;\n                    (C) exposure of underrepresented youth to role \n                models in the fields of STEM and near-peer mentors;\n                    (D) training of informal learning educators and \n                youth-serving professionals using evidence-based \n                methods consistent with the target student population \n                being served;\n                    (E) education of students on the relevance and \n                significance of STEM careers, provision of academic \n                advice and assistance, and activities designed to help \n                students make real-world connections to STEM content \n                activities;\n                    (F) the attendance of underrepresented youth at \n                events, competitions, and academic programs to provide \n                content expertise and encourage career exposure in \n                STEM;\n                    (G) activities designed to engage parents of \n                underrepresented youth;\n                    (H) innovative strategies to engage \n                underrepresented youth, such as using leadership skill \n                outcome measures to encourage youth with the confidence \n                to pursue STEM coursework and academic study;\n                    (I) coordination with STEM-rich environments, \n                including other nonprofit, nongovernmental \n                organizations, classroom and out-of-classroom settings, \n                institutions of higher education, vocational \n                facilities, corporations, museums, or science centers; \n                and\n                    (J) the acquisition of instructional materials or \n                technology-based tools to conduct applicable grant \n                activity.\n    (c) Application.--An applicant seeking funding under the section \nshall submit an application at such time, in such manner, and \ncontaining such information as may be required.
