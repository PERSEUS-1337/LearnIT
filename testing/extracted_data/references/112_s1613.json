    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young \nAdult Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) An estimated 12,400 children and adolescents under age \n        20 are diagnosed with cancer each year.\n            (2) In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer \n        survived more than 5 years, but by 2011, cure rates have \n        increased to 78 percent for children and adolescents under age \n        20.\n            (3) The population of survivors of childhood cancers has \n        grown dramatically, to more than 300,000 individuals of all \n        ages as of 2007.\n            (4) As many as \\2/3\\ of childhood cancer survivors are \n        likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment, \n        with as many as \\1/4\\ experiencing a late effect that is \n        serious or life-threatening. The most common late effects of \n        childhood cancer are neurocognitive, psychological, \n        cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects and \n        secondary malignancies.\n            (5) The late effects of cancer treatment may change as \n        treatments evolve, which means that the monitoring and \n        treatment of cancer survivors may need to be modified on a \n        routine basis.\n            (6) The Institute of Medicine, in its reports on cancer \n        survivorship entitled ``Childhood Cancer Survivorship: \n        Improving Care and Quality of Life'', states that an organized \n        system of care and a method of care for pediatric cancer \n        survivors is needed.\n\nSEC. 3. CANCER SURVIVORSHIP PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Cancer Survivorship Programs.--Subpart 1 of part C of title IV \nof the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285 et seq.) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 417G.
