FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to \n        provide States help in certain areas, including efforts to \n        reduce violent crime;\n            (2) Federal legislation relating to criminal justice, \n        including the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations \n        Act (``RICO'') and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, has been \n        very effective in dealing with crimes to which the legislation \n        applies;\n            (3) the responsibility for protecting citizens against most \n        violent crimes and for punishing most violent criminal \n        offenders is primarily a matter of State and local governance;\n            (4) violent crimes nationwide have risen dramatically and \n        constitute a national priority of the highest order;\n            (5) the persistence and increasing incidence of violent \n        crime, despite the efforts of State and local governments, has \n        resulted in a vastly increased Federal role in this area, and \n        there is pressure for even greater Federal involvement in \n        criminal matters traditionally handled by State and local \n        governments;\n            (6) the Federal courts especially have become overburdened \n        with criminal matters more properly handled by State and local \n        governments;\n            (7) a major impetus for this increased Federal role in \n        combating violent crime is the lack of effective tools with \n        which State and local governments can prosecute violent \n        criminal offenders;\n            (8) a more uniform, proportionate, and appropriately \n        punitive system of sentencing for violent criminal offenders \n        would serve both to reduce the incidence of violent crime and \n        to reduce the need for direct Federal involvement in criminal \n        matters traditionally handled by State and local governments;\n            (9) a more appropriate and effective role for the Federal \n        Government in the struggle against most violent crime is to \n        encourage each State to take the steps necessary to reduce \n        crime in such State which would also reduce the national crime \n        rate;\n            (10) the United States Sentencing Guidelines have proven to \n        be an effective means of achieving, at the Federal level, a \n        more uniform, proportionate, and appropriately punitive \n        criminal sentencing system; and\n            (11) each State should be required to analyze its criminal \n        sentencing system and to consider whether the adoption of a \n        revised sentencing system would enable it to combat violent \n        crime more effectively.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to require each State to undertake a comprehensive \n        examination of the State's criminal sentencing scheme and to \n        create a sentencing system which more effectively governs the \n        sentencing of violent offenders; and\n            (2) to provide funds to States that comply with the \n        requirements of section 5(b) to implement necessary changes to \n        the State criminal sentencing system, including increasing the \n        capacity of State correctional facilities if necessary.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n    For the purpose of this Act, the term ``State'' means any State of \nthe United States.\n\nSEC. 4. STATE SENTENCING REVIEWS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Each State, in order to be eligible for funds \nunder this Act, must conduct a systematic review of its criminal \nsentencing laws and practices.\n    (b) State Sentencing Reviews.--Not later than one year after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, the government of each State shall \nsubmit to the Attorney General a report detailing the results of the \nState's review of its criminal sentencing system. The report also shall \ninclude the following:\n            (1) An analysis of the State statutory criminal sentencing \n        scheme, including information regarding murder (all degrees), \n        arson, burglary, assault, robbery, kidnapping, extortion, rape, \n        and child molestation. This analysis should include--\n                    (A) the minimum and maximum sentence available for \n                each offense;\n                    (B) the basis for distinguishing between different \n                degrees of the same offense;\n                    (C) whether factors in addition to the actual crime \n                (such as criminal history, victim impact, or use of a \n                weapon) should be considered by the sentencing \n                authority; and\n                    (D) whether probation or some other non-custodial \n                alternatives to incarceration are a sentencing option.\n            (2) An analysis of the sentences actually imposed by State \n        court judges for the crimes listed in paragraph (1).\n            (3) An analysis of the time which has actually been served \n        for the conviction of crimes listed in paragraph (1).\n            (4) An analysis of the practices and procedures of the \n        State relating to probation, parole, and other alternatives to \n        incarceration, with particular emphasis on crimes which have \n        been committed by convicted criminals while on parole or \n        probation or otherwise not incarcerated.\n            (5) An analysis of whether the State sentencing system \n        permits or requires the sentencing authority to order convicted \n        criminals to pay restitution to the victim, the victim's \n        family, or the State, and the percentage of restitution orders \n        which are actually collected.\n            (6) An analysis of whether and under what circumstances \n        State law permits the pretrial detention without bond of \n        dangerous offenders.\n            (7) An analysis of whether and under what circumstances \n        State law gives victims the right to be informed, present, and \n        heard at all critical stages of a case from arrest through \n        parole.\n            (8) An analysis of whether and how State law establishes \n        post conviction relief procedures which limit repetitive \n        challenges by convicted offenders.\n            (9) An analysis of State law regarding the application of \n        adult sentencing laws to juvenile offenders charged with the \n        crimes listed in section 4(b)(1) of this Act.\n            (10) An analysis of the State prison capacity and whether \n        court orders limit, or otherwise impact such capacity and \n        whether a lack of capacity impacts sentencing or release \n        decisions at the judicial or administrative level.\n\nSEC. 5. STATE SENTENCING SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Each State, in order to comply with this Act, must \nsubmit for approval a plan to the Attorney General that evaluates the \ncriminal sentencing system and, if necessary, creates a sentencing \nsystem which complies with the requirements of subsection (b).\n    (b) State Sentencing System.--In addition to responding to the \nreporting requirement of section 4(b) of this Act, the State, in a \nsubsequent report to the Attorney General, shall describe in detail any \nchanges in the State's criminal sentencing system designed to meet the \nrequirements of this Act.
