FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the National Health and Nutrition \n        Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003-2006, for children aged \n        6-11 years and 12-19 years, the prevalence of being overweight \n        was 17 percent and 17.6 percent, respectively.\n            (2) According to the Surgeon General, overweight \n        adolescents have a 70 percent chance of becoming overweight or \n        obese adults.\n            (3) According to the Surgeon General, overweight and \n        obesity are associated with heart disease, certain types of \n        cancer, type 2 diabetes, stroke, arthritis, breathing problems, \n        and psychological disorders, such as depression.\n            (4) According to the Surgeon General, an estimated 300,000 \n        deaths per year may be attributable to obesity.\n            (5) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n        that in 2000, the total cost of obesity in the United States \n        was estimated to be $117 billion.\n            (6) According to the Dietary Guidelines produced by the \n        Department of Agriculture, increasing consumption of fruits and \n        vegetables, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods, while \n        reducing saturated fats, trans fats, sodium, added sugars, and \n        excess calories and reducing obesity could dramatically improve \n        Americans' health and well-being.\n            (7) According to the Surgeon General, nearly half of young \n        people aged 12-21 are not vigorously active on a regular basis. \n        Yet, regular physical activity improves strength, builds lean \n        muscle, and decreases body fat.\n\nSEC. 3.
