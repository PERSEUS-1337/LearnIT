If the patent owner files such a statement, the \n        patent owner shall promptly serve a copy of the statement on \n        the third-party requester. Not later than 2 months after the \n        date of such service, the third-party requester may file and \n        have considered in the opposition proceeding a reply to the \n        statement filed by the patent owner.\n            ``(2) Conduct of opposition proceedings.--Each opposition \n        shall be heard by one administrative opposition judge, and no \n        party shall be permitted ex parte communication with the \n        administrative opposition judge.
