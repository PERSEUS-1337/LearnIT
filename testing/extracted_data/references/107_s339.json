    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Education Development \nInitiative for the 21st Century Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide rural school students in the \nUnited States with increased learning opportunities.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) While there are rural education initiatives identified \n        at the State and local level, no Federal education policy \n        focuses on the specific needs of rural school districts and \n        schools, especially those that serve poor students.\n            (2) The National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) \n        reports that while 46 percent of our Nation's public schools \n        serve rural areas, they only receive 22 percent of the Nation's \n        education funds annually.\n            (3) A critical problem for rural school districts involves \n        the hiring and retention of qualified administrators and \n        certified teachers (especially in Special Education, Science, \n        and Mathematics). Consequently, teachers in rural schools are \n        almost twice as likely to provide instruction in two or more \n        subjects than teachers in urban schools. Rural schools also \n        face other tough challenges, such as shrinking local tax bases, \n        high transportation costs, aging buildings, limited course \n        offerings, and limited resources.\n            (4) Data from the National Assessment of Educational \n        Progress (NAEP) consistently shows large gaps between the \n        achievement of students in high-poverty schools and those in \n        other schools. High-poverty schools will face special \n        challenges in preparing their students to reach high standards \n        of performance on State and national assessments.\n\nSEC. 4.
