    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Asian Americans and Pacific \nIslanders Higher Education Enhancement Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The population of Asian American and Pacific Islanders \n        (referred to in this section as ``AAPI'') is an exceptionally \n        diverse population. Characteristics of the AAPI population vary \n        according to ethnicity, immigration patterns, historical \n        experiences, and social group issues.\n            (2) The diversity of the AAPI population includes \n        indigenous Pacific Islanders, well-established populations \n        represented in the United States for several generations, and \n        ethnic groups who may be recent immigrants or refugees, and \n        were forced to leave their home countries.\n            (3) The diversity of the population is reflected in the \n        Federal government's categories for Asian Americans and Pacific \n        Islanders. There are 17 ethnic groups considered to be Asian \n        and 4 ethnic groups considered to be Pacific Islander. Neither \n        definition reflects AAPI individuals who may identify \n        themselves as ``more than one race''.\n            (4) The distinct cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic, and \n        historical experiences that affect educational attainment of \n        different AAPI sub-populations are often overlooked because \n        programs and policies are based on aggregated data and the \n        assumption that AAPIs are a monolithic group. The ``model \n        minority myth'' assumption adversely effects AAPI youth, who \n        are perceived as being academically successful and not in need \n        of outreach, academic support systems, or other support \n        services.\n            (5) The ``model minority myth'' and lack of disaggregated \n        data may prevent student services offices from conducting \n        intentional outreach efforts, such as through Federal TRIO \n        programs including Upward Bound and Talent Search, to AAPI \n        students, because they are perceived to not be in need of \n        support.\n            (6) Additionally, disaggregated data indicates that 25.0 \n        percent of Vietnamese Americans, 63.6 percent of Hmong \n        Americans, 42.6 percent of Cambodian Americans, 34.7 percent of \n        Laotian Americans, and 17.7 percent of Pacific Islanders live \n        in poverty. Such socioeconomic disparities within the community \n        are often overlooked, as only 12.6 percent of the total AAPI \n        population lives in poverty.\n            (7) While Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders overall \n        have the highest college graduation rates of any group (44 \n        percent in 2000), certain subgroups have much lower rates of \n        degree attainment. Only 13.8 percent of Vietnamese Americans, \n        5.8 percent of Laotian Americans, 6.1 percent of Cambodian \n        Americans, and less than 5.1 percent of Hmong Americans had \n        college degrees. Only 13.8 percent of Pacific Islanders had \n        college degrees.\n            (8) Certain segments of the AAPI population face numerous \n        barriers to accessing higher education and would benefit from \n        grants and opportunities similar to those provided by other \n        minority serving institutions. The designation of AAPI-serving \n        institutions would help institutions of higher education expand \n        their capacity to identify and assist underserved AAPI \n        students.\n\nSEC. 3.
