FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) 13 people die every day waiting for a life-saving \n        transplant operation;\n            (2) over 67,000 people are currently waiting for a \n        transplant operation--including over 44,000 kidney patients, \n        14,000 liver patients, 4,000 lung patients, and 800 pancreas \n        patients;\n            (3) every 14 minutes, a new name is added to the national \n        transplant waiting list;\n            (4) between 10,000 and 12,000 people die annually who are \n        considered medically suitable for organ donation, yet only an \n        estimated 5,200 people donate their organs every year;\n            (5) one donor can help more than 50 people in need of an \n        organ;\n            (6) current programs designed to expand the number of \n        available organs do not contain any economic awards or \n        incentives for patients to become organ donors; and\n            (7) current debates in Congress and in the Administration \n        have unfortunately focused on the way organs ought to be \n        allocated, rather than addressing the root cause of the \n        problem, which is a lack of available transplant organs.\n\nSEC. 3. CREDIT FOR ORGAN DONATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to nonrefundable \npersonal credits) is amended by inserting after section 25A the \nfollowing new section:\n\n``SEC. 25B.
