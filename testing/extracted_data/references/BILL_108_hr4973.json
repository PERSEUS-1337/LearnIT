FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The national high school graduation rate is only 70 \n        percent, and in urban districts that percentage drops further \n        to only 50 percent.\n            (2) The national graduation rate for the class of 2001 was \n        only 51 percent for African Americans and 52 percent for Latino \n        students.\n            (3) Each school day, approximately 3,000 secondary school \n        students drop out of school.\n            (4) Six million secondary students who make up the lowest \n        25 percent in terms of achievement scores are 3.5 times more \n        likely to drop out than students in the next highest quarter of \n        academic achievement, and are 20 times more likely to drop out \n        than high achieving students.\n            (5) Approximately 25 percent of secondary school students \n        are reading at ``below basic'' levels. The problem is even more \n        severe for poor students of color. The average minority or low-\n        income ninth grader performs at only the fifth or sixth grade \n        level in reading.\n            (6) Low graduation rates are evidence that, in the earlier \n        grades, schools are not meeting the fundamental achievement \n        needs of low-income students.\n            (7) Even those students who do graduate from secondary \n        schools and go on to college are struggling because they lack \n        the basic skills to succeed. Approximately 40 percent of all 4-\n        year college students take a remedial course and 63 percent of \n        all community college students are assigned to at least one \n        remedial course.\n            (8) A small percentage of low-income students who manage to \n        enter college are able to complete a degree. Of students from \n        families in the bottom 20 percent in terms of income who enter \n        college, only 27 percent go on to complete a two- or four-year \n        college degree within eight years.\n            (9) Graduation rates impact early drop-out rates in the \n        military. The attrition rates of both non-high school graduates \n        and GED recipients are 8 percentage points higher than the \n        rates of graduates. As a result, the Armed Services no longer \n        accepts high school drop-outs and put less value on alternative \n        certificates.\n            (10) Students who fail to graduate from high school are \n        more likely to engage in criminal activity than students who \n        graduate. A one percent increase in high school graduation \n        rates would save approximately $1.4 billion in costs associated \n        with incarceration, or about $2,100 for each male high school \n        graduate.\n            (11) In today's workplace, nearly 8 in 10 adults with \n        bachelors degrees are employed, but for those who completed \n        high school only, the figure falls to about 6 in 10. And for \n        students who dropped out, the figure drops further to 4 in 10.\n            (12) Employment projections indicate that jobs requiring \n        only a high school degree will grow by just 9 percent by the \n        year 2008, while those requiring a bachelor's degree will grow \n        by 25 percent and those requiring an associate's degree will \n        grow by 31 percent.\n            (13) Personalization of the school environment has been \n        proven to increase success rates for low-performing secondary \n        school students. Nearly 50 percent of middle school youth and \n        40 percent of high school youth report feelings of \n        disengagement from school. Rates are even higher for teens and \n        minorities in urban schools. These feelings result in failure \n        to work hard, to seek assistance, or to take appropriate \n        courses.\n            (14) Effective research-based education programs that \n        improve high school graduation rates are comprehensive in \n        nature and include interventions that begin in kindergarten and \n        span all the grades through 12th.\n\nSEC. 3. PROJECT GRAD.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of the program authorized under this Act \nis--\n            (1) to provide support and assistance to programs \n        implementing integrated education reform services to improve \n        high school graduation and college going rates for \n        disadvantaged students; and\n            (2) to promote the establishment of new programs to \n        implement such integrated education reform services.\n    (b) Grant Authorized.--The Secretary is authorized to award a grant \nto Project GRAD USA, a nonprofit educational organization that has as \nits primary purpose the improvement of high school graduation and \ncollege going rates for disadvantaged students (hereinafter in this \nsection referred to as the ``grantee''), to provide support and \ntechnical assistance to existing programs implementing the set of \nintegrated education reform services described in subsection (d)(2) and \nto promote the expansion of such programs.\n    (c) Requirements of Grant Agreement.--The Secretary shall enter \ninto an agreement with the grantee that requires that--\n            (1) the grantee will enter into subcontracts with nonprofit \n        educational organizations (hereinafter in this section referred \n        to as ``subgrantees'') under which the subgrantees will agree \n        to establish, operate, and provide the non-Federal share of the \n        cost of implementing Project GRAD programs;\n            (2) the grantee will provide such technical assistance to \n        the subgrantees as may be necessary to carry out the provisions \n        of this section;\n            (3) funds made available under the grant can be used to pay \n        the Federal share of the cost of establishing and operating \n        programs as provided in paragraph (1) and costs associated with \n        the provision of technical assistance as provided in paragraph \n        (2); and\n            (4) the grantee will select only subgrantees that serve a \n        substantial number or percentage of low-income students.\n    (d) Supported Programs.--\n            (1) Designation; feeder patterns.--The programs supported \n        with funds available under this section shall be known as \n        ``Project GRAD programs''. Such programs shall, with the \n        agreement of the grantee, identify one or more groups of public \n        schools at which services will be provided through establishing \n        a ``feeder pattern'' through which elementary and secondary \n        schools channel students having participated in Project GRAD \n        services into an identified high school.\n            (2) Integrated education reform services.--The services \n        provided through project GRAD programs shall include--\n                    (A) research-based programs in reading, \n                mathematics, and classroom management;\n                    (B) campus-based social services programs including \n                a systematic approach to increase family and community \n                involvement in the schools served;\n                    (C) a college access program, which includes the \n                provision of a college scholarship for students that \n                meet established criteria, proven approaches to \n                increasing student and family college awareness, and \n                assistance for those students in applying to college \n                for financial aid; and\n                    (D) such other services identified by the grantee \n                as necessary to increase high school graduation and \n                college going rates.\n    (e) Use of Funds.--Not less than 75 percent of the funds received \nby the grantee under this section shall be used to fund awards to \nsubgrantees to carry out the requirements of subsection (d)(1). The \nbalance of such funds shall be used by grantee to carry out the \nrequirements of subsection (d)(2), as well as other such activities to \npromote greater public awareness of integrated education reform \nservices to improve high school graduation and college going rates for \ndisadvantaged students as described in subsection (d)(2).\n    (f) Federal Share.--\n            (1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (c), the term \n        ``Federal share'' means, with respect to the costs of Project \n        GRAD programs authorized in subsection (c), subgrants provided \n        by the grantee averaging $200 per pupil, adjusted to take into \n        consideration the resources available to the school at which \n        the subgrantee will implement the program, and the need for \n        Project GRAD USA services to improve student outcomes.\n            (2) Exception.--Nothing in this subsection shall preclude \n        the awarding of subgrants reflecting a per student cost of more \n        than $200 if the grantee determines that additional resources \n        were not available consistent with the requirements placed on \n        the grantee in subsection (c)(4).\n            (3) More may be required.--If funds or resources are \n        available to a subgrantee, the grantee may elect to award the \n        subgrantee less than the Federal share of the cost associated \n        with the program.\n    (g) Evaluation.--\n            (1) Evaluation by the secretary.--The Secretary shall \n        select an independent entity to evaluate every 3 years the \n        performance of students who participate in a program under this \n        section. The evaluation shall be contracted using the strongest \n        possible research design for determining the effectiveness of \n        programs funded under this section. The evaluation shall \n        include a comparison of reading and mathematics achievement \n        and, where applicable, high school graduation, college going, \n        and college completion rates of students who participate in the \n        programs funded under this section with those indicators for \n        students of similar backgrounds who do not participate in such \n        programs.\n            (2) Evaluation by grantee and subgrantees.--The grantee \n        shall require each subgrantee to prepare an in-depth report of \n        the results of the programs supported with funds, and the use \n        of funds, made available under this section. Such review shall \n        include data on the reading and math achievement of students \n        involved in the programs and statistics on high school \n        graduation, college going, and college completion rates, and \n        such financial reporting as deemed relevant to review the \n        effectiveness and efficiency of the program. The report shall \n        be in a form and include such content as shall be determined by \n        the grantee in consultation with the Secretary or the entity \n        selected by the Secretary to evaluate the Project GRAD program.\n            (3) Availability of evaluations.--Copies of any evaluation \n        or report prepared pursuant to this section shall be available \n        to the Secretary and the Chairman and ranking member of the \n        Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of \n        Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor \n        and Pensions of the Senate.\n    (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to make grants under this section $27,000,000 for fiscal \nyear 2005 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 5 \nsucceeding fiscal years.\n    (i) Low-Income Student.--For purposes of this section, the term \n``low-income student'' means a student who is determined by a local \neducational agency to be from a low-income family using the measures \ndescribed in section 1113(c) of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965."
