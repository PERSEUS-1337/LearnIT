FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) men's and boys' wool suits (of United States category \n        443), sport coats (of United States category 433) and slacks \n        (of United States category 447) (collectively, ``tailored wool \n        apparel'') from Canada are being imported into the United \n        States in such increased quantities as to cause serious damage \n        to the domestic tailored wool apparel industry;\n            (2) the provision of safeguard procedures in international \n        trade agreements to deal with surges of injurious imports has \n        been a fundamental policy of the United States Government for \n        over sixty years;\n            (3) in a departure from this fundamental policy, the North \n        American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA'') deprives United \n        States tailored wool apparel manufacturers and their workers of \n        any remedy to address surges of injurious imports from Canada, \n        while all other United States, Canadian, and Mexican industries \n        and their workers can seek some form of safeguard from \n        injurious import surges under NAFTA;\n            (4) United States tailored wool apparel manufacturers and \n        their workers should be provided an appropriate safeguard like \n        all other United States industries and their workers;\n            (5) since 1988, United States production of men's and boys' \n        wool suits has declined by over 40 percent and employment in \n        the industry declined by nearly 50 percent;\n            (6) four major and numerous smaller United States producers \n        of tailored wool apparel recently went out of business, \n        announced their intention to go out of business, or declared \n        bankruptcy;\n            (7) plants in States such as Alabama, Delaware, Florida, \n        Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, \n        Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia have either been closed \n        or are laying off workers;\n            (8) the surging tailored wool apparel imports are assembled \n        in Canada from fabric produced in Italy, Korea, Turkey and \n        other countries and exported at a preferential rate of duty \n        under a program known as a Tariff Preference Level (TPL) for \n        nonoriginating goods that was first established as a tariff \n        preference in the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement \n        (``CFTA'') for Canadian exports of wool apparel items;\n            (9) the tariff preference was designed for a limited \n        purpose--to ensure that Canadian producers of wool apparel \n        traditionally exported to the United States (which included \nonly a small amount of tailored wool apparel) had access to an adequate \nsupply of wool fabric, not for the wholesale circumvention of the rule \nof origin contained in the agreement;\n            (10) high-quality wool fabrics are readily available to \n        apparel producers in Canada in sufficient quantities from \n        Canadian and United States producers;\n            (11) in recognition of the tariff preference's short supply \n        purpose, the CFTA provided for monitoring of wool apparel \n        imports ``with a view to adjusting the annual quality \n        limitations at the request of either Party based on the ability \n        of apparel producers to obtain supplies of particular fabrics \n        originating within the territories of the Parties'';\n            (12) the CFTA also required renegotiation of the tariff \n        preference before January 1, 1998, ``to reflect current \n        conditions in the textile and apparel industries located within \n        the territories of the Parties, including the ability of such \n        apparel producers to obtain supplies of particular fabrics \n        originating within the territories of the Parties'';\n            (13) the NAFTA deleted the CFTA's monitoring and \n        renegotiation provisions and excluded tailored wool apparel \n        from the safeguard mechanisms established to deal with surges \n        of injurious imports;\n            (14) prior to implementation of the CFTA, Canada accounted \n        for no more than 5 percent of United States imports of men's \n        and boys' wool suits; by 1995, as a result of the TPL, Canada \n        had become the largest exporter of men's and boys' wool suits \n        to the United States, accounting for 24 percent of imports;\n            (15) since 1988, imports of men's and boys' wool suits from \n        Canada have increased over 1,000 percent (i.e., from 100,000 \n        units in 1988 to over 1.1 million units in 1995);\n            (16) the imports from Canada, made of fabric that is not of \n        North American origin, have also harmed United States wool \n        fabric, yarn, and fiber producers and their workers in states \n        such as Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North \n        Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, \n        South Carolina, and Virginia;\n            (17) the Congress never intended for the NAFTA to result in \n        such serious injury to United States tailored wool apparel \n        manufacturers and their workers and for the NAFTA to single out \n        that United States industry and its workers by denying them \n        access to an adequate and effective safeguard; and\n            (18) the following safeguard proposals are intended to \n        rectify these oversights.\n\nSEC. 3. PHASED SAFEGUARDS MEASURES.\n\n    (a) Revision in Sub-Limits.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw, not more than 50 percent of the total square meter equivalents of \nwool apparel assembled in Canada and eligible for preferential duty \ntreatment under Appendix 6.B.1 to Annex 300-B of the North American \nFree Trade Agreement (``the Appendix'') and entered, or withdrawn from \nwarehouse, for consumption during any year shall be tailored wool \napparel and not more than 50 percent of such sublimit shall be men's \nand boys' wool suits of United States category 443, or men's and boys' \nwool sport coats of category 433, or men's and boys' wool slacks of \ncategory 447, respectively.\n    (b) Duty Snap-Back.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \ntailored wool apparel assembled in Canada and eligible for preferential \nduty treatment under the Appendix shall be subject to duty at the \nnondiscriminatory (most-favored-nation) rate in effect at the time of \nentry.\n    (c) Effective Dates.--\n            (1) November 1, 1996.--Subsection (a) shall apply to \n        merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for \n        consumption after August 31, 1996.\n            (2) March 1, 1997.--Subsection (c) shall apply to \n        merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for \n        consumption after February 28, 1997.\n            (3) Waiver.--The President may delay the effective date \n        under this subsection for subsection (b), and may suspend the \n        application of such subsection if it has taken effect, for such \n        period as he considers appropriate, if he determines that \n        Canada has entered into an agreement with the United States \n        which provides for sub-limits required under subsection (a)."
