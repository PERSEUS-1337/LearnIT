FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) When used properly, cough medicines that contain \n        dextromethorphan have a long history of being safe and \n        effective. But abuse of dextromethorphan at high doses can \n        produce hallucinations, rapid heart beat, high blood pressure, \n        loss of consciousness, and seizures. The dangers multiply when \n        dextromethorphan is abused with alcohol, prescription drugs, or \n        narcotics.\n            (2) Dextromethorphan is inexpensive, legal, and readily \n        accessible, which has contributed to the increased abuse of \n        that drug, particularly among teenagers.\n            (3) Increasing numbers of teens and others are abusing \n        dextromethorphan by ingesting it in excessive quantities. \n        Prolonged use at high doses can lead to psychological \n        dependence on the drug. Abuse of dextromethorphan can also \n        cause impaired judgment, which can lead to injury or death.\n            (4) Dextromethorphan abuse increased by a factor of 10 \n        during the period of 1999 through 2004, with an increase by a \n        factor of 15 among children aged 9 to 17 years.\n            (5) An estimated 2,400,000 teenagers (1 in 10) abused over-\n        the-counter cough medicines in 2005. Children ages 9 to 17 \n        years are the fastest growing group of dextromethorphan \n        abusers.\n            (6) The Food and Drug Administration has called the abuse \n        of dextromethorphan a ``serious issue'' and a ``disturbing new \n        trend'' that can cause ``death as well as other serious adverse \n        events such as brain damage, seizure, loss of consciousness, \n        and irregular heartbeat.''.\n            (7) In recognition of the problem, several retailers have \n        voluntarily implemented age restrictions on purchases of cough \n        and cold medicines containing dextromethorphan.\n            (8) Prevention is a key component of addressing the rise in \n        the abuse of legal medications. Education campaigns teaching \n        teens and parents about the dangers of these drugs are an \n        important part of this effort.\n\nSEC. 3.
