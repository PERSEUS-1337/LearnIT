    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Rocky Mountain Forest Insects \nResponse Enhancement and Support Act'' or the ``Rocky Mountain FIRES \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) fire beetles, bark beetles, and other insects that feed \n        on trees are--\n                    (A) natural parts of the Rocky Mountain forest \n                ecology; and\n                    (B) shape the forest in a beneficial manner by \n                thinning dense tree stands and promoting cyclical re-\n                growth;\n            (2) in various parts of the Rocky Mountain region large-\n        scale infestations of bark beetles and other insects, in \n        combination with other factors, have increased the likelihood \n        of unusually severe wildfires that pose a threat to individuals \n        and properties that are located in nearby communities;\n            (3) increased wildfire danger is the result of numerous \n        factors, including--\n                    (A) a century-long policy of suppressing small \n                fires on Federal land that, combined with a recent \n                reduction in the quantity of timber harvested on \n                Federal land, has resulted in unusually dense \n                vegetation that can provide fuel for unusually severe \n                wildfires;\n                    (B) a pronounced and prolonged drought that has \n                weakened trees and made the trees more susceptible to \n                wildfire and insects; and\n                    (C) population growth in the mountain communities \n                adjacent to Federal land, and the development of ski \n                areas and other recreational facilities on and in the \n                vicinity of Federal land, that have increased the \n                number of individuals, homes, and businesses at risk;\n            (4) the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. \n        6501 et seq.) addressed the need to reduce the volume of fuel \n        that can feed the most severe fires that threaten communities; \n        and\n            (5) provisions of that Act and other laws need to be \n        modified to help reduce the increased risk of severe wildfires \n        to communities in the Rocky Mountain region resulting from the \n        effects of widespread infestations of bark beetles and other \n        insects.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate a more \nexpeditious response by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary \nof the Interior in reducing the increased risk of severe wildfires to \ncommunities in the Rocky Mountain region resulting from the effects of \nwidespread infestations of bark beetles and other insects.\n\nSEC. 3.
