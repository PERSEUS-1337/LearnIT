    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all the following:\n(a) The current pervasive use of information technology in public enterprises has resulted in an abundance of public access to information and services provided by the government, but the increased interdependence of information technology systems has created a new type of risk for society. Threats to public critical infrastructure that use information technology within the state present risks to public health and safety and could severely disrupt economic activity within California.\n(b) Ensuring sufficient preparations are taken to protect critical infrastructure from interference, compromise, or incapacitation are in the public interest and serve a public purpose.\n(c) A comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, related to state agency critical infrastructure information and control, developed in a coordinated effort among state agencies, will help prepare for threats to critical infrastructure, thereby reducing the potential consequences from those attacks.\n(d) The Department of Technology, in its role as the lead entity that coordinates state resources in the development of information technology (IT) strategy and policy, directs state agency information security and privacy standards and procedures for the day-to-day protection of state information assets from a variety of threats, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity threats and attacks.\n(e) The Office of Emergency Services, in its role as the lead executive entity that coordinates state resources for emergency preparedness, response, and damage mitigation, is integrating cybersecurity into the State Emergency Plan.\n(f) The Department of Technology is continuing its state government oversight and compliance monitoring program, and enhancing day-to-day information security incident response coordination with the Office of Emergency Services, Department of the California Highway Patrol\u2019s Computer Crimes Investigation Unit, and the Military Department.\n(g) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this legislation to add to the ongoing work of the state\u2019s comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, undertaken in a coordinated effort among state agencies, to prepare California for threats to critical infrastructure under the unifying coordination of the Office of Emergency Services.\nSEC. 2.\nArticle 6.4 (commencing with Section 8592.30) is added to Chapter 7 of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code, to read:\nArticle  6.4. Cybersecurity\n8592.30.\nAs used in this article, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u201cCritical infrastructure controls\u201d means networks and systems controlling assets so vital to the state that the incapacity or destruction of those networks, systems, or assets would have a debilitating impact on public health, safety, economic security, or any combination thereof.\n(b) \u201cCritical infrastructure information\u201d means information not customarily in the public domain pertaining to any of the following:\n(1) Actual, potential, or threatened interference with, or an attack on, compromise of, or incapacitation of critical infrastructure controls by either physical or computer-based attack or other similar conduct, including, but not limited to, the misuse of, or unauthorized access to, all types of communications and data transmission systems, that violates federal, state, or local law or harms public health, safety, or economic security, or any combination thereof.\n(2) The ability of critical infrastructure controls to resist any interference, compromise, or incapacitation, including, but not limited to, any planned or past assessment or estimate of the vulnerability of critical infrastructure.\n(3) Any planned or past operational problem or solution regarding critical infrastructure controls, including, but not limited to, repair, recovery, reconstruction, insurance, or continuity, to the extent it is related to interference, compromise, or incapacitation of critical infrastructure controls.\n(c) \u201cDepartment\u201d means the Department of Technology.\n(d) \u201cOffice\u201d means the Office of Emergency Services.\n(e) \u201cSecretary\u201d means the secretary of each state agency as set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 12800.\n(f) \u201cState agency\u201d or \u201cstate agencies\u201d means the same as \u201cstate agency\u201d as set forth in Section 11000.\n8592.35.\n(a) (1) On or before July 1, 2018, the department shall, in consultation with the office and compliance with Section 11549.3, update the Technology Recovery Plan element of the State Administrative Manual to ensure the inclusion of cybersecurity strategy incident response standards for each state agency to secure its critical infrastructure controls and critical infrastructure information.\n(2) In updating the standards in paragraph (1), the department shall consider, but not be limited to considering, all of the following:\n(A) Costs to implement the standards.\n(B) Security of critical infrastructure information.\n(C) Centralized management of risk.\n(D) Industry best practices.\n(E) Continuity of operations.\n(F) Protection of personal information.\n(b) Each state agency shall provide the department with a copy of its updated Technology Recovery Plan.\n8592.40.\n(a) Each state agency shall report on its compliance with the standards updated pursuant to Section 8592.35 to the department in the manner and at the time directed by the department, but no later than July 1, 2019.\n(b) The department, in conjunction with the office, may provide suggestions for a state agency to improve compliance with the standards developed pursuant to Section 8592.35, if any, to the head of the state agency and the secretary responsible for the state agency. For a state agency that is not under the responsibility of a secretary, the department shall provide any suggestions to the head of the state agency and the Governor.\n8592.45.\nThe information required by subdivision (b) of Section 8592.35, the report required by subdivision (a) of Section 8592.40, and any public records relating to any communication made pursuant to, or in furtherance of the purposes of, subdivision (b) of Section 8592.40 are confidential and shall not be disclosed pursuant to any state law, including, but not limited to, the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1).\nSEC. 3.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 8592.45 to the Government Code, imposes a limitation on the public\u2019s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nPreventing public disclosure of the individual cybersecurity preparations and critical infrastructure information of state agencies promotes public safety by prohibiting access to those who would use that information to thwart the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure controls within the state."
