FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at \n        the highest level ever recorded in this country, and the \n        Department of Education recently announced that 52,200,000 \n        students are expected to attend school in 1998, an increase of \n        more than a million students over 1997.\n            (2) Increases in elementary and secondary student \n        enrollment will continue in record numbers each year for the \n        next decade with more than 3,000,000 additional students \n        expected; secondary school attendance alone is expected to \n        increase by more than 13 percent.\n            (3) This unprecedented increase in student enrollment will \n        affect high poverty urban and rural areas, and States \n        experiencing rapid population growth.\n            (4) Just to keep pace with the growing number of enrolled \n        elementary and secondary school students, schools will need to \n        hire 150,000 additional teachers during the next decade.\n            (5) Data and research, including information from the State \n        of Tennessee's Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio project \n        (Project STAR), the largest and longest lasting experiment ever \n        conducted to examine the effects of small class sizes on \n        student learning and development, suggest that students in the \n        early grades learn more in smaller classes, continue to have an \n        edge over the rest of their peers years after they return to \n        normal-sized classrooms and show that every time a student is \n        added to a classroom, learning is diminished for the rest of \n        the class.\n            (6) It is vital that we adequately educate and prepare \n        America's children for the next century and our competitive \n        global economy.\n            (7) Helping improve the learning environment for each and \n        every student is an important goal, hiring new teachers is an \n        important objective, and Congress needs to fund positions for \n        teachers without adding to the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or \n        debt.\n            (8) Congress needs to provide resources to keep pace with \n        growing enrollment and, if possible, help to reduce classroom \n        sizes.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Education is authorized to award \ngrants to Governors to enable Governors to provide funds to local \neducational agencies to hire elementary and secondary teachers or \nqualified instructional personnel as authorized under State law to \nreduce overcrowded classes.\n    (b) State Eligibility.--\n            (1) In general.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n        this Act, a Governor of a State shall submit an application to \n        the Secretary.\n            (2) Disapproval.--To the extent that appropriations are \n        made available in a fiscal year to carry out this Act, the \n        Secretary shall not disapprove an application from a Governor.\n    (c) Local Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant from the \nGovernor, a local educational agency shall--\n            (1) establish a trust fund for all payments received under \n        this Act;\n            (2) provide assurances that funds received under this Act \n        will be deposited in such trust fund account;\n            (3) provide assurances that funds received under this Act \n        will be used only to hire new teachers or qualified personnel \n        not later than 2 years after receipt of such funds;\n            (4) provide assurances that the agency will use accounting \n        and auditing practices stipulated by the Governor and allow the \n        State access to any and all records regarding funds received \n        and used under this Act;\n            (5) provide assurances that the agency will achieve a net \n        gain in the number of teachers or qualified instructional \n        personnel in a classroom setting;\n            (6) review annually the performance of personnel hired \n        pursuant to this Act to ensure that the agency has hired \n        qualified personnel;\n            (7) obligate personnel hired pursuant to this Act for a \n        period of employment not to exceed one year;\n            (8) repay to the State not later than 27 months after \n        receipt of funds from the State any amounts not expended after \n        24 months of such receipt;\n            (9) use funds received under this Act only to supplement \n        the amount of funds that would, in the absence of such Federal \n        funds, be made available from non-Federal sources for the \n        education of students participating in programs assisted under \n        this Act, and not to supplant such funds; and\n            (10) apply to the Governor each year in which the agency \n        wishes to receive funding under this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
