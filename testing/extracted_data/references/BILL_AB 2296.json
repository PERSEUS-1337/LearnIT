    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:\n(1) California is a world leader in innovation and harnessing the power of new technologies to promote efficiency, consumer benefits, and economic growth.\n(2) The Internet and digital technologies enable government to provide services to the public and to transact business more efficiently than with paper-based processes.\n(3) In 1995, in order to promote e-commerce and digital transactions with public agencies, California enacted Section 16.5 of the Government Code, which authorizes use of a \u201cdigital signature\u201d in any written communication with a public agency in which a signature is required or used, consistent with regulations to be adopted by the Secretary of State.\n(4) In 1999, California enacted the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (Title 2.5 (commencing with Section 1633.2) of Part 2 of Division 3 of the Civil Code), which provides that an \u201celectronic signature\u201d is valid and enforceable under any law that requires a signature in any transaction between two or more persons, including a government agency.\n(5) The definition of \u201cdigital signature\u201d in Section 16.5 of the Government Code and the definition of \u201celectronic signature\u201d in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act are similar, and neither statute includes any cross-reference to the other, leading to confusion in the marketplace and among public agencies as to what law governs.\n(6) A lack of clarity in the law creates a barrier to public agencies utilizing fully digital transactions that require a signature, including contracts, permits, and forms to obtain service or participate in government programs. As a result, both government and the public may not realize the benefits of digital transactions and online services, including efficiency, cost savings, convenience, and paper reduction.\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to amend current law to clarify that a \u201cdigital signature\u201d authorized by Section 16.5 of the Government Code and subject to regulations adopted by the Secretary of State is one type of \u201celectronic signature\u201d that a public agency may choose to adopt under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 1633.2 of the Civil Code is amended to read:\n1633.2.\nIn this title the following terms have the following definitions:\n(a) \u201cAgreement\u201d means the bargain of the parties in fact, as found in their language or inferred from other circumstances and from rules, regulations, and procedures given the effect of agreements under laws otherwise applicable to a particular transaction.\n(b) \u201cAutomated transaction\u201d means a transaction conducted or performed, in whole or in part, by electronic means or electronic records, in which the acts or records of one or both parties are not reviewed by an individual in the ordinary course in forming a contract, performing under an existing contract, or fulfilling an obligation required by the transaction.\n(c) \u201cComputer program\u201d means a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in an information processing system in order to bring about a certain result.\n(d) \u201cContract\u201d means the total legal obligation resulting from the parties\u2019 agreement as affected by this title and other applicable law.\n(e) \u201cElectronic\u201d means relating to technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic, or similar capabilities.\n(f) \u201cElectronic agent\u201d means a computer program or an electronic or other automated means used independently to initiate an action or respond to electronic records or performances in whole or in part, without review by an individual.\n(g) \u201cElectronic record\u201d means a record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means.\n(h) \u201cElectronic signature\u201d means an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with an electronic record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the electronic record.

The term includes a procedure that requires the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, or callback or other acknowledgment procedures.\n(o) \u201cTransaction\u201d means an action or set of actions occurring between two or more persons relating to the conduct of business, commercial, or governmental affairs.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 16.5 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n16.5.\n(a) In any written communication with a public entity, as defined in Section 811.2, in which a signature is required or used, any party to the communication may affix a signature by use of a digital signature that complies with the requirements of this section.
