ASSESSMENT OF ACHIEVEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ OF \n              BENCHMARKS FOR POLITICAL SETTLEMENT AND NATIONAL \n              RECONCILIATION IN IRAQ.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating and ever-widening \n        problem of sectarian and intra-sectarian violence based upon \n        political distrust and cultural differences between some Sunni \n        and Shia Muslims, concentrated primarily in Baghdad.\n            (2) Iraqis must reach political settlements in order to \n        achieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to reach \n        such settlements to support a truly unified government greatly \n        contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq.\n            (3) The responsibility for internal security and halting \n        sectarian violence in Iraq must rest primarily with the \n        Government of Iraq, relying on the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF).\n            (4) On January 10, 2007, President George W. Bush announced \n        a new strategy for Iraq, which consists of three basic \n        elements: diplomatic, economic, and military. The central \n        component of the military element is an augmentation of the \n        present level of United States military forces in Iraq with \n        more than 20,000 additional United States military forces to \n        ``work alongside Iraqi units and be embedded in their \n        formations. Our troops will have a well-defined mission: to \n        help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods, to help them \n        protect the local population, and to help ensure that the Iraqi \n        forces left behind are capable of providing the security that \n        Baghdad needs''.\n            (5) President George W. Bush said on January 10, 2007, that \n        ``I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other \n        leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to \n        dispel the contrary impression that exists.\n            (6) The Commander, Multi-National Forces-Iraq, General \n        David Petraeus, stated during his confirmation hearing before \n        the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, on January 23, \n        2007, that it is ``very important'' for Iraqis to understand \n        that they need to reach the political settlements which are \n        essential to resolve the sectarian violence and to defeat \n        insurgents.\n            (7) General Petraeus acknowledged during his confirmation \n        hearing before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, \n        on January 23, 2007, that political settlement and political \n        settlement alone by the Iraqis is our ultimate way of providing \n        security and success in Iraq.\n            (8) General Petraeus stated on March 8, 2007 that ``[a] \n        political resolution of various differences, of this \n        legislation, of various senses that people do not have a stake \n        in the success of the new Iraq, and so forth, that is crucial. \n        That is what will determine in the long run the success of this \n        effort''. In an April 26, 2007, news conference, General \n        Petraeus said that the situation in Iraq remains ``exceedingly \n        difficult''.\n            (9) General Petraeus, as principal author of Army Field \n        Manual 3-24 (MCWP 3-33.5), Counterinsurgency, released in \n        December 2006, and therefore possessing the unique \n        understanding and experience regarding the principles and \n        fundamentals of pursuing a counterinsurgency strategy, states \n        that ``[i]n the end, the host nation has to win on its own. \n        Achieving this requires development of viable local leaders and \n        institutions. U.S. forces and agencies can help, but [Host \n        Nation] elements must accept responsibilities to achieve real \n        victory''.\n            (10) United States military operations in Iraq should be \n        conducted alongside a comprehensive diplomatic, political, and \n        economic strategy that includes sustained engagement with \n        Iraq's neighbors and the international community for the \n        purpose of working collectively to bring stability to Iraq.\n            (11) United States military personnel are currently serving \n        in Iraq with the bravery and professionalism consistent with \n        the finest traditions of the United States Armed Forces. Many \n        have lost their lives, and many more have been wounded. They \n        have and deserve the support of all Americans, and the American \n        people will always honor their sacrifices and honor their \n        families.\n            (12) United States strategy in Iraq should be conditioned \n        on the meeting by the Government of Iraq of specific \n        benchmarks, as laid out by the President and in consultation \n        with Congress, and reflected in the commitments of the \n        Government of Iraq to the international community.\n            (13) The meeting of these benchmarks by the Government of \n        Iraq should be viewed as the condition for continued United \n        States military and economic involvement in Iraq.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress \nshould not take any action, including the elimination or reduction of \nfunds, that will impair the mission of the United States military \nforces in the field, undermine their safety or harm their effectiveness \nin pursuing their assigned missions.\n    (c) Report on Achievement of Benchmarks.--\n            (1) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act, the Commander, Multi-National Forces-\n        Iraq, having consulted with relevant United States and Iraqi \n        officials, shall submit to Congress an independent report \n        setting forth the status of the achievement of the benchmarks \n        specified in paragraph (2) and stating the Commander's \n        assessment whether or not each such benchmark has been met. The \n        Commander shall prepare and submit the report in coordination \n        with the Director of National Intelligence.\n            (2) Benchmarks.--The benchmarks specified in this paragraph \n        are as follows:\n                    (A) The assumption by Iraq of control of its \n                military.\n                    (B) The enactment and implementation of a Militia \n                Law to disarm and demobilize militias and to ensure \n                that Iraqi security forces are accountable only to the \n                central government and loyal to the constitution of \n                Iraq.\n                    (C) The completion of the review of the \n                constitution of Iraq and the holding of a referendum on \n                special amendments to the constitution of Iraq to \n                ensure equitable participation in the Government of \n                Iraq without regard to religious sect or ethnicity.\n                    (D) The completion of a provincial election law and \n                the commencement and specific preparation for the \n                conduct of provincial elections that ensures equitable \n                constitution of provincial representative bodies \n                without regard to religious sect or ethnicity.\n                    (E) The enactment and implementation of legislation \n                to ensure that the energy resources of Iraq benefit \n                Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi \n                citizens in an equitable manner.\n                    (F) The enactment and implementation of legislation \n                that equitably reforms the de-Ba'athification process \n                in Iraq.\n            (3) Testimony before congress.--Not later than 14 days \n        after the submittal to Congress of the report required by \n        paragraph (1), the Commander, Multi-National Forces-Iraq shall \n        appear before each of the appropriate committees of Congress to \n        testify with respect to the success or failure of the \n        Government of Iraq in meeting the benchmarks specified in \n        paragraph (2).
