FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the commercialization of space has played a significant \n        role in establishing the United States as an economic \n        superpower;\n            (2) vital services enabled by satellites in space, such as \n        global positioning, early ballistic missile launch warning, \n        weather observations, intelligence gathering, and global \n        communications, have played a significant role in establishing \n        the United States as a military superpower;\n            (3) access to space enables research in space science to \n        enhance our understanding of the Universe and the physical \n        sciences, and enables observations of the Earth to monitor our \n        global environment, establishing the United States as a \n        scientific and technological superpower;\n            (4) activities in space have a remarkable ability to \n        inspire future generations of Americans to study science, \n        engineering, and mathematics, enhancing the scientific and \n        technical capabilities of the United States;\n            (5) the United States is rapidly losing its share of the \n        commercial space launch market to a number of foreign nations; \n        and\n            (6) the Federal Government is currently underfunding the \n        research and development of cutting-edge technologies \n        associated with advanced space transportation systems that \n        would lead to significant decreases in the costs of access to \n        space.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCING SPACE ACCESS COSTS.\n\n    (a) Amendments.--Section 102 of the National Aeronautics and Space \nAct of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2451) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), \n        and (h) as subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i), \n        respectively;\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(c) The Congress declares that the general welfare of the United \nStates requires that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \nwork to identify and develop innovative technologies which would reduce \nthe costs of transporting payloads and personnel to and from space, \nwhile simultaneously increasing the reliability and safety of advanced \nspace transportation systems. The Congress further declares that the \ngeneral welfare of the United States requires that, to the extent \nfeasible, the Federal Government--\n            ``(1) aggressively fund the development of innovative \n        propulsion systems, high-temperature thermal protection \n        systems, integrated vehicle health monitoring systems, \n        lightweight durable airframes, and simplified launch and \n        processing operations;\n            ``(2) maintain a concerted effort in the development and \n        testing of new space transportation technologies while \n        providing sufficient funding for basic scientific research that \n        is necessary for the long-term, revolutionary advances that \n        will drastically reduce the costs of space access;\n            ``(3) enhance United States economic competitiveness by \n        facilitating United States commercial sector access to space \n        transportation technology, data, and facilities, within the \n        constraints imposed by national security considerations;\n            ``(4) enter into appropriate cooperative research and \n        development agreements with the United States academic and \n        commercial sectors to advance space transportation research, \n        development, and operations;\n            ``(5) minimize regulations that discourage academic and \n        commercial sector involvement in the development of advanced \n        space transportation technologies;\n            ``(6) utilize to the fullest extent possible expertise and \n        products available within the United States prior to seeking \n        availability from foreign nations, except in cases where such \n        utilization would be inconsistent with the United States public \n        interests;\n            ``(7) equitably promote engineering and science education \n        related to space transportation technologies, within \n        constraints of national security considerations, to as broad a \n        range of individuals as possible; and\n            ``(8) continue to closely protect the intellectual property \n        rights associated with advancements in advanced space \n        transportation systems to maintain United States \n        competitiveness in the world.''; and\n            (3) in subsection (i), as so redesignated by paragraph (1) \n        of this subsection, by striking ``subsections (a), (b), (c), \n        (d), (e), (f), and (g)'' and inserting ``this section''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 206 of the National Aeronautics \nand Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2476) is amended by striking ``section \n102(c)'' both places it appears and inserting ``section 102(e)''.\n\nSEC. 4. FURTHER ADVANCEMENT OF SPACE TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n    Section 201 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \nAuthorization Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 2466) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``is the primary'' and \n        inserting ``remains an important''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (5), by inserting ``, and must therefore \n        also be committed to further developing low-cost, frequent, and \n        reliable access to space'' after ``transportation''."
