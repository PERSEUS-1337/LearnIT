FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The proportion of the population of the United States \n        age 60 years or older is predicted to drastically increase in \n        the next 30 years as more than 76,000,000 Baby Boomers approach \n        retirement and old age.\n            (2) It is estimated that between 500,000 and 5,000,000 \n        seniors in the United States are abused, neglected, or \n        exploited each year.\n            (3) Abuse, neglect, and exploitation of seniors crosses \n        racial, social class, gender, and geographic lines.\n            (4) Each year millions of individuals in the United States \n        are victims of financial exploitation, including mail, \n        telemarketing, and Internet fraud. Many of those who fall prey \n        to such exploitation are seniors.\n            (5) It is difficult to estimate the prevalence of fraud \n        that targets seniors because cases are severely underreported \n        and national statistics on senior fraud do not exist.\n            (6) The Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that seniors \n        in the United States are less likely to report fraud because \n        they do not know to whom to report, they are ashamed to have \n        been a victim of fraud, or they do not know that they have been \n        a victim of fraud. In some cases, a senior who has been a \n        victim of fraud may not report the crime because he or she is \n        concerned that relatives may conclude that the senior no longer \n        has the mental capacity to take care of his or her own \n        financial affairs.\n            (7) According to a 2009 report by the MetLife Mature Market \n        Institute, the annual financial loss by victims of senior \n        financial abuse is estimated to be at least $2,600,000,000.\n            (8) Perpetrators of mail, telemarketing, and Internet fraud \n        frequently target seniors because seniors are often vulnerable \n        and trusting people.\n            (9) As victims of such fraudulent schemes, many seniors pay \n        a financial cost, having been robbed of their hard-earned life \n        savings, and frequently pay an emotional cost, losing their \n        self-respect and dignity.\n            (10) Perpetrators of fraud targeting seniors often operate \n        outside the United States, reaching their victims through the \n        mail, telephone lines, and the Internet.\n            (11) The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act \n        increased the power of the United States Postal Service to \n        protect consumers against persons who use deceptive mailings, \n        such as those featuring games of chance, sweepstakes, skill \n        contests, and facsimile checks.\n            (12) During fiscal year 2007, Postal Inspection Service \n        analysts prepared more than 27,000 letters and informative \n        postcards in response to mail fraud complaints. During that \n        same year, postal inspectors investigated 2,909 mail fraud \n        cases in the United States and arrested 1,236 mail fraud \n        suspects, of whom 1,118 were convicted. Postal inspectors also \n        reported 162 telemarketing fraud investigations, with 83 \n        arrests and 61 convictions resulting from such investigations.\n            (13) In 2000, the United States Senate Special Committee on \n        Aging reported that consumers lose approximately \n        $40,000,000,000 each year to telemarketing fraud, and estimated \n        that approximately 10 percent of the Nation's 14,000 \n        telemarketing firms were fraudulent. Some researchers estimate \n        that only one in 10,000 fraud victims reports the crime to the \n        authorities.\n            (14) A 2003 report by AARP found that, though the crime of \n        telemarketing fraud is grossly underreported among seniors who \n        have been victims of such fraud, seniors who are properly \n        counseled by trained peer volunteers are less likely to fall \n        victim to fraudulent practices.\n            (15) The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that the \n        threat of fraud to seniors is growing and changing. This is \n        largely due to the fact that many younger Baby Boomers have \n        considerable computer skills and criminals have responded by \n        targeting seniors through online scams like phishing and email \n        spamming, in addition to traditional telephone calls and mass \n        mailings.\n            (16) The Internet Crime Complaint Center (hereinafter \n        referred to in this paragraph as ``IC3'') is a partnership \n        between the National White Collar Crime Center and the Federal \n        Bureau of Investigation that serves as a vehicle to receive, \n        develop, and refer criminal complaints regarding cybercrime. \n        The IC3 processed more than 219,553 complaints of Internet \n        crime in 2007. From these submissions, the IC3 referred 90,008 \n        complaints of Internet crime, representing a total dollar loss \n        of $239,090,000, to Federal, State, and local law enforcement \n        agencies in the United States for further consideration.\n            (17) Consumer awareness is the best protection from fraud.\n\nSEC. 3.
