PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION IN LIFE INSURANCE \n              POLICIES BASED ON FUTURE FOREIGN TRAVEL PLANS.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--It shall be unlawful for any insurer to deny any \nperson life insurance, or to otherwise discriminate in the issuance, \ncancellation, amount of coverage, or conditions of life insurance, \nbased upon the intent of such person to engage in future lawful foreign \ntravel.\n    ``(b) Insurance Rates.--It shall be unlawful for any insurer to \ncharge rates for life insurance which are excessive or unfairly \ndiscriminatory in relation to the actuarial risk associated with future \nlawful foreign travel of such person.\n\n``SEC. 403.

The Secretary is authorized to determine \nwhether such inconsistencies exist. The Secretary may not determine \nthat any State law is inconsistent with any provision of this title if \nthe Secretary determines that such law gives greater protection to the \ninsured.\n    ``(b) State Exemptions.--The Secretary shall, by regulation, exempt \nfrom the requirements of this title any class of insurance transactions \nwithin any State if the Secretary determines that under the law of that \nState that class of transaction is subject to requirements \nsubstantially similar to those imposed under this title or that such \nlaw gives greater protection to the consumer, and that there is \nadequate provision for enforcement.\n\n``SEC. 405.
