    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) It is necessary to provide assistance to low-income utility customers to make sure they can afford to pay their energy bills.\n(b) Programs that reduce the costs of the energy utilities\u2019 California Alternate Rates for Energy, or CARE, program can support the long-term ability of the CARE program to meet the needs of low-income customers.\n(c) Installing qualifying solar energy systems in disadvantaged communities can provide local economic development benefits while advancing the state\u2019s renewable energy policies and policies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\n(d) The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Investment Plan and Communities Revitalization Act (Chapter 4.1 (commencing with Section 39710) of Part 2 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code) requires that a minimum of 25 percent of the available moneys in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund be allocated to projects that provide benefits to disadvantaged communities and 10 percent fund projects in disadvantaged communities.\n(e) It is the goal of the state to make qualifying solar energy systems more accessible to low-income and disadvantaged communities and, as in the case of the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program, to install those systems in a manner that represents the geographic diversity of the state.\n(f) It is the goal of the state to install qualifying solar energy systems that have a generating capacity equivalent to at least 300 megawatts for the express purpose of lowering the energy bills of tenants at low-income multifamily housing.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 748.5 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:\n748.5.\n(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c), the commission shall require revenues, including any accrued interest, received by an electrical corporation as a result of the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to electric utilities pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 95890 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations to be credited directly to the residential, small business, and emissions-intensive trade-exposed retail customers of the electrical corporation.\n(b) Not later than January 1, 2013, the commission shall require the adoption and implementation of a customer outreach plan for each electrical corporation, including, but not limited to, such measures as notices in bills and through media outlets, for purposes of obtaining the maximum feasible public awareness of the crediting of greenhouse gas allowance revenues. Costs associated with the implementation of this plan are subject to recovery in rates pursuant to Section 454.\n(c) The commission may allocate up to 15 percent of the revenues, including any accrued interest, received by an electrical corporation as a result of the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to electrical distribution utilities pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 95890 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, for clean energy and energy efficiency projects established pursuant to statute that are administered by the electrical corporation, or a qualified third-party administrator as approved by the commission, and that are not otherwise funded by another funding source.\nSEC. 3.\nChapter 9.5 (commencing with Section 2870) is added to Part 2 of Division 1 of the Public Utilities Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  9.5. Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program\n2870.\n(a) As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n(1) \u201cCARE program\u201d means the California Alternate Rates for Energy program established pursuant to Section 739.1.\n(2) \u201cProgram\u201d means the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program established pursuant to this chapter.\n(3) \u201cQualified multifamily affordable housing property\u201d means a multifamily residential building of at least five rental housing units that is operated to provide deed-restricted low-income residential housing, as defined in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 2852, and that meets one or more of the following requirements:\n(A) The property is located in a disadvantaged community, as identified by the California Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 39711 of the Health and Safety Code.\n(B) At least 80 percent of the households have incomes at or below 60 percent of the area median income, as defined in subdivision (f) of Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code.\n(4) \u201cSolar energy system\u201d means a solar energy photovoltaic device that meets or exceeds the eligibility criteria established pursuant to Section 25782 of the Public Resources Code.\n(b) (1) Adoption and implementation of the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program may count toward the satisfaction of the commission\u2019s obligation to ensure that specific alternatives designed for growth among residential customers in disadvantaged communities are offered as part of the standard contract or tariff authorized pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 2827.1.\n(2) Nothing in this section shall preclude electrical corporations from offering and administering a distributed energy resource program, including solar energy systems, in disadvantaged communities offered under current or proposed programs using funds provided under subdivision (c) of Section 748.5 or programs proposed to comply with paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) as approved by the commission.\n(c) The commission shall annually authorize the allocation of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) or 10 percent of available funds, whichever is less, from the revenues described in subdivision (c) of Section 748.5 for the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program, beginning with the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2016, and ending with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. The commission shall continue authorizing the allocation of these funds through June 30, 2026, if the commission determines that revenues are available after 2020 and that there is adequate interest and participation in the program.\n(d) The commission shall consider the most appropriate program administration structure, including administration by a qualified third-party administrator, selected by the commission through a competitive bidding process, or administration by an electrical corporation, in an existing or future proceeding.\n(e) Not more than 10 percent of the funds allocated to the program shall be used for administration.\n(f) (1) By June 30, 2017, the commission shall authorize the award of monetary incentives for qualifying solar energy systems that are installed on qualified multifamily affordable housing properties through December 31, 2030.

That assessment shall include the number of qualified multifamily affordable housing property sites that have a qualifying solar energy system for which an award was made pursuant to this chapter and the dollar value of the award, the electrical generating capacity of the qualifying renewable energy system, the bill reduction outcomes of the program for the participants, the cost of the program, the total electrical system benefits, the environmental benefits, the progress made toward reaching the goals of the program, the program\u2019s impact on the CARE program budget, and the recommendations for improving the program to meet its goals. The report shall include an analysis of pending program commitments, reservations, obligations, and projected demands for the program to determine whether future ongoing funding allocations for the program are substantiated. The report shall also include a summary of the other programs intended to benefit disadvantaged communities, including, but not limited to, the Single-Family Affordable Solar Homes Program, the Multifamily Affordable Solar Housing Program, and the Green Tariff Shared Renewables Program (Chapter 7.6 (commencing with Section 2831)).\n(2) Every three years, the commission shall evaluate the program\u2019s expenditures, commitments, uncommitted balances, future demands, performance, and outcomes and shall make any necessary adjustments to the program to ensure the goals of the program are being met.
