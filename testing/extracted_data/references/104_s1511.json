    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Burma Freedom and Democracy Act of \n1995''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since 1962, Burma has been ruled by a military \n        dictatorship.\n            (2) As part of a crackdown against the Burmese pro-\n        democracy movement, the State Law and Order Restoration Council \n        (SLORC) was established by the military dictatorship in 1988.\n            (3) On May 27, 1990 the people of Burma voted \n        overwhelmingly in a free election for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and \n        the National League for Democracy (NLD).\n            (4) Despite numerous pledges, the SLORC has failed to honor \n        the results of the 1990 elections.\n            (5) The United States has not sent an ambassador to Rangoon \n        in protest of the failure of the SLORC to honor the 1990 \n        elections and the continued human rights abuses suffered by the \n        Burmese people.\n            (6) In response to the massacre of thousands of Burmese \n        participating in peaceful democratic demonstrations, Congress \n        adopted a provision as part of the Customs and Trade Act of \n        1990 requiring the President to impose appropriate economic \n        sanctions on Burma.\n            (7) Currently the United States has suspended economic aid \n        to Burma, placed an embargo on arms sales, denied GSP trade \n        preferences, and decertified Burma as a narcotics cooperating \n        country.\n            (8) On April 30, 1994, the Foreign Relations Authorization \n        Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law 103-236), placed \n        Burma on the list of international ``outlaw'' states that \n        includes Libya, North Korea, and Iraq and which is set forth in \n        section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n        2227(a)), thus mandating that voluntary United States funding \n        for any United Nations agency will be automatically reduced if \n        the agency conducts programs in Burma.\n            (9) On July 15, 1994 the Senate adopted Senate Resolution \n        234 calling on the Administration to encourage members of the \n        Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to work with the \n        United States to achieve the transfer of power to the winners \n        of Burma's 1990 democratic election.\n            (10) On July 10, 1995 after six years of unlawful \n        detention, the SLORC released Nobel Peace Prize winner Daw Aung \n        San Suu Kyi, the leader of the NLD.\n            (11) Since the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, SLORC has \n        rejected her efforts to establish a timetable for dialogue and \n        national reconciliation and has denied the NLD a meaningful \n        role in a credible political process.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to support actively the prompt transition from a \n        military dictatorship to a democratic government in Burma;\n            (2) to encourage the State Law and Order Restoration \n        Committee to immediately and unconditionally release all \n        political prisoners and allow them to participate in the \n        political process;\n            (3) to recognize the individuals who won the 1990 \n        democratic election as the legitimate representatives of the \n        Burmese people; and\n            (4) to expand contact with the democratically elected \n        leaders of Burma through the United States mission in Rangoon \n        in order to facilitate the democratic process in Burma.\n\nSEC. 4.
