The Administrator \n        shall have the authority to examine the level of toxic \n        chemicals released into the environment by facilities not \n        currently subject to Federal review, inspection, or reporting \n        requirements if (A) a facility is believed to produce a high \n        level of environmental pollution, and (B) the Administrator is \n        petitioned by individuals or groups within such EHIA to conduct \n        the review.\n\n       TITLE I--IDENTIFICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL HIGH IMPACT AREAS\n\nSEC. 101. IDENTIFICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL HIGH IMPACT AREAS.\n\n    (a) Publication of Method.--Within 12 months after the enactment of \nthis Act, the Administrator shall publish for public comment the method \nfor selecting the EHIAs.\n    (b) Determination of Impacted Areas.--Within 18 months after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall publish a list \nof 20 Environmental High Impact Areas that are either counties or other \nappropriate geographic units in which high levels of chemicals are \npresent and in which the population is exposed to such chemicals. The \nAdministrator shall also take into consideration any geographical areas \nsuggested for review by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease \nRegistry, the National Center for Environmental Health, the National \nCenter for Health Statistics, other appropriate Federal agencies, and \nState and local health authorities.\n    (c) Revision and Republication.--The Administrator shall revise and \nrepublish the list described in subsection (a) of this section not less \nthan every 5 years, using data compiled for that 5-year period.\n    (d) Compilation of List.--In selecting a methodology and compiling \nor revising the list of EHIAs, the Administrator shall--\n            (1) use the most recent data available;\n            (2) take into account the relative toxicity of the toxic \n        chemicals;\n            (3) determine, with the best available data, the actual and \n        potential exposures, and toxicity of the toxic chemicals \n        present in each impacted area;\n            (4) consider and utilize all appropriate data compiled \n        pursuant to any environmental regulatory authority and other \n        sources, including but not limited to available data on lead-\n        based paint and the existence of pollutants from mobile \n        sources;\n            (5) distinguish between toxic chemicals which are (A) in a \n        contained, controlled environment such as barrels, factories, \n        warehouses, or lined landfills; and (B) released into the air, \n        water, soil or groundwater of the area; and\n            (6) take into account the impact of pollution in high \n        population density areas.\n\n                   TITLE II--ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES\n\nSEC. 201. MANDATORY INSPECTION.\n\n    To assure that facilities with the highest potential for release of \ntoxic chemicals into the environment are operating in compliance with \nall applicable environmental, health and safety standards, the \nAdministrator, and the Assistant Secretary of the Occupational Safety \nand Health Administration shall conduct compliance inspections or \nreviews of all toxic chemical facilities in Environmental High Impact \nAreas subject to their respective jurisdictions within 1 year after the \npublication of each list of EHIAs under title I.\n\n                   TITLE III--COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION\n\nSEC. 301. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS.\n\n    The Administrator shall make a technical assistance grant available \nto any individual or group of individuals in an EHIA. Such grants shall \nbe used to seek guidance from independent experts for the purpose of \nimproving understanding of environmental and health concerns related to \ndesignation as an EHIA. Not more than one grant may be made with \nrespect to each EHIA, but the grant may be renewed to facilitate public \nparticipation where necessary.\n\n       TITLE IV--IDENTIFICATION AND PREVENTION OF HEALTH IMPACTS\n\nSEC. 401. SECRETARIAL STUDY.\n\n    Within 2 years after the publication of each list of EHIAs under \ntitle I, the Secretary shall issue for public comment a report \nidentifying the methodology used and nature and extent, if any, of \nacute and chronic impacts on human health in EHIAs as compared to non-\nEHIAs, including impacts on subgroups within EHIAs. Such impacts shall \ninclude but not be limited to cancer, birth deformities, infant \nmortality rates, and respiratory diseases. The report shall be \ncoordinated by the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and \nDisease Registry and shall involve the community being assessed. The \nATSDR shall work closely with the Directors of the National Institute \nfor Environmental Health Sciences, the National Center for Health \nStatistics, and other appropriate Federal agencies to coordinate the \nreport, relying on the expertise of leading health and environmental \nscientists. The health assessment shall seek to--\n            (1) isolate the impacts of environmental pollution;\n            (2) segregate the effects of other factors such as health \n        care availability or substance abuse or diet;\n            (3) evaluate the levels below which release of toxic \n        chemicals, either individually or cumulatively, must be reduced \n        to avoid adverse impacts on human health; and\n            (4) determine the impacts of uncontrolled releases.\nIn conducting health assessments, the Administrator of the Agency for \nToxic Substances and Disease Registry and other Federal agencies shall \nconsider: the differential sensitivities to exposures for vulnerable \ngroups; the effects of low levels of a toxin over a period of time; \ncumulative and synergistic effects of multiple toxins; and \nmethodological issues for studying exposures and diseases among small \nnumbers of people, including units of measurement and analyses \nsensitive to disease clusters; and demographic information relevant for \na determination of environmental justice concerns. As a result of the \nreport in communities where the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic \nSubstances Disease Registry has determined that adverse health impacts \nexist, the agency shall also make this information readily available to \nmembers of the community by providing information directly to the \naffected communities and tribal governments in the Environmental High \nImpact Areas.\n\nSEC. 402. MORATORIUM.\n\n    If the report under section 401 finds significant adverse impacts \nof environmental pollution on human health in EHIAs, there shall be a \nmoratorium on the siting or permitting of any new toxic chemical \nfacility in any EHIA shown to emit toxic chemicals in quantities found \nto cause significant adverse impacts on human health. A new toxic \nchemical facility may be cited or permitted in such an EHIA during this \nperiod only if the Secretary and Administrator agree that--\n            (1) there will be no significant adverse impacts to human \n        health;\n            (2) the owner or operator of the facility demonstrates that \n        the facility has developed a plan to maintain a comprehensive \n        pollution prevention program; and\n            (3) the facility demonstrates that it will minimize \n        uncontrolled releases into the environment.\nThe moratorium shall continue in effect in such an EHIA until the \nAdministrator determines, upon petition of any interested party, that \nthe health-based levels identified pursuant to section 401(5) have been \nattained at the EHIA.\n\n                        TITLE V--HEALTH REMEDIES\n\nSEC. 501. HEALTH SCREENING AND TREATMENT GRANTS.\n\n    Within 1 year after the Secretary's biennial health assessment is \nreleased, in EHIAs shown to have adverse health outcomes related to \nenvironmental exposures, the Secretary shall establish a grant program \nto make available to public and nonprofit private entities awards for \nthe purposes of providing community-wide medical screening and \ndiagnostic services for environmentally related illnesses. Treatment \nservices shall be provided for community residents with environmentally \nrelated illnesses if they lack private or public health insurance, and \nshall continue as long as medically necessary. Following community \nscreening, the Secretary shall initiate a review of medical services \nwithin EHIAs to determine if the area or population would qualify as \n``medically underserved'' or a ``health professional shortage area''.\n\n                     TITLE VI--POLLUTION REDUCTION\n\nSEC. 601. POLLUTION REDUCTION AND PREVENTION GRANTS.\n\n    In EHIAs where the Secretary has determined that adverse health \noutcomes are related to environmental exposures, the Administrator \nshall immediately take efforts to reduce pollution in the area. The \nAdministrator shall first make available to States with EHIAs pollution \nreduction/prevention grants which will involve community \nrepresentatives, public health experts, local business, and government \nofficials located within the EHIA in developing effective pollution \nreduction strategies. If within 1 year, the Administrator determines \nthat significant steps have not been made to reduce pollution and risk \nto human health, the Administrator may take regulatory steps to reduce \npollution in the area.\n\n                  TITLE VII--PROMOTION OF GREEN SPACE\n\nSEC. 701. DEVELOPMENT OF PARKS OR RECREATIONAL AREAS.\n\n    Within 1 year after the Secretary's biennial health assessment is \nreleased, the Secretary of the Interior shall establish a grant program \nto make available to local public or nonprofit private entities within \nEHIAs awards for the development of parks and recreational spaces, and \nprovide guidance for promoting environmentally sound use of the land.\n\n                          TITLE VIII--FUNDING\n\nSEC. 801. FUNDING.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act such \nsums as may be necessary."
