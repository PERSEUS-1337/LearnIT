FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Approximately 1 in 5 children have a diagnosable mental \n        disorder.\n            (2) Approximately 1 in 10 children have a serious emotional \n        or behavioral disorder that is severe enough to cause \n        substantial impairment in functioning at home, at school, or in \n        the community. It is estimated that about 75 percent of \n        children with emotional and behavioral disorders do not receive \n        specialty mental health services.\n            (3) Only half of schools across the United States report \n        having formal partnerships with community mental health \n        providers to deliver mental health services.\n            (4) If a school is going to respond to the mental health \n        needs of its students, it must have access to resources that \n        provide family-centered, culturally and linguistically \n        appropriate supports and services.\n            (5) Effective school mental health programs reflect the \n        collaboration and commitment of families, students, educators, \n        and other community partners.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) revise, increase funding for, and expand the scope of \n        the Safe Schools-Healthy Students program in order to provide \n        access to more comprehensive school-based mental health \n        services and supports; and\n            (2) provide for in-service training to all school personnel \n        in--\n                    (A) the techniques and supports needed to identify \n                early children with, or at risk of, mental illness;\n                    (B) the use of referral mechanisms that effectively \n                link such children to treatment intervention services; \n                and\n                    (C) strategies that promote a school-wide positive \n                environment.\n\nSEC. 4.
