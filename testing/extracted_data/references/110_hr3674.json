FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, according to \n        the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n        (UNHCR), more than 2,000,000 Iraqis have fled their homes for \n        neighboring countries to avoid sectarian and other violence.\n            (2) According to the UNHCR, there are 2,200,000 internally \n        displaced people (IDPs) in Iraq, many lacking adequate food, \n        shelter, and other basic services;\n            (3) The security situation within Iraq reduces access to \n        the Iraqi population by Iraqi Government agencies and \n        humanitarian aid providers and greatly limits the provision of \n        aid.\n            (4) The dispersion of Iraqi refugees in poor urban areas of \n        host countries makes it exceedingly difficult for humanitarian \n        agencies to identify and reach these populations.\n            (5) Iraq itself hosts more than 43,000 refugees from other \n        countries, many of whom were refugees prior to 2003 and have \n        been displaced in Iraq for a second time, including many \n        Palestinians.\n            (6) Palestinian refugee camps in Iraq near the Syrian and \n        Jordanian borders remain in dire need of humanitarian \n        assistance.\n            (7) Many Iraqis have put their lives and those of their \n        families at risk by working for the United States Government, \n        United States companies, and nongovernmental organizations.\n            (8) Since March 2003, the United States Government has \n        admitted 1,459 Iraqi refugees, while Jordan, a resource-poor \n        country, has accepted an estimated 750,000, Syria an estimated \n        1,500,000, and other countries neighboring Iraq have received \n        hundreds of thousands more.\n            (9) Current United States policies governing the processing \n        of refugees constrain the Department of Homeland Security from \n        expediting the screening procedures and increasing the number \n        of Iraqi refugees accepted into the United States.\n            (10) The massive flow of Iraqi refugees into neighboring \n        host countries has overwhelmed existing social, economic, and \n        security capacities of such countries.\n            (11) The Government of Jordan and the Government of Syria \n        require immediate assistance to adequately assist Iraqi refugee \n        populations, to ensure an effective degree of security within \n        their respective countries, and safeguard their borders.\n            (12) Increasing destitution and poverty among displaced \n        populations provide fertile ground for extremist ideologies to \n        take root.\n            (13) The Iraq Study group predicted that ``[a] humanitarian \n        catastrophe could follow as more refugees are forced to \n        relocate across the country and the region.''.\n            (14) The humanitarian crisis in Iraq threatens to \n        destabilize the entire region and other areas as well, \n        including Central Asia and Europe.\n            (15) Jordan estimates that it needs more than \n        $1,000,000,000 in emergency assistance and Syria estimates it \n        needs more than $250,000,000 in similar assistance to \n        adequately provide for the refugee populations they are \n        hosting, ensure an effective degree of security within their \n        respective countries, and safeguard their borders.\n            (16) The United States policy is to admit at least half of \n        the refugees referred by the UNHCR. In 2007, UNHCR referred \n        more than 9,500 cases to the United States. The United States \n        pledged to resettle 7,000 Iraqi refugees in 2007, later reduced \n        to 2,000, a commitment which has yet to be met.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) Iraqi refugees and IDPs will have an impact on the \n        security of the region and the short and long-term effects of \n        their displacement must be considered within overall United \n        States Iraq policy;\n            (2) the United States must demonstrate its commitment to \n        resettle Iraqi refugees and to work with other governments, \n        including the member states of the Organization for Security \n        and Cooperation in Europe, to encourage them to do the same; \n        and\n            (3) the United States should express its gratitude and \n        support to host countries for providing humanitarian assistance \n        to Iraqi refugees, as well as to those countries that have \n        already resettled Iraqi refugees.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENTS OF POLICY.\n\n    The following shall be the policies of the United States:\n            (1) To spearhead efforts to provide for the relief of Iraqi \n        refugees and IDPs, to take the lead in funding assistance \n        requests from the UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies, and to \n        assist in the resettlement of Iraqi refugees, particularly \n        those who have risked their lives and the lives of their \n        families to assist the United States in Iraq.\n            (2) To develop immediately a comprehensive program to \n        support the host countries and meet the needs of the growing \n        Iraqi refugee and IDP populations, and appoint a high-level \n        coordinator to ensure expeditious and effective implementation \n        of such a program.\n            (3) To work with the Government of Iraq to help it improve \n        its capacity and ability to provide relief for internally \n        displaced persons in all communities throughout the country and \n        to provide assistance to Iraqi refugees in neighboring \n        countries.\n            (4) To commit to working with international partners, \n        including the United Nations, donor countries, international \n        financial institutions, and international and indigenous \n        nongovernmental organizations to assist in providing for the \n        emergency, medium, and long-term humanitarian needs of Iraqi \n        refugees and IDPs.\n\nSEC. 5.
