FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The economy and national security of the United States \n        are critically dependent upon a vibrant manufacturing base.\n            (2) The good health of the United States manufacturing \n        industry requires, among other things, unfettered access to \n        open markets abroad and fairly traded raw materials and \n        products in accord with the international legal principles and \n        agreements of the World Trade Organization and the \n        International Monetary Fund.\n            (3) Since 1994, the People's Republic of China has \n        aggressively intervened in currency markets to peg the Chinese \n        currency, known as the renminbi or yuan, at a fixed rate of \n        approximately 8.28 yuan to the United States dollar.\n            (4) Economists generally agree that this policy by the \n        People's Republic of China has resulted in substantial \n        undervaluation of the renminbi, perhaps by 40 percent or more.\n            (5) Evidence of this undervaluation can be found in the \n        large and growing annual trade surpluses of the People's \n        Republic of China, foreign-direct investment in China, and \n        rapidly increasing aggregate amount of foreign-currency \n        reserves.\n            (6) The renminbi's undervaluation acts as both a subsidy \n        for exports from the People's Republic of China and a non-\n        tariff barrier against imports into China, to the serious \n        detriment of the United States manufacturing industry.\n            (7)(A) As a member of both the World Trade Organization and \n        the International Monetary Fund, the People's Republic of China \n        has assumed a series of international legal obligations that \n        proscribe subsidization of exports and exchange-rate \n        manipulation.\n            (B) These prohibitions are most prominently set forth in \n        Articles VI, XV, and XVI of the GATT 1994 (as defined in \n        section 2(1)(B) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n        3501(1)(B)), in the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing \n        Measures (as defined in section 101(d)(12) of the Uruguay Round \n        Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(12)), and in Articles IV and \n        VIII of the International Monetary Fund's Articles of \n        Agreement.\n            (8) In addition, as a further condition of its accession \n        agreement to become a member of the World Trade Organization on \n        December 11, 2001, the People's Republic of China agreed to a \n        transitional product-specific safeguard mechanism to address \n        market disruption to an importing member's domestic industry \n        due to increased imports of products of Chinese origin.\n            (9) Despite its international legal obligations, and \n        notwithstanding extended and ongoing negotiations with the \n        United States, the People's Republic of China has given no \n        indication of any intent to correct the renminbi's \n        undervaluation in the foreseeable future.\n            (10) Under the foregoing circumstances, it is consistent \n        with the international legal obligations of the People's \n        Republic of China and with the corresponding international \n        legal rights of the United States to amend relevant United \n        States trade laws to make explicit that exchange-rate \n        manipulation is actionable as either or both a countervailable \n        export subsidy and as a cause of present or threatened market \n        disruption to United States domestic producers.\n\nSEC. 3.
