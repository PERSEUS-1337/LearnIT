FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The incidence of arson or other destruction or \n        vandalism of places of religious worship, and the incidence of \n        violent interference with an individual's lawful exercise or \n        attempted exercise of the right of religious freedom at a place \n        of religious worship pose a serious national problem.\n            (2) The incidence of arson of places of religious worship \n        is particularly acute in the context of places of religious \n        worship that serve predominantly African-American \n        congregations.\n            (3) Damage to religious property based on the religious, \n        racial, or ethnic character of that property--\n                    (A) hinders interstate commerce by impeding the \n                movement of members of targeted groups in areas of our \n                Nation and preventing them from engaging in commerce in \n                those areas on account of their race, color, religion, \n                or national origin;\n                    (B) impedes individuals in moving interstate \n                because of their race, color, religion, or national \n                origin;\n                    (C) is often committed by individuals with ties to \n                groups that operate nationwide; and\n                    (D) disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n                communities and is deeply divisive.\n            (4) Changes in Federal law are necessary to deal properly \n        with this problem.\n            (5) Although local jurisdictions have attempted to respond \n        to the challenges posed by such acts of destruction or damage \n        to religious property, the problem is sufficiently serious, \n        widespread, and interstate in scope to warrant Federal \n        intervention to assist State and local jurisdictions.\n            (6) Congress has authority pursuant to the Commerce clause \n        of the Constitution to make acts of destruction or damage to \n        religious property a violation of Federal law.\n            (7) Congress has authority pursuant to section 2 of the \n        13th amendment to make actions of private citizens motivated by \n        race, color, or ethnicity that interfere with the ability of \n        citizens to hold or use religious property without fear of \n        attack, violations of Federal criminal law.\n            (8) Congress has authority pursuant to section 2 of the \n        13th amendment to make the commission of an arson or other bias \n        motivated destruction or vandalism of a place of religious \n        worship violations of Federal criminal law.\n            (9) Congress has the authority pursuant to section 5 of the \n        14th amendment to make violent interference with a citizen's \n        free exercise of the right of religious worship through damage \n        to religious property a violation of Federal law.\n\nSEC. 3.
