All points of order against such reform legislation \n        (and against consideration of such reform legislation) are \n        waived. The motion is highly privileged in the House of \n        Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and is not \n        debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, or to a \n        motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the \n        consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the \n        vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not \n        be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n        such reform legislation is agreed to, the respective House \n        shall immediately proceed to consideration of such reform \n        legislation without intervening motion, order, or other \n        business, and such reform legislation shall remain the \n        unfinished business of the respective House until disposed of.\n            (2) Debate on such reform legislation, and on all debatable \n        motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n        to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally \n        between those favoring and those opposing such reform \n        legislation. An amendment to such reform legislation is not in \n        order. A motion further to limit debate is in order and not \n        debatable. A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the \n        consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit such \n        reform legislation is not in order. A motion to reconsider the \n        vote by which such reform legislation is agreed to or disagreed \n        to is not in order.\n            (3) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on \n        such reform legislation, and a single quorum call at the \n        conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with the \n        rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final passage of \n        such reform legislation shall occur.\n            (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the \n        application of the rules of the Senate or the House of \n        Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating \n        to such reform legislation shall be decided without debate.\n    (c) Consideration by Other House.--\n            (1) If, before the passage by one House of reform \n        legislation, that House receives from the other House such a \n        reform legislation, then the following procedures shall apply:\n                    (A) Such reform legislation of the other House \n                shall not be referred to a committee and may not be \n                considered in the House receiving it except in the case \n                of final passage as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii).\n                    (B) With respect to such reform legislation of the \n                House receiving the reform legislation--\n                            (i) the procedure in that House shall be \n                        the same as if such reform legislation had not \n                        been received from the other House; but\n                            (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on \n                        such reform legislation of the other House.\n            (2) Upon disposition of the reform legislation received \n        from the other House, it shall no longer be in order to \n        consider such reform legislation that originated in the \n        receiving House.\n    (d) Rules of the Senate and House.--This section, and sections 8 \nand 9, are enacted by the Congress--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such are \n        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but are \n        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in \n        that House in the case of a reform legislation, and supersede \n        other rules only to the extent inconsistent with such rules; \n        and\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n        procedure of that House) at any time in the same manner, and to \n        the same extent, as in the case of any other rule of that \n        House.\n\nSEC. 11.
