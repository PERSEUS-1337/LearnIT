FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Egypt is not a reliable ally in the war on terrorism.\n            (2) The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) \n        reports that only two weeks before the September 11, 2001, \n        attacks, the Egyptian Government daily newspaper Al-Akhbar \n        published a column that stated: ``The Statue of Liberty, in New \n        York Harbor, must be destroyed because of following the idiotic \n        American policy that goes from disgrace to disgrace in the \n        swamp of bias and blind fanaticism.''.\n            (3) According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, \n        the Egyptian Government weekly newspaper Al-Ahram Al-Arabi \n        published on September 22, 2001, an op-ed article that stated: \n        ``For many long years, America made many peoples in the world \n        cry. It was always [America] that carried out the acts; now, \n        acts are being carried out [against] it. A cook who concocts \n        poison must one day also taste that poison!''.\n            (4) In the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, \n        signed after the Camp David Accords, each party agreed ``to \n        ensure that acts or threats of belligerency, hostility or \n        violence do not originate from and are not committed from \n        within its territory . . . against the population, citizens, or \n        property of the other party.''.\n            (5) The Israeli Defense Forces have repeatedly found arms \n        smuggling tunnels between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. More than \n        40 tunnels were discovered in 2003. Some of these tunnels \n        originate in Egyptian army and police outposts.\n            (6) Egyptian President Mubarak publicly stated that \n        Hezbollah had a ``right'' to attack Israelis in Southern \n        Lebanon.\n            (7) The Middle East Media Research Institute reports that \n        Dr. Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, recently appointed by the Egyptian \n        Government to be the Mufti of Egypt, told a conference at the \n        University of Cairo in March 2003 that ``martyrdom operations, \n        in which the Palestinians blow up targets of the Israeli \n        occupation, are actions that are 100 percent permitted \n        according to Islamic religious law, and it is forbidden to \n        facilitate attack of a Muslim country . . . Any attempt to \n        invade Iraq is forbidden by Islamic religious law and by \n        morality, and Islam forbids it, and even commands its believers \n        to resist attempts at invasion and occupation.''.\n            (8) According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, \n        on August 17, 2001, the Egyptian Government daily newspaper Al-\n        Akhbar contained an editorial that stated: ``All that we have \n        left to say to the sons of Palestine . . . Kill your enemies \n        wherever you may find them. This is a life and death conflict \n        between you and them and it will not be over through calming \n        attempts. The only thing that will force your enemy to \n        surrender and to accept your demands is force, whatever the \n        sacrifices may be.''.\n            (9) On May 9, 2003, President Bush stated: ``Over time, the \n        expansion of liberty throughout the world is the best guarantee \n        of security throughout the world. Freedom is the way to peace. \n        . . . We're determined to help build a Middle East that grows \n        in hope, instead of resentment. Because of the ideals and \n        resolve of this Nation, you and I will not live in an age of \n        terror. We will live in an age of liberty.''.\n            (10) In November 2003 President Bush stated: ``The great \n        and proud nation Egypt . . . should show the way toward \n        democracy in the Middle East.''.\n            (11) The United States Government's Middle East Partnership \n        Initiative (MEPI) ``champions an expanded public space where \n        democratic voices can be heard in the political process, and \n        the people have a choice in governance''.\n            (12) Egypt is a dictatorship. The due process and \n        separation of powers key to any functioning democracy have been \n        stifled in Egypt since Hosni Mubarak assumed the presidency \n        more than 22 years ago. The so-called emergency powers he \n        renews every three years allow him to arrest political \n        opponents, their family and friends. Some experts believe that \n        President Mubarak's refusal to name a successor or vice \n        president suggests his intention to have his son, Gamal \n        Mubarak, succeed him.\n            (13) Egypt regularly tortures its citizens. According to \n        the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights approximately 13,000 \n        to 16,000 people are detained without charge on suspicion of \n        security or political offenses in Egypt each year. Amnesty \n        International published a report last year stating that \n        ``everyone taken into detention in Egypt is at risk of \n        torture''.\n            (14) The Washington Post reported on January 6, 2004, that \n        14 people have been allegedly tortured and killed in Egyptian \n        jails over the course of the past 2 years.\n            (15) The Coptic Christian minority of between 6 and 10 \n        million in Egypt is victimized regularly, and remains without \n        protection. The Government of Egypt has never taken \n        responsibility for the arrest and torture of more than 1,200 \n        Copts in late 1998 in the wake of sectarian violence.\n            (16) In the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, \n        each party agreed ``that the normal relationship between them \n        will include full recognition, diplomatic, economic and \n        cultural relations, termination of economic boycotts, and \n        discriminatory barriers to the free movement of people and \n        good, and will guarantee the mutual enjoyment by citizens of \n        the due process of law''.\n            (17) As a member of the Arab League, which maintains a \n        boycott against Israel, Egypt recalled its ambassador to Israel \n        in November of 2000, putting immense strain on the diplomatic \n        relations established between the two countries 25 years ago at \n        Camp David.\n            (18) In the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, \n        each party agreed that ``the Parties shall seek to foster \n        mutual understanding and tolerance and will, accordingly, \n        abstain from hostile propaganda against each other''.\n            (19) The American Jewish Committee reported that the \n        government controlled newspaper, Al-Ahkbar, published two \n        award-winning columns entitled, ``Thanks to Hitler''. The \n        Middle East Media Research Institute reported that another \n        government controlled paper, Al-Ahram, suggested that \n        ``responsibility for [the August bombing in the Iraqi city of \n        Najaf] is Western responsibility--and more specifically, \n        American''.\n            (20) The television series ``Knight Without a Horse'' was \n        broadcast on Egypt's state-run television during Ramadan 2002. \n        The television program was based on the Protocols of the Elders \n        of Zion, an anti-Semitic document that suggests that Jews are \n        planning to take over the world.\n            (21) On March 23, 2003, The Washington Post reported: ``The \n        most popular singer in Egypt is Shaaban Abdel-Rahim, an \n        illiterate man whose tape `I hate Israel' has sold more than 5 \n        million copies. One of the most successful plays, `Mama \n        America', a virulently anti-American piece by well-known artist \n        Mohammed Sobhi, has been running for months.''.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE FOR EGYPT.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for \nfiscal year 2005 and subsequent fiscal years, United States military \nassistance may not be provided for Egypt.\n    (b) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of subsection \n(a) for a fiscal year if the President determines and certifies to \nCongress that it is in the national security interests of the United \nStates to do so.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the amount of United States military assistance that \n        would have been provided for Egypt for a fiscal year but for \n        the application of section 3(a) should be provided for Egypt \n        for such fiscal year in the form of economic support fund \n        assistance under chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance \n        Act of 1961 and further that such assistance should be in \n        addition to economic support fund assistance already proposed \n        to be provided for Egypt for such fiscal year;\n            (2) funds for economic support fund assistance for Egypt \n        should not be used by the armed forces of Egypt;\n            (3) 30 days prior to the initial obligation of funds for \n        economic support fund assistance for Egypt for a fiscal year, \n        the President should certify to Congress that procedures have \n        been established to ensure that the Comptroller General will \n        have access to appropriate United States financial information \n        in order to review the uses of such funds; and\n            (4) the agreement among the United States, Egypt, and \n        Israel to decrease the overall amount of United States foreign \n        assistance for both countries should continue.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITION.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``United States military assistance'' means--\n            (1) assistance for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, \n        demining and related programs and activities, including \n        assistance under chapter 8 of part II of the Foreign Assistance \n        Act of 1961 (relating to anti-terrorism assistance) and \n        assistance under chapter 9 of part II of such Act, section 504 \n        of the FREEDOM Support Act, section 23 of the Arms Export \n        Control Act, or the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for demining \n        activities, the clearance of unexploded ordnance, the dest"
