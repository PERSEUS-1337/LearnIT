    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Dextromethorphan Abuse Reduction Act \nof 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) When used properly, cough medicines that contain \n        dextromethorphan have a long history of being safe and \n        effective. But abuse of dextromethorphan at doses that exceed \n        the recommended levels can produce hallucinations, rapid heart \n        beat, high blood pressure, loss of consciousness, and seizures. \n        The dangers multiply when dextromethorphan is abused with \n        alcohol, prescription drugs, or narcotics.\n            (2) Dextromethorphan is inexpensive, legal, and readily \n        accessible, which has contributed to the increased abuse of the \n        drug, particularly among teenagers.\n            (3) Increasing numbers of teens and others are abusing \n        dextromethorphan by ingesting it in excessive quantities. \n        Prolonged use at high doses can lead to psychological \n        dependence on the drug. Abuse of dextromethorphan can also \n        cause impaired judgment, which can lead to injury or death.\n            (4) An estimated 1,700,000 teenagers (7 percent of teens) \n        abused over-the-counter cough medicines in 2008.\n            (5) The Food and Drug Administration has called the abuse \n        of dextromethorphan a ``serious issue'' and has said that while \n        dextromethorphan, ``when formulated properly and used in small \n        amounts, can be safely used in cough suppressant medicines, \n        abuse of the drug can cause death as well as other serious \n        adverse events such as brain damage, seizure, loss of \n        consciousness, and irregular heart beat.''\n            (6) In recognition of the problem, several retailers have \n        voluntarily implemented age restrictions on purchases of cough \n        and cold medicines containing dextromethorphan, and several \n        manufacturers have placed language on packaging of cough and \n        cold medicines alerting parents to the dangers of medicine \n        abuse.\n            (7) Prevention is a key component of the effort to address \n        the rise in the abuse of dextromethorphan and other legal \n        medications. Education campaigns teaching teens and parents \n        about the dangers of these drugs are an important part of this \n        effort.\n\nSEC. 3. SALES OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING DEXTROMETHORPHAN.\n\n    (a) Sales of Products Containing Dextromethorphan.--\n            (1) In general.--Part D of title II of the Controlled \n        Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841 et seq.) is amended by adding at \n        the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 424.
