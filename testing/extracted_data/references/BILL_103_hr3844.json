FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Contaminated and underused or abandoned industrial \n        sites in distressed communities are, economically, at a \n        competitive disadvantage relative to greenfield sites, as \n        capital for their cleanup and redevelopment may not be \n        available.\n            (2) Contaminated and underused and abandoned industrial \n        properties located in distressed areas, owned by private, \n        public, or nonprofit entities, often with significant economic \n        development potential once cleaned up, are unable to secure \n        initial financing for site remediation.\n            (3) Considerable public benefits can accrue from such sites \n        once cleaned up and brought back to productive reuse, \n        especially those devoted to industrial purposes that employ \n        enviornmentally sound practices.\n            (4) Voluntary cleanup programs spur private sector cleanups \n        when the property value is sufficient and its location \n        favorable enough to make the additional costs of cleanup \n        economically feasible, but this approach does not resolve the \n        problems facing properties with little or no value, common \n        among sites located in economically distressed areas.\n            (5) Because of their experience in administering targeted \n        loan assistance programs, States are in a good position to use \n        Federal funds to capitalize revolving loan funds to support \n        local cleanup and redevelopment projects.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to revitalize distressed \ncommunities by providing loans for cleanup of certain industrial \nproperties that have the potential to attract private investment, \nfoster clean manufacturing, and create jobs for local residents.\n\nSEC. 3. REVOLVING LOAN FUND FOR CLEANUPS UNDER STATE VOLUNTARY CLEANUP \n              PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Loan Program.--The Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (hereinafter in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Administrator'') shall establish a program to provide a \ncapitalization loan to any State that submits an application that is \napproved by the Administrator to establish or expand a State revolving \nloan fund for purposes of providing loans for voluntary environmental \ncleanups of eligible facilities.\n    (b) Application for Loan.--An application for a capitalization loan \nunder this section shall be in such form as the Administrator considers \nappropriate. At a minimum, the application shall include each of the \nfollowing:\n            (1) Evidence that the State is carrying out a voluntary \n        cleanup program for eligible facilities. The Administrator \n        shall insure that the State voluntary program provides, at a \n        minium, adequate opportunities for public participation, \n        sufficient technical assistance, and oversight to ensure that \n        cleanups comply with Federal and State laws, and certification \n        to the owner and prospective purchaser that the cleanup is \n        complete.\n            (2) Evidence that the State will provide a matching share \n        of at least 20 percent of the costs of such cleanup from either \n        new or existing sources of State funding.\n            (3) A description of the State's proposed revolving loan \n        program and of the State's capability to manage the program. \n        States may use interest income or loan repayments (in an amount \n        equal to not more than 10 percent of their revolving loan fund \n        amount) for program administrative purposes. At a minimum, the \n        State's revolving loan program shall--\n                    (A) provide loans to both public and private \n                parties conducting voluntary cleanups under the State's \n                voluntary cleanup program who are unable to secure \n                loans from private lending institutions or other means \n                of financing;\n                    (B) require that borrowers demonstrate credit \n                worthiness and the ability to carry out the cleanup; \n                and\n                    (C) give priority to loans for the purpose of \n                cleaning up--\n                            (i) facilities that are planned to be \n                        reused for industrial purposes that employ \n                        environmentally sound practices; and\n                            (ii) facilities that will generate jobs for \n                        contractors whose principal place of business \n                        is the political subdivision in which the \n                        facility is located or for laborers who reside \n                        in such political subdivisions.\n            (4) A statement that the State will begin repayment of the \n        loan within 5 years after receipt of the loan, and evidence of \n        the State's ability to repay the loan.\n            (5) A statement that a loan from the revolving loan fund \n        will not be used to pay for any of the following:\n                    (A) New construction.\n                    (B) Environmental fines or penalties.\n                    (C) Speculative assessments or speculative \n                rehabilitation at facilities with little or no \n                potential for economic development.\n            (6) Such other elements as the Administrator considers \n        appropriate.\n    (c) Amount of Loan.--The Administrator shall determine the \ndistribution of funds among the eligible States. The amount of a \ncapitalization loan made by the Administrator under this Act to a State \nmay not exceed 15 percent of the amount available each year to all the \neligible States.\n    (d) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated to the \nAdministrator for purposes of making capitalization loans to States \nunder this section the sum of $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1995 and \n$7,500,000 for each of the fiscal years 1996 and 1997.\n\nSEC. 4.
