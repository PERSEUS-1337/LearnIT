CLEAN TECHNOLOGY FUND.\n\n    ``(a) Contribution Authority.--The Secretary of the Treasury may \ncontribute on behalf of the United States $400,000,000 to a fund which \nmeets the requirements of subsection (b) (in this section referred to \nas the `Fund').\n    ``(b) Requirements.--The requirements of this subsection are as \nfollows:\n            ``(1) Administration.--The Fund is established and \n        administered by the Bank.\n            ``(2) Purpose.--The purpose of the Fund is to promote \n        accelerated deployment in developing countries of technologies \n        designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing funds, \n        primarily through multilateral development banks to promising \n        projects in developing countries.\n            ``(3) Coordination with the united nations framework on \n        climate change.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The Bank is required to operate \n                the Fund in a manner that is fully consistent and \n                supportive of the United Nations Framework on Climate \n                Change (in this paragraph referred to as the `UNFCCC').\n                    ``(B) Termination of operations.--The Bank is \n                required to take necessary steps to conclude the \n                operations of the Fund (including by not entering into \n                new agreements for contributions to the Fund) on the \n                commencement of operations of an international clean \n                technology fund provided for the UNFCCC, unless the \n                UNFCCC provides for continuation of the operations.\n            ``(4) Authority to hold undisbursed funds in interest-\n        bearing accounts.--Pending disbursement from the Fund of \n        amounts provided under this section, the Bank has the authority \n        to hold the amounts in interest-bearing accounts of the Fund.\n    ``(c) Limitations on Authorization of Appropriations.--For the \ncontribution authorized by subsection (a), there are appropriated not \nmore than $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2009.\n    ``(d) Support of Zero Carbon and Cleaner Technologies.--The \nSecretary of the Treasury shall seek to ensure that--\n            ``(1) the priorities of the Fund include supporting `zero \n        carbon' technologies, and improvements in energy efficiency in \n        existing infrastructure that demonstrate an ability to be \n        transformational in support of a country's path toward low \n        carbon development;\n            ``(2) the disbursement of amounts in the Fund demonstrate a \n        preference for `zero carbon' technologies;
