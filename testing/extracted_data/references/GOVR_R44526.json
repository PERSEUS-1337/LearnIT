    "content": "The first section of this report provides an overview of the consideration of FY2017 judiciary appropriations, with subsections covering each major action, including the initial submission of the request on February 9, 2016; hearings held by the House and Senate Financial Services Subcommittees; the House subcommittee markup on May 25, 2016; the House Appropriations Committee markup on June 9, 2016; the Senate subcommittee markup on June 15, 2016; the Senate Appropriations Committee markup on June 16, 2016; House floor consideration of H.R. 5485 on July 5, July 6, and July 7, 2016; and the continuing resolutions and the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, on May 5, 2017.  The status is summarized in Table 1 . This overview is followed by a section on prior-year actions and funding. The report then provides an overview of judiciary accounts.  The Budget for Fiscal Year 2017 was submitted on February 9, 2016. It contains a request for $7.58 billion in new budget authority for judicial branch activities, including $6.99 billion in discretionary funds and $0.59 billion in mandatory funding for judges' salaries and benefits. By law, the judicial branch request is submitted to the President and included in the budget submission without change.  Neither the House nor Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Financial Services held hearings on the FY2017 judicial branch budget request. The House subcommittee announced that it would accept programmatic and language submissions from Members through March 17, 2016.  On May 25, the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government held a markup of the FY2017 Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) bill. The subcommittee recommended $7.55 billion in funds for the judiciary, including mandatory funds for judges' salaries and benefits as required under current law. On June 9, 2016, the House Appropriations Committee held a markup of the FY2017 FSGG bill. The committee recommended $7.55 billion in funds for the judiciary, including mandatory funds for judges' salaries and benefits as required under current law. The bill was ordered reported by a vote of 30-18 ( H.R. 5485 , H.Rept. 114-624 ). No amendments were offered related to the judiciary. On June 15, the Senate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government held a markup of the FY2017 FSGG bill. The subcommittee recommended $7.58 billion in funds for the judiciary, including mandatory funds for judges' salaries and benefits as required under current law. On June 16, 2016, the Senate Appropriations Committee held a markup of the FY2017 FSGG bill. The committee recommended $7.58 billion in funds for the judiciary, including mandatory funds for judges' salaries and benefits as required under current law. The bill was ordered reported by a vote of 30-0 ( S. 3067 , S.Rept. 114-280 ). No amendments were offered related to the judiciary. On July 5, the House agreed to a structured rule ( H.Res. 794 , H.Rept. 114-639 ) for consideration of the Financial Services and General Government bill ( H.R. 5485 ). One amendment (#60) related to the judiciary was made in order. The amendment would reduce funding to the Salaries and Expenses Account under the Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and other Judicial Services heading by $1 million. On July 7, amendment #60 was offered as part of en bloc amendment ( H.Amdt. 1246 ), and was passed by voice vote. H.R. 5485 , as amended, was agreed to on July 7, with a vote of 239-185 (Roll no. 398).  No further action was taken on H.R. 5485 or S. 3067 prior to the start of FY2017 on October 1, 2016. Judicial branch activities were funded through continuing appropriations resolutions ( P.L. 114-223 , P.L. 114-254 , and P.L. 115-30 ) until the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 115-31 ). Division E of this act provides $7.5 billion for the judiciary, an increase of $176.2 million (2.4%) from FY2016 and $63.0 million (-0.8%) less than the request. FY2016 judiciary funding was provided in Division E, Title 3, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ), which was enacted on December 18, 2015. The $7.344 billion provided by the act represented an increase of $73.9 million (1.0%) from FY2015 and was $184.1 million (-2.5%) less than the judiciary's request.  FY2015 judiciary funding was provided in Division E, Title 3, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ), which was enacted on December 16, 2014. The $7.261 billion provided by the act represented an increase of $221.9 million (3.2%) from FY2014 and was $37.9 million (-0.5%) less than the judiciary's request.  Neither a Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill nor a continuing appropriations resolution (CR) containing FY2014 funding was enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013. A funding gap, which resulted in a partial government shutdown, ensued for 16 days. The funding gap was terminated by the enactment of a CR ( P.L. 113-46 ) on October 17, 2013. The CR provided funding through January 15, 2014. Following enactment of a temporary continuing resolution on January 15, 2014 ( P.L. 113-73 ), a consolidated appropriations bill was enacted on January 17 ( P.L. 113-76 ), providing $7.039 billion for the judiciary for FY2014. Appropriations for the judiciary comprise approximately 0.2% of total budget authority.  Two accounts that fund the Supreme Court (the salaries and expenses of the Court and the expenditures for the care of its building and grounds, which are the responsibility of the Architect of the Capitol) together total approximately 1% of the total judiciary budget. The rest of the judiciary's budget provides funding for the lower federal courts and related judicial services.  The largest account, approximately 72% of the total FY2017 enacted level, is the Salaries and Expenses account for the U.S. Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services. This covers the \"salaries of circuit and district judges (including judges of the territorial courts of the United States), justices and judges retired from office or from regular active service, judges of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, bankruptcy judges, magistrate judges, and all other officers and employees of the federal judiciary not otherwise specifically provided for,\" and \"necessary expenses of the courts.\" Two other large accounts provide funds for Defender Services (13.9%) and Court Security (7.5%). The remaining judiciary budget is divided among the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (0.4% of FY2016 enacted), U.S. Court of International Trade (0.3%), Fees of Jurors and Commissioners (0.5%), Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (1.2%), Federal Judicial Center (0.4%), U.S. Sentencing Commission (0.2%), and Judicial Retirement Funds (2.1%).  Three specialized courts within the federal court system are not funded under the judiciary budget: the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (funded in the Department of Defense appropriations bill), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (funded in the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill), and the U.S. Tax Court (funded under Independent Agencies, Title V, of the FSGG bill). Federal courthouse construction is funded within the General Services Administration account under Independent Agencies, Title V, of the FSGG bill. The judiciary uses non-appropriated funds to help offset its funding requirements. The majority of these non-appropriated funds are from fee collections, primarily court filing fees. These monies are used to offset expenses within the Salaries and Expenses accounts of Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services. Some of these funds may be carried forward from one year to the next. These funds are considered \"unencumbered\" because they result from savings from the judiciary's financial plan in areas where budgeted costs did not materialize. According to the judiciary, such savings are usually not under its control (e.g., the judiciary has no control over the confirmation rate of Article III judges and must make its best estimate on the needed funds to budget for judgeships, rent costs, and technology funding for certain programs). The budget request and appropriations figures presented here reflect the net resources for the judiciary, and do not include these offsetting non-appropriated funds.  The judiciary also has \"encumbered\" funds\u2014no-year authority funds appropriated for specific purposes. These are used when planned expenses are delayed, from one year to the next (e.g., costs associated with office space delivery, and certain technology needs and projects). The judiciary continues its cost-containment efforts begun over a decade ago. Specific areas of focus include office space rental, personnel expenses, information technology, and operating costs.  In a press release accompanying the submission of the FY2017 budget, Judge Julia S. Gibbons, chair of the Budget Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, stressed the results and ongoing efforts of the judiciary's formal cost-containment initiatives, which began in 2004. \"Our budget request is reflective of the cost-containment policies we have put in place and reducing cost growth in the Judiciary's budget continues to be a top priority,\" said Judge Gibbons. Current efforts focus on implementation of shared administrative services among various courts, as well as reducing the judiciary's space footprint. In response to a November 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on judicial branch cost savings (GAO-16-97), the judiciary is reevaluating its methodologies and reporting practices for cost savings accounting. In 2015, Judge Gibbons reported that the judiciary has achieved a cost reduction of \"nearly $1.5 billion relative to [the] projected requirements\" over the past 10 years. In 2013, the Judicial Conference set a goal of a 3% reduction in total space. According to Judge Gibbons, as of March 2015, 30% of that goal has been reached, resulting in $5.8 million in rent savings, and the judiciary \"is on track to accomplish the full three percent reduction by the end of fiscal year 2018.\" The safe conduct of court proceedings and the security of judges in courtrooms and off-site has been a concern in recent years. Efforts to improve judicial security have been spurred by the double homicide of family members of a federal judge in Chicago in 2005; the Atlanta killings, in 2005, of a state judge, a court reporter, and a sheriff's deputy at a courthouse; the sniper shooting of a state judge in his Reno office in 2006; and the wounding of a deputy U.S. marshal and killing of a court security officer at the Lloyd D. George U.S. Courthouse and Federal Building in Las Vegas in 2010. An FY2005 supplemental appropriations act included a provision that provided intrusion detection systems for judges in their homes, and the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 aimed to enhance security for judges and court personnel, as well as courtroom safety for the public.  The judiciary has been working closely with the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to ensure that adequate protective policies, procedures, and practices are in place. The FY2017 appropriation continued a pilot program for the USMS to assume responsibility for perimeter security at selected courthouses that were previously the responsibility of the Federal Protective Service (FPS). This pilot was first authorized in FY2009 as a result of the judiciary's stated concerns that FPS was not providing adequate perimeter security. After the initial planning phase, USMS implemented the pilot program on January 5, 2009, and assumed primary responsibility for security functions at seven courthouses located in Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, New York, Tucson, and Baton Rouge (location of two of the seven courthouses). The judiciary and USMS have been evaluating the program and identifying areas for improvement. The judiciary reimburses USMS for the protective services. Following its biennial evaluation and review of judgeship needs, the Judicial Conference of the United States, in March 2017, recommended Congress create 57 new federal judgeships: 5 in the courts of appeals and 52 in the district courts. Several bills have been introduced in recent Congresses to create one or more new judgeships; no action beyond committee referral has occurred on any of the bills. The Conference made a similar request in the 114 th Congress, recommending a total of 73 new judgeships. Subsequent legislation was introduced in both the House and Senate to address this request, but no final action was taken before the 114 th Congress adjourned.\u00a0 Since the enactment of an omnibus judgeship bill in 1990 ( P.L. 101-650 ), according to the Judicial Conference, the number of appellate judgeships has remained at 179 while appellate court case filings have increased by 40%. During this same time period, Congress enacted legislation that increased the number of district judgeships by 5% (from 645 to 677) while district court case filings increased by 38%. The FY2017 judiciary budget request totals $7.53 billion. Table 2 lists the amounts enacted for FY2016, the President's FY2017 request, the House-passed level in H.R. 5485 , the committee-reported level in the Senate, and the FY2017 enacted level.  The total FY2017 request for the Supreme Court, $94.5 million, is contained in two accounts: (1) Salaries and Expenses of $79.3 million and (2) Care of the Building and Grounds of $14.9 million. The total represents a 7.0% increase over the FY2016 enacted level. The House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills provided the full request, as does P.L. 115-31 .
