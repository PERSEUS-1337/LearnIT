FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On April 20, 2010, the mobile offshore drilling unit \n        Deepwater Horizon, operated by BP, P.L.C. (in this Act referred \n        to as ``BP''), exploded and sank, triggering the oil spill that \n        is the worst environmental disaster in the history of the \n        United States.\n            (2) Since then, BP has been unsuccessful in stemming the \n        discharge of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, currently estimated \n        at a rate of up to 60,000 barrels of oil per day.\n            (3) Many who live in the area of the Gulf of Mexico are \n        dependent on the Gulf for their livelihoods.\n            (4) The fishing industry, including seafood processing and \n        related wholesale and retail businesses, supports over 200,000 \n        jobs with related economic activity of $5,500,000,000.\n            (5) As of May 25, 2010, commercial and recreational fishing \n        were prohibited within a 54,096 square-mile area, approximately \n        22 percent of Federal waters of the Gulf Exclusive Economic \n        Zone.\n            (6) The tourist industry contributed 620,000 jobs and over \n        $9,000,000,000 in wages to the Gulf region.\n            (7) The oil spill will require a dedicated and trained \n        workforce working over an extended period of time to clean up \n        and restore the damage.\n            (8) Contracts and cooperative agreements between Federal \n        agencies and State and local governments and other entities \n        empower communities and are cost-effective tools that provide \n        positive social and environmental benefits. The use of such \n        contracts and agreements should be encouraged as a means to \n        rehabilitate public land affected or altered by the BP oil \n        spill, and enhance and maintain environmentally important land \n        and water.\n            (9) Joint collaborations between the Federal agencies, \n        private businesses, and local, State, and Federal service and \n        conservation corps are particularly beneficial, as the \n        collaborations provide the opportunity to prepare for \n        productive lives while engaged in meaningful and educational \n        public service opportunities, and the public with cost-saving \n        human resources to assist in conserving, maintaining, and \n        protecting public land.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to create a Gulf Coast Conservation Corps to perform \n        rehabilitation and enhancement projects in any area of the Gulf \n        of Mexico affected by the oil discharged as a result of the \n        explosion on and sinking of the mobile offshore drilling unit \n        Deepwater Horizon by creating a workforce to collect the oil \n        discharged, and restore affected wildlife and damaged \n        ecosystems, in such areas;\n            (2) to create jobs in the Gulf of Mexico region that offer \n        unemployed individuals a chance to obtain skills and experience \n        so that they are better equipped to gain productive employment \n        related to environmental restoration; and\n            (3) to provide such individuals the opportunity to serve \n        their communities and the Country.\n\nSEC. 4.
