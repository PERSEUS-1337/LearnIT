SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the several key oil-producing countries that relied on \n        the United States for their military protection in 1990 and \n        1991, including during the Persian Gulf conflict, and continue \n        to depend on the United States for their security and \n        stability, should share in the responsibility for that \n        stability and security commensurate with their national \n        capabilities; and\n            (2) the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain, \n        Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab \n        Emirates) have the economic capability to contribute more \n        toward their own security and stability and therefore these \n        countries should contribute commensurate with that capability.\n\nSEC. 3. EFFORTS TO INCREASE BURDENSHARING BY COUNTRIES IN THE PERSIAN \n              GULF REGION BENEFITTING FROM UNITED STATES MILITARY \n              PRESENCE.\n\n    The President shall seek to have each country in the Persian Gulf \nregion to which the United States extends military protection (either \nthrough security agreements, basing arrangements, or mutual \nparticipation in multinational military organizations or operations) \ntake one or more of the following actions:\n            (1) For any country in which United States military \n        personnel are assigned to permanent duty ashore, increase its \n        financial contributions to the payment of the nonpersonnel \n        costs incurred by the United States government for stationing \n        United States military personnel in that country, with the goal \n        of achieving by September 30, 2004, 75 percent of such costs. \n        An increase in financial contributions by any country under \n        this paragraph may include the elimination of taxes, fees, or \n        other charges levied on the United States military personnel, \n        equipment, or facilities stationed in that country.\n            (2) Increase its annual budgetary outlays for national \n        defense as a percentage of its gross domestic product by 10 \n        percent or at least to a level commensurate to that of the \n        United States by September 30, 2002.\n            (3) Increase its annual budgetary outlays for foreign \n        assistance (to promote democratization, economic stabilization, \n        transparency arrangements, defense economic conversion, respect \n        for the rule of law, and internationally recognized human \n        rights) by 10 percent or at least to a level commensurate to \n        that of the United States by September 30, 2002.\n            (4) Increase the amount of military assets (including \n        personnel, equipment, logistics, support and other resources) \n        that it contributes, or would be prepared to contribute, to \n        military activities in the Persian Gulf region.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE ACTIONS BY UNITED STATES ALLIES.\n\n    In seeking the actions described in section 3 with respect to any \ncountry, or in response to a failure by any country to undertake one or \nmore of such actions, the President may take any of the following \nmeasures to the extent otherwise authorized by law:\n            (1) Reduce the end strength level of members of the Armed \n        Forces assigned to permanent or part-time duty in the Persian \n        Gulf region.\n            (2) Impose on those countries fees or other charges similar \n        to those that such countries impose on United States forces \n        stationed in such countries.\n            (3) Suspend, modify, or terminate any bilateral security \n        agreement the United States has with that country, consistent \n        with the terms of such agreement.\n            (4) Reduce (through rescission, impoundment, or other \n        appropriate procedures as authorized by law) any United States \nbilateral assistance appropriated for that country.\n            (5) Take any other action the President determines to be \n        appropriate as authorized by law.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT ON PROGRESS IN INCREASING ALLIED BURDENSHARING.\n\n    Not later than March 1, 2002, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \nto Congress a report on--\n            (1) steps taken by other countries to complete the actions \n        described in section 3;\n            (2) all measure taken by the President, including those \n        authorized in section 4, to achieve the actions described in \n        section 3;\n            (3) the difference between the amount allocated by other \n        countries for each of the actions described in section 3 during \n        the period beginning on October 1, 2001, and ending on \n        September 30, 2002, and during the period beginning on October \n        1, 2002, and ending on September 30, 2003; and\n            (4) the budgetary savings to the United States that are \n        expected to accrue as a result of the steps described under \n        paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 6.
