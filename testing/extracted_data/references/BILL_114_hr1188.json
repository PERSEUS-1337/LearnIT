The rate \n        of increase under the process established under this paragraph \n        may not exceed 30 percent per year.\n            (2) Rulemaking required.--The Board shall issue proposed \n        rules, not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, to establish the tiered approval process required \n        under paragraph (1). The tiered approval process shall \n        establish standards designed to ensure that the new business \n        lending capacity authorized under the amendment made by \n        subsection (a) is being used only by insured credit unions that \n        are well managed and well capitalized, as required by the \n        amendments made under subsection (a) and as defined by the \n        rules issued by the Board under this paragraph.\n            (3) Considerations.--In issuing rules required under this \n        subsection, the Board shall consider--\n                    (A) the experience level of the institutions, \n                including a demonstrated history of sound member \n                business lending;\n                    (B) the criteria under section 107A(a)(2) of the \n                Federal Credit Union Act, as amended by this Act;
