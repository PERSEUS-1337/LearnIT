    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Tuberculosis (TB) Now Act of \n2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Tuberculosis is one of the greatest infectious causes \n        of death of adults worldwide, killing 1.6 million people per \n        year--one person every 20 seconds.\n            (2) One-third of the world's population is infected with \n        the tuberculosis bacterium and an estimated 8.8 million \n        individuals develop active tuberculosis each year.\n            (3) Tuberculosis is the leading infectious killer among \n        individuals who are HIV-positive due to their weakened immune \n        systems, and it is estimated that one-third of people with HIV \n        infection have tuberculosis.\n            (4) Today, tuberculosis is a leading killer of women of \n        reproductive age.\n            (5) There are 22 countries that account for 80 percent of \n        the world's burden of tuberculosis. The People's Republic of \n        China and India account for 36 percent of all estimated new \n        tuberculosis cases each year.\n            (6) Driven by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, incidence rates of \n        tuberculosis in Africa have more than doubled on average since \n        1990. The problem is so pervasive that in August 2005, African \n        Health Ministers and the World Health Organization (WHO) \n        declared tuberculosis to be an emergency in Africa.\n            (7) The wide extent of drug resistance, including both \n        multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug \n        resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), represents both a critical \n        challenge to the global control of tuberculosis and a serious \n        worldwide public health threat. XDR-TB, which is characterized \n        as being MDR-TB with additional resistance to multiple second-\n        line anti-tuberculosis drugs, is associated with worst \n        treatment outcomes of any form of tuberculosis. XDR-TB is \n        converging with the HIV epidemic, undermining gains in HIV \n        prevention and treatment programs and requires urgent \n        interventions. Drug resistance surveillance reports have \n        confirmed the serious scale and spread of tuberculosis with \n        XDR-TB strains confirmed on six continents. Demonstrating the \n        lethality of XDR-TB, an initial outbreak in Tugela Ferry, South \n        Africa, in 2006 killed 52 of 53 patients with hundreds more \n        cases reported since that time. Of the world's regions, sub-\n        Saharan Africa, faces the greatest gap in capacity to prevent, \n        find, and treat XDR-TB.\n            (8) With more than 50 percent of tuberculosis cases in the \n        United States attributable to foreign-born individuals and with \n        the increase in international travel, commerce, and migration, \n        elimination of tuberculosis in the United States depends on \n        efforts to control the disease in developing countries. Recent \n        research has shown that to invest in tuberculosis control \n        abroad, where treatment and program costs are significantly \n        cheaper than in the United States, would be a cost-effective \n        strategy to reduce tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality \n        domestically.\n            (9) The threat that tuberculosis poses for Americans \n        derives from the global spread of tuberculosis and the \n        emergence and spread of strains of multi-drug resistant \n        tuberculosis and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis, which \n        are far more deadly, and more difficult and costly to treat.\n            (10) DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course) is one \n        of the most cost-effective health interventions available today \n        and is a core component of the new Stop TB Strategy.\n            (11) The Stop TB Strategy, developed by the World Health \n        Organization, builds on the success of DOTS and ongoing \n        challenges so as to serve all those in need and reach targets \n        for prevalence, mortality, and incidence reduction. The Stop TB \n        Strategy includes six components:\n                    (A) Pursuing high-quality expansion and enhancement \n                of DOTS coverage.\n                    (B) Implementing tuberculosis and HIV collaborative \n                activities, preventing and controlling multi-drug \n                resistant tuberculosis, and addressing other special \n                challenges.\n                    (C) Contributing to the strengthening of health \n                systems.\n                    (D) Engaging all health care providers, including \n                promotion of the International Standards for \n                Tuberculosis Care.\n                    (E) Empowering individuals with tuberculosis and \n                communities.\n                    (F) Enabling and promoting research to develop new \n                diagnostics, drugs, vaccines, and program-based \n                operational research relating to tuberculosis.\n            (12) The Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015: Actions for Life \n        is a comprehensive plan developed by the Stop TB Partnership \n        that sets out the actions necessary to achieve the millennium \n        development goal of cutting tuberculosis deaths and disease \n        burden in half by 2015 and thus eliminate tuberculosis as a \n        global health problem by 2050.\n            (13) While innovations such as the Global Tuberculosis Drug \n        Facility have enabled low-income countries to treat a standard \n        case of tuberculosis with drugs that cost as little as $16 for \n        a full course of treatment, there are still millions of \n        individuals with no access to effective treatment.\n            (14) As the global resource investment in fighting \n        tuberculosis increases, partner nations and international \n        institutions must commit to a corresponding increase in the \n        technical and program assistance necessary to ensure that the \n        most effective and efficient tuberculosis treatments are \n        provided.\n            (15) The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n        Malaria is an important global partnership established to \n        combat these three infectious diseases that together kill \n        millions of people a year. Expansion of effective tuberculosis \n        treatment programs constitutes a major component of Global Fund \n        investment, along with integrated efforts to address HIV and \n        tuberculosis in areas of high prevalence.\n            (16) The United States Agency for International Development \n        and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are actively \n        involved with global tuberculosis control efforts. Because the \n        global tuberculosis epidemic directly impacts tuberculosis in \n        the United States, Congress has urged the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention each year to increase its involvement \n        with international tuberculosis control efforts.\n            (17) The United States Agency for International Development \n        is the lead United States Government agency for international \n        tuberculosis efforts, working in close partnership with the \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and with the \n        President's Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS Relief. The goal of the \n        United States Agency for International Development is to \n        contribute to the global reduction of morbidity and mortality \n        associated with tuberculosis by building country capacity to \n        prevent and cure tuberculosis and achieve global targets of 70 \n        percent case detection and 85 percent treatment success rates. \n        The United States Agency for International Development provides \n        support for tuberculosis programs in countries that have a high \n        burden of tuberculosis, a high prevalence of tuberculosis and \n        HIV, and a high risk of MDR-TB.\n\nSEC. 3.
