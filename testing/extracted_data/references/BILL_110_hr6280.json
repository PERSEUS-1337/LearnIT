SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS AND PURPOSES; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``America's \nAffordable Health Care Act of 2008''.\n    (b) Findings and Purposes.--\n            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n                    (A) The regulation of the practice of insurance is \n                a State prerogative.\n                    (B) It is in the interests of health care consumers \n                that Congress allows for policies that increase the \n                affordability of health insurance products.\n                    (C) The Federal government provides States and the \n                medical community with public financing to support the \n                medical needs of the uninsured.\n                    (D) There is a correlation between the amount of \n                insurance benefits and the cost of insurance products.\n                    (E) State mandate laws have created barriers to \n                affordable health coverage.\n                    (F) A number of States allow for the creation of \n                insurance products that recognize the increased costs \n                associated with mandate laws.\n                    (G) Consumers throughout the United States are \n                finding it increasingly hard to secure affordable \n                health care coverage which contributes to the national \n                uninsured rate.\n            (2) Federal insurance product.--Congress further finds that \n        it is in the interests of taxpayers, health care purchasers, \n        and the health care provider community, to allow for a class of \n        federally certified insurance products that can be purchased in \n        the individual market without being subject to State benefit \n        mandate laws.\n            (3) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n                    (A) to promote increased affordability and access \n                to health care coverage for citizens of the United \n                States;\n                    (B) to allow consumers the ability to make choices \n                by weighing insurance benefits with the cost of \n                insurance;\n                    (C) to provide incentives to health plans and \n                health insurance issuers to offer increasingly \n                affordable insurance policies to all those in the \n                individual market;\n                    (D) to provide low-income and uninsured workers \n                with incentives to purchase insurance policies;\n                    (E) to provide incentives to companies and States \n                to offer health care solutions for high-risk \n                beneficiaries;\n                    (F) to provide for new coverage opportunities to \n                solve the problems of affordability and uninsurance; \n                and\n                    (G) to promote the availability of health insurance \n                coverage through high-risk pools for individuals whose \n                health conditions create barriers to such coverage.\n    (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1.
