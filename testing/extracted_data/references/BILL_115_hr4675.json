LOW-DOSE RADIATION RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subtitle G of title IX of the Energy Policy Act of \n2005 (42 U.S.C. 16311 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section \n977 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 977A. LOW-DOSE RADIATION RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall carry out a basic research \nprogram on low-dose radiation to--\n            ``(1) enhance the scientific understanding of, and reduce \n        uncertainties associated with, the effects of exposure to low-\n        dose radiation; and\n            ``(2) inform improved risk-assessment and risk-management \n        methods with respect to such radiation.\n    ``(b) Program Components.--In carrying out the program required \nunder subsection (a), the Secretary shall--\n            ``(1) formulate scientific goals for low-dose radiation \n        basic research in the United States;\n            ``(2) identify ongoing scientific challenges for \n        understanding the long-term effects of ionizing radiation on \n        biological systems;\n            ``(3) develop a long-term strategic and prioritized basic \n        research agenda to address such scientific challenges in \n        coordination with other research efforts;\n            ``(4) identify and, to the extent possible, quantify, \n        potential monetary and health-related benefits to Federal \n        agencies, the general public, industry, research communities, \n        and other users of information produced by such research \n        program;\n            ``(5) leverage the collective body of knowledge from \n        existing low-dose radiation research; and\n            ``(6) engage with other Federal agencies, research \n        communities, and potential users of information produced under \n        this section, including institutions concerning radiation \n        research, medical physics, radiology, health physics, and \n        emergency response.\n    ``(c) Coordination.--In carrying out the program, the Secretary, in \ncoordination with the Physical Science Subcommittee of the National \nScience and Technology Council, shall--\n            ``(1) support the directives under section 106 of the \n        American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 6601 \n        note);\n            ``(2) ensure that the Office of Science of the Department \n        of Energy consults with the National Aeronautics and Space \n        Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the \n        Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Defense, the \n        Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Homeland \n        Security;\n            ``(3) advise and assist the National Science and Technology \n        Council on policies and initiatives in radiation biology, \n        including enhancing scientific knowledge of the effects of low-\n        dose radiation on biological systems to improve radiation risk-\n        assessment and risk-management methods; and\n            ``(4) identify opportunities to stimulate international \n        cooperation relating to low-dose radiation and leverage \n        research and knowledge from sources outside of the United \n        States.\n    ``(d) Research Plan.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on \nScience, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a 4-year \nresearch plan that identifies and prioritizes basic research needs \nrelating to low-dose radiation. In developing such plan, the Secretary \nshall incorporate the components described in subsection (b).\n    ``(e) Definition of Low-Dose Radiation.--In this section, the term \n`low-dose radiation' means a radiation dose of less than 100 \nmillisieverts.\n    ``(f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to subject any research carried out by the Secretary for the \nprogram under this section to any limitations described in 977(e) of \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16317(e)).\n    ``(g) Funding.--For purposes of carrying out this section, the \nSecretary is authorized to make available from funds provided to the \nBiological and Environmental Research Program--\n            ``(1) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2018;\n            ``(2) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2019;\n            ``(3) $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2020; and\n            ``(4) $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2021.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents for subtitle G of \ntitle IX of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended by inserting after \nthe item relating to section 977 the following:\n\n``977A. Low-dose radiation research program.''.\n\nSEC. 3. SPENDING LIMITATION.\n\n    No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out \nthis Act and the amendments made by this Act, and this Act and such \namendments shall be carried out using amounts otherwise available for \nsuch purpose.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives February 13, 2018.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L.
