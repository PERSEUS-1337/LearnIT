    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Regulatory Information Presentation \nAct of 1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is a substantial lack of consistency in the \n        presentation of information explaining and supporting Federal \n        rulemaking actions when such information is published with \n        proposed and final rules in the Federal Register.\n            (2) This lack of consistency makes it more difficult for \n        the public and Congress to understand rulemaking actions and \n        their justification and to locate particular relevant \n        information.\n            (3) Presidential Executive Order 12866, promulgated \n        September 30, 1993, specifies certain analytical components for \n        Federal rulemaking that provide a useful design for consistent \n        organization of the information presented in Federal Register \n        rulemaking notices.\n            (4) Such a consistent format will facilitate congressional, \n        executive branch, and public review of proposed rulemaking \n        actions.\n\nSEC. 3. FORMATTING OF RULEMAKING ENTRIES IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER.\n\n    (a) Significant Rules.--This section applies to each significant \nrule that is published in the Federal Register as a general notice of \nproposed rulemaking, or as a final or interim final substantive rule, \nunder section 553 of title 5, United States Code.\n    (b) Information To Be Included in Proposed, Interim Final, and \nFinal Rules.--Each agency shall, in accordance with a uniform format to \nbe established (after public notice and an opportunity for public \ncomment) by the Office of the Federal Register, include in the preamble \n(the ``Supplementary Information'') to each such significant rule, both \nas a proposed and as a final or interim final rule, the information \nspecified in this subsection.\n            (1) Rulemaking status.--\n                    (A)(i) The agency shall describe whether, and if so \n                the reason that, the rule has been determined to be--\n                            (I) a significant rule; or\n                            (II) a major rule under section 804(2) of \n                        title 5, United States Code.\n                    (ii) If the agency determines that a rule is not a \n                significant rule, the agency shall provide the reasons \n                and justifications for such determination using each of \n                the factors described in section 5(3).\n                    (B) The agency shall identify the nature and timing \n                of any applicable legal deadline or other good cause \n                for the issuance of the rule more quickly than the \n                normal work schedule would provide.\n                    (C) The agency shall provide an explanation as to \n                whether the President, the Vice President, or any \n                official in the Executive Office of the President has \n                waived any provision of any relevant Executive order or \n                related policy directive applicable to the rulemaking. \n                If any cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, or other \n                evaluation of the rule prepared by the agency displays \n                an important gap in the analytical information relied \n                upon therein, the agency shall provide an explanation \n                as to why it is or is not feasible or reasonable to \n                delay the rulemaking until those gaps in information \n                are filled.\n            (2) Regulatory policy officer.--The agency shall provide \n        the name, telephone number, and position of the regulatory \n        policy officer of the agency responsible at each stage of the \n        regulatory process for fostering the development of effective, \n        innovative, and least burdensome regulations and furthering the \n        principles set forth in any relevant Executive order or related \n        policy directive related to rulemaking.\n            (3) Consultation.--The agency shall describe any \n        consultations with stakeholders, formal advisory bodies, and \nState, local, or tribal governments under title II of Public Law 104-4 \n(2 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) or other applicable authority, identifying the \nindividuals involved and the issues discussed.\n            (4) Need.--The agency shall identify any applicable law \n        requiring the specific rulemaking and separately describe any \n        compelling public need for undertaking the rulemaking, \n        including a detailed explanation of the need for preempting, or \n        regulating instead of, State, local, or tribal governments.\n            (5) Legal authority.--The agency shall identify the \n        specific statutory provisions authorizing the rule, the overall \n        regulatory program involved, and the scope of the statutory \n        discretion of the agency, if any, to regulate and the degree to \n        which the agency is regulating. Except in cases in which the \n        rule has no legal effect other than to implement the literal \n        wording of the applicable law, the agency shall include in the \n        preamble a legal analysis identifying the scope of discretion \n        available to the agency in undertaking the rulemaking.\n            (6) Alternatives considered.--The agency shall identify the \n        principal regulatory alternatives considered by the agency \n        before determining which alternative to propose for public \n        comment, or to adopt in the final or interim final rule.\n            (7) Alternative selected.--Based on the criteria set forth \n        in title II of Public Law 104-4 (2 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and any \n        relevant Executive order or related policy directive related to \n        rulemaking, the agency shall identify and explain in reasonable \n        detail the reasons why the agency selected the alternative to \n        be adopted or adopted in the rule.\n            (8) Costs.--The agency shall estimate the direct and \n        indirect costs of the rule, which shall be stated to the extent \n        reasonably possible as monetized costs, quantified costs, or \n        qualitative costs, in that order.\n            (9) Impacts.--The agency shall identify the entities that \n        will be significantly impacted through compliance with the \n        rule, and shall evaluate and describe the nature of the impacts \n        that are anticipated to be caused by the costs to be imposed or \n        other actions the entities are anticipated to take in order to \n        come into compliance with the rule. The agency shall summarize \n        any analysis or evaluation conducted under title II of Public \n        Law 104-4 (2 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) or chapter 6 of title 5, \n        United States Code, or if the agency did not conduct such an \n        analysis or evaluation, provide an explanation as to why an \n        analysis or evaluation was not performed.\n            (10) Benefits.--The agency shall estimate the direct and \n        indirect benefits of the rule. These benefits shall be stated \n        to the extent possible as monetized benefits, quantified \n        benefits, or qualitative benefits.\n            (11) Certification of compliance.--The agency shall state \n        whether any official in the Executive Office of the President \n        carried out a review of the rule under any relevant Executive \n        order or related policy directive related to rulemaking. If \n        such a review has been carried out, the agency shall briefly \n        describe the individuals involved, the timing of the review \n        process, the procedural actions taken by those involved, and \n        the nature of any issues raised in the course of such review. \n        If any such official found the issuance of the rule to be \n        consistent with the regulatory principles set forth in such \n        Executive order or related policy directive related to \n        rulemaking, the agency shall identify the official, and \n        describe the nature of the communication involved.\n    (c) Additional Information To Be Included in Interim Final and \nFinal Rules.--\n            (1) In general.--Each agency shall, in accordance with a \n        uniform format to be established (after public notice and \n        opportunity for public comment) by the Office of the Federal \n        Register, include in the preamble (the ``Supplementary \n        Information'') to each such significant rule, as a final or \n        interim final rule, the information specified in this \n        subsection.\n            (2) Significant issues.--\n                    (A) Each agency shall provide a brief description \n                of the significant issues raised--\n                            (i) by the public in a statement placed in \n                        the rulemaking file;\n                            (ii) in consultations described in \n                        subsection (b)(3) by formal advisory bodies; \n                        and\n                            (iii) by any official in the Executive \n                        Office of the President carrying out a review \n                        under any relevant Executive order or related \n                        policy directive related to rulemaking.\n                    (B) If, under subparagraph (A)(iii), an official \n                did not raise any significant issue, the agency shall \n                provide a description to that effect. The agency shall \n                identify and describe any important gap in analytical \n                information relied upon in any cost-benefit analysis, \n                risk assessment, or other evaluation of the rule \n                prepared by the agency, and any assumptions and \n                justification for such assumptions that were used to \n                fill those gaps.\n            (3) Conflict resolution.--The agency shall describe in \n        reasonable detail, both concerning the specific review \n        procedures used and also the substantive concerns raised--\n                    (A) whether the rule was returned to the agency for \n                reconsideration by any official in the Executive Office \n                of the President, the nature of any reasons for such \n                return, and the nature of the response of the agency to \n                such return;\n                    (B) the nature of any involvement by the President \n                or Vice President or their respective staff in \n                reviewing the rule, or any earlier version of the rule, \n                submitted for review by any official in the Executive \n                Office of the President under any relevant Executive \n                order or related policy directive related to \n                rulemaking; and\n                    (C) the nature of the resolution of any \n                disagreement involved in such review or return.\n            (4) Significant substantive changes.--\n                    (A) The agency shall provide a brief description of \n                any substantive changes to the rule made--\n                            (i) following the end of the period for \n                        public comment and the submission of the draft \n                        final or interim final rule for review by any \n                        official in the Executive Office of the \n                        President under any relevant Executive order or \n                        related policy directive related to rulemaking; \n                        and\n                            (ii) during any review of the draft final \n                        or interim final rule by any official in the \n                        Executive Office of the President under any \n                        relevant Executive order or related policy \n                        directive related to rulemaking.\n                    (B) The agency shall identify the individual \n                primarily responsible for suggesting any such \n                substantive change, if such individual is not within \n                the program office directly responsible for drafting \n                the rule.\n            (5) Cost-benefit determination.--To the extent permitted by \n        law and as applicable, the agency shall provide a reasoned \n        statement explaining the way in which the estimated benefits of \n        the rule justify its estimated costs, as described under \n        subsections (b)(8) and (b)(10), and any other impacts, as \n        described under subsection (b)(9). To the extent that the \n        agency relies upon qualitative benefits to justify the action \n        of the agency, the agency shall also describe the subjective \n        nature and uncertainties inherent in such a statement of \n        qualitative benefits.\n    (d) Good Cause Exception.--When the agency for good cause finds, \nand incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor \nin the rule, that providing any portion of the information required by \nsubsections (b) and (c) is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to \nthe public interest, the agency may issue the rule without providing \nsuch portion of the information required. The agency shall identify in \nthe preamble to the rule the portion of the information that is not \nbeing provided and shall state the reasons for not providing the \npreamble and when the preamble will be provided. The agency shall make \nevery reasonable effort to provide such information before the \neffective date of the rule.\n\nSEC. 4.
