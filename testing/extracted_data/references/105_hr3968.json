FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress hereby finds the following:\n            (1) Congressional hearings have documented that there are \n        enormous national interest economic implications of the Year \n        2000 technology challenge for critical national \n        infrastructures, including banking and finance, energy, \n        telecommunications, transportation, and vital human services.\n            (2) The private sector costs of year 2000 remediation are \n        likely to be significant with the Board of Governors of the \n        Federal Reserve System estimating, in recent congressional \n        testimony, such costs at roughly $50,000,000,000.\n            (3) Although critical national infrastructures are \n        interdependent, with domestic and international banking \n        operations heavily dependent on telecommunications and power \n        infrastructures, there is neither a national nor an \n        international framework for ensuring that all such \n        infrastructures will be ready for the Year 2000.\n            (4) In an April 1998 report to Congress entitled, ``Year \n        2000 Computing Crisis: Potential for Widespread Disruption \n        Calls for Strong Leadership and Partnerships,'' the General \n        Accounting Office recommended that the President's Council on \n        Year 2000 Conversion quickly formulate a comprehensive picture \n        of the Nation's Year 2000 readiness and establish an effective \n        approach to promote public-private partnerships to resolve the \n        Nation's Year 2000 crisis.\n\nSEC. 3.
