FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) For most of the past 16 years, the number of Americans \n        without health insurance has been on the rise, reaching more \n        than 41,000,000 in 2002.\n            (2) People without health insurance are less likely to get \n        preventive care and often delay or forgo needed care. They are \n        therefore more likely than those with health insurance to be \n        hospitalized for conditions that could have been avoided.\n            (3) Not only are the health and financial circumstances of \n        uninsured Americans adversely affected by the lack of health \n        insurance, their care is ultimately being paid for in the least \n        efficient manner: after they get sick.\n            (4) People who were uninsured during any part of 2001 \n        received $99,000,000,000 in care, of which $34,500,000,000 was \n        not paid for either out of pocket or by a private or public \n        insurance source. Federal, State, and local governments covered \n        85 percent of such uncompensated care, amounting to \n        $30,000,000,000.\n            (5) Private health insurance enrollees also help pay for \n        uncompensated care through higher premiums.\n            (6) Covering more Americans will not only contribute to \n        better overall health, it will lower the amount of health care \n        costs assumed by taxpayers, businesses, and consumers.\n            (7) Helping small businesses gain access to affordable \n        health care benefits is essential to insuring more Americans.\n            (8) Eighty-two percent of uninsured people are part of \n        working families.\n            (9) More than \\1/2\\ of small businesses with less than 50 \n        employees do not offer their employees health insurance.\n            (10) Innovative community-based solutions have developed \n        and should serve as a model for insuring more Americans.\n\nSEC. 3.
