FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States lags behind many of the other \n        industrialized nations in understanding the relationship of \n        design principles to the conceptualization and development of \n        high quality products and systems and to research and design \n        methodologies.\n            (2) Innovative and excellent design is critical to the \n        successful development, manufacturing, and marketing of \n        products and systems.\n            (3) Since 70 percent or more of the costs of product, \n        process, and system development, manufacture, and use is \n        determined during the initial design stage, design must be a \n        critical factor from the beginning of product development.\n            (4) A strong domestic design engineering capability can \n        reduce costs and enhance competitiveness.\n            (5) Excellence in design, including integrating \n        environmental objectives at the beginning of the production \n        process, improves the quality of life by creating useful, safe, \n        and attractive products and systems and by conserving \n        nonrenewable resources through the efficient use of materials \n        and the reduction of the generation of waste.\n            (6) Information technologies and concurrent engineering \n        processes can aid the concurrent design process. Information \n        technologies can also provide links among different industry \n        sectors.\n            (7) Greater efforts should be made to exhibit and promote, \n        both domestically and internationally, well-designed United \n        States products and systems.\n            (8) The United States, unlike many of its foreign economic \n        competitors, lacks a national strategy to promote and recognize \n        design excellence in its products and systems.\n            (9) Excellence in design can be enhanced through a \n        combination of efforts of the private and public sectors.\n            (10) A national design program to promote excellence in the \n        design of United States products and systems can enhance the \n        competitiveness of United States products and systems and \n        expand trade and economic opportunities for the people of the \n        United States.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to establish a United States Design Council as an \n        advisory committee within the Department of Commerce;\n            (2) to educate United States businesses with respect to the \n        importance of innovation and excellence in design to \n        competitiveness;\n            (3) to promote programs of research, development, and \n        technology transfer related to promoting understanding of the \n        principles and processes of design and design engineering; and\n            (4) to assist government agencies in developing and \n        encouraging innovation and excellence in design in their own \n        facilities and programs and by suppliers of products and \n        systems.\n\nSEC. 2.
