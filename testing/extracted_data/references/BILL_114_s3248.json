FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Incentives and encouragement for the conservation and \n        appropriate handling of nutrients contained in organic matter \n        are necessary.\n            (2) Biogas systems will save Federal, State, and local \n        taxpayers money by converting waste into useful products, such \n        as fuel, fertilizer, thermal heat, feedstock for hydrogen fuel \n        cells, and renewable chemicals.\n            (3) Manure resource recovery systems will save Federal, \n        State, and local taxpayers money by recovering the nutrients \n        contained in organic matter from their source, rather than \n        recovering the nutrients after they have entered landfills or \n        waterways.\n\nSEC. 3. ENERGY CREDIT FOR QUALIFIED BIOGAS PROPERTY AND QUALIFIED \n              MANURE RESOURCE RECOVERY PROPERTY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 48(a)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 is
