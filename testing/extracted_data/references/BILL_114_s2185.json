FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) breast cancer is the most common cancer among women of \n        the United States, except for skin cancers;\n            (2) today, about 1 in 8, or 12 percent of, women in the \n        United States will develop invasive breast cancer, which is an \n        increase from 1 in 11, or 9 percent of, women in 1975;\n            (3) breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n        death in women;\n            (4) the chance of dying from breast cancer is about 1 in \n        36;\n            (5) thanks to earlier detection, increased awareness, and \n        improved treatment, death rates from breast cancer have \n        decreased since 1989;\n            (6) there is a strong interest among the people of the \n        United States to do more to tackle breast cancer;\n            (7) the National Cancer Institute estimates that \n        $18,100,000,000 was spent in the United States on breast cancer \n        care in 2014;\n            (8) finding a cure for breast cancer is a goal of the \n        United States Government;\n            (9) the National Institutes of Health dedicated an \n        estimated $674,000,000 for breast cancer research in fiscal \n        year 2014;\n            (10) in fiscal year 2014, the Breast Cancer Research \n        Program of the Department of Defense received $120,000,000;\n            (11) while the National Institutes of Health and the \n        Department of Defense program on breast cancer research remain \n        the largest funders of breast cancer research in the United \n        States, funding for the National Cancer Institute was reduced \n        by nearly $66,000,000 between 2011 and 2013;\n            (12) the funding level for the Department of Defense Breast \n        Cancer Research Program has remained consistent since 2012, but \n        this amount represents a 20-percent decrease from 2011 funding \n        levels;\n            (13) additional private sector support for breast cancer \n        research will help find cures for breast cancer even faster;\n            (14) it is estimated that, in the United States, 231,840 \n        women will be diagnosed with, and 40,290 women will die of, \n        breast cancer in 2015;\n            (15) on average, every 13 minutes a woman dies of breast \n        cancer in the United States;\n            (16) due to disease type and lack of adequate care, \n        African-American women have the highest death rates of all \n        racial and ethnic groups overall and are at least 44-percent \n        more likely to die of breast cancer than women of other racial \n        and ethnic groups;\n            (17) breast cancer used to be considered a disease of aging \n        but recent trends show that more aggressive forms of the \n        disease have been increasingly diagnosed in younger women;\n            (18) breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer \n        among nearly every racial and ethnic group, including African-\n        American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific \n        Islander, and Hispanic/Latina women;\n            (19) clinical advances resulting from research have led to \n        increased survival rates from breast cancer;\n            (20) since 1990, death rates from breast cancer have \n        dropped more than 34 percent;\n            (21) it is estimated that there will be 2,350 new cases of \n        invasive breast cancer and 440 breast cancer deaths among men \n        in the United States in 2015;\n            (22) at this time there are more than 3,100,000 breast \n        cancer survivors in the United States;\n            (23) it is estimated that breast cancer costs \n        $12,500,000,000 in lost productivity;\n            (24) the losses of productivity due to breast cancer will \n        increase with the projected growth rate and aging of the \n        population of the United States if cancer mortality rates stay \n        constant in the future;\n            (25) there is a better chance of survival, and there are \n        more treatment options available, with early stage detection \n        through mammograms and clinical breast exams;\n            (26) breast cancer is the most common cancer in women \n        worldwide, with an estimated 1,700,000 new cases of breast \n        cancer among women worldwide in 2012;\n            (27) the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (hereafter in \n        this Act referred to as ``BCRF'') is considered one of the most \n        efficient cancer research charities;\n            (28) of every dollar donated to BCRF, 91 cents goes to \n        research and awareness programs, 88 cents towards research and \n        3 cents towards awareness;\n            (29) founded in 1993, BCRF has raised more than \n        $500,000,000 to fuel discoveries in tumor biology, genetics, \n        prevention, treatment, survivorship, and metastasis, making \n        BCRF one of the largest private funders of breast cancer \n        research in the world; and\n            (30) in 2014 and 2015, BCRF committed $58,600,000 in \n        research, including $11,600,000 to the international Evelyn H. \n        Lauder Founder's Fund focused on metastasis, to support the \n        work of more than 220 researchers at leading medical \n        institutions across 6 continents, including 25 States and 14 \n        countries.\n\nSEC. 3.
