FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Each year more than 350,000 adults suffer cardiac \n        arrest, usually away from a hospital. More than 95 percent of \n        them will die, in many cases, because lifesaving defibrillators \n        arrive on the scene too late, if at all.\n            (2) These cardiac arrest deaths occur primarily from occult \n        underlying heart disease and from drownings, allergic or \n        sensitivity reactions, or electrical shocks.\n            (3) Survival from cardiac arrest requires successful early \n        implementation of a chain of events--the chain of survival \n        which begins when the person sustains a cardiac arrest and \n        continues until the person arrives at the hospital.\n            (4) A successful chain of survival requires the first \n        person on the scene to take rapid and simple initial steps to \n        care for the patient and to assure the patient promptly enters \n        the emergency medical services system.\n            (5) The first persons on the scene when an arrest occurs \n        are typically lay persons who are friends or family of the \n        victim, fire services, public safety personnel, basic life \n        support emergency medical services providers, teachers, \n        coaches, and supervisors of sports or other extracurricular \n        activities, providers of day care, schoolbus drivers, \n        lifeguards, attendants at public gatherings, coworkers, and \n        other leaders within the community.\n            (6) A coordinated Federal response is necessary to ensure \n        that appropriate and timely lifesaving interventions are \n        provided to persons sustaining nontraumatic cardiac arrest. The \n        Federal response should include, but not be limited to--\n                    (A) significantly expanded research concerning the \n                efficacy of various methods of providing immediate out-\n                of-hospital lifesaving interventions to the \n                nontraumatic cardiac arrest patient;\n                    (B) the development of research-based, nationally \n                uniform, easily learned and well retained model core \n                educational content concerning the use of such \n                lifesaving interventions by health care professionals, \n                allied health personnel, emergency medical services \n                personnel, public safety personnel, and other persons \n                who are likely to arrive immediately at the scene of a \n                sudden cardiac arrest;\n                    (C) an identification of the legal, political, \n                financial, and other barriers to implementing these \n                lifesaving interventions; and\n                    (D) the development of model State legislation to \n                reduce identified barriers and to enhance each State's \n                response to this significant problem.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH MODEL PROGRAM ON THE FIRST LINKS \n              IN THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL.\n\n    Section 421 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285b-3) is \namended by adding at the end the following subsection:\n    ``(c) Programs under subsection (a)(1)(E) (relating to emergency \nmedical services and preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, and \nrehabilitative approaches) shall include programs for the following:\n            ``(1) The development and dissemination, in coordination \n        with the emergency services guidelines promulgated under \n        section 402(a) of title 23, United States Code, by the \n        Associate Administrator for Traffic Safety Programs, Department \n        of Transportation, of a core content for a model State \ntraining program applicable to cardiac arrest for inclusion in \nappropriate current emergency medical services educational curricula \nand training programs that address lifesaving interventions, including \ncardiopulmonary resuscitation.
