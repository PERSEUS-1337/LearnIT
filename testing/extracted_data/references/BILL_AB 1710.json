Despite a federal tax credit and the state\u2019s vehicle incentive, the higher initial costs for zero-emission vehicles remain a barrier for many of the state\u2019s consumers.\n(b)Some advanced-technology light-duty vehicles require new infrastructure to enable convenient and cost-effective fueling, which can be a barrier to vehicle sales. This can include fueling infrastructure in homes, workplaces, and public spaces.\n(c)Market penetration is slowed due to a lack of information for consumers on the benefits and availability of vehicles and the incentives available when they are ready to purchase or lease a vehicle.\n(d)While the state has taken a leadership role to develop programs to assist the deployment of plug-in electric vehicles and fuel-cell electric vehicles in disadvantaged communities, any long-term plan designed by the state needs to address new and used car sales in disadvantaged communities.\nSEC. 2.\nChapter 8.8 (commencing with Section 44269) is added to Part 5 of Division 26 of the\nHealth and Safety Code\n, to read:\n8.8.\nAdvanced-Technology Light-Duty Vehicles\n44269.\n(a)On or before January 1, 2019, the state board, in coordination with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission and the Department of Transportation, shall develop and implement a comprehensive program to promote advanced-technology light-duty vehicle deployment in the state to drastically increase the use of those vehicles and to meet the goals established by the Governor and the Legislature, including, but not limited to, the ZEV Action Plan by the Governor\u2019s Interagency Working Group on Zero-Emission Vehicles and the Charge Ahead California Initiative (Chapter 8.5 (commencing with Section 44258)).\n(b)The program established pursuant to this chapter shall include all of the following:\n(1)Long-term market signals.\n(2)Sustainable funding mechanisms.\n(3)A portfolio of approaches.\n(4)Support for low-income deployment in disadvantaged communities, as identified in Section 39711.\n(c)The program established pursuant to this chapter may include, but need not be limited to, any of the following:\n(1)On-road incentives.\n(2)Point-of-sale incentives.\n(3)Consumer tax incentives.\n(4)In-home and parking infrastructure incentives."
