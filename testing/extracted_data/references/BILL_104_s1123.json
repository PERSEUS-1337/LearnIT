FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) cigarette smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco \n        products continue to represent major health hazards to the \n        Nation, causing more than 420,000 deaths each year;\n            (2) cigarette smoking continues to be the single most \n        preventable cause of death and disability in the United States;\n            (3) tobacco products contain hazardous additives, gases, \n        and other chemical constituents dangerous to health;\n            (4) the use of tobacco products costs the United States \n        more than $50,000,000,000 in direct health care costs, with \n        more than $21,000,000,000 of these costs being paid by \n        government funds;\n            (5) tobacco products contain nicotine, a poisonous, \n        addictive drug;\n            (6) all States prohibit the sale of tobacco products to \n        minors, but enforcement has been ineffective or nonexistent and \n        tobacco products remain one of the least regulated consumer \n        products in the United States;\n            (7) over the past decade, little or no progress has been \n        made in reducing tobacco use among teenagers and recently, \n        teenage smoking rates appear to be rising;\n            (8) more than two-thirds of smokers smoke their first \n        cigarette before the age of 14, and 90 percent of adult smokers \n        did so by age 18;\n            (9) 516,000,000 packs of cigarettes are consumed by minors \n        annually, at least half of which are illegally sold to minors;\n            (10) reliable studies indicate that tobacco use is a \n        gateway to illicit drug use; and\n            (11) the Federal Government has a major policy setting role \n        in ensuring that the use of tobacco products among minors is \n        discouraged to the maximum extent possible.\n\nSEC. 3.
