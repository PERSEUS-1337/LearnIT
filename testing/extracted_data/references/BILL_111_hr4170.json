FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) On October 7, 2008, Congress established the Troubled \n        Assets Relief Program (TARP) as part of the Emergency Economic \n        Stabilization Act (Public Law 110-343; 122 Stat. 3765) and \n        allocated $700,000,000,000 for the purchase of toxic assets \n        from banks with the goal of restoring liquidity to the \n        financial sector and restarting the flow of credit in our \n        markets.\n            (2) The Secretary of the Treasury, without consultation \n        with the Congress, changed the purpose of Troubled Assets \n        Relief Program and began injecting capital into financial \n        institutions through a program called the Capital Purchase \n        Program (CPP) rather than purchasing toxic assets.\n            (3) Lending by financial institutions was not noticeably \n        increased with the implementation of the Capital Purchase \n        Program and the expenditure of $250,000,000,000 of the funds \n        under the Troubled Assets Relief Program, despite the goal of \n        the program.\n            (4) The recipients of amounts under the Capital Purchase \n        Program are now faced with additional restrictions related to \n        accepting those funds.\n            (5) A number of community banks and large financial \n        institutions have expressed their desire to return their \n        Capital Purchase Program funds to the Secretary of the Treasury \n        and the Secretary has begun the process of accepting receipt of \n        such funds.\n            (6) The Secretary of the Treasury should not unilaterally \n        determine how these returned funds are spent in the future and \n        the Congress should play a role in any determination of future \n        spending of funds returned through the Troubled Assets Relief \n        Program.\n\nSEC. 3. REPEAL OF TARP EXTENSION AUTHORITY.\n\n    Section 120 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (12 \nU.S.C. 5230) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``(a) Termination.--''; and\n            (2) by striking subsection (b).\n\nSEC. 4.
