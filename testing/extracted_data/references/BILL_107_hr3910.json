FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) Ovarian cancer is a serious and underrecognized threat \n        to women's health.\n            (2) Ovarian cancer, the deadliest of the gynecologic \n        cancers, is the fourth leading cause of cancer death among \n        women in the United States.\n            (3) Ovarian cancer occurs in 1 out of 57 women in the \n        United States.\n            (4) Approximately 50 percent of the women in the United \n        States diagnosed with ovarian cancer die as a result of the \n        cancer within 5 years; among African-American women, only about \n        48 percent survive 5 years or more.\n            (5) Ovarian cancer is readily treatable when it is detected \n        in the beginning stages before it has spread beyond the \n        ovaries, but the vast majority of cases are not diagnosed until \n        the advanced stages when the cancer has spread beyond the \n        ovaries.\n            (6) In cases where ovarian cancer is detected in the \n        beginning stages, more than 90 percent of women survive longer \n        than 5 years.\n            (7) Only 25 percent of ovarian cancer cases in the United \n        States are diagnosed in the beginning stages.\n            (8) In cases where ovarian cancer is diagnosed in the \n        advanced stages, the chance of 5-year survival is only about 25 \n        percent.\n            (9) Ovarian cancer may be difficult to diagnose because \n        symptoms are easily confused with other diseases and because \n        there is no reliable, easy-to-administer screening tool.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE PREVENTIVE BENEFIT EXPANSION TO INCLUDE CERTAIN \n              SCREENING TESTS FOR OVARIAN CANCER.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Coverage.--Section 1861 of the Social Security Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 1395x) is amended--\n                    (A) in subsection (s)(2)--\n                            (i) by striking ``and'' at the end of \n                        subparagraphs (U);\n                            (ii) by adding ``and'' at the end of \n                        subparagraph (V); and\n                            (iii) by inserting after subparagraph (V) \n                        the following new subparagraph:\n            ``(W) qualified ovarian cancer screening tests (as defined \n        in subsection (ww)); and''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n\n               ``Qualified Ovarian Cancer Screening Tests\n\n    ``(ww)(1) The term `qualified ovarian cancer screening test' means \na test that consists of any (or all) of the procedures described in \nparagraph (2) provided for the purpose of early detection of ovarian \ncancer to a woman over 50 years of age who has not had such a test \nduring the preceding year.\n    ``(2) The procedures described in this paragraph are as follows:\n            ``(A) A proteomic pattern blood test to identify ovarian \n        cancer.\n            ``(B) Such other procedures as the Secretary finds \n        appropriate for the purpose of early detection of ovarian \n        cancer, taking into account changes in technology and standards \n        of medical practice, availability, effectiveness, costs, and \n        such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate.''.\n            (2) Payment for proteomic pattern blood test under clinical \n        diagnostic laboratory test fee schedules.--\n                    (A) In general.--Section 1833(h)(1)(A) of such Act \n                (42 U.S.C. 1395l(h)(1)(A)) is amended by inserting \n                after ``(including prostate cancer screening tests \n                under section 1861(oo) consisting of prostate-specific \n                antigen blood tests'' the following: ``, and including \n                ovarian cancer screening tests under section \n                1861(ww)(2)(A) consisting of proteomic pattern blood \n                tests''.\n                    (B) Payment rate.--Section 1833(h)(7) of such Act \n                (42 U.S.C. 1395l(h)(7) is amended by inserting after \n                ``a primary screening method for detection of cervical \n                cancer)'' the following: ``and qualified ovarian cancer \n                screening tests under section 1861(ww)(2)(A)''.\n            (3) Conforming amendments.--Section 1862(a) of such Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 1395y(a)) is amended--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1)--\n                            (i) in subparagraph (H), by striking \n                        ``and'' at the end,\n                            (ii) in subparagraph (I), by striking the \n                        semicolon at the end and inserting ``, and'', \n                        and\n                            (iii) by adding at the end the following \n                        new subparagraph:\n            ``(J) in the case of qualified ovarian cancer screening \n        tests (as defined in section 1861(ww)), which are performed \n        more frequently than is covered under such section;''; and\n                    (B) in paragraph (7), by striking ``or (H)'' and \n                inserting ``(H), or (J)''.\n    (b) Contingent Effective Date.--(1) The amendments made subsection \n(a) shall become effective (if at all) in accordance with paragraph \n(2).\n    (2)(A) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall submit to \nCongress the report required under section 4(b) containing the results \nof the evaluation conducted under section 4(a) analyzing the \neffectiveness of using proteomic patterns in blood serum to identify \novarian cancer, including the effectiveness of so using proteomic \npatterns in combination with other screening methods for ovarian \ncancer.\n    (B) The amendments made by subsection (a) shall become effective, \non the date that is the first day of the first calendar quarter that \nbegins after the Secretary submits the report referred to in \nsubparagraph (A), unless the Secretary includes in that report a \nfinding that use of such technique is not sufficiently effective, \nreliable, or cost effective for use in detecting ovarian cancer in \nmedicare beneficiaries.\n\nSEC. 4.
