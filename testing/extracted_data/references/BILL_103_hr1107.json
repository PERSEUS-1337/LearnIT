FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Hurricanes and tornadoes kill more Americans and \n        destroy more property than any other natural disaster.\n            (2) Each year, in the United States, extreme winds cause \n        billions of dollars of damage to homes, schools, and other \n        buildings, roads and bridges, electrical power distribution \n        networks, and communications networks.\n            (3) Research on wind and wind engineering has resulted in \n        improved methods for making buildings and other structures less \n        vulnerable to extreme winds, but additional research funding is \n        needed to develop new, improved, and more cost-effective \n        methods of wind-resistant construction.\n            (4) Federal funding for wind engineering research has \n        decreased drastically over the last 20 years.\n            (5) Wind research has been hampered by a lack of data on \n        near-surface wind speed and distribution during hurricanes, \n        tornadoes, and other severe storms.\n            (6) Many existing methods for wind-resistant construction \n        are inexpensive and easy to implement but often they are not \n        applied because the construction industry and the general \n        public are unaware of such methods.\n            (7) Various Federal agencies have important roles to play \n        in wind engineering research, but at present there is little \n        interagency cooperation or coordination in this area.\n            (8) Establishment of a Federal Wind Engineering Research \n        Program would result in new technologies for wind-resistant \n        construction, broader application of such technologies in \n        construction, and ultimately reduced loss of life and property \n        due to extreme winds.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to create a Wind Engineering Research \nProgram within the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nwhich would--\n            (1) provide for wind engineering research;\n            (2) serve as a clearinghouse for information on wind \n        engineering; and\n            (3) improve interagency coordination on wind engineering \n        research between the National Institute of Standards and \n        Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Federal \n        Aviation Administration, and other appropriate Federal \n        agencies.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.\n\n    Within the National Institute of Standards and Technology, there \nshall be established a Wind Engineering Research Program which shall--\n            (1) conduct research and development, in cooperation with \n        the private sector and academia, on new methods for mitigating \n        wind damage due to hurricanes, tornadoes, and other severe \n        storms;\n            (2) coordinate research requiring the use of wind tunnels \n        with other Federal agencies having appropriate facilities, such \n        as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, for wind \n        engineering research;\n            (3) disseminate information on the application of existing \n        research results and methods for reducing wind damage to \n        buildings that are usually incompletely engineered or \n        nonengineered, such as single family dwellings, mobile homes, \n        light industrial buildings, and small commercial structures;\n            (4) transfer technology developed in wind engineering \n        research to the private sector so that it may be applied in \n        building codes, design practice, and construction;\n            (5) conduct, in conjunction with the National Oceanic and \n        Atmospheric Administration, post-disaster research following \n        hurricanes, tornadoes, and other severe storms to evaluate the \n        vulnerability of different types of buildings to extreme winds;\n            (6) serve as a point of contact for dissemination of \n        research information on wind engineering and work with the \n        private sector to develop education and training programs on \n        construction techniques developed from research results for \n        reducing wind damage;\n            (7) work with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and other \n        Federal agencies on meteorology programs to collect and \n        disseminate more data on extreme wind events; and\n            (8) work with the National Science Foundation to support \n        and expand basic research on wind engineering.\n\nSEC. 5. WIND ENGINEERING RESEARCH ADVISORY COMMITTEE.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--Not later than 120 days after   the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Director of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology shall establish an independent Wind \nEngineering Research Advisory Committee (in this Act referred to as the \n``advisory committee'').\n    (b) Duties.--The advisory committee shall provide advice and \nrecommendations to the Director of the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology regarding the needs, objectives, and plans with respect \nto the development of the wind engineering research and development \nplan referred to in section 6, including the role of other Federal \nagencies in implementing the plan.\n    (c) Membership.--The advisory committee shall be composed of \nmembers appointed by the Director of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology from among individuals who are not employees \nof the Department of Commerce and who are specially qualified to serve \non the advisory committee by virtue of their education, training, or \nexperience.
