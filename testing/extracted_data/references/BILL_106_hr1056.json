FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the failure of many computer programs to recognize the \n        Year 2000 may have extreme negative financial consequences in \n        the Year 2000, and in subsequent years for both large and small \n        businesses;\n            (2) small businesses are well behind larger businesses in \n        implementing corrective changes to their automated systems;\n            (3) many small businesses do not have access to capital to \n        fix mission critical automated systems, which could result in \n        severe financial distress or failure for small businesses; and\n            (4) the failure of a large number of small businesses due \n        to the Year 2000 computer problem would have a highly \n        detrimental effect on the economy in the Year 2000 and in \n        subsequent years.\n\nSEC. 3.
