Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:\nIt is in the public interest for contracts entered into by a city or county for legal services based on a contingency fee to be open and transparent, therefor, this act would further the purposes of Section 3 of Article 1 of the California Constitution."
