FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Government has frozen, through \n        Executive Order 13566 of February 25, 2011, over $30 billion in \n        assets in the United States owned by the late Muammar Qaddafi, \n        his family, and his regime.\n            (2) The United States military conducted actions, through \n        Operation Odyssey Dawn and NATO Operation Unified Protector, \n        over the territory and off the coast of Libya designed to \n        protect the Libyan people from the violence and cruelty of the \n        Qaddafi regime.\n            (3) United States military operations in Libya exposed \n        members of the United States Armed Forces to the risk of death.\n            (4) The Libyan uprising against the late dictator Qaddafi \n        succeeded with the help of United States forces.\n            (5) Libya is an oil rich country that will be able to \n        finance its economic development and reconstruction.\n            (6) Libya has Africa's largest oil reserves and a \n        population of approximately 6.5 million people.\n            (7) In 2010, Libya had one of the highest per capita oil \n        export revenues in the world.\n            (8) The Department of Defense estimates the cost of United \n        States military and humanitarian efforts for the Libyan people \n        at under $3 billion.\n            (9) Funds collected by the United States from Libya \n        pursuant to the United States-Libya Claims Settlement Agreement \n        are insufficient to provide complete relief for all of the \n        victims of Libyan state-sponsored terrorism whose claims are \n        currently being adjudicated, or have been awarded, by the \n        Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States. The \n        amount of the shortfall is believed to be as much as $400 \n        million.\n            (10) Around the world, over $150 billion of Qaddafi assets \n        are frozen, and almost all of this amount will be paid to the \n        new Libyan government, including the vast majority of the \n        assets blocked by the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
