    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Fab Lab Network Act of \n2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States is the world leader in scientific \n        research, discovery, and innovation.\n            (2) There exists a strong social and economic incentive to \n        create the fewest barriers to entry for those interested in \n        furthering education, discovery, invention, and innovation in \n        the scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical \n        fields.\n            (3) The United States has a strong strategic interest in \n        promoting a robust, well trained, highly capable, and \n        geographically diverse manufacturing base.\n            (4) MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms has contributed \n        significantly to the advancement of these goals through its \n        work in creating and advancing Fabrication Laboratories (Fab \n        Labs) in the United States and abroad.\n            (5) A new kind of national infrastructure will be required \n        in order to adequately take advantage of leading edge digital \n        fabrication technologies to secure the United States' leading \n        position in scientific fields and to promote a robust \n        manufacturing base.\n            (6) A focused, dedicated national effort will be required \n        in order to ensure the creation of such an infrastructure takes \n        place as quickly and effectively as possible.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL FAB LAB NETWORK.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The National Fab Lab Network incorporated by \nthis Act (hereinafter in this section referred to as the ``NFLN'') is \nhereby authorized and empowered to receive either real or personal \nproperty and to hold the same absolutely or in trust, and to invest, \nreinvest, and manage the same in accordance with the provisions of its \nconstitution and to apply said property and the income arising \ntherefrom to the objects of its creation and according to the \ninstructions of its donors.\n    (b) In General.--The National Fab Lab Network (NFLN) shall exist as \na nonprofit entity whose purpose is to facilitate the piece by piece \nconstruction of an actual network of connected labs. The NFLN itself \nshall not represent an overseeing, regulating, or coordinating body of \nthis distributed network, but will merely exist to facilitate its \nconstruction.\n    (c) Definitions.--In this section, the term ``Fabrication \nLaboratory'' also referred to as a ``Fab Lab'' means a facility \ncontaining a variety of manufacturing and other fabrication tools \noperable by means of digital input as well as the software and \ncomputers required to design for and operate those tools. These labs \nserve a broad range of purposes, but each allow for clear guidelines \nfor how members of the local community, local businesses, and academic \nor educational purposes can be pursued with the labs' resources \nconsistent with a charter to be established by the NFLN.\n    (d) Functions.--The functions of the NFLN shall be the following:\n            (1) To serve as the coordinating body for all efforts to \n        create a coordinated, collaborative network of Fab Labs in the \n        United States.\n            (2) To serve as the first point of contact for \n        organizations interested in constructing and operating a Fab \n        Lab and to maintain a first-come first-serve wait list of those \n        organizations.\n            (3) To work out to the satisfaction of NFLN staff and board \n        members the ability of interested organizations to successfully \n        host a Fab Lab. In particular, the staff and board members of \n        the NFLN shall examine the ability of the organization to \n        supply a physical location for the lab, their financial ability \n        to pay for sufficient staff to operate the lab and train its \n        users, an ability to engage the local community or other \n        sufficient user base, and an awareness of those long term \n        obligations.\n            (4) To match those organizations who meet with the NFLN's \n        approval for those criteria specified in paragraph (3) with \n        available sources of funding and individuals with personal \n        experience in establishing and operating Labs in other \n        organizations so as to expedite the process of making new Labs \n        operational. In general, the NFLN should not bring to this \n        stage or continue to engage with those organizations that do \n        not meet the NFLN's approval on those criteria described in \n        paragraph (3).\n            (5) To advertise or perform other outreach activities to \n        those organizations that might have interest in or otherwise \n        benefit from creating a Fab Lab, and to notify those \n        organizations of the specific purposes the NFLN can perform.\n    (e) Purposes.--In carrying out its functions, the NFLN's purposes \nand goals shall be--\n            (1) to facilitate the construction of a new type of \n        information and digital fabrication infrastructure; \n        specifically, in all its actions to facilitate and encourage \n        the construction of a decentralized network of connected Fab \n        Labs;\n            (2) to promote the goals of greater science, technology, \n        engineering, and math education, workforce development in the \n        areas of manufacturing and product design, increased innovation \n        and invention in the private sector, as well as scientific and \n        academic discovery through the use of distributed digital \n        fabrication tools; and\n            (3) to seek to establish at least one Fab Lab per every \n        700,000 individuals in the United States in the first ten years \n        of its operation.\n    (f) Funding.--The NFLN may accept donations from private \nindividuals, corporations, government agencies, or other organizations."
