FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Around the world, women remain under-represented in \n        conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and post-conflict \n        peace building efforts.\n            (2) Despite the historic under-representation of women in \n        conflict resolution processes, women in conflict-affected \n        regions have nevertheless achieved significant success in--\n                    (A) moderating violent extremism;\n                    (B) countering terrorism;\n                    (C) resolving disputes through nonviolent mediation \n                and negotiation; and\n                    (D) stabilizing societies by enhancing the \n                effectiveness of security services, peacekeeping \n                efforts, institutions, and decision-making processes.\n            (3) Research shows that--\n                    (A) peace negotiations are more likely to end in a \n                peace agreement when women's groups play an influential \n                role in the negotiation process;\n                    (B) once reached, a peace agreement is 35 percent \n                more likely to last at least 15 years if women have \n                participated in the negotiation process; and\n                    (C) when women meaningfully participate, peace \n                negotiations are more likely to address the underlying \n                causes of the conflict, leading to more sustainable \n                outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the meaningful participation of women in conflict \n        prevention and conflict resolution processes helps to promote \n        more inclusive and democratic societies and is critical to the \n        long-term stability of countries and regions;\n            (2) the political participation and leadership of women in \n        fragile environments, particularly during democratic \n        transitions, is critical to sustaining lasting democratic \n        institutions; and\n            (3) the United States should be a global leader in \n        promoting the meaningful participation of women in conflict \n        prevention, management, and resolution, and post-conflict \n        relief and recovery efforts.\n\nSEC. 4.
