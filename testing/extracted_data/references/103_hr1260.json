    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Aeronautical Research and \nCompetitiveness Act of 1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) aircraft production in the United States affects nearly \n        80 percent of the economy;\n            (2) for every dollar increase in shipments of United States \n        aircraft internationally, the United States economy output \n        increases by an estimated $2.30;\n            (3) for every $1,000,000,000 of aircraft shipments \n        internationally, nearly 35,000 jobs are created;\n            (4) many of the advanced aircraft technologies developed by \n        the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the \n        Department of Defense have application in design, development, \n        testing, and production for both civil aircraft and military \n        aircraft;\n            (5) a decrease in military aviation programs will have a \n        negative impact on civil aviation programs;\n            (6) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has \n        found that it must strengthen its capabilities and take a more \n        assertive role in coordinating and facilitating long-term \n        United States aeronautical research efforts;\n            (7) research programs at the National Aeronautics and Space \n        Administration that have potential applications in both \n        military and civil aviation include wind tunnels and wind \n        tunnel technology, high-speed research technology, rotorcraft \n        technology, high performance aircraft technology, supersonic \n        technology, and others;\n            (8) joint technology development programs among the \n        Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space \n        Administration, and industry would allow for transferring \n        skills and technologies from the defense to the civilian \n        aerospace sector and would allow for the transfer back to \n        defense, when necessary; and\n            (9) such joint programs could allow for the Department of \n        Defense contribution to the programs to be phased out over 5 \n        years, which would allow the defense industry to make the \n        transfer to the civilian aerospace sector and produce needed \n        aerospace technology.\n\nSEC. 3. JOINT AERONAUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Administrator and the Secretary shall \njointly establish a program for the purpose of conducting research on \naeronautical technologies that have application to both military and \ncivil aeronautical vehicles and that enhance United States \ncompetitiveness. Such program shall include research on--\n            (1) next-generation wind tunnel and advanced wind tunnel \n        instrumentation technology;\n            (2) advanced engine materials, engine concepts, and testing \n        of propulsion systems or components of the high-speed civil \n        transport research program;\n            (3) high performance aircraft research;\n            (4) advanced rotorcraft research;\n            (5) advanced hypersonic aeronautical research;\n            (6) environmentally compatible technologies, including \n        technologies that limit or reduce noise and air pollution; and\n            (7) relevant human factors, including the human factors \n        which may affect or be affected by the transfer of aeronautical \n        technologies from the military sector to the civil sector.\n    (b) Contracts and Grants.--Contracts and grants entered into under \nthe program established under subsection (a) shall be administered \nusing procedures developed jointly by the Secretary and the \nAdministrator. These procedures should include scientific peer review \nand an integrated acquisition policy for contract and grant \nrequirements and for technical data rights that are not an impediment \nto joint programs among the Department of Defense, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, and industry.\n\nSEC. 4. AERONAUTICAL RESEARCH PLAN.\n\n    (a) Requirement.--Within 180 days after the date of the enactment \nof this Act, the Administrator and the Secretary, in consultation with \nthe advisory committee, shall prepare and transmit to Congress a \nnational aeronautical research plan setting forth the research and \ndevelopment that the Administrator and the Secretary consider necessary \nto advance aeronautical technologies over the 5-year period beginning \nin fiscal year 1993.\n    (b) Objectives of Plan.--The objectives of the plan prepared under \nsubsection (a) shall include--\n            (1) selected programs that jointly enhance public and \n        private aeronautical technology development;\n            (2) an opportunity for private defense contractors to be \n        involved in transition activities to the civilian sector; and\n            (3) the transfer of Federal Government-developed \n        technologies to the private sector to promote economic strength \n        and competitiveness.\n    (c) Contents of Plan.--The plan prepared under subsection (a) shall \ninclude--\n            (1) for the first year, detailed objectives and estimates \n        of the schedule, cost, and manpower levels for each research \n        project, and a description of the scope and content of each \n        major contract or grant;\n            (2) for the second through fifth years, estimates of the \n        total cost of each major project for such year and a list of \n        all major research projects which may be required to meet the \n        objectives;\n            (3) a 5-year schedule for the decrease of Federal \n        contribution and corresponding increase in private sector \n        contributions for the research and development program; and\n            (4) the portion of the Federal contribution that each \n        Federal agency will contribute.\n    (d) Annual Update.--The plan prepared under subsection (a) shall be \nupdated annually, to reflect changes in global aviation technologies \nand United States competitiveness.\n\nSEC. 5.
