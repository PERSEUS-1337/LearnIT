FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, \n        and Liability Act of 1980 established a Federal Superfund trust \n        fund for the purpose of hazardous substance removal and \n        remediation at sites across the Nation.\n            (2) The release of hazardous substances may threaten and \n        impair public health, the local environment, community \n        infrastructure, the economy, and social well being.\n            (3) The Environmental Protection Agency has evaluated more \n        than 45,000 sites and has currently listed 1,086 non-Federal \n        sites on the National Priorities List.\n            (4) One in 4 Americans lives within 3 miles of a Superfund \n        site.\n            (5) The expiration of the Superfund crude oil, chemical \n        feedstock, and corporate taxes in 1995 has contributed to a \n        funding shortfall and has shifted the burden of cleanup to the \n        general public, which has prevented numerous Superfund sites \n        from receiving new construction funding in fiscal years 2004, \n        2005, and 2006 and slowed the pace of existing cleanups.\n            (6) Delayed and slowed Superfund cleanup actions magnify \n        public health risks and increase total remediation costs.\n            (7) Responsible parties or potentially responsible parties \n        would continue to be liable for hazardous releases under the \n        Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n        Liability Act of 1980 after reestablishment of Superfund taxes.\n            (8) Although costs vary from site to site, costs at some \n        sites are substantial and place a greater demand on the \n        Hazardous Substance Superfund resources to clean up \n        contamination.\n            (9) The Environmental Protection Agency generally considers \n        Superfund sites where cleanup costs exceed $50,000,000 to be \n        megasites.\n            (10) Megasites typically are among the larger, more \n        complex, and more severely contaminated of sites, presenting \n        the greatest cleanup challenges. As such, megasites are a \n        substantial factor driving future funding needs to clean up \n        hazardous substances under the Superfund program.\n            (11) The Environmental Protection Agency commits a large \n        percentage of annual Superfund obligations for long-term \n        ongoing cleanup work at only a few sites. These megasites \n        siphon funding from other Superfund sites and result in \n        construction delays. In fiscal year 2006, 45 percent of funds \n        for Superfund construction and post-construction activities \n        went to only 14 sites.\n            (12) As more megasites move beyond the analysis and design \n        phase into actual construction, funding needs for these sites \n        will increase. The average annual cost per megasite is \n        projected to be at least $140,000,000.\n            (13) Megasites differ from non-megasites in that they \n        require more resources over the long term to address \n        complexities associated with developing remedies and cleaning \n        up contamination that can cover many square miles and may \n        involve multiple communities, responsible parties, Indian \n        Tribes, or States.\n            (14) For some megasites there is no ascertainable final \n        remedy because remediation may involve decades of sequential \n        actions, and institutional controls may be required in \n        perpetuity. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, \n        more than half of the mining sites currently listed on the \n        National Priorities List will require operation and maintenance \n        in perpetuity.\n            (15) Responsible parties may not be able to fund megasite \n        remediation activities that are anticipated to last for decades \n        or longer. The lack of a dedicated revenue stream raises \n        serious concerns about how a remediation program expected to \n        last for decades, if not centuries, can be successfully \n        implemented.\n            (16) At megasites with no viable responsible parties, the \n        Federal Government pays 90 percent of the construction costs, \n        with the State paying the other 10 percent. Once construction \n        is completed, the State is solely responsible for paying all \n        operation and maintenance costs, a time frame that for many \n        megasites may extend in perpetuity.\n\nSEC. 3.
