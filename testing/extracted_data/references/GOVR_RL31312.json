    "content": "On February 20, 2003, the President signed into law H.J.Res. 2 , FY2003 OmnibusAppropriations Act, containing FY2003 legislative branch appropriations language ( P.L. 108-7 ). The Senate adopted its version of the FY2003 language as an amendment introduced by Senator TedStevens on January 12, 2003. The Senate and conference versions of H.J.Res. 2 replaced versions of the FY2003 bill passed in 2002, and reflect reductions in compliance with therequest of the White House.  FY2003 funds had been pending since the beginning of the fiscal year, October 1, 2002. In lieu of a FY2003 legislative funding bill, Congress passed eight continuing resolutions that togetherprovided temporary funding at basically the FY2002 level from October 1 through February 20,2003. Legislative branch operations were funded at the \"rate of operations not to exceed thecurrent rate.\" (1) Congress changed the structure of the annual legislative branch appropriations bill in theFY2003 Act.  Prior to enactment of the FY2003 legislative appropriations bill, and effective in FY1978, the legislative branch appropriations bill was divided into two titles. Title I, Congressional Operations,contained budget authorities for activities directly serving Congress. Included in this title were thebudgets of the House, the Senate, Joint Items (joint House and Senate activities), the Office ofCompliance, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) (exceptthe Library of Congress (LOC) buildings and grounds), the Congressional Research Service (CRS)within the Library of Congress, and congressional printing and binding activities of the GovernmentPrinting Office (GPO). Title II, Related Agencies, contained budgets for activities not directly supporting Congress. Included in this title were budgets of the Botanic Garden, the Library of Congress (except theCongressional Research Service), the Library buildings and grounds maintained by the Architect ofthe Capitol, the Government Printing Office (except congressional printing and binding costs), andthe General Accounting Office (GAO). Periodically since FY1978, the bill contained additionaltitles for such purposes as capital improvements and special one-time functions. In the 2003 bill, appropriations for legislative branch agencies are contained in one title, Title I. Title II now contains general administrative provisions, and appropriations for two activities, theJohn C. Stennis Center for Public Service Training and Development and the Congressional AwardAct.  Figure 1 shows FY2002 appropriations as funded in Titles I and II. Title I budget authority was69.9% of the total appropriation of $3.25 billion. Title II budget authority was 30.1% of the totalappropriation. In addition, there was legislative budget authority that was not included in the annuallegislative branch appropriations act. It included permanent budget authority for both federal fundsand trust funds, and other budget authority. (2) Note: Includes regular annual appropriations in P.L.107-68 ; emergency response funds pursuant to P.L.107-117 ; and FY2002 supplemental appropriation in P.L. 107-206 . Permanent federal funds are available as the result of previously enacted legislation and do not require annual action. (3) Permanent trust funds are monies held in accounts credited with collections from specific sources earmarked by law for a defined purpose. Trust funds do not appear in the annual legislativebill since they are not budget authority. They are included in the U.S. Budget either as budgetreceipts or offsetting collections. (4) The Budget also contains non-legislative entities within the legislative branch budget. They are funded in other appropriation bills, but are placed in the legislative section by the Office ofManagement and Budget for bookkeeping purposes. (5)  Table 1. Legislative Branch Appropriations, FY1995 to FY2002 (budget authority in billions of current dollars) a a. These figures represent current dollars, exclude permanent budget authorities, and contain supplementals andrescissions. Permanent budget authorities are not included in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill but,rather, are automatically funded annually. b. Includes budget authority contained in the FY1999 regularannual Legislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L. 105-275 ), the FY1999 emergency supplemental appropriation ( P.L. 105-277 ), and the FY1999 supplementalappropriation ( P.L. 106-31 ). c. Includes budget authority contained in the FY2000 regularannual Legislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L.106-57 ); a supplemental and a 0.38% rescission in P.L. 106-113 ; and supplementals in P.L. 106-246 and P.L.106-554 . d. This figure contains: (1) FY2001 regular annual appropriationscontained in H.R. 5657 , legislative branchappropriations bill; (2) FY2001 supplemental appropriations of $118 million and a 0.22% across-the-boardrescission contained in H.R. 5666 , miscellaneous appropriations bill; and (3) FY2001 supplementalappropriations of $79.5 million contained in H.R. 2216 ( P.L. 107-20 ). H.R. 5657 and H.R. 5666 were incorporated by reference in P.L. 106-554 , FY2001 Consolidated AppropriationsAct. The first FY2001legislative branch appropriations bill, H.R. 4516 , was vetoed Oct. 30, 2000. The second legislative branch appropriations bill, H.R. 5657 , was introduced Dec. 14 andincorporated in P.L 106-554. in P.L. 106-554 . This figure does not reflect any terrorism supplementals fundsreleased pursuant to P.L. 107-38 .  e. This figure contains regular annual appropriations in P.L.107-68 ; transfers from the legislative branch emergencyresponse fund pursuant to P.L.107-117 ; and FY2002 supplemental appropriations in P.L. 107-206 .   Table 2. Status of Legislative Branch Appropriations, FY2003,P.L. 108-7 (H.J.Res. 2, 108th Congress) a. The conference report on H.J.Res. 2 , FY2003 continuing appropriations resolution, was filed onFebruary 13, 2003 ( H.Rept. 108-10 ). Because a FY2003 legislative funding bill was not enacted prior to theadoption of H.J.Res. 2 , Congress extended funding generally at the FY2002 level from October 1,2002, through February 20, 2003, in a series of continuing resolutions. A conference report was not filed on theoriginal FY2003 legislative branch bill, H.R. 5121 , and the bill died upon adjournment of the 107thCongress. Early in the 108th Congress, the Senate amended H.J.Res. 2 , the FY2003 continuingappropriations resolution, to include the Senate version of the FY2003 legislative branch appropriation. Aconference on H.J.Res. 2 was held on February 10, 2003. H.J.Res. 2 , referred to as theFY2003 omnibus appropriations resolution, also contains FY2003 appropriations for agencies included in 10other appropriations bills not enacted during the 107th Congress. The legislative branch operated under continuing resolutions between October 1, 2002 and February 20, 2003. (6) In general the resolutionscontinued operations at the enactedFY2002 level, including supplemental appropriations. (7) Limiting the funding level to the FY2002 rate could have adversely affected the legislative branch by delaying authorizationand funding for new Capitol Police positions; (8) improvements in police training programs;establishment of new police recruitment and retention programs; availability of hazardousduty pay to the police; additional compensation for speciality assignments and proficiencies;authorization and funding for a full 9.1% pay increase for the Capitol Police in January 2003;and establishment of an alternative computing facility for the House, Senate, and otherlegislative branch activities. Also, the legislative branch would have had to absorb costsassociated with implementation of the 3.1% pay increase that became effective in January2003.  Submission of FY2003 Budget Request. On February 4, 2002, the President submitted his FY2003 U.S. Budget , which contained arequest prepared by legislative branch entities of $3.48 billion for activities funded in theannual legislative branch appropriations bill. Subsequently, the FY2003 request was revisedby the legislative branch to $3.43 billion, a 5.3% increase over the FY2002 budget authorityof $3.25 billion. (9) Hearings on FY2003 Budget Requests. The House Subcommittee on Legislative, Committee on Appropriations, held hearings on April25, 2002, on FY2003 requests of the House of Representatives, Library of Congress, includingthe Congressional Research Service, Government Printing Office, and General AccountingOffice. Hearings continued on April 25 on requests of the Architect of the Capitol and theCongressional Budget Office.  The Senate Subcommittee on Legislative Branch, Committee on Appropriations, held hearings on March 13 on FY2003 requests of the Library of Congress, includingCongressional Research Service; on April 17 on requests of the Secretary of the Senate andArchitect of the Senate; on May 1 on requests of the Senate Sergeant at Arms and CapitolPolice; and on May 8 on budget proposals of the Government Printing Office, CongressionalBudget Office, and General Accounting Office. Passage of House Version, H.R. 5121 (107thCongress). The House version of the FY2003 bill, H.R. 5121 ,contained $2.67 billion (excluding Senate items), an increase of $128.2 million (5.0%) overFY2002's appropriation of $2.54 million (excluding Senate items).  Among issues raised during House floor consideration was language in an amendment offered by Representative James Moran to reduce the appropriation for the Joint Committeeon Taxation by $590,000 until the Committee released a report on tax evasion by expatriates. The House rejected the amendment, 206-213.  Also, during consideration, a point of order was raised and sustained by the chair against language that would have consolidated the Capitol Police payrolls, replacing the currentmethod by which some personnel are paid from the House payroll and others from the Senatepayroll. Among provisions of H.R. 5121 , as passed by the House, were those to  increase funds for the Capitol Police by $99.0 million (63.0%), from $157.2 million to $256.2 million; increase the pay of Capitol Police by 9.1%, including a 4.1% annual adjustment, and an additional 5% pay raise; increase Capitol Police personnel positions by 318, to 1,477; make the Capitol Police chief an ex-officio member of the Capitol Police Board. Currently, the Board is comprised of the House and Senate Sergeants at Armsand the Architect of the Capitol; provide an annual pay adjustment of 4.1% to House employees; fund the House at $960.4 million; Capitol Police at $256.2 million; Congressional Research Service at $86.2 million; Congressional Budget Office at $32.4million; Library of Congress at $422.2 million; General Accounting Office at $453.5 million;and the Government Printing Office at $119.8 million; and fund the activities of the Architect of the Capitol at $303.1 million.  Limitation on Transfer of Appropriations. The House bill, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee, and passed by the House,contained a new provision to limit the transfer of appropriations in anticipation of theenactment of the proposed Department of Homeland Security. Although the impact of theprovision is not entirely clear, it appears to have been included due to concerns about potentialtransfers of appropriations without additional approved in an appropriations act. Similarlanguage is included in FY2003 House appropriations bills for other departments andagencies. A transfer, a shifting of funds between appropriations, is not allowed without statutory authority (31 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1532). Section 308 of H.R. 5121 prohibits the transferringof any funds appropriated in the Act to any department, agency, or instrumentality of theUnited States government, except pursuant to a transfer made by, or transfer authorityprovided in, the Act or any other appropriation act. This provision appears prospectively toprohibit any transfer of funds pursuant to authority made by, or transfer authority provided in,any act other than an appropriation act such as an authorization act.  This prohibition also may have the effect of denying transfer of funds made available in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, FY2003, pursuant to authority currently grantedby the Economy Act because it is not an appropriation act. Codified at Sections 1535 and1536 of Title 31 of the United States Code , the Economy Act now allows an agency totransfer funds to another agency to acquire goods or services if an agency filling an order isable to provide or get by contract those goods or services and if they cannot be provided bycontract as conveniently or as cheaply by a commercial enterprise. This language does notappear in the Senate version of H.R. 5121 . Passage of Senate Version, H.R. 5121, Amended to Contain the Language of S. 2720 (107th Congress). On July 25,the Senate passed H.R. 5121 , amended to contain the provisions of S. 2720 ( S.Rept. 107-209 ). The bill contained $2.42 billion (excluding Houseitems), an increase of $163.8 million (7.3%) over the FY2002 level of $2.253 billion(excluding House items). Among its provisions were those to increase funds for the Capitol Police by $52.6 million (33.5%), from $157.2 million to $209.8 million; increase the pay of Capitol Police by 9.1%, including a 4.1% annual adjustment, and an additional 5% pay raise;  increase Capitol Police personnel by 269 FTEs, to a total of 1,839 FTEs;  merge the Library of Congress police with the Capitol police over 3years; create the position of Deputy Architect of the Capitol as the chiefoperating officer for the Capitol complex; make up to $50 million available for an alternative computing facility for the House, Senate and other legislative branch entities, subject to a study by the Architectof the Capitol and approval by the Senate and House AppropriationsCommittees; direct the General Accounting Office to review printing and dissemination of Federal government information, particularly with respect to congressionalprinting and binding services of the Government Printing Office, the Federal DepositoryLibrary Program, and contracting of printing by the executive branch;  fund the Senate at $672.6 million (with a $31.2 million increase primarily to fund a new security system, enhanced mail handling, and a new Office ofEmergency Preparedness); Congressional Research Service at $87.0 million; CongressionalBudget Office at $32.4 million; Library of Congress (excluding CRS) at $410.0 million;General Accounting Office $454.5 million; and the Government Printing Office at $122.5million; and fund the Architect of the Capitol at $388.0 million (including renovations of the Capitol Power Plant). Adoption of By the Senate of H.J.Res. 2, FY2003 Omnibus Appropriations (108th Congress). As adopted on January 23, 2003,the Senate version of H.J.Res. 2 (FY2003 continuing appropriations resolution)contained $2.34 billion for FY2003 legislative branch activities (excluding House items), anincrease of 2.6% over FY2002's $2.28 billion. (10) H.J.Res. 2 also required anacross the board reduction in FY2003 appropriations contained in the resolution, includingthose for the legislative branch. (11) The FY2003 appropriation, as contained in the version of H.J.Res. 2 passed by the Senate, was 3.1% less than funding contained in the first version which it passed in the107th Congress, H.R. 5121 (see discussion on bill below). The reduction wasmade in compliance with a request of the White House. The largest reduction was 16.9% foractivities of the Architect of the Capitol. During consideration of H.J.Res. 2 , the Senate adopted amendment no. 165, on January 23, 2003, containing $157,500 for a new Office of President Pro TemporeEmeritus established by the amendment. (12) Adoption of Conference Report on H.J.Res. 2, FY2003 Omnibus Appropriations (P.L. 108-7). H.J.Res. 2 , as adopted by the Senate, was sent directly to a conferencecommittee, which issued its report on February 13 ( H.Rept. 108-10 ). Both houses agreed tothe conference version later that day, and the resolution was signed into law on February 20. P.L. 108-7 contains $3.36 billion for the legislative branch, subject to a rescission of 0.65%(Section 601, Division N, P.L. 108-7 ). On February 21, the Office of Management andBudget issued guidelines to government agencies on application of the rescission http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins/b03-02.pdf .  In July 2002, both houses agreed to a FY2002 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 4775 , signed into P.L. 107-206 by the President on August 2, 2002,containing $25.2 million for the legislative branch and administrative provisions as follows:  $16.1 million for the Capitol Police to meet expenses of computer equipment and services, training, communications, uniforms, weapons, and reimbursementfor expenses related to anthrax detection and treatment to the Hazardous Substance Superfundof the Environmental Protection Agency; $1.6 million for the House of Representatives account \"Salaries andexpenses\" in subaccount \"Standing committees, special and select\" to remain availablethrough December 31, 2002; and $7.5 million for the Library of Congress account \"Copyright Office, salaries and expenses\" to meet a shortfall in copyright registration receipts due to delays inthe receiving mail subsequent to the discovery of anthrax; the appropriation was containedin a request transmitted by the President to Congress on March 21, 2002;and Among administrative provisions in the conference report are those to  increase a Senator's Official Personnel and Office Expense Account by up to $20,000 to meet expenses directly related to the September 11 terrorist attacks, or todisplacement due to anthrax detection, subject to certification by the Senator in a writtenrequest to the Secretary of the Senate no later than September 30,2002; authorize the Architect of the Capitol to acquire buildings and facilities for use as computer backup facilities for legislative branch offices, subject to approval of theHouse Office Building Commission or the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration,or both if a joint facility; such property is to be considered part of the Capitol grounds andsubject to regulations governing use of the grounds;  establish a new account in the Treasury for the Architect of the Capitol titled, \"Capitol police buildings,\" for maintenance, care, and operation of buildings of theCapitol Police; and authorize the Architect of the Capitol to acquire real property for use by the Capitol Police, subject to approval of the House Office Building Commission and theSenate Committee on Rules and Administration; such property is to be considered part of theCapitol grounds and subject to regulations governing use of thegrounds. House Version, H.R. 4775. The House passed H.R. 4775 ( H.Rept. 107-480 ) on May 24, 2002, containing $25.2million for the legislative branch in Chapter 9 as follows: $1.6 million for House committees;  $7.5 million for the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress;and $16.1 million for the Capitol Police Board account in subaccount\"General expenses\" for computer equipment, training, communications, uniforms, weapons,and including $12.5 million for reimbursement to the Environmental Protection Agency,Hazardous Substance Superfund, for expenses of anthrax investigation and cleanup. However, availability of the $16.1 million appropriations was contingent upon the amountbeing included in an official budget request transmitted by the President to Congress. Further, the budget request must be designated by the President as an emergency requirement,as defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Congress sodesignated the $16.1 million in H.R. 4775 . Among administrative provisions in H.R. 4775 , as passed by the House, were those to  establish a new account in the Treasury for the Architect of the Capitol titled, \"Capitol police buildings,\" for maintenance, care, and operation of buildings of theCapitol Police; authorize the Architect of the Capitol to acquire real property for use by the Capitol Police, subject to approval of the House Office Building Commission and theSenate Committee on Rules and Administration; such property is to be considered part of theCapitol grounds and subject to regulations governing use of thegrounds; authorize federal, state, and local government political leaders to participate in an exchange program with Russia to study Russian politics, business and otheroperations; direct the Librarian of Congress and the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to ensure that all CRS materials, including materials providedthrough electronic means, be provided to Members and congressional employees as currentlyprovided at all other locations where Members and employees carry out official duties;and authorize the Architect of the Capitol to acquire buildings and facilities for use as computer backup facilities for legislative branch offices, subject to approval of theHouse Office Building Commission or the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration,or both if a joint facility; such property is to be considered part of the Capitol grounds andsubject to regulations governing use of the grounds. Senate Version, S. 2551. On June 7, the Senate passed H.R. 4775 , amended to contain the language of S. 2551 . The Senate version contained $11.1 million for the legislative branchin Chapter 9 as follows: $3.6 million for the Capitol Police Board subaccount \"General expenses\" for security equipment and installation, supplies, materials and contract services,to be disbursed by the Board or their designee; and $7.5 million for the Library of Congress account \"Copyright Office, salaries and expenses.\"  Among general provisions in S. 2551 , as passed, are those to  increase a Senator's Official Personnel and Office Expense Account by up to $20,000 to meet expenses directly related to the September 11 terrorist attacks, or todisplacement due to anthrax detection, subject to certification by the Senator in a writtenrequest to the Secretary of the Senate no later than September 30,2002; grant the Capitol Police Board sole discretion in determining if employee bonuses will assist the Capitol Police in recruitment; authorize the Capitol Police to pay tuition allowances for payment or reimbursement of education expenses; and authorize the Architect of the Capitol to acquire buildings and facilities for use as computer backup facilities for legislative branch offices, subject to approval of theHouse Office Building Commission or the Senate Committee on Rules and Administrationor both if a joint facility; such property is to be considered part of the Capitol grounds andsubject to regulations governing use of the grounds. Congress inserted language in the first continuing resolution ( H.J.Res. 111 )prohibiting federal agencies from using funds made available in the Act ( P.L. 107-229 ,September 30, 2002), or any other act, to pay for printing services provided by an entity otherthan the Government Printing Office (GPO). The language reflects a conflict betweenCongress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) over federal printingrequirements. Current law requires that federal entities (other than the Supreme Court)procure printing through GPO. On May 3, 2002, the director of OMB issued a directive thatfederal agencies would no longer be required to use GPO for printing services. (13) Accordingto the memorandum, the directive is based on a 1996 opinion of the Department of Justice thatCongress could not constitutionally obligate executive agencies to use GPO for printing. Congress again added language to the third continuing resolution ( H.J.Res. 122 ; P.L. 107-240 , October 11, 2002) regarding federal printing requirements that (1) statesthe finding of Congress that law requires \"all printing, binding, and blankbook work forCongress, the Executive Office, the Judiciary, other than the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates, and every executive department, independent office, and establishment of thegovernment to be done at the Government Printing Office;\" (14) and (2) prohibits the use offunds in this Act ( P.L. 107-240 ), or any other act, to implement the May 3, 2002, directive ofthe director of OMB, which authorizes federal agencies to use printing sources other thanGPO; and (3) prohibits the use of funds to pay for the printing of the U.S. Budget by a printingentity other than GPO.  The issue however remains unsettled. On October 22, 2002, the Department of Justice issued a memorandum restating the department's view that the requirement for federalagencies to procure printing only through GPO is unconstitutional. On November 14, 2002,the General Accounting Office (GAO) issued an opinion that federal agencies are prohibitedfrom using funds to implement the May 3, 2002, directive of OMB, and that no funds areavailable in any act to pay for printing the U.S. Budget other than by GPO. Later inNovember, OMB formalized its position in the November 13 issue of the Federal Register ,and issued solicitations for procurement of printing services for the FY2004 U.S. Budget .  The Act also contains a gratuity payment of $150,000 (equal to one year's salary) for the widower of the late Hon. Patsy Mink (Hawaii).  Discussions on the FY2003 bill included, among other issues, the following: funding increase for the activities of the Capitol Police;  security enhancements within and around the Capitolcomplex; recruitment and retention of Capitol Policepersonnel; salary disbursing authority for Capitol Policeofficers; Library of Congress Police merger with Capitol Police;and construction of a new Capitol Police command center.  (15) Funding Issues. The U.S. Capitol Police is responsible for Capitol complex security, under the direction of the Capitol Police Board. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the subsequent discovery of anthrax in Capitoloffice buildings prompted enhanced security within and around the Capitol complex, andCongress has undertaken to strengthen the capabilities of the U.S. Capitol Police. To furthersupport these abilities, Congress agreed to increase the Capitol Police budget by 17.6%, or$30.5 million, to $203.8 million from $173.3 million.  The Capitol Police appropriation is contained in two accounts--(1) the salaries account, which increased by $62.6 million (55.4%), to $175.7 million from $113.0 million, and (2)the general expenses account, which decreased $32.2 million (-53.4%), to $28.1 million from$60.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to the level of FY2002 funding, which containedtwo appropriations in addition to the regular appropriation--a transfer of $31.0 million fromthe legislative branch emergency response fund (pursuant to P.L. 107-117 ), and $16.1 millionfrom a FY2002 supplemental ( P.L. 107-206 ).  A separate appropriation under the account for the Architect of the Capitol contains $23.9 million for Capitol Police buildings and grounds.  FY2003 Capitol Police funding contains a 9.1% increase in police pay, and provisions provide for the merger of the Library of Congress police force with the Capitol Police force;expand authority for the Capitol Police chief to enhance police recruitment and retention(including provisions for hiring and relocation bonuses, establishment of a student loanrepayment program, and authorization for training). The Act also contains languagemandating a redefinition of the mission and composition of the Capitol Police Board. Previously, in FY2002, Congress increased spending for the Capitol Police by $50.3 million, or 47.1%, over the FY2001 level for a total appropriation of $157.2 million forFY2002. (16) In addition, Congress authorized anadditional 348 FTEs for a total of 1,750 FTEsin FY2002. For FY2003, the Capitol Police requested $212.6 million, an increase of 35.3% over the FY2002 level, and an additional 60 FTEs. Of the $212.6 million, $184.5 million (17) wasrequested for Capitol Police salaries, an increase of 63.3% over the FY2002 level of $113.0million. The increase largely was intended for additional officers and civilian personnel anda pay raise for sworn officers. In addition, during FY2003, the Capitol Police anticipated theneed to replace approximately 100 officers who normally leave the force each year throughattrition. (18) According to the Capitol Police, theincreased FTE level was to allow for two officers at each post - one to operate and monitor security equipment and one to act as an observer; staff of the new Office of EmergencyManagement; staff of a chemical/biological strike team;  additional sworn and civilian personnel for uniformed services,intelligence, and dignitary protection; and administrative support for increased Capitol Police personnel. (19) The U.S. Capitol Police requested $28.1 million for general expenses, a reduction of 36.4% from the FY2002 level of $44.2 million. The FY2002 appropriations includes atransfer of $31 million from the emergency response fund ( P.L. 107-38 ) for immediatesecurity enhancements undertaken by the Capitol Police in the aftermath of the September 11,2001 terrorist attacks. Without the $31 million supplemental, the FY2003 request for generalexpenses would have been an increase of 113.8% over the base level of $13.2 million. Theincrease was largely intended for  additional training programs for police and civilian personnel; implementation of a response strike force for a chemical, biological, orradiological incident;  increases in protective service travel; a new mobile command center; expansion of the information technologyinfrastructure; staff recruitment, including incentives and promotionaltesting; additional requirements for weapons, ammunition, and range facilities;and additional cell phones, workstations and other communicationsequipment. (20) New Account Structure for the Capitol Police in the FY2003 Bills. Both houses moved the Capitol Police account for (1) salariesand (2) general expenses from the Joint Items account to a stand-alone Capitol Police account. Additionally, both houses authorized a new account for Capitol Police buildings and groundswithin the appropriation for the Architect of the Capitol.  House and Senate FY2003 Appropriations for the Police. The total appropriation for all three appropriations in theHouse bill was $256.2 million, an increase of $99.0 million (63.0%) over the FY2002appropriations of $157.2 million. The Senate total was $209.8 million, an increase of $52.6million (33.5%). The major differences were funding levels for (1) general expenses ($43.0million in the House bill; $33.6 million in the Senate version) and (2) Capitol Police buildingsand grounds ($37.5 million in the House bill; $1.5 million in the Senate version). H.R. 5121 contained $175.7 million, an increase of 55.5%, for the salaries of 1,454 sworn officers and 326 civilians. This reflected an increase of 288 sworn officersand 30 civilians over current levels.  The Senate-adopted bill ( H.R. 5121 , amended to contain the language of S. 2720 ) contained $176.6 million, an increase of 56.3%, for the salaries of atotal of 1,839 FTEs. This was an increase of 269 FTEs over the FY2002 level. Bothappropriations measures accommodated a 9.1% pay raise for U.S. Capitol Police officers,which included a cost-of-living-adjustment of 4.1% and a comparability pay adjustment of5.0%. For general expenses of the Capitol Police, the House approved $43 million for FY2003, which represented an increase of 225.8% over the FY2002 base level of $13.2 million. (21) Incontrast, the Senate approved $33.2 million for general expenses. This figure represented anincrease of 151.5% from the FY2002 base level. The committee report accompanying theSenate bill stated: \"The amount recommended is needed primarily to support the significantincrease in staffing as well as an increase in training.\" (22) For Capitol Police buildings and grounds, the House approved $37.5 million, and the Senate approved $1.5 million.  Policy Issues. According to the U.S. Capitol Police, the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel to meet the additionaldemands has been a tremendous challenge. During a hearing before the SenateAppropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch on May 1, 2002, Acting Chief RobertR. Howe testified that the Capitol Police \"are losing officers to other law enforcementagencies at an increasing rate. Likewise, we are competing against those same agencies toattract qualified personnel to increase the staffing level and overcome attrition.\" Recognizing these challenges, Congress last year authorized the Capitol Police to institute a number of recruitment and retention incentives. Section 909 of the EmergencySupplemental Act, 2002 (Division B of P.L. 107-117 , 115 Stat. 2320-2322) authorizes theCapitol Police Board and the Capitol Police Chief to provide several types of financialincentives for the recruitment and retention of officers and employees of the Capitol Police. The House and Senate versions of the FY2003 legislative branch appropriations bill, H.R. 5121 , contained several administrative provisions related to suchincentives. (23) First, both bills included similarprovisions to give the Capitol Police chief thesole discretion in determining recruitment and retention bonuses and add a tuitionreimbursement program to the types of incentives the chief could offer.  Second, both bills contained similar provisions to provide the chief with other tools that were intended to augment personnel recruitment and retention. Some of these include theauthority to establish specialty positions and pay, provide availability pay to officers, andcompensate newly-appointed officers at a rate above the minimum base rate. The House billalso authorized the chief to establish a program to recruit former military and law enforcementpersonnel without regard to age and provide overtime compensation to officers at ranks abovelieutenant. The Senate bill required the chief to recruit personnel for the Capitol Policewithout regard to age. The House Appropriations Committee-reported measure contained a provision (Section 110 of H.R. 5121 ) transferring the disbursing authority for salaries of the CapitolPolice to the chief. Currently, salaries of Capitol Police officers assigned to the House aredisbursed by the House Chief Administrative Officer, and salaries of officers assigned to theSenate are disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate. The Committee-reported provision wouldhave consolidated these payrolls. However, during consideration of the bill on the Housefloor on July 18, 2002, Representative Robert Ney raised a point of order against the provisionon the grounds that it violated clause 2 of House Rule XXI by changing existing law. (24) Afterthe chair sustained the point of order, the provision was stricken from the bill. (25) Identical language consolidating the Capitol Police payrolls was added to the Senate version of the legislative branch appropriations bill by a manager's amendment( S.Amdt. 4320 ), approved by unanimous consent on July 25, 2002. Finally, the Senate bill contained an administrative provision (Section 108 of S. 2720 ) to transfer the personnel and functions of the Library of Congress Policeto the U.S. Capitol Police. Last year, the Senate Appropriations Committee requested theGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct an evaluation on the feasibility of consolidatingthe Library of Congress Police or the Government Printing Office Police or both with theCapitol Police. (26) On July 5, 2002, the GAO issuedits completed evaluation, U.S. CapitolPolice Merger Review (GAO-02-792R), finding that a merger of the police forces would befeasible. The merger provision was retained by conferees on H.J.Res. 2 .  Although the FY2003 request does not contain funds for the Capitol visitors' center, the center will play an important role in Capitol security. Conferees on the FY2002 legislativebranch appropriations bill agreed to add $70 million for the Capitol visitors' center, reflectinga heightened interest by some Members of Congress in making the necessary appropriationsavailable so that construction on the center could begin in early calendar year 2002. Duringmark up of the FY2002 bill by the Senate Appropriations Committee, committee membersagreed to an amendment containing $1 million for the \"planning, engineering, design, andconstruction\" of the center the purpose of which is \"to provide greater security for all personsworking in or visiting the United States Capitol and to enhance the educational experience ofthose who have come to learn about the Capitol building and Congress.\" The funds were toremain available until expended. The mark up of the House Subcommittee on Legislative didnot contain funds for the center. Subsequent to congressional approval of $70 million for the center in November 2001, the President released additional funds for construction of the center in the FY2001emergency terrorism funds contained ( P.L. 107-38 .) The construction funds were containedin $211.1 million released to the Architect of the Capitol. The amount of funds available forconstruction was not provided in the release. (27) Congressional leadership broke ground for the center on June 20, 2000. Construction began in early 2002 and is expected to be completed in 2005. (28) Cost is estimated to beapproximately $335 million. Architect of the Capitol Funding. Conferees agreed to a FY2003 funding level of $395.4 million, an increase of $40.4 million(11.4%) from $355.0 million. Operations of the Architect of the Capitol are funded in nineaccounts. These accounts and their increases are general administration (15.5%);  Capitol building (-73.6%) (29) ; Capitol grounds (39.1%); Senate office buildings (54.0%);  House office buildings (12.9%);  Capitol power plant (94.5%);  Library buildings and grounds (72.5%); Capitol buildings and grounds (100.0%); and, Botanic Gardens (8.1%).  From time to time, other projects of the Architect may be funded in separate accounts, as was the case in FY2002, which included $70.0 million for the Capitol Visitors' Center and$1.3 million for the Congressional Cemetery. The FY2003 request for activities of the Architect was $409.4 million, an increase of $55.0 million (15.5%) from FY2002.  Among the Architect's requests were funds for 43 currently unfunded FTEs ($3.2 million), and a total FTE level of 1,958; and 115 projects that were contained in theArchitect's \"capital budget,\" which primarily funds maintenance projects. Seven projectsaccount for $67 million, or 65%, of the request. These include funds for repair of the Capitoldome ($42.5 million); purchase of property for an off-site delivery and screening center forthe Capitol police ($6.8 million); constructing a new Library of Congress audio visualconservation center in Culpepper Virginia ($5 million); renovations to the Rayburn officebuilding cafeteria ($3.5 million); designing and purchasing land for a vehicle maintenancefacility for the Capitol police ($3.3 million); modernizing House building elevators ($3million); and preparing construction drawings for a garage adjacent to Capitol policeheadquarters ($3 million).

Funding for House committees is contained in the appropriation heading \"committee employees\" that comprises two subheadings. The first subheading contains funds forpersonnel and non-personnel expenses of House committees, except the AppropriationsCommittee, as authorized by the House in a committee expense resolution. Thisappropriation is $103.4 million, a decrease of $1.1 million (-1.1%) over the FY2002appropriation of $104.5 million.  The second subheading contains funds for the personnel and non-personnel expenses of the Committee on Appropriations.

P.L. 108-7 contains $32.1 million for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), an increase of $1.3million, or 4.3%, over the agency's FY2002 funding level of $30.8 million. Administrativelanguage authorizes the director of CBO to establish a program which allows CBO employeesto participate in details or other temporary assignments in other government agencies, orstudies, or uncompensated work experiences that CBO considers would benefit employees'future work at CBO.  The agency's request contained authorization for four additional FTE positions, increasing the FTE level to 236, allowing CBO to expand its visiting scholars' program, (30) anda request to change its legislative authority in order to offer advanced staff training throughstudy and work experiences in both government and private sectors, in subject areas in whichthe agency had difficulty recruiting. According to the director of CBO in recent testimony, the agency's budget \"continues to be driven by the need to be competitive in a specialists labor market, with nearly all of theincrease going to mandatory increases in personnel costs.\" General Accounting Office. Congress appropriated $451.1 million for the General Accounting Office (GAO), which is a $21.7million (5.1%) increase from FY2002's funding level of $429.4 million. The House versionof H.R. 5121 (107th Congress) contained $453.5 million, and the Senate version$454.5 million.

The agency's request allowed it to maintain the authorized FTE level of 3,269. According to GAO, 80% of its FY2003 budget request was for pay and related benefits, withemphasis on staff training, recruiting, and retention, including mass transit subsidies and anew student loan repayment program.

An additional $29.5million is available to the Library through congressional authorization to use receipts collectedby the Copyright Office. Funds are distributed among four accounts as follows:  $351.6 million for salaries and expenses of the Library, including $17.2 million for the digital futures program, and authorization for 2,841 FTEstaff; $9.7 million for the Copyright Office, including authorization for 530FTEs;  $87.0 million for the Congressional Research Service (CRS), includingauthorization for 742 FTEs; and $51.0 million for books for the blind and physically handicapped,including 128 FTEs.

The Libraryrequested 169 additional FTE positions, as follows: 35 for digital futures, 118 for collectionsaccess, preservation and security, 4 for infrastructure support, and 12 for CRS, for a newauthorized FTE level of 4,358. (32) The Librarian of Congress also requested an additional $7.5 million in FY2002 funds for the Copyright Office to meet the shortfall in copyright registration receipts due to delays inthe receiving mail. These funds were contained in the FY2002 Supplemental AppropriationAct ( P.L. 107-206 ). Government Printing Office. P.L. 108-7 contains $119.8 million for the Government Printing Office (GPO), an increase of $5.2million (4.5%) from the previous year's appropriation of $114.6 million. Funds areappropriated in two accounts--\"Congressional Printing and Binding\" and \"Office ofSuperintendent of Documents.\" From time to time, a third account is funded, \"GovernmentPrinting Office Revolving Fund.\" Although Congress transferred $4.0 million to this accountfor FY2002, it did not provide for the transfer of fund in FY2003.  The FY2003 increase is primarily due to congressional printing and binding expenses, an increase of $9.1 million (11.3%) to $90.1 million from $81.0 million. Funds for the Officeof Superintendent of Documents increased $22,000 (0.07%) to $29.7 million from $29.6million.   Table 3.
