    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Child Care for the Gulf \nCoast Region Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Studies have stated that reopening child care \n        facilities was crucial for helping parents get back to work and \n        businesses to recover.\n            (2) Studies have shown that without available and \n        affordable child care economic recovery will be greatly impeded \n        and lead to a reduction in worker productivity.\n            (3) In New Orleans before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the \n        city had 1,912 day-care slots at 266 licensed centers, but now \n        80 percent of those centers and 75 percent of those slots are \n        gone.\n            (4) The National Association of Child Care Resource and \n        Referral Agencies reported in a study published by the \n        Mississippi State University Early Childhood Institute that \n        between 62 to 94 percent of the licensed child care slots in \n        the three coastal counties hardest hit by Hurricanes Katrina \n        and Rita in Mississippi were lost.\n            (5) In Jackson County, Mississippi, initial assessment \n        found that one-fourth of the county's licensed centers were \n        damaged beyond repair, representing 11 percent of the county's \n        licensed child care capacity. Another 39 percent of centers \n        needed repairs.\n\nTITLE I--EMERGENCY CHILD CARE BUSINESS INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR THE \n                           GULF COAST REGION\n\nSEC. 101.
