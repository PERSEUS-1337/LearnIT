    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Save Our Climate Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \n        has concluded that human emissions of greenhouse gases, \n        particularly carbon dioxide are responsible for global climate \n        change.\n            (2) The IPCC has estimated that global temperatures will \n        rise between 3.2-7.2 degrees Farenheit in the next 100 years if \n        carbon dioxide emissions are not dramatically reduced.\n            (3) An increase of even a few degrees could have major \n        adverse impacts on both the human and man-made environments, \n        due to rising sea-levels, intensification of weather events, \n        mass extinction of species, and scarcity of water.\n            (4) The United States is responsible for nearly 24 percent \n        of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, equaling approximately \n        six billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.\n            (5) In order to stabilize the earth's climate and prevent \n        catastrophic global climate change, the level of worldwide \n        carbon dioxide emissions need to be reduced 80 percent by 2050.\n            (6) A tax on fossil fuels based on carbon content will \n        reduce the incentive to burn those fuels, thereby reducing \n        carbon dioxide emissions.\n            (7) Revenue collected from a tax on fossil fuels could be \n        used to decrease taxes on low and middle-income taxpayers, to \n        fund research and development of alternative green energy \n        sources, or to increase funding for other domestic social \n        priorities.\n\nSEC. 3. IMPOSITION OF CARBON TAX ON PRIMARY FOSSIL FUELS.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--Chapter 38 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n(relating to environmental taxes) is amended by adding at the end \nthereof the following new subchapter:\n\n           ``Subchapter E--Carbon Tax on Primary Fossil Fuels\n\n``Sec. 4691.
