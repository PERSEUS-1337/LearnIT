    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This act may be cited as the ``National Defense Rail Connection Act \nof 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) A comprehensive rail transportation network is a key element of \nan integrated transportation system for the North American continent, \nand Federal leadership is required to address the needs of a reliable, \nsafe, and secure rail network, and to connect all areas of the United \nStates for national defense and economic development, as previously \ndone for the interstate highway system, the Federal aviation network, \nand the transcontinental railroad.\n    (b) The creation and use of joint use corridors for rail \ntransportation, fiber optics, pipelines, and utilities are an efficient \nand appropriate approach to optimizing the Nation's interconnectivity \nand national security.\n    (c) Government assistance and encouragement in the development of \nthe transcontinental rail system successfully led to the growth of \neconomically strong and socially stable communities throughout the \nwestern United States.\n    (d) Government assistance and encouragement in the development of \nthe Alaska Railroad between Seward, Alaska and Fairbanks, Alaska \nsuccessfully led to the growth of economically strong and socially \nstable communities along the route, which today provide homes for over \n70 percent of Alaska's total population.\n    (e) While Alaska and the remainder of the continental United States \nhas been connected by highway and air transportation, no rail \nconnection exists despite the fact that Alaska is accessible by land \nroutes and is a logical destination for the North American rail system.\n    (f) Rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas is an \nappropriate means of providing controlled access, reducing overall \nimpacts to environmentally sensitive areas over other methods of land-\nbased access.\n    (g) Because Congress originally authorized 1,000 miles of rail line \nto be built in Alaska, and because the system today covers only \napproximately half that distance, substantially limiting its beneficial \neffect on the economy of Alaska and the Nation, it is appropriate to \nsupport the expansion of the Alaska system to ensure the originally \nplanned benefits are achieved.\n    (h) Alaska has an abundance of natural resources, both material and \naesthetic, access to which would significantly increase Alaska's \ncontribution to the national economy.\n    (i) Alaska contains many key national defense installations, \nincluding sites chosen for the construction of the first phase of the \nNational Missile Defense system, the cost of which could be \nsignificantly reduced if rail transportation were available for the \nmovement of materials necessary for construction and for the secure \nmovement of launch vehicles, fuel and other operational supplies.\n    (j) The 106th Congress recognized the potential benefits of \nestablishing a rail connection to Alaska by enacting legislation to \nauthorize a U.S.-Canada bilateral commission to study the feasibility \nof linking the rail system in Alaska to the nearest appropriate point \nin Canada of the North American rail network.\n    (k) In support of pending bilateral activities between the United \nStates and Canada, it is appropriate for the United States to undertake \nactivities relating to elements within the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. IDENTIFICATION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE RAILROAD-UTILITY CORRIDOR.\n\n    (a) Within one year from the date of enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of \nTransportation, the State of Alaska and the Alaska Railroad \nCorporation, shall identify a proposed national defense railroad-\nutility corridor linking the existing corridor of the Alaska Railroad \nto the vicinity of the proposed National Missile Defense facilities at \nFort Greely, Alaska. The corridor shall be at least 500 feet wide and \nshall also identify land for such terminals, stations, maintenance \nfacilities, switching yards, and material sites as are considered \nnecessary.\n    (b) The identification of the corridor under paragraph (a) shall \ninclude information providing a complete legal description for and \nnoting the current ownership of the proposed corridor and associated \nland.\n    (c) In identifying the corridor under paragraph (a), the Secretary \nshall consider, at a minimum, the following factors:\n            (1) The proximity of national defense installations and \n        national defense considerations.\n            (2) The location of and access to natural resources that \n        could contribute to economic development of the region.\n            (3) Grade and alignment standards that are commensurate \n        with rail and utility construction standards and that minimize \n        the prospect of at-grade railroad and highway crossings.\n            (4) Availability of construction materials.\n            (5) Safety.\n            (6) Effects on and service to adjacent communities and \n        potential intermodal transportation connections.\n            (7) Environmental concerns.\n            (8) Use of public land to the maximum degree possible.\n            (9) Minimization of probable construction costs.\n            (10) An estimate of probable construction costs and methods \n        of financing such costs through a combination of private, \n        State, and Federal sources.\n            (11) Appropriate utility elements for the corridor, \n        including but not limited to petroleum product pipelines, \n        fiber-optic telecommunication facilities, and electrical power \n        transmission lines.\n            (12) Prior and established traditional uses.\n    (d) The Secretary may, as part of the corridor identification, \ninclude issues related to the further extension of such corridor to a \nconnection with the nearest appropriate terminus of the North American \nrail network in Canada.\n\nSEC. 4. NEGOTIATION AND LAND TRANSFER.\n\n    (a) The Secretary of the Interior shall--\n            (1) upon completion of the corridor identification in \n        section 3, negotiate the acquisition of any lands in the \n        corridor which are not federally owned through an exchange for \n        lands of equal or greater value held by the Federal Government \n        elsewhere in Alaska; and\n            (2) upon completion of the acquisition of lands under \n        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall convey to the Alaska \n        Railroad Corporation, subject to valid existing rights, title \n        to the lands identified under section 3 as necessary to \n        complete the national defense railroad-utility corridor, on \n        condition that the Alaska Railroad Corporation construct in the \n        corridor an extension of the railroad system to the vicinity of \n        the proposed national missile defense installation at Fort \n        Greely, Alaska, together with such other utilities, including \n        but not limited to fiber-optic transmission lines and \n        electrical transmission lines, as it considers necessary and \n        appropriate. The Federal interest in lands conveyed to the \n        Alaska Railroad Corporation under this Act shall be the same as \n        in lands conveyed pursuant to the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act \n        (45 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 5. APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS.\n\n    Actions authorized in this Act shall proceed immediately and to \nconclusion not withstanding the land-use planning provisions of section \n202 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, Public Law \n94-579.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \nnecessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
