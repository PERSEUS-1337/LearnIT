Grantees \n        may conduct forensic reviews to determine whether recorded data \n        has been tampered with. Data shall be downloaded from the body-\n        worn camera by the end of each shift in which the camera was \n        used. Officers shall properly categorize and tag body-worn \n        camera videos at the time they are downloaded. Videos shall be \n        classified according to the type of event or incident captured \n        in the footage.\n            ``(12) When setting time frames for retention of data, \n        grantees shall consider the following:\n                    ``(A) State laws governing evidence retention.\n                    ``(B) Departmental policies governing retention of \n                other types of electronic records.\n                    ``(C) The openness of the State's public disclosure \n                laws.\n                    ``(D) The need to preserve footage to promote \n                transparency.\n                    ``(E) The length of time typically needed to \n                receive and investigate citizen complaints.\n                    ``(F) The agency's capacity for data storage.\n            ``(13) Data must be managed by a third party.

Each such policy \n        must be in compliance with any applicable State or Federal \n        public disclosure laws.\n            ``(18) Body-worn camera training shall be required for all \n        grantee personnel who may use or otherwise be involved with \n        body-worn cameras.\n            ``(19) The grantee shall collect statistical data \n        concerning body-worn camera usage, including when video footage \n        is used in criminal prosecutions and internal affairs matters \n        as well as when excessive force has been used.\n            ``(20) The grantee shall conduct periodic reviews of \n        policies and protocols of the grantee pertaining to body-worn \n        cameras.\n\n``SEC. 3034. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.\n\n    ``Funds available under this part shall be awarded to each \nqualifying unit of local government with fewer than 100,000 residents. \nAny remaining funds available under this part shall be awarded to other \nqualifying applicants on a pro rata basis.\n\n``SEC. 3035. MATCHING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    ``(a) Federal Share.--The portion of the costs of a program \nprovided by a grant under subsection (a) may not exceed 50 percent. Any \nfunds appropriated by Congress for the activities of any agency of an \nIndian tribal government or the Bureau of Indian Affairs performing law \nenforcement functions on any Indian lands may be used to provide the \nnon-Federal share of a matching requirement funded under this \nsubsection.\n    ``(b) Non-Federal Share.--The non-Federal share of payments made \nunder this part may be made in cash or in-kind fairly evaluated, \nincluding planned equipment or services.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
