FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) The provisions in Public Law 94-519 established a \n        system to ensure the fair and equitable allocation of Federal \n        surplus personal property to eligible recipients, including law \n        enforcement agencies, school systems, medical institutions, \n        libraries, homeless assistance providers, and units of local \n        government;\n            (2) the benefits of the Federal personal property \n        utilization and donation program are measured in terms of \n        United States dollars which are not spent by the donees on new \n        and expensive property;\n            (3) Members of Congress and State and local officials have \n        an obligation to oversee the fair and equitable distribution of \n        Government property, thereby ensuring accountability to the \n        taxpayers of the United States;\n            (4) the owners of surplus Federal property are the people \n        of the United States, and the Federal Government is merely its \n        public custodian;\n            (5) the efforts of the State agencies in distributing \n        surplus property have enabled thousands of United States \n        taxpayers to acquire items such as office equipment, clothing, \n        furniture, motor vehicles, forklifts, aircraft, boats, and \n        generators which have been declared surplus to the needs of the \n        Federal Government;\n            (6) the effectiveness of the current system for donation of \n        surplus Federal personal property has been undermined by \n        programs that mandate that property be made available on a \n        priority basis to foreign entities before the safety, health, \n        education, and training needs of taxpayers of the United States \n        are met; and\n            (7) new legislation is needed to move the priority of \n        property transfers through foreign assistance programs to a \n        level below that of domestic use transfers of excess personal \n        property to Federal agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. PRIORITY TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE TRANSFER OF \n              NONLETHAL EXCESS SUPPLIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n    Section 2547 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``The Secretary of \n        Defense'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``Subject to subsection \n        (d), the Secretary of Defense'';\n            (2) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (e); and\n            (3) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:\n    ``(d) Nonlethal excess supplies of the Department of Defense shall \nbe made available to a State, a local government of a State, a \nterritory, or a possession, upon the request of the State, local \ngovernment, territory, or possession pursuant to authority provided in \nanother provision of law before such supplies are made available for \nhumanitarian relief purposes under this section. The President may make \nsuch supplies available for humanitarian purposes before such supplies \nare made available to a State, local government, territory, or \npossession under this subsection in order to respond to an emergency \nprecipitated by a natural disaster.''.\n\nSEC. 4. TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN FOREIGN \n              COUNTRIES.\n\n    Section 607 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n2357(d)) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (d)--\n                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) \n                as subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), respectively;\n                    ((B) by striking ``(d) The'' and inserting ``(d)(1) \n                Except as provided in paragraph (3), the''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(2) No property may be transferred under paragraph (1) unless the \nAdministrator of General Services determines that there is no Federal \nor State use requirement for the property under any other provision of \nlaw.''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(e) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the transfer of \nconfiscated property to foreign countries.''.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT ON DISPOSAL AND DONATION OF SURPLUS PERSONAL PROPERTY.\n\n    Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Administrator of General Services shall review all statutes \nrelating to the disposal and donation of surplus personal property and \nsubmit to Congress a report on such statutes including--\n            (1) the effectiveness of programs administered under such \n        statutes (except for any program that grants access to personal \n        property by local communities impacted by the closure of a \n        military base), and the amount and type of property \n        administered under each such program during the 2 most recent \n        fiscal years; and\n            (2) legislative recommendations to integrate and \n        consolidate all such programs to be administered by a single \n        Federal authority working with State agencies while \n        accomplishing the purposes of such programs."
