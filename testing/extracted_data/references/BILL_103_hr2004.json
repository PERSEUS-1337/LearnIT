CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) since the late 18th century, the United States textile \n        machinery industry has played an important role in the \n        development of the world textile industry;\n            (2) the United States textile machinery industry currently \n        consists of approximately 500 companies, primarily small \n        businesses, producing machinery, parts and accessories used in \n        the production of textile mill products for apparel, defense, \n        furniture and industrial application;\n            (3) the textile machinery industry is overwhelmingly \n        comprised of firms with 50 or fewer employees;\n            (4) the textile machinery industry is one of 92 industries \n        in the United States considered essential to our defense needs;\n            (5) during the last decade, the textile machinery industry \n        has been among those industries most weakened due to a dramatic \n        rise in imports and foreign trade barriers which thwart United \n        States exports;\n            (6) further erosion of the textile machinery industry will \n        expose the United States textile and apparel complex to \n        offshore pricing, delivery and service resulting in less \n        competition and limited choice;\n            (7) shipments of textile machinery, parts and accessories \n        were approximately 26 percent lower in 1988 than in 1980, while \n        imports rose by an astounding 100 percent during this same \n        period;\n            (8) such erosion of the textile machinery industry will \n        result in loss of tariff revenue to the Treasury of the United \n        States;\n            (9) the textile industry is among the largest five \n        employers in the country;\n            (10) there are many economic benefits of the textile \n        machinery industry, including tariffs on imports, corporate and \n        employee taxes, preservation of jobs and small businesses, \n        industrial growth, manufacturing skills, maintenance of basic \n        industries, increased exports, and a lower trade deficit;\n            (11) over the last two decades, employment in the textile \n        machinery industry has shrunk from 28,500 individuals to \n        17,800;\n            (12) recapturing the textile machinery market will be a \n        positive contribution to the balance of trade;\n            (13) trade impacted businesses should have direct access to \n        capital from the source of subsidized competition; and\n            (14) government studies recommend that research and \n        development programs be developed to help sustain and expand \n        the textile machinery industry.\n\nSEC. 2.
