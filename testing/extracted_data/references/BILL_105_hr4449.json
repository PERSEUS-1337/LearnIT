MUST-CARRY FOR SATELLITE CARRIERS RETRANSMITTING TELEVISION \n              BROADCAST SIGNALS.\n\n    Title III of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended by inserting \nafter section 336 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 337. CARRIAGE OF LOCAL TELEVISION SIGNALS BY SATELLITE CARRIERS.\n\n    ``(a) Carriage Obligations.--Each satellite carrier providing \nsecondary transmissions of a television broadcast station to \nsubscribers located within the local market of such station shall offer \nto carry all television broadcast stations located within that local \nmarket, subject to section 325(b), except that the carriage obligations \nof this section shall not apply to satellite carriers that do not \nretransmit the signals of broadcast television stations pursuant to the \nstatutory license under section 122 of title 17, United States Code. \nCarriage of additional television broadcast stations within the local \nmarket shall be at the discretion of the satellite carrier, subject to \nsection 325(b).\n    ``(b) Duplication Not Required.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), a \nsatellite carrier shall not be required to offer to carry the signal of \nany local television broadcast station that substantially duplicates \nthe signal of another local television broadcast station which is \nsecondarily transmitted by the satellite carrier, or to offer to carry \nthe signals of more that one local television broadcast station \naffiliated with a particular broadcast network (as the term is defined \nby regulation).\n    ``(c) Carriage of All Local Television Stations on Contiguous \nChannels.--All local television broadcast stations retransmitted by a \nsatellite carrier to subscribers in the stations' local markets shall \nbe made available to subscribers in their local markets on contiguous \nchannels and in a nondiscriminatory manner on any navigational device, \non-screen program guide, or menu.\n    ``(d) Compensation for Carriage.--A satellite carrier shall not \naccept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in \nexchange either for carriage of local television broadcast stations in \naccordance with the requirements of this section or for channel \npositioning rights provided to such stations under this section, except \nthat any such station may be required to bear the costs associated with \ndelivering a good quality signal to the principal headend of the \nsatellite carrier. No station carried in accordance with the \nrequirements of this section shall be required to bear the costs of \ndelivering a good quality signal to a location other than the principal \nheadend of the satellite carrier.\n    ``(e) Remedies.--\n            ``(1) Complaints by broadcast stations.--Whenever a local \n        television broadcast station believes that a satellite carrier \n        has failed to meet its obligations under this section, such \n        station shall notify the carrier, in writing, of the alleged \n        failure and identify its reasons for believing that the \n        satellite carrier is obligated to offer to carry the signal of \n        such station or has otherwise failed to comply with other \nrequirements of this section. The satellite carrier shall, within 30 \ndays after such written notification, respond in writing to such \nnotification and either begin carrying the signal of such station in \naccordance with the terms requested or state its reasons for believing \nthat it is not obligated to carry such signal or is in compliance with \nother requirements of this section. A local television broadcast \nstation that is denied carriage in accordance with this section by a \nsatellite carrier may obtain review of such denial by filing a \ncomplaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner \nin which such satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations and \nthe basis for such allegations. A failure by a satellite carrier to \ncarry a local television broadcast station within its local market if \nthere has been a change in that station's local market, or to carry a \nlocal broadcast television station that is significantly viewed outside \nits local market due to technical limitations of that satellite \ncarrier's existing facilities, shall not constitute a failure by the \nsatellite carrier to comply with its obligations under this section.\n            ``(2) Opportunity to respond.--The Commission shall afford \n        such satellite carrier an opportunity to present data and \n        arguments to establish that there has been no failure to meet \n        its obligations under this section.\n            ``(3) Remedial actions; dismissal.--Within 120 days after \n        the date a complaint is filed, the Commission shall determine \n        whether the satellite carrier has met its obligations under \n        this section. If the Commission determines that the satellite \n        carrier has failed to meet such obligations, the Commission \n        shall order the satellite carrier, in the case of an obligation \n        to carry a station, to begin carriage of the station and to \n        continue such carriage for at least 12 months. If the \n        Commission determines that the satellite carrier has fully met \n        the requirements of this section, it shall dismiss the \n        complaint.\n    ``(f) Regulations by Commission.--Within 180 days after the \neffective date of this section, the Commission shall, following a \nrulemaking proceeding, issue regulations implementing the requirements \nimposed by this section.\n    ``(g) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n            ``(1) Television broadcast station.--The term `television \n        broadcast station' means a full-power television broadcast \n        station, and does not include a low-power or translator \n        television broadcast station.\n            ``(2) Local market.--The term `local market' means the \n        designated market area in which a station is located and--\n                    ``(A) for a commercial television broadcast station \n                located in any of the 150 largest designated market \n                areas, all commercial television broadcast stations \n                licensed to a community within the same designated \n                market area are within the same local market;\n                    ``(B) for a commercial television broadcast station \n                that is located in a designated market area that is not \n                one of the 150 largest, the local market includes all \n                commercial television broadcast stations licensed to a \n                community within the same designated market area, and \n                may also include any station that is significantly \n                viewed, as such term is defined in section 76.54 of the \n                title 47, Code of Federal Regulations; and\n                    ``(C) for a noncommercial educational television \n                broadcast station, the local market includes any \n                station that is licensed to a community within the same \n                designated market area as the noncommercial educational \n                television broadcast station.\n            ``(3) Designated market area.--The term `designated market \n        area' means a designated market area, as determined by the \n        Nielsen Media Research and published in the DMA Market and \n        Demographic Report.\n            ``(4) Principal headend of the satellite carrier.--The term \n        `principal headend of the satellite carrier' means the \n        reception point in the local market of a broadcast television \n        station or in a market contiguous to the local market of a \n        broadcast television station at which the satellite carrier \n        initially receives the signal of the station for purposes of \n        transmission of such signals to the facility which uplinks the \n        signals to the carrier's satellites for secondary transmission \n        to the satellite carrier's subscribers.\n            ``(5) Secondary transmission.--The term `secondary \n        transmission' has the meaning given that term in section 119(d) \n        of title 17, United States Code.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
