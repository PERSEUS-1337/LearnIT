FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is to \n        require agencies of the Federal Government to make certain \n        agency information available for public inspection and copying \n        and to establish and enable enforcement of the right of any \n        person to obtain access to the records of such agencies \n        (subject to statutory exemptions) for any public or private \n        purpose;\n            (2) since the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act \n        in 1966, and the amendments enacted in 1974 and 1986, the \n        Freedom of Information Act has been a valuable means through \n        which any person can learn how the Federal Government operates;\n            (3) the Freedom of Information Act has led to the \n        disclosure of waste, fraud, abuse, and wrongdoing in the \n        Federal Government;\n            (4) the Freedom of Information Act has led to the \n        identification of unsafe consumer products, harmful drugs, and \n        serious health hazards;\n            (5) Government agencies increasingly use computers to \n        conduct agency business and to store publicly valuable agency \n        records and information; and\n            (6) Government agencies should use new technology to \n        enhance public access to agency records and information.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) foster democracy by ensuring public access to agency \n        records and information;\n            (2) improve public access to agency records and \n        information;\n            (3) ensure agency compliance with statutory time limits; \n        and\n            (4) maximize the usefulness of agency records and \n        information collected, maintained, used, retained, and \n        disseminated by the Federal Government.\n\nSEC. 3.
