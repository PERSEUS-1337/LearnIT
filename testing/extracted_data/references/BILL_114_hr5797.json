FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine \n        Conservation Area established by this Act contains a series of \n        ancient volcanos and underwater geological features in the \n        Exclusive Economic Zone.\n            (2) Found on the seamounts, ridges, and banks in the \n        Conservation Area are rare deep-water corals, sponges, \n        anemones, tunas, sharks, seabirds, marine mammals (including \n        orcas, sperm whales, and blue whales), endangered sea turtles, \n        octopuses, and diverse fish populations, some of which are \n        endemic to the area.\n            (3) The only hydrothermal vents in the continental \n        Exclusive Economic Zone are found on Gorda Ridge located off \n        the north coast of California and the south coast of Oregon.\n            (4) These areas' remote location and depth contribute to \n        their remarkably pristine condition, limited human footprint, \n        and reputation as a vital frontier for scientific discovery, \n        with research expeditions continuing to yield new and rare \n        species, greater understanding about ecological relationships, \n        and renewed appreciation of the uniqueness of deep-sea \n        ecosystems.\n            (5) Despite currently limited direct pressure from \n        extractive use, the Conservation Area is undergoing rapid \n        change due to warming waters, ocean acidification, and \n        ecological stress from pollution and other sources the \n        management of which transcends the jurisdiction of any single \n        government agency or department.\n            (6) According to many scientists, comprehensive marine \n        habitat protection is one of the most important actions for \n        building resilience in ocean environments to current and \n        emerging challenges presented by anthropogenic and other \n        stressors impacting marine ecosystems.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect, conserve, and \nenhance for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations \nthe nationally significant historical, natural, cultural, scientific, \nand educational values of the California Seamounts and Ridges National \nMarine Conservation Area.\n\nSEC. 3.
