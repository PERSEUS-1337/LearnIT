FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) From 1929 through 1941, Federal, State, and local \n        Government authorities and certain private sector entities \n        throughout the United States undertook an aggressive program to \n        forcibly remove individuals of Mexican ancestry from the United \n        States.\n            (2) As many as two million individuals of Mexican ancestry \n        were forcibly removed to Mexico, as many as 1.2 million of whom \n        were United States citizens.\n            (3) These men, women, and children were removed outside the \n        United States in response to public pressure to curtail the \n        employment of Mexican-Americans, most of whom were United \n        States citizens or residing legally in the United States, \n        during the Depression.\n            (4) Massive raids were conducted on Mexican-American \n        communities, and many of the people who were removed were never \n        able to return to the United States, their country of birth.\n            (5) These raids targeted individuals of Mexican ancestry, \n        with Federal, State, and local Government authorities and \n        certain private sector entities characterizing these \n        individuals as ``illegal aliens'' even when such individuals \n        were United States citizens or permanent legal residents.\n            (6) These raids also separated such United States citizens \n        and permanent legal residents from their families and deprived \n        them of their livelihoods and constitutional rights.\n            (7) No official inquiry into this matter has been made.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a fact \nfinding commission to determine whether United States citizens and \npermanent legal residents were forcibly removed to Mexico from 1929 to \n1941 in violation of law as a result of past directives of Federal, \nState and local governments and the impact of such removal on those \nindividuals, their families, and the Mexican-American community in the \nUnited States, and to recommend appropriate remedies.\n\nSEC. 3.
