FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote \n        the general welfare of the United States by supporting \n        interstate, national, and international commerce through the \n        use of Federal resources to assist States, Indian tribes, and \n        local governments in the development and maintenance of \n        physical infrastructure, including roads, highways, byways, \n        bridges, and other transportation-related structures;\n            (2) there exists a unique legal and political relationship \n        between the United States and tribal governments and a unique \n        Federal responsibility to American Indians and Alaska Natives;\n            (3) under law and practice, the United States has \n        undertaken a trust responsibility to protect and preserve \n        Indian tribes, Indians, and tribal assets and resources;\n            (4) this Federal responsibility includes working with \n        tribal governments and their members to improve the condition \n        of the physical infrastructure used by tribes for their \n        economic well-being;\n            (5) the demonstrated need for improvements to physical \n        infrastructure on Indian land is acute, and the Federal \n        Government should assist in making the improvements and in \n        developing tribal and private mechanisms to achieve the goals \n        of economic self-sufficiency and political self-determination;\n            (6)(A) Indian tribes of the United States are served by \n        over 50,000 miles of roads nationwide;\n            (B) the road system of the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n        constitutes about 21,000 miles, or 42 percent, of roads serving \n        Indian tribes;\n            (C) State and county roads make up the largest percentage, \n        about 49 percent, of roads serving Indian tribes; and\n            (D) tribal roads account for approximately 5 percent, and \n        private and Federal roads (other than Bureau of Indian Affairs \n        roads) make up the small balance of approximately 4 percent, of \n        roads serving Indian tribes;\n            (7)(A) the Indian reservation roads program established \n        under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n        1991 (Public Law 102-240) is targeted at the Bureau of Indian \n        Affairs road system that constitutes less than \\1/2\\ of the \n        total mileage of roads on Indian reservations in the United \n        States;\n            (B) only 11 percent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs roads \n        are rated as being in good condition; and\n            (C) of the unpaved Bureau of Indian Affairs roads, 90 \n        percent are known to be in poor condition and none of the \n        unpaved roads are rated as being in good condition;\n            (8)(A) annual funding of the Indian reservation roads \n        program, through the Highway Trust Fund, as authorized by the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, has become \nthe major source of funding for new road construction on Indian land in \nthe United States;\n            (B) the Bureau of Indian Affairs road construction budget \n        has virtually vanished; and\n            (C) the Bureau of Indian Affairs continues to provide \n        minimal funding of about $25,000,000 per fiscal year for road \n        maintenance of its road system;\n            (9)(A) in the late 1950's, Bureau of Indian Affairs road \n        construction and maintenance funding reached a high of \n        $10,000,000 per fiscal year for the first time in history;\n            (B) by 1979, Bureau of Indian Affairs road budgets for \n        construction and maintenance reached their peak of almost \n        $80,000,000 per fiscal year, and then declined rapidly;\n            (C) in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 \n        (Public Law 97-424), the funding levels for the Indian \n        reservation roads program stabilized at about $100,000,000 \n        through the Highway Trust Fund for each of fiscal years 1984 \n        through 1986;\n            (D) the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation \n        Assistance Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-17) reduced the annual \n        Highway Trust Fund authorization to $80,000,000 for each of \n        fiscal years 1987 through 1991; and\n            (E) in almost every fiscal year since fiscal year 1992, the \n        Indian reservation roads program has been funded at \n        $191,000,000 per fiscal year;\n            (10)(A) Indian reservation roads are needed to support \n        economic development activities, education, health, and \n        virtually every aspect of reservation life; and\n            (B) some of the most scenic highways in the United States \n        are on Indian reservations;\n            (11)(A) at current and historic levels of funding, Indian \n        road conditions continue to fall behind national standards; and\n            (B) to help alleviate some of the poor transportation \n        conditions on Indian reservations in the United States, there \n        is a need to increase the level of funding, from the Highway \n        Trust Fund, for the Indian reservation roads program to \n        $300,000,000 per fiscal year, from the current level of \n        $191,000,000 per fiscal year; and\n            (12) Federal assistance described in this section should be \n        provided in a manner that recognizes the rights of Indian self-\n        determination and self-governance by providing the assistance, \n        to the maximum extent practicable, directly to Indian tribal \n        governments.\n\nSEC. 3.
