    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the productivity of the ``green revolution'' has been \n        fueled by abundant, low cost fossil fuels providing raw \n        material and energy for fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides, \n        and for powering mechanization, thereby multiplying farm worker \n        output;\n            (2) farm worker productivity is based on the input of large \n        quantities of fossil fuel based energy and chemicals, with \n        typically an input of as much as 10 fossil calories used to \n        produce a calorie of food output;\n            (3) food production in this manner cannot be sustained if \n        fossil fuels are depleted and become increasingly costly and \n        scarce, and biofuels are not a viable alternative if their \n        production consumes more energy than they contain;\n            (4) reduction of energy consumption through maximum \n        efficiency is a prerequisite to sustainable reliance on \n        renewable resources at an affordable scale; and\n            (5) for over a century, agriculture extension has shown \n        that demonstration of viable techniques and technologies is a \n        powerful force for their adoption and promotion.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Eligible entity.--The term ``eligible entity'' means--\n                    (A) a regional, State, local, or tribal agency;\n                    (B) a nonprofit organization or institution that \n                farms or provides farm or educational services to \n                persons or organizations that own or operate farms;\n                    (C) a farm or farmer or for-profit corporation that \n                farms, or group of such farms, farmers, or \n                corporations, at least 50 percent of the gross revenue \n                of which is derived from the sale of food or fiber \n                grown on the farm, if the acreage under their control, \n                individually and collectively, whether through \n                ownership or leasehold interests, is less than 160 \n                acres; and\n                    (D) institutions of higher education, as defined in \n                section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n                U.S.C. 1001(a)).\n            (2) Renewable energy.--The term ``renewable energy'' means \n        energy obtained from a resource in a manner capable of being \n        indefinitely sustained or replenished.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n            (4) Self-powered farm.--The term ``self-powered farm'' \n        means a farm or collection of farms that--\n                    (A) is capable of independence from offsite sources \n                of energy, fuel, and raw materials for fuel;\n                    (B) is a community resource for--\n                            (i) food; and\n                            (ii) energy, fuel, or raw materials for \n                        fuel;\n                    (C) minimizes or eliminates ongoing operating \n                expenditures to offsite entities for fossil fuel-\n                derived energy;\n                    (D) employs sustainable farming practices for long \n                term soil fertility; and\n                    (E) produces at least 2 times as much energy, \n                including fuel or raw materials for fuel, as it \n                consumes both on site and in the transfer of farm \n                products to market.\n\nSEC. 3.
