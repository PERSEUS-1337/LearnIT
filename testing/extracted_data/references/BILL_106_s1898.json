FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) Increasingly, States are turning to private prisoner \n    transport companies as an alternative to their own personnel or the \n    United States Marshals Service when transporting violent prisoners.\n        (2) The transport process can last for days if not weeks, as \n    violent prisoners are dropped off and picked up at a network of \n    hubs across the country.\n        (3) Escapes by violent prisoners during transport by private \n    prisoner transport companies have occurred.\n        (4) Oversight by the Attorney General is required to address \n    these problems.\n        (5) While most governmental entities may prefer to use, and \n    will continue to use, fully trained and sworn law enforcement \n    officers when transporting violent prisoners, fiscal or logistical \n    concerns may make the use of highly specialized private prisoner \n    transport companies an option. Nothing in this Act should be \n    construed to mean that governmental entities should contract with \n    private prisoner transport companies to move violent prisoners; \n    however when a government entity opts to use a private prisoner \n    transport company to move violent prisoners, then the company \n    should be subject to regulation in order to enhance public safety.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n        (1) Crime of violence.--The term ``crime of violence'' has the \n    same meaning as in section 924(c)(3) of title 18, United States \n    Code.\n        (2) Private prisoner transport company.--The term ``private \n    prisoner transport company'' means any entity, other than the \n    United States, a State, or an inferior political subdivision of a \n    State, which engages in the business of the transporting for \n    compensation, individuals committed to the custody of any State or \n    of an inferior political subdivision of a State, or any attempt \n    thereof.\n        (3) Violent prisoner.--The term ``violent prisoner'' means any \n    individual in the custody of a State or an inferior political \n    subdivision of a State who has previously been convicted of or is \n    currently charged with a crime of violence or any similar statute \n    of a State or the inferior political subdivisions of a State, or \n    any attempt thereof.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL REGULATION OF PRISONER TRANSPORT COMPANIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Attorney General, in consultation with the \nAmerican Correctional Association and the private prisoner transport \nindustry, shall promulgate regulations relating to the transportation \nof violent prisoners in or affecting interstate commerce.\n    (b) Standards and Requirements.--The regulations shall include the \nfollowing:\n        (1) Minimum standards for background checks and preemployment \n    drug testing for potential employees, including requiring criminal \n    background checks, to disqualify persons with a felony conviction \n    or domestic violence conviction as defined by section 921 of title \n    18, United States Code, for eligibility for employment. \n    Preemployment drug testing will be in accordance with applicable \n    State laws.\n        (2) Minimum standards for the length and type of training that \n    employees must undergo before they can transport prisoners not to \n    exceed 100 hours of preservice training focusing on the \n    transportation of prisoners. Training shall be in the areas of use \n    of restraints, searches, use of force, including use of appropriate \n    weapons and firearms, CPR, map reading, and defensive driving.\n        (3) Restrictions on the number of hours that employees can be \n    on duty during a given time period. Such restriction shall not be \n    more stringent than current applicable rules and regulations \n    concerning hours of service promulgated under the Federal Motor \n    Vehicle Safety Act.\n        (4) Minimum standards for the number of personnel that must \n    supervise violent prisoners. Such standards shall provide the \n    transport entity with appropriate discretion, and, absent more \n    restrictive requirements contracted for by the procuring government \n    entity, shall not exceed a requirement of 1 agent for every 6 \n    violent prisoners.\n        (5) Minimum standards for employee uniforms and identification \n    that require wearing of a uniform with a badge or insignia \n    identifying the employee as a transportation officer.\n        (6) Standards establishing categories of violent prisoners \n    required to wear brightly colored clothing clearly identifying them \n    as prisoners, when appropriate.\n        (7) Minimum requirements for the restraints that must be used \n    when transporting violent prisoners, to include leg shackles and \n    double-locked handcuffs, when appropriate.\n        (8) A requirement that when transporting violent prisoners, \n    private prisoner transport companies notify local law enforcement \n    officials 24 hours in advance of any scheduled stops in their \n    jurisdiction.\n        (9) A requirement that in the event of an escape by a violent \n    prisoner, private prisoner transport company officials shall \n    immediately notify appropriate law enforcement officials in the \n    jurisdiction where the escape occurs, and the governmental entity \n    that contracted with the private prisoner transport company for the \n    transport of the escaped violent prisoner.\n        (10) Minimum standards for the safety of violent prisoners in \n    accordance with applicable Federal and State law.\n    (c) Federal Standards.--Except for the requirements of subsection \n(b)(6), the regulations promulgated under this Act shall not provide \nstricter standards with respect to private prisoner transport companies \nthan are applicable, without exception, to the United States Marshals \nService, Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service when transporting violent prisoners under \ncomparable circumstances.\n\nSEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    Any person who is found in violation of the regulations established \nby this Act shall--\n        (1) be liable to the United States for a civil penalty in an \n    amount not to exceed $10,000 for each violation and, in addition, \n    to the United States for the costs of prosecution; and\n        (2) make restitution to any entity of the United States, of a \n    State, or of an inferior political subdivision of a State, which \n    expends funds for the purpose of apprehending any violent prisoner \n    who escapes from a prisoner transport company as the result, in \n    whole or in part, of a violation of regulations promulgated \n    pursuant to section 4(a).\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
