    "content": "Congress from the outset was \"imbued with the conviction that only the very highest achievements [were] entitled to such a distinction, and that the value of a reward is enhanced by its rarity!\" Instituting such a tradition was considered \"both a legitimate function and powerful instrument of nationality.\" \"Few inventions,\" Colonel David Humphrey wrote in 1787, \"could be more happily calculated to diffuse the knowledge and preserve the memory of illustrious characters and splendid events than medals\u2014whether we take into consideration the imperishable nature of the substance whence they are formed, the facility of multiplying copies, or the practice of depositing them in the cabinets of the curious.\" With these words, Humphrey, who had the responsibility for having the first gold medals struck in Paris, captured the essence of the feelings which inspired the Continental Congress to choose medals as its highest distinction and expression of national appreciation. Following a long-standing historical practice, Congress commissioned gold medals as tributes for what were considered to be the most distinguished achievements. Silver and bronze medals, and ceremonial swords, were awarded for less eminent, but still notable, accomplishments. Of these, only the gold medal has been continuously awarded to the present day. The Continental Congress had not yet proclaimed its independence from Great Britain when, on March 25, 1776, George Washington, commander of the Continental Army, was tendered the first Congressional Gold Medal for his \"wise and spirited conduct\" in bringing about British evacuation of Boston. During the next 12 years, the Continental Congress authorized an additional six gold medals for Revolutionary military and naval leaders. In 1777, Major General Horatio Gates was recognized for his \"brave and successful efforts\" in bringing about the surrender of the British Army at Saratoga. Two years later, a similar honor was bestowed upon Major General Anthony Wayne in 1779 for his courageous assault on the British at Stony Point, NY. A gold medal was also given to Major Henry Lee in commemoration of the skill and bravery he exhibited against the British at Paulus Hook, NJ. Brigadier General [author name scrubbed] and Major General Nathaniel Greene were praised for their gallant efforts in South Carolina during 1781. Six years later, John Paul Jones was similarly honored for his \"valor and brilliant services\" in capturing the Serapis. While the Continental Congress was prompt in approving each of these medals, those responsible for carrying out the wishes of Congress were far less expeditious. Because of its close ties with France, Congress turned to Paris for advice and assistance in having the medals struck. Unfortunately, Congress's preoccupation with the American Revolution, together with the lengthy and complicated procedures which had to be followed in Paris, produced long delays. Thomas Jefferson was not able to present Washington his gold medal until March 21, 1790, some 14 years after it had been approved. At the same time, Washington received a mahogany box containing a number of other gold medals ordered by Congress. Soon thereafter, these medals were transmitted by the former President to the various recipients. The gold medal conferred upon Major Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee for his \"remarkable prudence\" and \"bravery\" during the surprise raid of Paulus Hook, NJ, was the first to be struck in this country. Following the ratification of the Constitution, the first gold medal authorized by the Congress of the United States was given to Captain Thomas Truxtun in 1800 for his gallant effort during the action between the United States frigate Constellation and the French ship La Vengeance . In 1805, Commodore Edward Preble received a gold medal for gallantry and good conduct during the War with Tripoli. Subsequently, Congress commissioned 27 gold medals for notable victories and achievements in the War of 1812. This was more than four times as many as it had given during the American Revolution. \"Scarcely a victory of any consequence was overlooked.\" The gold medal Congress approved on February 22, 1816, honoring Captain James Biddle's \"gallantry\" in capturing the British sloop-of-war Penguin , was the final naval award of this character awarded by Congress until World War II. Gold medals would continue to be awarded for military achievements until the Civil War, but with far less frequency. In part this is explained by the fact that in the War with Mexico naval operations were negligible and military operations were principally confined to two expeditions led, respectively, by Major General Zachary Taylor and Major General Winfield Scott. Taylor's heroics against the Mexicans earned him gold medals on three different occasions. Scott, for his efforts, was accorded a gold medal in 1848. Gold medals were also given to 10 officers and seamen belonging or attached to the French, British, and Spanish ships-of-war, who on December 10, 1846, gallantly rescued 37 of the officers and crew from the wreck of the United States brig Somers in Vera Cruz harbor. Heroic action of a very different type in 1854 prompted Congress to praise Commander Duncan N. Ingraham of the USS St. Louis for his efforts in rescuing Martin Koszta from illegal seizure and imprisonment aboard the Austrian war-brig Hussar . Soon after the Hussar episode, Congress broke with its tradition of only honoring heroism associated with the actions of American military or naval personnel. In 1858, Dr. Frederick A. Rose, an assistant-surgeon in the British Navy, was recognized for his kindness and humanity to sick American seamen aboard the U.S. steamer Susquehannah whose crew had been stricken with yellow fever. At the behest of President Abraham Lincoln, Congress applauded Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1864 for his patriotic gift to the imperiled nation of a steamship which bore the donor's name. Three years later, Cyrus W. Field was praised for his work in the laying of the transatlantic cable. Tribute was similarly paid to Private George F. Robinson for his \"heroic conduct\" in saving Secretary of State William H. Seward from an assassin's knife on April 14, 1865. At the same time, Congress established the first permanent American military decoration with creation of the Medal of Honor. This award, which was conceived in the early 1860s, marked the beginning of a formalized policy by the United States of awarding military decorations. Although this medal was also to be presented in the name of the Congress of the United States and today is often referred to as the Congressional Medal of Honor, the regulations for awarding the Medal of Honor have from the beginning been the responsibility of the armed services. There is a clear distinction between the Medal of Honor, which is a military award, and Congressional Gold Medals, which are authorized by Congress to honor particular individuals and events. During the Civil War, more than 1,500 Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor, but only one individual\u2014Ulysses S. Grant\u2014received a Congressional Gold Medal. Thirty-five years were to pass before Congress would bestow the award on another American military leader. On five occasions, in the interim, Congress expressed its gratitude for lifesaving contributions. In 1866 three merchant sea captains were recognized with gold medals for rescuing some 500 men from the wreck of the steamship San Francisco more than a decade earlier. In 1873, Congress expressed its admiration for the 10 men from Westerly, RI, who saved the lives of 32 persons from the wrecked steamer Metis , in the waters of Long Island Sound. The following year, the heroics of John Horn, Jr., who during an 11-year period had rescued 110 men, women, and children from drowning in the Detroit River, captured the attention of Congress. Joseph Francis was thanked in 1888 for his \"life-long service to humanity\" in the construction and perfection of lifesaving appliances, which had been instrumental in saving several hundreds of lives. In 1890, George Wallace Melville, chief engineer aboard the Arctic exploring steamer Jeannette , and seven of his shipmates were praised for their persistent efforts to find and assist their commanding officer after they became shipwrecked. Nineteenth-century contributions of a far different nature prompted expressions of gratitude to philanthropists George Peabody of Massachusetts and John F. Slater of Connecticut for their substantial financial support for education of the underprivileged in the South and Southwest. In the 20 th and 21 st centuries, Congress continued to broaden the scope of such honors to include recognition of excellence in such varied fields as the arts, athletics, aviation, diplomacy, entertainment, exploration, medicine, politics, religion, and science. Nineteen Americans from the arts and the world of entertainment have received Congressional Gold Medals to date. Composer George M. Cohan was the first to be so acclaimed, in 1936, for his patriotic songs \"Over There\" and \"A Grand Old Flag.\" Some 18 years later, in recognition of Irving Berlin's brilliance in composing \"God Bless America\" and other patriotic songs, Congress bestowed its second gold medal on an American song writer. During the 1960s, poet Robert Frost was praised for enriching the culture of the world, comedian Bob Hope was honored for outstanding \"service to his country and the cause of peace,\" and filmmaker Walt Disney was singled out for his \"outstanding contributions to the United States and the world.\" Opera singer and humanitarian Marian Anderson and actor John Wayne were similarly decorated for their distinguished careers and contributions to the nation and world in the late 1970s. Since 1980, author Louis L'Amour, choral music conductor Fred Waring; entertainer and humanitarian Danny Thomas; and author Elie Wiesel, one of the foremost spokesmen of the victims of the Holocaust, were so honored. Singer Harry Chapin was recognized for his efforts to address issues of hunger around the world. In addition, Congress has memorialized the contributions of George and Ira Gershwin to American music, theater, and culture; Aaron Copland to American music composition; Andrew Wyeth to American art; Frank Sinatra to the entertainment industry through his endeavors as a producer, director, actor, and vocalist; and Charles M. Schulz to comic illustration. In 2008, Constantino Brumidi was recognized for his contributions to the nation as a designer and decorator of the U.S. Capitol. Gold medals for outstanding contributions in air and space exploration have covered a broad spectrum of accomplishments. In a public ceremony at Dayton, Ohio, on June 18, 1909, Wilbur and Orville Wright were presented Congressional Gold Medals for their achievements in demonstrating to the world the potential of aerial navigation. Congress recognized Charles A. Lindbergh for his aeronautical achievements in 1928. A year later, the seven officers and men who conceived, organized, and commanded the first trans-Atlantic flight in the United States naval flying boat NC-4 were honored. Howard Hughes was praised in 1939 for \"advancing the science of aviation.\" At the close of World War II, Congress authorized a gold medal for American military aviation pioneer Brigadier General William (Billy) Mitchell. In September 1959, Dr. Robert H. Goddard's \"historic pioneering research on space rockets, missiles, and jet propulsion\" was acclaimed by Congress. Since that time, gold medals have been given to Lieutenant General Ira C. Eaker for his \"distinguished career as an aviation pioneer and Air Force leader\"; and to the first transatlantic balloonists: Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson, and Larry Newman. Four decades later, in conjunction with the 40 th anniversary of mankind's historic and first lunar landing in 1969, Congress honored Neil A. Armstrong, the first human to walk on the Moon; Edwin E. \"Buzz\" Aldrin, Jr., the pilot of the lunar module and second person to walk on the Moon; Michael Collins, the pilot of their Apollo 11 mission's command module; and John Herschel Glenn, Jr., who, in 1962, became the first American to orbit the Earth. Congressional tributes have also been extended to several explorers of Antarctica. American explorer Lincoln Ellsworth received a gold medal for his polar flight of 1925 and transpolar flight of 1926. Also participating in the latter flight, and similarly honored, were Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen and Italian explorer Umberto Nobile. The undaunted services rendered by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd and the other members of the Byrd Expedition were praised with equal exuberance in 1930. Six years later, Lincoln Ellsworth received a second gold medal for his claims on behalf of the United States of approximately 350,000 square miles in Antarctica and for his 2,500-mile aerial survey of the heart of Antarctica. Despite the fact that several different lifesaving medals have been provided for over the years by law, Congress has still periodically expressed its own admiration for acts of heroism. In 1865, Congress praised George F. Robinson for his heroic conduct in fighting off an assassin attempting to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward. Two American sea captains, Captain Edwin J. Low, of the bark Kilby of Boston, and Captain George C. Stouffer, of the ship Antarctic of New York, were recognized in 1866 for aiding in the rescue of some 500 men from the wreck of the steamship San Francisco . Six years later, Congress lauded Captain Jared S. Crandall and nine other men of Westerly, RI, for manning a life-boat and a fishing boat to save the lives of 32 persons from the wreck of the steamer Metis on the waters of Long Island Sound. A Gold Medal was awarded to John Horn, Jr., in 1874 for his heroic exploits in rescuing 110 men, women, and children from drowning in Detroit River. Congress in 1888 acknowledged the work of Joseph Francis in the construction and perfection of life-saving appliances by which many thousands of lives have been saved. In 1902, three members of the Revenue Cutter Service were praised for a nearly 2,000-mile overland relief expedition to the American whaling fleet in the arctic region. At a March 1, 1913, White House ceremony, Captain Arthur Henry Rostron, commander of the steamship Carpathia , received a gold medal from President William Howard Taft for his prompt and heroic response in rescuing 704 survivors from the wreck of the Titanic . The following March, Captain Paul H. Kreibohm of the American steamer Kroonland , and four members of his crew, were awarded gold medals for rescuing 89 people from the burning steamer Volturno in the North Atlantic. Rev. Francis X. Quinn, pastor of the Church of the Guardian Angel in New York City, was honored in 1939 for risking his life in persuading an armed gunman holding an elderly couple hostage to surrender to police. The following January, a medal was authorized for William Sinnott, who had been wounded while guarding Franklin D. Roosevelt in Miami just prior to his first inauguration. A year later, 11-year-old Roland Boucher of Burlington, VT, saved the lives of four children who had broken through the ice on Lake Champlain near Juniper Island. Congress saluted Boucher's bravery and heroism in 1943. In 1900, Congress once again returned to the practice of recognizing distinguished military service when it praised First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, commander of the revenue cutter Hudson for rescuing the United States naval torpedo boat Winslow under a \"most galling fire from the enemy's guns.\" At the conclusion of World War II, the valor, bravery, and heroism of Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King and General of the Army George C. Marshall, two of America's most able military leaders during the war, were recognized. Also in 1946, General John J. Pershing was honored for his \"heroic achievements\" as Commander in Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe in World War I and for his \"unselfish devotion to the service of his country\" during World War II. The four known surviving veterans of the Civil War received Congressional Gold Medals a decade later. Rear Admiral Hyman George Rickover was applauded in 1958 for his achievements in \"directing the development and construction of the world's first nuclear-powered ships and the first large-scale nuclear power reactor devoted exclusively to the production of electricity.\" A quarter of a century later, Rickover was accorded a second gold medal for his contributions to the \"development of safe nuclear energy and the defense of the United States.\" Meanwhile, in 1962, Congress authorized a Congressional Gold Medal for General Douglas MacArthur in recognition of his \"gallant service\" to the United States. Three other military leaders were so acclaimed in the 1990s. General Matthew B. Ridgeway's more than 40 years of distinguished service as a military commander earned recognition at the beginning of the decade. Following Operation Desert Storm, which culminated with the successful liberation of the nation of Kuwait, General H. Norman Schwarzkopf and General Colin L. Powell were honored. Schwarzkopf was cited for his \"exemplary performance as a military leader in coordinating the planning, strategy, and execution of the United States\" and coalition forces in liberating Kuwait. Powell was recognized for his \"exemplary performance as a military leader and advisor to the President in planning and coordinating the military response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.\" In 2000, Congress recognized the contribution of the original 29 Navajo Marine Corps Radio Operators, known as the \"Navajo Code Talkers,\" who developed a code using their native language to communicate military messages during World War II. The code developed by these Native Americans proved to be unbreakable and was used extensively throughout the Pacific theater. Military commanders credited use of the Navajo Code with \"saving lives of countless American soldiers and the success of the engagements of Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.\" With the Code Talkers Recognition Act of 2008, Congress recognized the dedication and valor of Native American code talkers from other tribes for their contributions to United States victories in World War I and World War II. General Henry H. Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (October 1997-September 2001), was honored in 2001 for his leadership in coordinating the United States and NATO successful combat action throughout Operation Allied Force in the Balkans. In a unique action early in 2006, Congress honored the Tuskegee Airmen collectively with a single Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of their unique military record, which inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces. The presentation ceremony was held in the Capitol Rotunda on Thursday, March 29, 2007. Following presentation by the President, the medal was given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it was to be displayed. Congress used a similar approach in 2009, awarding the Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War II collectively for their \"pioneering military service and exemplary record.\" The \"WASP,\" as they were known, were the first women in history to fly American military aircraft. This medal, like the Tuskegee Gold Medal, is to be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display as appropriate. In 2010, another collective medal was awarded, to the 100 th Infantry Battalion, the 442 nd Regimental Combat Team, and the Military Intelligence Service United States Army, in recognition of their \"bravery, valor, and dedication to country \u2026 while fighting a 2-fronted battle of discrimination at home and fascism abroad.\"  Two other collective medals were awarded in 2011. The first was awarded to the Montford Point Marines, in recognition of \"their personal sacrifice and service to their country\" as the first African-American Marines. The second was awarded to all fallen heroes of 9/11, in \"honor of the men and women who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.\" In 2013, Congress awarded a collective medal to the First Special Service Force, in recognition of \"its superior service during World War II.\" In 2014, Congress awarded collective medals to five groups associated with World War II: the American Fighter Aces, the Doolittle Raiders, The World War II Civil Air Patrol, the Monuments Men, and the 65 th Infantry Regiment, known as the Borinqueneers. In 2016 Congress awarded collective medals to two groups: the Filipino Veterans of World War II, and the Office of Strategic Services.  Historic achievements in agriculture, science, and medicine also have been watched closely by Congress. For discovering the cause and means of transmission of yellow fever, Major Walter Reed and his 21 associates were recognized in 1928. Gold medals were subsequently authorized for Mrs. Richard Aldrich and Anna Bouligny some four decades after their outstanding, unselfish, and wholly voluntary service in establishing and operating \"hospitals for the care and treatment of military patients in Puerto Rico\" during the War with Spain. Thomas A. Edison was honored for the development and application of \"inventions that have revolutionized civilization.\" Similar congressional tributes were subsequently extended to Dr. Jonas E. Salk, for discovering a serum for the prevention of polio, to Dr. Thomas Anthony Dooley III for his unselfish medical care among the underprivileged peoples of the world, particularly in southeast Asia, and to Mary Lasker, whom some considered the first lady of medicine and science in this country, for her \"humanitarian contributions in the area of medical research and education, urban beautification and the fine arts.\" Congress recognized Nobel Laureate Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, \"whose accomplishments in terms of bringing radical change to world agriculture and uplifting humanity are without parallel.\" Internationally recognized physician and surgeon Dr. Michael Ellis DeBakey was lauded for his pioneering work in the field of cardiovascular surgery, as well as for his innovative research into this and other fields of medicine. The first politician to be honored with a gold medal was Vice President Alben W. Barkley in 1949. Since that time, Congress has saluted the distinguished and dedicated public service of Sam Rayburn, Robert F. Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, Harry S. Truman, former President Gerald R. Ford and his wife Betty, and former President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy. Tribute was also paid to Representative Leo J. Ryan, following his \"untimely\" assassination while performing his responsibilities as a Member of the House of Representatives in Guyana. Most recently, former Senator Edward William Brooke III, of Massachusetts, the first African American elected by popular vote to the U.S. Senate, was recognized for his unprecedented and enduring service to our nation. Athletes so recognized have been baseball hall of famers Roberto Clemente and Jackie Robinson, heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis, track and field star Jesse Owens, and golfers Byron Nelson and Arnold Palmer. Clemente was also praised for his \"civil, charitable, and humanitarian contributions,\" Robinson for \"many contributions to the nation,\" Louis for bolstering the \"spirit of American people during one of the most critical times in American history,\" Owens for his \"humanitarian contributions to public service, civil rights, and international goodwill,\" Nelson \"for his significant contributions ... as a teacher and a commentator,\" and Palmer for \"his service to the Nation in promoting excellence and good sportsmanship in golf.\" A lifelong commitment to the principles of freedom, equality, justice, and peace earned civil rights worker Roy Wilkins acclaim on Capitol Hill. The Little Rock Nine\u2014Jean Brown Trickey, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, Terrence Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed Wair, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, and Jefferson Thomas\u2014were recognized for the selfless heroism they exhibited \"in the cause of civil rights by integrating Central High School in Little Rock Arkansas.\" Rosa Parks, the \"First Lady of Civil Rights,\" was honored for her \"quiet dignity,\" which \"ignited the most significant social movement in the history of the United States.\" Praise was bestowed on Dr. Dorothy Height for her contribution \"as one of the preeminent social and civil rights activists of her time, particularly in the struggle for equality, social justice, and human rights for all people.\" Reverend Joseph A. DeLaine, Harry and Eliza Briggs, and Levi Pearson were saluted \"for their contributions to the Nation as pioneers in the effort to desegregate public schools that led directly to the landmark desegregation case of Brown et al. v. the Board of Education of Topeka et al.\" Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., and his wife Coretta Scott King, were lauded for their contribution \"to the Nation on behalf of the civil rights movement.\" Sustained efforts to preserve the beauty of our nation prompted praise for Lady Bird Johnson and Laurence Spelman Rockefeller. Lady Bird was applauded for her \"outstanding contributions to the improvement and beautification of America,\" and Rockefeller for his \"leadership on behalf of natural resource conservation and historic preservation. Marking humanitarian efforts, 12 of the 53 gold medals awarded by the 103 rd -106 th Congresses were given to individuals who have dedicated their lives to the service of others. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the leader of the Lubavitch movement for more than four decades, was recognized for his \"outstanding and enduring contributions toward world education, morality, and acts of charity.\" Billy Graham, \"America's most respected and admired evangelical leader for the past half century,\" and his wife Ruth, were honored for \"their outstanding and enduring contributions toward faith, morality, and charity.\" Former President Gerald Ford and his wife Betty were honored \"their dedicated public service and outstanding humanitarian contributions to the people of the United States.\" Mother Teresa of Calcutta was acclaimed for her nearly 70 years of \"selfless dedication to humanity and charitable works.\" Ecumenical Patrick Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians around the world, was lauded for \"outstanding and enduring contributions to religious understanding and peace.\" Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was cited for his \"lifelong dedication to the abolition of apartheid and promotion of reconciliation among the people of the Republic of South Africa.\" Congress honored Father Theodore M. Hesburgh, President of the University of Notre Dame from 1952 until 1987, for his \"outstanding and enduring contributions to civil rights, higher education, the Catholic Church, the Nation, and the global community.\" John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York, was recognized for \"his accomplishments as a priest, a Navy chaplain, and a humanitarian.\" Tribute was paid to Pope Paul II for \"his many and enduring contributions to peace and religious understanding.\" Enduring and outstanding contributions to peace, non-violence, human rights, and religion won acclaim for Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. Recognition was bestowed on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for \"her courageous and unwavering commitment to peace, nonviolence, human rights, and democracy in Burma.\" Dr. Muhammad Yunus was recognized for his \"contributions to the fight against global poverty.\" These recent awards are not without precedent, since the first and only Gold Medal given to an organization honored the American Red Cross in 1979 for \"unselfish and humanitarian service to the people of the United States.\" In 2013, Congress awarded a gold medal to Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley, to \"commemorate the lives they lost \u2026 in the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church.\" In 2014, Jack Nicklaus was a awarded a gold medal in \"recognition of his service to the Nation in promoting excellence, good sportsmanship, and philanthropy.\" In 2015, the Foot Soldiers of the Voting Rights Movement were awarded a gold medal in recognition of their \"extraordinary bravery and sacrifice [that] brought national attention to the struggle for equal voting rights, and served as the catalyst for Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\"  Thirty-one of the Congressional Gold Medals authorized to date have gone to non-Americans. In 1847, 10 officers and men belonging to or attached to French, British, and Spanish ships-of-war in the harbor of Vera Cruz captured congressional attention for aiding in the rescue of officers and crew of the United States brig Somers . Eight years after Congress paid tribute to Dr. Frederick A. Rose of the British Navy in 1858, Captain Robert Creighton, of the British ship Three Bells, won acclaim for aiding in the rescue of survivors from the steamship San Francisco . Gold medals were also given to Se\u00f1or Domicio da Gama, Se\u00f1or R\u00f3mulo S. Na\u00f3n, and Se\u00f1or Eduardo Su\u00e1rez, the diplomatic representatives of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile who acted as mediators between the United States and Mexico in 1914; and to Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen and Italian explorer Umberto Nobile for their participation in American explorer Lincoln Ellsworth's polar flight of 1925 and his 1926 transpolar flight. In 1969, President Nixon was authorized to present a gold medal in the name of the United States and in the name of Congress to the widow of the late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Canadian Ambassador to Iran Kenneth Taylor was honored in March 1980 for his efforts in securing the safe return of six American Embassy officials in their escape from Tehran. Congress recognized Simon Wiesenthal of Austria in 1980 for his dedicated action in bringing to justice Nazi war criminals who had gone into hiding at the end of World War II. Early in 1982, Her Majesty Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands was awarded a gold medal in recognition of the bicentennial anniversary of diplomatic and commercial relations between her country and the United States. Natan (Anatoly) and Avital Shcharansky of the former Soviet Union were applauded in 1986 for their \"supreme dedication and total commitment to the cause of individual human rights and freedoms.\" During the 105 th Congress, the President was authorized to award gold medals to three additional foreign recipients\u2014Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, a Turkish citizen, and Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela of the Republic of South Africa. In the 106 th Congress, Pope John Paul II was cited. British Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2003 became the first Briton since Winston Churchill to be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Three years later, Tenzin Gyatso, Tenzin, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, earned recognition. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma won acclaim in 2008, as did Dr. Muhammad Yunus in 2010.  In 2012, a Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to Raoul Wallenberg in recognition of his achievements and heroic actions during the Holocaust. In 2014, a gold medal was awarded to Shimon Peres. After a Congressional Gold Medal bill has been approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law by the President, officials of the United States Mint meet with the sponsors of the legislation and members of the honoree's family to discuss possible designs for the medal. Photographs of the honoree are also examined during this meeting. Mint engravers then prepare a series of sketches of possible designs for consideration and comment by the Commission of Fine Arts and subsequently the Secretary of the Treasury, who makes the final decision on the medal's design. Once the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the honoree's family, has made a selection, the design is sculptured, a die is made, and the medal is struck at the Philadelphia Mint. The Mint then notifies the White House and arrangements are made for a formal presentation by the President. The cost of issuing a Congressional Gold Medal, generally about $30,000, is charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. Congress established this revolving fund \"in the Treasury of the United States ... to be available to the Secretary for numismatic operations and programs of the United States Mint without fiscal year limitations.\" The authorizing legislation in each case typically includes a provision stating that the \"Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck ... at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the medals (including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses) and the cost of the gold medal.\" Monies received from the sales of the bronze duplicates are deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. In the House, there are no chamber or committee rules regarding the procedures for gold medal bills. Rule 28(a)(7) of the House Republican Conference, however, prohibits the Republican leader from scheduling any bill or resolution for consideration under suspension of the Rules which directs the Secretary of the Treasury to strike a Congressional Gold Medal unless the recipient is a natural person; the recipient has performed an achievement that has an impact on American history and culture that is likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient's field long after the achievement; the recipient has not received a medal previously for the same or substantially the same achievement; the recipient is living or, if deceased, has not been deceased for less than 5 years or more than 25 years; and the achievements were performed in the recipient's field of endeavor, and represent either a lifetime of continuous superior achievements or a single achievement so significant that the recipient is recognized and acclaimed by others in the same field, as evidenced by the recipient having received the highest honors in the field. The rules of the House Republican Conference also place an indirect restriction on the number of gold medals that may be awarded annually. Rule 28(a)(7)(F) prohibits the Republican leader from scheduling, or requesting to have scheduled, any bill for consideration under suspension of the rules which \"directs the Secretary of the Treasury to strike a Congressional Gold Medal ...[that causes] the total number of measures authorizing the striking of such medals in that Congress to substantially exceed the average number of such measures enacted in prior Congresses.\"  A waiver on the restriction can be granted by the majority of the elected leadership of the conference. In addition, because the restriction only applies to bills considered under suspension of the rules, it appears that an otherwise-prohibited bill could be brought to the floor under an alternative procedure, such as a special rule. In the Senate, the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee in the 115 th Congress requires that at least 67 Senators must cosponsor any Congressional Gold Medal bill before being considered by the committee. Although Congress has approved legislation stipulating requirements for numerous other awards and decorations, there are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals. When a Congressional Gold Medal has been deemed appropriate, Congress has, by legislative action, provided for the creation of a medal on an ad hoc basis.  CRS research did not identify any statutory restrictions on the number of gold medals that may be awarded by Congress or struck by the U.S. Mint. Furthermore, since each award made by Congress is itself statutory law, it is unlikely that any statutory limitation on the annual number of Congressional Gold Medals that could be struck would prevent the enactment of legislation authorizing additional medals. As of this writing, there have been no proposals in the 115 th Congress to change the procedures or criteria for awarding congressional gold medals. During the 109 th Congress, however, on January 26, 2005, the House, by a vote of 231 to 173, approved H.R. 54 , the Congressional Gold Medal Enhancement Act of 2005, sponsored by Representative Michael N. Castle. The bill would have amended Section 5111 of Title 31 of the United States Code by adding the following new subsection: (e) Congressional Gold Medal Standards\u2014 (1) MAXIMUM NUMBER\u2014Beginning on the date of the enactment of the Congressional Gold Medal Enhancement Act of 2005, the Secretary of the Treasury may strike not more than 2 congressional gold medals for presentation pursuant to an Act of the Congress in any calendar year. (2) PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS\u2014The Secretary may strike congressional gold medals only in accordance with the following requirements: (A) RECIPIENTS\u2014Only an individual may be a recipient of a congressional gold medal. (B) TIMING\u2014No gold medal may be presented posthumously on behalf of any individual except during the 20-year period beginning 5 years after the death of the individual (unless the Act of Congress authorizing the striking of such medal was enacted before the death of such individual). During House debate on H.R. 54 , Representative Castle emphasized that his measure sought \"to maintain the prestige of the medal by limiting the number that may be awarded each year,\" and to \"clarify that recipients are individuals and not groups.\" Passage of the measure, he argued, \"will ensure the future integrity and true honor of the award. It is my goal that every recipient, [P]resident, civil rights leader, military hero, inventor, or noted healer, who receives the Congressional Gold Medal will remain part of a unique honor bestowed by the United States Congress.\" House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael G. Oxley characterized the proposed legislation as a \"commonsense effort to maintain the prestige of this award.\" By limiting the number of medals that can be struck each year, and by \"limiting the recipients to individuals rather than groups, maintains the prestige and honor of receiving a Congressional Gold Medal. Combined with the requirement of a minimum co-sponsorship level of two-thirds of the House is the best way to preserve the integrity of the gold medal.\" Representative Joseph Crowley in opposing the legislation told his House colleagues, \"We are rushing to act on an issue that does not represent a problem.\" \"Who that received this medal in the past,\" he asked, \"was not worthy of it?\" He also expressed dismay \"that the Committee on Rules refused to allow consideration of a key amendment that would strike a section of bill that only permits the granting of Congressional Gold Medals to individuals.\" Although Crowley tended \"to agree with the notion that distributing what is an exceptional honor to too many individuals could devalue the symbolic worth of a gold medal, there are occasions when more than one person is justified to receive the medal for their honorable actions in tandem with others.\" He continued by emphasizing that had this bill already been law, \"Congress would not have been able to issue\" a Congressional Gold Medal \"to the Little Rock Nine,\" to \"President and Mrs. Reagan,\" or to \"Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King.\" The House adopted by voice vote an amendment to H.R. 54 offered by Representative Oxley that would make the legislation effective immediately upon passage, instead of the original effective date of January 1, 2006. Two amendments offered by Representative Crowley, both of which were defeated, would have (1) raised the number of Gold Medals that could be approved from two per calendar year to six per Congress, or an overall increase of two medals per Congress; and (2) required that there be an equitable distribution of Gold Medals approved between those sponsored by the majority and minority parties. Later the same day, H.R. 54 was received in the Senate, read twice, and referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. There was no further action on the bill.
