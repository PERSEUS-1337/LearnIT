FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Government has a vested interest in \n        promoting domestic energy independence.\n            (2) Federal incentives, including public-private \n        partnerships, tax incentives, loan guarantees, and direct \n        loans, have been used in the past to help foster private sector \n        growth in energy related industries.\n            (3) Demand for refined petroleum products continues to rise \n        as the economy recovers and developing nations increase their \n        consumption.\n            (4) Due to a variety of factors, the refining industry has \n        seen a number of refinery closures.\n            (5) These closures leads to a number of difficulties, \n        including reduction in short-term supply, longer delivery \n        times, higher prices of goods for consumers, increased cost of \n        production for businesses, rising home heating prices, \n        increased importation of gasoline from foreign countries, and \n        less energy independence.\n            (6) Reduced refining capacity will only increase pressure \n        on the industry to manage supply and meet demand, as domestic \n        refining capacity shifts and contracts.\n            (7) The location of our refining facilities and \n        distribution networks is significant.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``Commission \non Energy Independence and Domestic Refining Capacity'' (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4. REQUESTING STUDIES.\n\n    The President may request the Commission to conduct a study \ndescribed in section 5(a) to determine whether the consolidation or \nclosing of a refinery will result in an adverse decline in the Nation's \ndomestic refining capacity.\n\nSEC. 5. DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Studies.--Upon receipt of a request under section 4, the \nCommission shall conduct a study to examine--\n            (1) the state of the domestic refining industry, including \n        the effect of the consolidation or refinery closure on overall \n        production, domestic economic growth, and national gas prices;\n            (2) the possibilities for the Federal Government to form \n        public-private partnerships that would lead to increased \n        domestic refining capacity;\n            (3) the potential positive and adverse consequences of \n        Federal partnerships and incentives on growth within the \n        industry;\n            (4) the potential benefits of reinvesting a portion of \n        revenues from public-private partnerships into energy related \n        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education, \n        and seeding future federally funded energy research; and\n            (5) the types of Federal incentives that could be used to \n        maintain domestic refining capacity including--\n                    (A) tax incentives;\n                    (B) loan guarantees;\n                    (C) direct loans;\n                    (D) grants;\n                    (E) land grants;\n                    (F) credits;\n                    (G) cooperative agreements;\n                    (H) preferences; and\n                    (I) other competitions.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 3 months after the request for a study, \nthe Commission shall submit to the President and Congress a written \nreport of the results of the study conducted under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 6. DUTIES OF THE SECRETARY.\n\n    If the Commission's study finds that a plant consolidation or \nclosure will have an adverse affect on the Nation's domestic refining \ncapacity, the Secretary of Energy (in this Act referred to as the \n``Secretary'') may offer Federal incentives to prevent the diminishment \nof refining capacity. These incentives include--\n            (1) formation of public-private partnerships to increase \n        the Nation's refining capacity; and\n            (2) incentives designed to increase domestic refining \n        capacity, including the incentives described in section \n        5(a)(5).\n\nSEC. 7.
