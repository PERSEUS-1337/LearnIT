FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) motors and motor-driven systems account for a \n        significant quantity of the electricity used in the United \n        States;\n            (2) motor electrical energy use is determined by the \n        efficiency of the motor and the design of the motor-driven \n        system in which the motor and the drive operate;\n            (3) Federal Government research on commercial and \n        industrial motors and motor-driven system use and efficiency is \n        outdated;\n            (4) the Bureau of the Census has discontinued collection of \n        data on motor and generator importation, manufacture, shipment, \n        and sales;\n            (5) the last Department of Energy motor market assessment \n        was conducted in 2002;\n            (6) motor and motor-driven systems have changed \n        dramatically during the 12-year period ending on the date of \n        enactment of this Act; and\n            (7) a new motor and motor-driven system market assessment \n        will help United States manufacturers better understand the \n        commercial marketplace and become more globally competitive.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the \n        Department of Energy.\n            (2) Interested parties.--The term ``interested parties'' \n        includes--\n                    (A) trade associations;\n                    (B) motor manufacturers;\n                    (C) manufacturers of variable speed drives, \n                including variable frequency drives;\n                    (D) motor end users, including original equipment \n                manufacturers that use motors to drive machinery;\n                    (E) permanent magnetic material manufacturers;\n                    (F) electric utilities; and\n                    (G) individuals and entities that conduct energy \n                efficiency programs.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n\nSEC. 4. MOTOR MARKET ASSESSMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary, in consultation with interested \nparties, shall conduct a market assessment of motors and motor-driven \nsystems used in the United States.\n    (b) Assessment.--In conducting the assessment under subsection (a), \nthe Secretary shall--\n            (1) develop a detailed profile of the stock of motors and \n        motor-driven systems in commercial and industrial facilities of \n        the United States (as of the date of enactment of this Act);\n            (2) develop a profile of commercial and industrial motor \n        and motor-driven system purchase and maintenance practices;\n            (3) analyze the opportunities (by market segment) for \n        improved energy efficiency and cost savings available through--\n                    (A) the use of energy efficient motors, variable \n                speed drives, servo drives, and other control \n                technologies;\n                    (B) optimization of motor-driven systems; and\n                    (C) substitution of existing motor designs with new \n                and future advanced motor and motor-driven system \n                designs, including--\n                            (i) electronically commutated permanent \n                        magnet motors;\n                            (ii) interior permanent magnet motors;\n                            (iii) switched reluctance motors;\n                            (iv) synchronous reluctance motors; and\n                            (v) variable speed drives; and\n            (4) evaluate the state of the global supply chain that \n        supports motor and drive technologies (as of the date of \n        enactment of this Act), including--\n                    (A) the accessibility and sustainability of key \n                materials;\n                    (B) the progress of research and development \n                directed at decreasing the quantity of heavy rare earth \n                materials required in high energy density permanent \n                magnets; and\n                    (C) factors that may lead to an increase in \n                domestic manufacturing of motor and drive technologies.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 540 days after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary shall publish and make available on the website \nof the Department a report on the assessment conducted under this \nsection.\n    (d) Recommendations.--The Secretary shall use the assessment and \nreport required under this section--\n            (1) to develop recommendations to update the detailed motor \n        and motor-driven system profile on a periodic basis using \n        readily available market information; and\n            (2) to identify technology and research needs that could be \n        met through joint industry and government partnership.\n\nSEC. 5. PUBLIC AWARENESS PROGRAM.\n\n    Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary, in consultation with interested parties, shall establish a \nprogram targeted at motor end-users to increase the awareness of the \nend-users of--\n            (1) the energy efficiency and cost saving opportunities \n        available to commercial and industrial facilities from using \n        higher efficiency motors and motor-driven system technologies;\n            (2) motor and motor-driven system procurement and \n        management procedures; and\n            (3) criteria for making decisions for new, replacement, or \n        repair of motor and motor-driven system components."
