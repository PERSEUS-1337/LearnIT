FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) From 2014 through 2018, the United States and nations \n        around the world will mark the centennial of World War I, \n        including the entry of the United States into the war in April \n        1917.\n            (2) America's support of Great Britain, France, Belgium, \n        and its other allies in World War I marked the first time in \n        this Nation's history that American soldiers went abroad in \n        defense of liberty against foreign aggression, and it marked \n        the true beginning of ``the American century''.\n            (3) Although World War I was at the time called ``the war \n        to end all wars'', in fact the United States would commit its \n        troops to the defense of foreign lands 3 more times in the 20th \n        century.\n            (4) More than 4,000,000 men and women from the United \n        States served in uniform during World War I, among them 2 \n        future presidents, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. \n        Two million individuals from the United States served overseas \n        during World War I, including 200,000 naval personnel who \n        served on the seas. The United States suffered 375,000 \n        casualties during World War I, including 116,516 deaths.\n            (5) The events of 1914 through 1918 shaped the world, the \n        United States, and the lives of millions of people in countless \n        ways.\n            (6) The centennial of World War I offers an opportunity for \n        people in the United States to learn about and commemorate the \n        sacrifices of their predecessors.\n            (7) Commemorative programs, activities, and sites allow \n        people in the United States to learn about the history of World \n        War I, the United States involvement in that war, and the war's \n        effects on the remainder of the 20th century, and to \n        commemorate and honor the participation of the United States \n        and its citizens in the war effort.\n            (8) While the other great conflicts of the 20th century, \n        World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, have \n        national memorials on the Mall in Washington, DC, there \n        currently exists no nationally recognized memorial honoring the \n        service of the United States and its citizens in World War I.\n            (9) In 1921, the people of Kansas City, Missouri dedicated \n        a site in that city for a memorial to the service of Americans \n        in World War I, a ceremony attended by General John J. Pershing \n        and military leaders of Great Britain, France, Belgium, and \n        Italy. In 1924, the cornerstone of the 217-foot Liberty \n        Memorial Tower was laid. On Armistice Day 1926, President \n        Calvin Coolidge delivered the keynote address at the Memorial's \n        dedication ceremony. The Memorial and surrounding grounds were \n        completed in 1938, with an inscription that reads ``In Honor of \n        Those Who Served in the World War in Defense of Liberty and Our \n        Country.''.\n            (10) The 106th Congress recognized the Liberty Memorial as \n        a national symbol of World War I.\n            (11) The 108th Congress designated the museum at the base \n        of the Liberty Memorial as ``America's National World War I \n        Museum''. The museum preserves the history of World War I, and \n        educates and enlightens people about this significant event.\n            (12) The District of Columbia War Memorial was authorized \n        in 1924 by resolution of the 68th Congress, and was dedicated \n        on Armistice Day 1931 by President Herbert Hoover. The DC War \n        Memorial, erected in memory of the 499 residents of the \n        District of Columbia who died in World War I, is often \n        overlooked by residents and visitors to Washington.\n            (13) The DC War Memorial is located on the national Mall in \n        Washington, adjacent to the World War II, Korean War, and \n        Vietnam memorials. Of these memorials, which now compose a \n        quartet of memorials to the 4 great wars of the American \n        Century, only the DC War Memorial is not a national memorial.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to--\n            (1) establish a commission, in Kansas City, Missouri, to \n        ensure a suitable national observance of the centennial of \n        World War I; and\n            (2) rededicate the Liberty Memorial of Kansas City and the \n        District of Columbia War Memorial, respectively, as the \n        ``National World War I Museum and Memorial'' and the ``District \n        of Columbia and National World War I Memorial''.\n\nSEC. 3.
