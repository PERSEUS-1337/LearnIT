    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``9/11 First Responders History \nProject Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Over 410,000 people were exposed to the site of the \n        September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center \n        (WTC) in New York City, including 50,000 workers from across \n        the Nation who traveled to the site to lend their support.\n            (2) Of these over 410,000 people, 91,000 were rescue and \n        recovery workers.\n            (3) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was one of the \n        major health effects for individuals who responded to the WTC \n        attacks.\n            (4) Nineteen percent of adult enrollees (about 71,000 \n        people) in the WTC Health Registry report new PTSD symptoms, 4 \n        times the rate typically seen in adults in the United States.\n            (5) Of the more than 10,000 rescue and recovery workers \n        monitored for a study at the Mount Sinai WTC Consortium over a \n        five-year period from 2002 to 2007, 11% met criteria for \n        probable PTSD, 8.8% had probable depression, 5.0% had probable \n        panic disorder, and 62% had substantial stress reaction.\n            (6) According to the Mount Sinai study, the rate of PTSD \n        among responders to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \n        at the WTC is significantly greater than in the general \n        population and is on par with the rate experienced by veterans \n        of the war in Afghanistan. For example, 15.5% of firefighters \n        report probable post-9/11 PTSD and firefighters who worked at \n        Ground Zero lost an average of 12 years of lung function.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to create a new \nfederally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will \ncoordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio \nrecordings of personal histories and testimonials of emergency \nresponders and recovery and cleanup workers who responded to the \nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that will build upon and \ncomplement previous and ongoing documentary work on this subject, and \nto assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of such \nindividuals so that Americans of all current and future generations may \nhear from them directly and better appreciate the sacrifices they made.\n\nSEC. 3.
