FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The American people abhor torture by repressive \n        governments and other parties. The existence of torture creates \n        a climate of fear and international insecurity that affects all \n        people.\n            (2) Torture is the strategic use of pain to destroy both \n        individuals and society. The effects of torture are long term. \n        Those effects can last a lifetime for the survivors and affect \n        future generations.\n            (3) By eliminating leadership of their opposition and \n        frightening the general public, repressive governments use \n        torture as a weapon against democracy.\n            (4) Torture victims remain under physical and psychological \n        threats, especially in communities where the perpetrators are \n        not brought to justice. In many nations, even those who treat \n        torture victims are threatened with reprisals, including \n        torture, for carrying out their ethical duties to provide care. \n        Both the survivors of torture and their treatment providers \n        deserve, and often require, protection from further repression.\n            (5) A significant number of refugees and asylees entering \n        the United States have been victims of governmental torture. \n        Those claiming asylum deserve prompt consideration of their \n        applications for political asylum to minimize their insecurity \n        and sense of danger. Many torture survivors now live in the \n        United States. They should be provided with the rehabilitation \n        services which would enable them to become productive members \n        of our communities.\n            (6) The development of a treatment movement for torture \n        survivors has created new opportunities for action by the \n        United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored and \n        other acts of torture.\n            (7) There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect \n        and support torture victims and their treatment providers \n        together with overall efforts to eliminate torture.\n            (8) By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect \n        their families, the United States can help to heal the effects \n        of torture and prevent its use around the world.\n            (9) The United States has ratified the Convention Against \n        Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or \n        Punishment, but has not implemented all provisions of the \n        convention.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided, the terms \n        used in this Act have the meaning given such terms in section \n        101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n            (2) Torture.--The term ``torture'' has the meaning given \n        such term in section 2340(1) of title 18, United States Code, \n        and includes the use of rape and other forms of sexual violence \n        by a person acting under the color of law upon another person \n        under his custody or physical control.\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON INVOLUNTARY RETURN OF PERSONS FEARING SUBJECTION \n              TO TORTURE.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--The United States shall not expel, extradite, or \nreturn involuntarily an individual to a country if there is substantial \nevidence of circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to \nbelieve that the individual would fear subjection to torture.\n    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``to return \ninvoluntarily'', in the case of an individual in any locale, means the \nfollowing:\n            (1) To return the individual without the individual's \n        consent, whether or not the return is induced by physical \n        force.\n            (2) To take an action by which it is reasonably foreseeable \n        that the individual will be returned, whether or not the return \n        is induced by physical force.\nSEC. 5.
