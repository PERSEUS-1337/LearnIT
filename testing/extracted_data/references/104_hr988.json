AWARD OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES IN FEDERAL CIVIL DIVERSITY \n              LITIGATION AFTER AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT.\n\n    Section 1332 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(e)(1) In any action over which the court has jurisdiction under \nthis section, any party may, at any time not less than 10 days before \ntrial, serve upon any adverse party a written offer to settle a claim \nor claims for money or property or to the effect specified in the \noffer, including a motion to dismiss all claims, and to enter into a \nstipulation dismissing the claim or claims or allowing judgment to be \nentered according to the terms of the offer. Any such offer, together \nwith proof of service thereof, shall be filed with the clerk of the \ncourt.\n    ``(2) If the party receiving an offer under paragraph (1) serves \nwritten notice on the offeror that the offer is accepted, either party \nmay then file with the clerk of the court the notice of acceptance, \ntogether with proof of service thereof.\n    ``(3) The fact that an offer under paragraph (1) is made but not \naccepted does not preclude a subsequent offer under paragraph (1). \nEvidence of an offer is not admissible for any purpose except in \nproceedings to enforce a settlement, or to determine costs and expenses \nunder this subsection.\n    ``(4) At any time before judgment is entered, the court, upon its \nown motion or upon the motion of any party, may exempt from this \nsubsection any claim that the court finds presents a question of law or \nfact that is novel and important and that substantially affects \nnonparties. If a claim is exempted from this subsection, all offers \nmade by any party under paragraph (1) with respect to that claim shall \nbe void and have no effect.\n    ``(5) If all offers made by a party under paragraph (1) with \nrespect to a claim or claims, including any motion to dismiss all \nclaims, are not accepted and the judgment, verdict, or order finally \nissued (exclusive of costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees incurred \nafter judgment or trial) in the action under this section is not more \nfavorable to the offeree with respect to the claim or claims than the \nlast such offer, the offeror may file with the court, within 10 days \nafter the final judgment, verdict, or order is issued, a petition for \npayment of costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred with \nrespect to the claim or claims from the date the last such offer was \nmade or, if the offeree made an offer under this subsection, from the \ndate the last such offer by the offeree was made.\n    ``(6) If the court finds, pursuant to a petition filed under \nparagraph (5) with respect to a claim or claims, that the judgment, \nverdict, or order finally obtained is not more favorable to the offeree \nwith respect to the claim or claims than the last offer, the court \nshall order the offeree to pay the offeror's costs and expenses, \nincluding attorneys' fees, incurred with respect to the claim or claims \nfrom the date the last offer was made or, if the offeree made an offer \nunder this subsection, from the date the last such offer by the offeree \nwas made, unless the court finds that requiring the payment of such \ncosts and expenses would be manifestly unjust.\n    ``(7) Attorney's fees under paragraph (6) shall be a reasonable \nattorney's fee attributable to the claim or claims involved, calculated \non the basis of an hourly rate which may not exceed that which the \ncourt considers acceptable in the community in which the attorney \npractices law, taking into account the attorney's qualifications and \nexperience and the complexity of the case, except that the attorney's \nfees under paragraph (6) may not exceed--\n            ``(A) the actual cost incurred by the offeree for an \n        attorney's fee payable to an attorney for services in \n        connection with the claim or claims; or\n            ``(B) if no such cost was incurred by the offeree due to a \n        contingency fee agreement, a reasonable cost that would have \n        been incurred by the offeree for an attorney's noncontingent \n        fee payable to an attorney for services in connection with the \n        claim or claims.\n    ``(8) This subsection does not apply to any claim seeking an \nequitable remedy.''.\n\nSEC. 3. HONESTY IN EVIDENCE.\n\n    Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C. App.) is \namended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a) In general.--'' before ``If'', and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Adequate basis for opinion.--Testimony in the form of an \nopinion by a witness that is based on scientific knowledge shall be \ninadmissible in evidence unless the court determines that such \nopinion--\n            ``(1) is scientifically valid and reliable;\n            ``(2) has a valid scientific connection to the fact it is \n        offered to prove; and\n            ``(3) is sufficiently reliable so that the probative value \n        of such evidence outweighs the dangers specified in rule 403.\n    ``(c) Disqualification.--Testimony by a witness who is qualified as \ndescribed in subdivision (a) is inadmissible in evidence if the witness \nis entitled to receive any compensation contingent on the legal \ndisposition of any claim with respect to which the testimony is \noffered.\n    ``(d) Scope.--Subdivision (b) does not apply to criminal \nproceedings.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
