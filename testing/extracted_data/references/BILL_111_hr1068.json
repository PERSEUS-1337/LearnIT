FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Bush Administration allocated the first $350 \n        billion of TARP funds in a manner that has outraged the Nation \n        by failing to provide the most basic oversight of the funds.\n            (2) Congress has declined to block the remaining $350 \n        billion of TARP funds despite the lack of oversight and the \n        record fiscal year 2009 budget deficit estimated at $1.2 \n        trillion.\n            (3) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n        has committed more than a trillion dollars to stabilize the \n        economy by bailing out various banks deemed ``too big to \n        fail''.\n            (4) The $700 billion TARP fund and the new Federal Reserve \n        lending facilities were created to protect Wall Street \n        investors; therefore, the same Wall Street investors should pay \n        for this infusion of taxpayer money.\n            (5) The easiest method to raise the money from Wall Street \n        is a securities transfer tax, a tax that has a negligible \n        impact on the average investor.\n            (6) This transfer tax would be on the sale and purchase of \n        financial instruments such as stock, options, and futures. A \n        quarter percent (0.25 percent) tax on financial transactions \n        could raise approximately $150 billion a year.\n            (7) The United States had a transfer tax from 1914 to 1966. \n        The Revenue Act of 1914 (Act of Oct. 22, 1914 (ch. 331, 38 \n        Stat. 745)) levied a 0.2 percent tax on all sales or transfers \n        of stock. In 1932, Congress more than doubled the tax to help \n        overcome the budgetary challenges during the Great Depression.\n            (8) All revenue generated by this transfer tax should be \n        deposited in the general fund of the Treasury of the United \n        States, scaled to meet the net cost of these bailouts, and \n        phase out when the cost of the bailouts are repaid.\n\nSEC. 3.
