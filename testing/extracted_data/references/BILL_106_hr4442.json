FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) President Theodore Roosevelt began the National \n        Wildlife Refuge System by establishing the first refuge at \n        Pelican Island, Florida, on March 14, 1903.\n            (2) The National Wildlife Refuge System is comprised of \n        more than 93,000,000 acres of Federal lands managed by the \n        United States Fish and Wildlife Service in more than 520 \n        individual refuges and thousands of waterfowl production areas \n        located in all 50 States and the territories of the United \n        States.\n            (3) The System is the only network of Federal lands \n        dedicated singularly to wildlife conservation and where \n        wildlife dependent recreation and environmental education are \n        priority public uses.\n            (4) The System serves a vital role in the conservation of \n        millions of migratory birds, endangered species and threatened \n        species, fish, marine mammals, and the habitats on which these \n        species depend.\n            (5) Each year the System provides millions of Americans \n        with opportunities to participate in wildlife-dependent \n        recreation, including hunting, fishing, and wildlife \n        observation.\n            (6) Public visitation to National Wildlife Refuges is \n        growing, with more than 35,000,000 visitors annually. It is \n        essential that visitor centers and public use facilities be \n        properly constructed, operated, and maintained.\n            (7) The National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and \n        Community Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-\n        242) significantly enhances the ability to incorporate \n        volunteers and partnerships in refuge management.\n            (8) The System currently has an unacceptable backlog in \n        critical operations and maintenance needs.\n            (9) The centennial anniversary of the System in 2003 offers \n        an historic opportunity to appreciate these natural resources \n        and expand public enjoyment of these lands.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To establish a commission to promote awareness of the \n        National Wildlife Refuge System among the American public as \n        the System celebrates its centennial anniversary in 2003.\n            (2) To develop a long-term plan to meet the priority \n        operations, maintenance, and construction needs of the System.\n            (3) To require each fiscal year an annual report prepared \n        in the context of--\n                    (A) the budget submission of the Department of the \n                Interior to the President; and\n                    (B) the President's budget request to the Congress.\n            (4) To improve public use programs and facilities of the \n        System to meet the increasing needs of the public for wildlife-\n        dependent recreation in the 21st century.\n\nSEC. 3.
