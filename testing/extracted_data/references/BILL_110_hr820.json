FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Symptoms of depression are displayed by 37 percent of \n        seniors (individuals ages 65 and over) in the United States.\n            (2) The suicide rate for seniors is higher than such rate \n        for other age groups in the United States.\n            (3) Many Medicare beneficiaries lack access to mental \n        health services because mental health providers do not furnish \n        services in many medically underserved communities in which \n        such beneficiaries inhabit.\n            (4) Marriage and family therapists are the only core mental \n        health professionals recognized by the Department of Health and \n        Human Services but not recognized by the Medicare program for \n        purposes of coverage of services provided by such professionals \n        and reimbursement for such services. Psychiatrists, clinical \n        psychologists, clinical social workers, and psychiatric nurses \n        are recognized Medicare providers.\n            (5) Out of all counties in the United States, nearly 75 \n        percent of such counties do not have psychiatrists, 58 percent \n        of such counties do not have clinical social workers, and 50 \n        percent of such counties do not have psychologists with a \n        professional degree to serve their population. Marriage and \n        family therapists provide critical, cost-effective mental \n        health services for populations that have no other mental \n        health providers.\n            (6) The shortage of mental health providers who participate \n        in the Medicare program is a result of the Medicare program not \n        covering the services of the 50,0000 licensed marriage and \n        family therapists.\n            (7) Many marriage and family therapists work in medically \n        underserved communities. Twenty-five percent of patients are \n        ethnic minorities and in 2006, 27 percent of marriage and \n        family therapy students were ethnic minorities, a percentage \n        that continues to increase annually.\n            (8) There are 25 percent more marriage and family \n        therapists than psychiatrists in rural counties, and in the \n        most rural areas, there are twice as many marriage and family \n        therapists than psychiatrists.\n            (9) Medicare coverage of marriage and family therapy \n        services can increase Medicare beneficiaries' access to mental \n        health care in rural areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
