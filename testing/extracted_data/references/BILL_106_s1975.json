For \n                purposes of determining whether to grant relief under \n                this paragraph, the time for making the allocation (or \n                election) shall be treated as if not expressly \n                prescribed by statute.\n            ``(2) Substantial compliance.--An allocation of GST \n        exemption under section 2632 that demonstrates an intent to \n        have a zero inclusion ratio with respect to a transfer or a \n        trust shall be deemed to be an allocation of so much of the \n        transferor's unused GST exemption as produces, to the extent \n        possible, a zero inclusion ratio. In determining whether there \n        has been substantial compliance, all relevant circumstances \n        shall be taken into account, including evidence of intent \n        contained in the trust instrument or instrument of transfer and \n        such other factors as the Secretary deems relevant.''.\n    (b) Effective Dates.--\n            (1) Relief for late elections.--Section 2642(g)(1) of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by subsection (a)) \n        shall apply to requests pending on, or filed after, the date of \n        the enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Substantial compliance.--Section 2642(g)(2) of such \n        Code (as so added) shall take effect on the date of the \n        enactment of this Act and shall apply to allocations made prior \n        to such date for purposes of determining the tax consequences \n        of generation-skipping transfers with respect to which the \n        period of time for filing claims for refund has not expired. No \n        negative implication is intended with respect to the \n        availability of relief for late elections or the application of \n        a rule of substantial compliance prior to the enactment of this \n        amendment."
