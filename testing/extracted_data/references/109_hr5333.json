    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Shoulder-Fired Missile Threat \nReduction Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) MANPADS.--The term ``MANPADS'' means--\n                    (A) a surface-to-air missile system designed to be \n                man-portable and carried and fired by a single \n                individual; or\n                    (B) any other surface-to-air missile system \n                designed to be operated and fired by more than one \n                individual acting as a crew and portable by several \n                individuals.\n            (2) Conventional weapons.--The term ``conventional \n        weapons'' means rocket propelled grenades, landmines, abandoned \n        stocks of munitions, and other weapons the Secretary of State \n        determines the proliferation of which undermines international \n        peace and stability.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The global proliferation of man-portable air defense \n        systems (MANPADS) and other conventional weapons poses a direct \n        threat to the national security of the United States.\n            (2) The use of MANPADS and other conventional weapons by \n        terrorists and insurgent groups continues to hamper United \n        States efforts to achieve peace and security in Iraq and \n        Afghanistan.\n            (3) More than two-dozen terrorist groups, including al-\n        Qaeda, are believed to possess MANPADS.\n            (4) On November 28, 2002, in Mombasa, Kenya, two shoulder-\n        fired missiles were fired at a departing civilian airliner in \n        an unsuccessful attack claimed by al-Qaeda.\n            (5) A successful terrorist attack with a shoulder-fired \n        missile against a civilian airliner would have devastating \n        human and incalculable economic costs.\n            (6) The Government Accountability Office has estimated that \n        there are between 500,000 and 750,000 MANPADS in countries \n        around the world, with a few thousand outside government \n        controls and thousands more under government controls but \n        vulnerable to theft and possible transfer to terrorist groups \n        due to inadequate security.\n            (7) Many countries that possess stocks of MANPADS and other \n        conventional weapons no longer require such weapons for their \n        own security or self-defense, but do not possess the means to \n        eliminate or safeguard such weapons systems.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) where appropriate, the United States Government should \n        provide assistance to countries seeking to secure, remove, or \n        eliminate stocks of MANPADS and other conventional weapons that \n        pose a proliferation threat;\n            (2) where appropriate, the Secretary of State should direct \n        United States Ambassadors to such countries to negotiate with \n        appropriate officials of their host countries to offer \n        assistance to secure, remove, and eliminate stocks of MANPADS \n        and other conventional weapons that pose a proliferation \n        threat; and\n            (3) in light of the clear links between global networks of \n        terrorism and global networks of the illegal trade in \n        conventional weapons, the United States Government should place \n        consistent, broad, and continued emphasis on combating the \n        proliferation of MANPADS and other conventional weapons within \n        the broader nonproliferation strategy of the United States.\n\nSEC. 5. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to assist the governments of \nother countries to secure, remove, or eliminate stocks of MANPADS and \nother conventional weapons that pose a proliferation threat, local or \nregional security threat, or humanitarian threat.\n\nSEC. 6.
