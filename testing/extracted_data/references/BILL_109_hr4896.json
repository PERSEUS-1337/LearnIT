FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death \n        among children, and for every such injury that is fatal, \n        approximately 18 children are hospitalized and 1,250 are \n        treated by emergency departments for such injuries that are \n        nonfatal.\n            (2) According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an \n        average of 50 children under the age of 5 die each year in \n        incidents associated with nursery products, and about 16 of \n        these deaths each year are associated with cribs.\n            (3) In 2003, an estimated 60,700 children under the age of \n        5 were treated in United States hospital emergency rooms for \n        injuries associated with nursery products, and there were \n        10,700 injuries to children under the age of 5 years associated \n        with strollers alone.\n            (4) Of the 397 recalls issued by the Consumer Product \n        Safety Commission in fiscal year 2005, 109 (or 28 percent) were \n        children's products.
