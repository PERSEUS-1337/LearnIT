FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price \n        discrimination practices that compel many older Americans to \n        pay substantially more for prescription drugs than the drug \n        manufacturers' most favored customers, such as health insurers, \n        health maintenance organizations, and the Federal Government.\n            (2) On average, older Americans who buy their own \n        prescription drugs pay twice as much for prescription drugs as \n        the drug manufacturers' most favored customers. In some cases, \n        older Americans pay over 15 times more for prescription drugs \n        than the most favored customers.\n            (3) The discriminatory pricing by major drug manufacturers \n        sustains their annual profits of $20,000,000,000, but causes \n        financial hardship and impairs the health and well-being of \n        millions of older Americans. More than 1 in 8 older Americans \n        are forced to choose between buying their food and buying their \n        medicines.\n            (4) Most federally funded health care programs, including \n        the medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security \n        Act, and programs administered by the Veterans Health \n        Administration, the Public Health Service, and the Indian \n        Health Service, obtain prescription drugs for their \n        beneficiaries at low prices. Beneficiaries under the medicare \n        program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act are denied \n        this benefit and cannot obtain their prescription drugs at the \n        favorable prices available to other federally funded health \n        care programs.\n            (5) Implementation of the policy set forth in this Act is \n        estimated to reduce prescription drug prices for medicare \n        beneficiaries by more than 40 percent.\n            (6) In addition to substantially lowering the costs of \n        prescription drugs for older Americans, implementation of the \n        policy set forth in this Act will significantly improve the \n        health and well-being of older Americans and lower the costs to \n        the Federal taxpayer of the medicare program.\n            (7) Older Americans who are terminally ill and receiving \n        hospice care services represent some of the most vulnerable \n        individuals in our Nation. Making prescription drugs available \n        to medicare beneficiaries under the care of medicare-certified \n        hospices will assist in extending the benefits of lower \n        prescription drug prices to those most vulnerable and in need.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect medicare \nbeneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug manufacturers and to \nmake prescription drugs available to medicare beneficiaries at \nsubstantially reduced prices.\n\nSEC. 3. PARTICIPATING MANUFACTURERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Each participating manufacturer of a covered \noutpatient drug shall make available for purchase by each pharmacy such \ncovered outpatient drug in the amount described in subsection (b) at \nthe price described in subsection (c).\n    (b) Description of Amount of Drugs.--The amount of a covered \noutpatient drug that a participating manufacturer shall make available \nfor purchase by a pharmacy is an amount equal to the aggregate amount \nof the covered outpatient drug sold or distributed by the pharmacy to \nmedicare beneficiaries.\n    (c) Description of Price.--The price at which a participating \nmanufacturer shall make a covered outpatient drug available for \npurchase by a pharmacy is the price equal to the lower of the \nfollowing:\n            (1) The lowest price paid for the covered outpatient drug \n        by any agency or department of the United States.\n            (2) The manufacturer's best price for the covered \n        outpatient drug, as defined in section 1927(c)(1)(C) of the \n        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8(c)(1)(C)).\n\nSEC. 4. SPECIAL PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO HOSPICE PROGRAMS.\n\n    For purposes of determining the amount of a covered outpatient drug \nthat a participating manufacturer shall make available for purchase by \na pharmacy under section 3, there shall be included in the calculation \nof such amount the amount of the covered outpatient drug sold or \ndistributed by a pharmacy to a hospice program. In calculating such \namount, only amounts of the covered outpatient drug furnished to a \nmedicare beneficiary enrolled in the hospice program shall be included.\n\nSEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n    The Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to \nimplement this Act.\n\nSEC. 6.
