FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) an estimated 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 Americans live and \n        work overseas while continuing to vote and pay taxes in the \n        United States;\n            (2) Americans residing abroad help increase exports of \n        American goods because they traditionally buy American, sell \n        American, and create business opportunities for American \n        companies and workers, thereby strengthening the United States \n        economy, creating jobs in the United States, and extending \n        United States influence around the globe;\n            (3) with the growing threat of terrorism against Americans \n        who live around the world, the need to account for the number \n        of Americans residing in different countries is even more \n        important;\n            (4) Americans residing abroad play a key role in advancing \n        this Nation's interests by serving as economic, political, and \n        cultural ``ambassadors'' of the United States; and\n            (5) the major business, civic, and community organizations \n        representing Americans and companies of the United States \n        abroad support the counting of all Americans residing abroad by \n        the Bureau of the Census, and are prepared to assist the Bureau \n        of the Census in this task.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the Bureau of the Census should undertake a test census \n        of Americans residing in selected countries abroad, and that \n        the necessary funding should be appropriated for this purpose;\n            (2) the Bureau of the Census should, after completing that \n        test census, review the means by which Americans residing \n        abroad may be included in the 2010 decennial census;\n            (3) based on its review (described in paragraph (2)), the \n        Bureau of the Census should again test methodologies that would \n        provide for the counting of Americans residing abroad; and\n            (4) the Bureau of the Census should take appropriate \n        measures to provide for the inclusion of Americans residing \n        abroad in the 2010 decennial census and decennial censuses \n        thereafter.\n\nSEC. 3. COUNTING OF AMERICANS RESIDING ABROAD.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce shall--\n            (1) using any authorities available to the Secretary under \n        section 182 or any other provision of title 13, United States \n        Code, take a test census of Americans residing abroad by \n        September 30, 2004;\n            (2) submit the final tabulations of the test census to the \n        President and Congress within 9 months after the date specified \n        in paragraph (1), broken down into appropriate categories, \n        including--\n                    (A) Americans residing abroad affiliated with the \n                Federal Government, and their dependents; and\n                    (B) Americans residing abroad not affiliated with \n                the Federal Government, and their dependents;\n            (3) not later than June 30, 2005, submit to the President \n        and Congress a report containing any recommendations the \n        Secretary may have with respect to the inclusion of Americans \n        residing abroad in future decennial censuses, including--\n                    (A) counting methodologies;\n                    (B) the purposes for which any information could or \n                should be used; and\n                    (C) whether Americans residing abroad can be \n                included in the 2010 decennial census for purposes of \n                the apportionment of Representatives in Congress among \n                the several States and, if so, how that should be done;\n            (4) after submitting the report required by paragraph (3), \n        but before the end of 2006, again test methodologies for \n        counting Americans residing abroad; and\n            (5) take appropriate measures--\n                    (A) to provide for the inclusion of Americans \n                residing abroad in the 2010 decennial census and \n                decennial censuses thereafter; and\n                    (B) to make use of the information obtained from \n                such censuses for such purposes as, and to the maximum \n                extent that, the Secretary considers feasible and \n                appropriate.\n    (b) Confidentiality of Information; Penalties.--The provisions of \nsection 9 and chapter 7 of title 13, United States Code, shall apply \nwith respect to the test census.\n    (c) Limited Use of Data.--The data obtained from the test census \nmay not be used for any purpose not specifically provided for under \nthis section.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
