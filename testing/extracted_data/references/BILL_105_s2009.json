FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The military health care system of the Department of \n        Defense and the Veterans Health Administration of the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs are national institutions that \n        collectively manage more than 1,500 hospitals, clinics, and \n        health care facilities worldwide to provide services to more \n        than 11,000,000 beneficiaries.\n            (2) In the post-Cold War era, these institutions are in a \n        profound transition that involves challenging opportunities.\n            (3) During the period from 1988 to 1998, the number of \n        military medical personnel has declined by 15 percent and the \n        number of military hospitals has been reduced by one-third.\n            (4) During the two years since 1996, the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs has revitalized its structure by \n        decentralizing authority into 22 Veterans Integrated Service \n        Networks.\n            (5) In the face of increasing costs of medical care, \n        increased demands for health care services, and increasing \n        budgetary constraints, the Department of Defense and the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs have embarked on a variety of \n        dynamic and innovative cooperative programs ranging from shared \n        services to joint venture operations of medical facilities.\n            (6) In 1984, there was a combined total of 102 Department \n        of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense facilities with \n        sharing agreements. By 1997, that number had grown to 420. \n        During the six years from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year \n        1997, shared services increased from slightly over 3,000 \n        services to more than 6,000 services ranging from major medical \n        and surgical services, laundry, blood, and laboratory services \n        to unusual speciality care services.\n            (7) The Department of Defense and the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs are conducting four health care joint ventures \n        in New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, Oklahoma, and are planning to \n        conduct four more such ventures in Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, and \n        California.\n\nSEC. 2.
