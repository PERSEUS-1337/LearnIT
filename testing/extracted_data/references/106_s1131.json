    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fragile X Research Breakthrough Act \nof 1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Fragile X is the most common inherited cause of mental \n        retardation. It affects 1 in every 2,000 boys and 1 in every \n        4,000 girls. One in 260 women is a carrier.\n            (2) Most children with Fragile X require a lifetime of \n        special care at a cost of over $2,000,000 per child.\n            (3) Relatively newly-discovered and relatively unknown, \n        even in the medical profession, Fragile X is caused by the \n        absence of a single protein that can be produced synthetically \n        but that cannot yet be effectively assimilated.\n            (4) Fragile X research, both basic and applied, is vastly \n        underfunded in view of its prevalence, the potential for the \n        development of a cure, the established benefits of currently \n        available interventions, and the significance that Fragile X \n        research has for related disorders.\n            (5) Fragile X is a powerful research model for other forms \n        of X-linked mental retardation, as well as neuropsychiatric \n        disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and \n        pervasive developmental disorder. Individuals with Fragile X \n        are a homogeneous study population for advancing understanding \n        of these disorders.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT; \n              RESEARCH ON FRAGILE X.\n\n    Subpart 7 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 285g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 452E.
