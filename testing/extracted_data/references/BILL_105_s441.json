FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly 4 of 5 peer reviewed research projects deemed \n        worthy of funding by the National Institutes of Health are not \n        funded.\n            (2) Less than 3 percent of the nearly one trillion dollars \n        our Nation spends on health care is devoted to health research, \n        while the defense industry spends 15 percent of its budget on \n        research and development.\n            (3) Public opinion surveys have shown that Americans want \n        more Federal resources put into health research and are willing \n        to pay for it.\n            (4) Ample evidence exists to demonstrate that health \n        research has improved the quality of health care in the United \n        States. Advances such as the development of vaccines, the cure \n        of many childhood cancers, drugs that effectively treat a host \n        of diseases and disorders, a process to protect our Nation's \n        blood supply from the HIV virus, progress against \n        cardiovascular disease including heart attack and stroke, and \n        new strategies for the early detection and treatment of \n        diseases such as colon, breast, and prostate cancer clearly \n        demonstrates the benefits of health research.\n            (5) Health research which holds the promise of prevention \n        of intentional and unintentional injury and cure and prevention \n        of disease and disability, is critical to holding down health \n        care costs in the long term.\n            (6) Expanded medical research is also critical to holding \n        down the long-term costs of the medicare program under title \n        XVIII of the Social Security Act. For example, recent research \n        has demonstrated that delaying the onset of debilitating and \n        costly conditions like Alzheimer's disease could reduce general \n        health care and medicare costs by billions of dollars annually.\n            (7) The state of our Nation's research facilities at the \n        National Institutes of Health and at universities is \n        deteriorating significantly. Renovation and repair of these \n        facilities are badly needed to maintain and improve the quality \n        of research.\n            (8) Because discretionary spending is likely to decline in \n        real terms over the next 5 years, the Nation's investment in \n        health research through the National Institutes of Health is \n        likely to decline in real terms unless corrective legislative \n        action is taken.\n            (9) A health research fund is needed to maintain our \n        Nation's commitment to health research and to increase the \n        percentage of approved projects which receive funding at the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n            (10) Americans purchase health insurance and participate in \n        the medicare program to protect themselves and their families \n        against the high cost of illness and disability. Because of \n        this, it makes sense to devote 1 cent of every health insurance \n        dollar to finding preventions, cures, and improved treatments \n        for illnesses and disabilities through medical research.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF FUND.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of the \nUnited States a fund, to be known as the ``National Fund for Health \nResearch'' (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``Fund''), \nconsisting of such amounts as are transferred to the Fund under \nsubsection (b) and any interest earned on investment of amounts in the \nFund.\n    (b) Transfers to Fund.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n        transfer to the Fund amounts equivalent to amounts designated \n        under paragraph (2) and received in the Treasury.\n            (2) Amounts.--\n                    Health plan set aside.--With respect to each \n                calendar year beginning with the first full calendar \n                year after the date of enactment of this Act, each \n                health plan shall set aside and transfer to the \n                Treasury of the United States an amount equal to--\n                            (i) for the first full calendar year, .25 \n                        percent of all health premiums received with \n                        respect to the plan for such year;\n                            (ii) for the second full calendar year, .5 \n                        percent of all health premiums received with \n                        respect to the plan for such year;\n                            (iii) for the third full calendar year, .75 \n                        percent of all health premiums received with \n                        respect to the plan for such year; and\n                            (iv) for the fourth and each succeeding \n                        full calendar year, 1 percent of all health \n                        premiums received with respect to the plan for \n                        such year.\n            (3) Transfers based on estimates.--The amounts transferred \n        by paragraph (1) shall annually be transferred to the Fund \n        within 30 days after the President signs an appropriations Act \n        for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n        Education, and related agencies, or by the end of the first \n        quarter of the fiscal year.
