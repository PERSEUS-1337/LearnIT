SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT OF THIS \n              ACT.\n\n     It is the sense of Congress that unique harms are associated with \nthe remote interstate sales of cigarette and smokeless tobacco, \nincluding problems associated with verifying the legal age of consumers \nand long-term negative health effects associated with the continued use \nof these products. This Act further affirms Congress' longstanding \ninterest in encouraging compliance and enforcement of State laws that \nrelate to the remote sales, including internet sales, of these specific \nharmful products. Enacted more than 50 years ago, the Jenkins Act \nestablished reporting requirements for remote interstate sellers of \ncigarettes in order to reduce incentives for smuggling and to help \nstates enforce tobacco taxes. In light of the unique federal policy and \nhistoric distinctions between cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and \nother products, the requirements of this Act are in no way meant to \ncreate, and ought not be considered, precedent regarding the collection \nof State sales or use taxes by out-of-state entities that lack a \nphysical presence within the taxing State.\n\nSEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    The amendment made by this Act shall take effect on the first day \nof the first month beginning on or after 60 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act."
