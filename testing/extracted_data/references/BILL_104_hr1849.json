FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Congress finds--\n            (1) that, on October 8, 1984, the People's Republic of \n        China promulgated an internal document detailing the conditions \n        and measures for removing, for purposes of human transplant, \n        the organs of prisoners executed by the Chinese Government;\n            (2) that, pursuant to the document, China has, in some \n        cases, scheduled the execution of political dissidents on the \n        basis of the need for the internal organs of those political \n        dissidents;\n            (3) that, in China, prisoners are routinely executed \n        because of their opposition to the policies of their communist \n        government or because of their unwillingness to submit to forms \n        of thought control imposed by reeducation camps operated by the \n        Chinese Government;\n            (4) that, because of fear of the government, relatives of \n        executed dissidents are reluctant to claim the bodies of their \n        kin, for fear of political reprisal;\n            (5) that China's birth control policy routinely results in \n        forced abortion, forced sterilization, infanticide, and even \n        cannibalism; and\n            (6) that, by its actions, China has separated itself from \n        the community of civilized nations.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to use the economic \npower of the United States to lessen the brutality imposed by the \nChinese Government against its people, and for other purposes.\n\nSEC. 4.
