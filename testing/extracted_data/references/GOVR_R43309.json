    "content": "In the early morning of Friday, November 8, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (known in the Philippines as Yolanda ), one of the strongest typhoons to strike land on record, slammed into the central Visayas region. Over a 16 hour period, the super typhoon or cyclone, with a force equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane and clouds that covered two-thirds of the country, directly swept through six Philippine provinces and affected over 10% of the nation's population of 105 million people. Haiyan's estimated wind speeds were 195 mph at its peak and 155 mph as it weakened and moved west, with wind gusts of up to 235 mph. Several hundred thousand people reportedly had fled their homes in advance of Haiyan's arrival. Many of those displaced were moved to evacuation centers. (See Figure 1 and Figure 2 .) The speed of the storm as well as advance warning prevented greater flooding and may have saved many lives. However, in some of the hardest hit areas, particularly in coastal communities in eastern and western Leyte province and the southern tip of Eastern Samar, there appears to have been little defense against Haiyan's wrath. Between two-thirds and 90% of structures were heavily damaged or destroyed, including medical facilities. Downed trees and other debris blocked roads. Airports, vital links to the rest of the archipelagic country, were damaged. Furthermore, decentralized government authority, a shortage of available government workers, looting, and heavy rains delayed some relief efforts. The typhoon was the deadliest natural disaster ever recorded in the Philippines. Within a few days of the typhoon, the Philippine government reported that an estimated 11.5 million people had been affected by the storm, with more than 540,000 displaced (of which roughly 380,000 were staying in 1,215 evacuation centers and 162,000 outside the centers). The government also reported that 792,000 people were evacuated in advance of the disaster. The city of Tacloban (population 220,000), capital of Leyte province, was one of the hardest hit places and the scene of the most concentrated destruction and death. Thousands of Tacloban residents reportedly drowned in a \"two-story-high\" storm surge, including people seeking safety in a sports stadium that served as a shelter. Many others were killed by flying debris. (See Figure 3 , Figure 4 , and Figure 5 .) The estimated number of dead and missing is often fluid and subject to change in the days, weeks, and months following a natural disaster, particularly one on the scale of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda). Two and a half months after the typhoon struck, based on figures provided by the Philippine government, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that 14.1 million people had been affected, with more than 4.1 million displaced (as of mid-January 2014, 26,000 were staying in evacuation centers). Estimates of the number killed had risen to 6,201 with more than 1,785 missing. The number of injured was unknown. In addition, assessments revealed that nearly 5.6 million people required food assistance and an estimated 1.1 million houses had been damaged or destroyed. All numbers remain subject to revision. Steady population increases in disaster-prone areas, combined with a geography consisting of islands and poor infrastructure, make the Philippines vulnerable to humanitarian crises. An average of 20 major storms batter the country each year. In 2012, Typhoon Bopha (Pablo) struck the southern island of Mindanao, leaving nearly 2,000 people dead or missing. On the island of Bohol, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in October 2013 displaced 350,000 people, many of whom resisted going to shelters as Haiyan approached, fearing that they might collapse in an aftershock. Until Haiyan, the country's most destructive typhoon was Tropical Storm Thelma (Uring) of 1991, which killed over 5,000 people in the Visayas region. According to many observers, U.S. support to the Philippines following the typhoon, including disaster assistance, expressions of sympathy, and a flurry of diplomatic activity, has bolstered the already strong bilateral relationship. Some Philippine leaders and political commentators argue that the U.S. military response to the disaster has strengthened the case for an enhanced U.S. military presence in the country, an issue that the two sides have been discussing intensively during the past few months (see \" U.S.-Philippines Relations \" below). Some analysts opine that the response of the United States has significantly boosted its soft power in the Philippines and the region, particularly in comparison to that of China.  On November 10, 2013, President Obama made a statement expressing sympathy and support to the people of the Philippines. On November 21, the Senate expedited the confirmation of the new U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, Philip Goldberg, so that he could help coordinate U.S. humanitarian assistance there. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry travelled to the Philippines on December 17, 2013, where he met with President Benigno Aquino and visited the city of Tacloban. He announced $40 million in military assistance and $25 million in additional humanitarian aid (on top of roughly $60 million in disaster assistance already provided). Kerry had cancelled a trip to Manila in October 2013 due to tropical storm Nari.  Members of Congress were among the first U.S. government officials to offer support. Representative Chris Smith led a congressional delegation to Leyte province on November 25, 2013. On November 19, the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing entitled \"Assessing the Response to Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan.\" The Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs conducted a hearing on the U.S. response on December 3. Members circulated \"Dear Colleague\" letters including those calling for assistance to remote areas affected by the disaster and protection for vulnerable Filipina women and children. U.S. legislators also sponsored resolutions expressing condolences, supporting assistance and charitable donations to the people of the Philippines, and urging the U.S. government to grant Temporary Protected Status to eligible Philippine nationals, which would allow them to stay and work in the United States and thereby support their families in storm-affected areas (see Textbox ). In general, experts divide relief operations into several phases: search and rescue; treatment and survival; relocation and rehabilitation; early recovery; and long-term reconstruction. As with any significant natural disaster that has many moving parts, it can take days and sometimes weeks to get a relief effort underway. Delays in transportation and congestion, lack of transportation infrastructure, bureaucratic problems, and lack of access all can cause bottlenecks at key points in the system. While timing is critical to save lives, a relief effort of this size requires the coordination of assessments and appropriate responses with the government, local communities, and the international community to function efficiently.  The humanitarian relief operation, led by the Philippine government, was initially hampered by a number of significant challenges, not unusual in a disaster of this magnitude, including a general lack of transportation, extremely limited communications systems, and damaged infrastructure. Although aid personnel and humanitarian supplies arrived within days in many of the affected areas, there were challenges getting food and relief commodities to some of the more remote locations. Despite the physical and logistical challenges facing the relief effort, regular relief activities reportedly reached most of the worst-stricken areas within two weeks of the storm. In-depth assessments, necessary to obtain a better understanding of the situation on the ground, were conducted and are ongoing. Overall aid delivery to affected areas has been mobilized and sustained. By mid-December, a little more than one month after the typhoon struck, immediate, life-saving efforts in general began to shift more towards early recovery programming and the development of plans for longer-term recovery and reconstruction. However, affected areas were impacted by the heavy rains and strong winds associated with Tropical Depression Agaton from January 17-20, 2014. The impact of the storm exposed ongoing vulnerabilities of those affected by Typhoon Haiyan. The Philippine government plans and administers disaster relief primarily through the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Center (NDRRMC) and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). Other agencies involved in relief efforts include the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Office of Civil Defense, and the Department of Health. The NDRRMC oversees activities along with Local Disaster Risk Reduction Management Councils (LDRRMCs), the DSWD, DSWD field offices, local governments, and other agencies. The DSWD and its field offices coordinate relief efforts on the ground. The NDRRMC also collaborates with private sector disaster management networks. The Department of Foreign Affairs serves as the first point of contact for countries and international organizations wishing to provide assistance. Taking the lead on the disaster response, the Philippine government formed a high-level national taskforce to ensure fast track transition from relief efforts to the rehabilitation and rebuilding of affected areas. President Aquino appointed Senator Ping Lacson as Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery, a cabinet-level position. In response to widespread fears about government corruption, the Aquino administration launched a web portal that allows the public to track international disaster funds, the Foreign Aid Transparency Hub (FAITH). The Philippine government launched a four-year Reconstruction Assistance in Yolanda (RAY) plan, on December 18, 2013. Requesting nearly $8.2 billion, RAY focuses on rebuilding areas affected by the typhoon and developing resilience to natural disasters. Three main activities include $780 million for critical actions focused on shelter, education, agriculture, livelihoods, and protection; $2 billion for short-term interventions through 2014; and $5.3 billion to address longer-term needs through 2017. The government has launched an effort to provide temporary housing\u2014469 \"bunkhouses\" have been built or planned so far\u2014for people living in tent cities, particularly for those who formerly lived closed to the sea and are not allowed to return due to the risk of future storm surges. Each bunkhouse consists of 24 rooms (one room per family) and common kitchen and bath areas. The homes lack electricity and running water. International aid agencies have criticized them for not meeting international standards. In January 2014, the government announced that it would build 60,000 permanent housing units over a two-year period. On November 9, 2013, U.S. Charge d'Affaires Brian L. Goldbeck issued a disaster declaration, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), immediately authorized funds to be released for the initial implementation of an emergency response program. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed the U.S. Pacific Command to deploy rescue teams, dispatch helicopters for airlifts, and conduct other relief efforts. As of January 31, 2014, the United States has provided over $87 million in humanitarian assistance through USAID, the Department of State, and the Department of Defense (DOD), and $59 million in private sector contributions. The U.S. government immediately set up an interagency task force to coordinate and facilitate the humanitarian response to the typhoon in the Philippines through the Washington, DC-based Response Management Team (RMT) headed by USAID through OFDA. It also deployed Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs). The RMT supports USAID/DART efforts, which are focused on assessing humanitarian needs, positioning emergency relief supplies, and coordinating assistance with the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines, the Philippine government, and the international community. On December 18, 2013, the DARTs transitioned to a field office as the emergency phase of the response began to shift to early recovery. OFDA will maintain an ongoing presence in the Philippines for now to coordinate ongoing humanitarian activities. The State Department set up a Crisis Response Task Force to help monitor developments, facilitate coordination with other agencies as needed, and respond to inquiries from concerned Americans. The U.S. Embassy in Manila provided a center for coordination and communication among other U.S. agencies, Philippine authorities, and private organizations and citizens. U.S.-based NGOs have played an active role in the relief and recovery effort. DOD's initial response to Typhoon Haiyan was greatly facilitated by the advanced warning of the storm as well as naval, air, and Marine Corps assets either visiting or stationed in mainland Japan and the Japanese island of Okinawa. The USS George Washington naval task force as well as elements of the 31 st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) from Okinawa formed the majority of Joint Task Force (JTF) 505, which was formed to conduct initial relief operations, dubbed Operation Damayan . Nearly 1,000 U.S. military personnel were deployed directly to the disaster area while the rest served on ships or provided support from bases around the world.  U.S. military aircraft provided reconnaissance of the affected areas, lifted aid workers into the disaster zones, transported relief supplies, and evacuated those affected by the typhoon to various locations in the Philippines. Marines who were deployed ashore assisted with road clearance and with the distribution of humanitarian assistance. Once ground routes were improved, about 90% of relief supplies were then relegated to truck transportation. The Marines concentrated their efforts in the Guiuan, Eastern Samar, area which was the hub for supply transport and focused their remaining efforts south of Tacloban in the Leyte Gulf area. On November 24, 2013, DOD officials announced it would begin to transition all of its relief efforts to the Philippine government and that JTF 505 would stand down on December 1, 2013. The U.S. Embassy in Manila announced JTF 505's December 1 disestablishment, noting that at their peak, U.S. military efforts included more than 13,400 military personnel, 66 aircraft, and 12 naval vessels. The U.S. military delivered more than 2,495 tons of relief supplies and evacuated over 21,000 people, including over 500 American citizens. Also, over 1,300 flights were completed in support of the relief efforts for Operation Damayan delivering to approximately 450 sites. In addition to the United States, roughly 20 other nations and multilateral organizations, including Australia, Japan, NATO, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, contributed military assistance. This aid involved the use of military ships, transport planes, and helicopters. International military personnel provided disaster relief and helped distribute medical supplies, drinking water, and food. China, which had been criticized for providing too little assistance and being slow to respond, sent a naval hospital ship, the Peace Ark , to the Philippines on November 21.  Provisions exist in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to offer temporary protected status (TPS) or relief from removal under specified circumstances. TPS is blanket relief that may be granted under the following conditions: there is ongoing armed conflict posing serious threat to personal safety; a foreign state requests TPS because it temporarily cannot handle the return of nationals due to environmental disaster; or there are extraordinary and temporary conditions in a foreign state that prevent aliens from returning, provided that granting TPS is consistent with U.S. national interests. A foreign national who is granted TPS receives a registration document and an employment authorization for the duration of TPS. Within a few days of the typhoon, U.S. Citizenship and Immigrant Services (USCIS) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a limited set of immigration relief measures that Filipinos impacted by the typhoon might be eligible for, but did not grant TPS. The government of the Philippines formally requested on December 16, 2013, that President Barack Obama designate TPS for Filipinos in the United States. Legislation that would grant TPS to Filipinos ( H.R. 3602 , the Filipino Temporary Protected Status Act of 2013) has been introduced in the 113 th Congress. The international community typically provides significant humanitarian assistance in response to major disasters and their ongoing impact. Following Typhoon Haiyan, at the request of the Philippine government and in a supporting role, the United Nations established Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) and U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) teams. With the U.N. Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) already in place, OCHA is helping to coordinate actors on the ground and enlist donor support. Humanitarian relief sectors are typically established during humanitarian crises to enable the United Nations to coordinate partners, prioritize resources, and facilitate planning. In the Philippines, as with other disasters, response activities were organized into 12 relief sectors or \"clusters\" led by various agencies. The clusters currently include Camp Coordination and Camp Management; Coordination; Early Recovery and Livelihoods; Education; Emergency Shelter; Emergency Telecommunications; Food Security and Agriculture; Health; Logistics; Nutrition; Protection; and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. The United Nations, along with other partners, including the United States, has a strong relationship with the Philippines, and remains at the forefront of the current on-the-ground response for humanitarian assistance and early recovery. International recovery efforts are typically complex because they require coordination among numerous actors and international entities. In the current crisis, apart from U.N. agencies, those responding to humanitarian crises include international organizations, NGOs, Private Voluntary Agencies (PVOs), and bilateral and multilateral donors. More than two months after the storm, humanitarian assistance is still required in some affected areas, particularly food, clean water, shelter, and basic health care. The HCT, in partnership with 14 U.N. organizations and 39 non-governmental and international organizations, designed a Strategic Response Plan (SRP) to support the government's activities in meeting immediate humanitarian needs, complement its reconstruction plan, and fill gaps identified by the government or through interagency assessments. The SRP covers 171 municipalities in 14 provinces and 4 regions, where it is estimated that over 14 million people were affected by the typhoon. The overall humanitarian and early recovery priorities and objectives identified by the HCT are listed below, but the implementation of the projects is expected be guided by location and caseload. Meeting basic food needs and nutritional requirements through community-based services and building food security through stimulation of markets and production. Activities include providing food assistance, nutritional support, and agricultural inputs for farmers. Attaining protective and sustainable shelter solutions for those families who were displaced or have homes that were destroyed or damaged. Shelter needs remain urgent and vary greatly by location. Activities include providing populations with shelter material, tools, cash for work, technical training, and site management in evacuation centers. Most of those displaced are in transitional shelters, such as bunkhouses or tarpaulins, or they have received shelter kits to rebuild their homes. Regaining self sufficiency of livelihoods in urban and rural areas through restoration of local economies, agriculture, and fisheries. Recovery of livelihoods is critical to enable people to rebuild their homes and their lives. Sustaining access to water, sanitation, hygiene, and the ongoing provision of health care in affected areas and evacuation centers. Activities include a focus on surveillance and early warning to prevent the outbreak of communicable diseases. Activities also include restoring water systems and access to sanitation facilities in communities, schools, and health care facilities. Establishing access to community and local government services, particularly for basic education in temporary learning spaces, social welfare, community support, and a protective environment. Removing and recycling debris from public spaces for use in reconstruction and to improve access to homes. Undertaking these objectives with a view to enhancing resilience and preparedness for future disasters. The SRP covers 12 months from the date of the disaster. The plan targets up to 3 million people under any one relief cluster. The government has identified three consecutive phases of the response: (1) critical humanitarian needs (to June 2014); (2) short-term investments (July to December 2014); and (3) medium-term, longer-term investments (January 2015-December 2017). The SRP covers the response through the first two phases. A Post-Disaster Needs Assessment is planned starting in early 2014, which will help inform the way forward on phases 2 and 3. It is expected that the United Nations, Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and European Union will work with the government in support of its plans. In addition, other selected ongoing activities include: The U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) launched a plan for national authorities and humanitarian partners to provide assistance and protection support to more than 3 million women and girls affected by the disaster. The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and others are focused on identification, documentation, tracing, and reunification for unaccompanied and separated children. Trafficking among vulnerable populations has also been raised as a concern. An estimated 35,000 people have requested help from the Philippine Red Cross in tracing family members who are thought to have gone missing in connection with the typhoon. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is supporting the Philippine Red Cross in its emergency humanitarian response, is also working with the Philippine authorities on the proper management of the dead. A number of international actors are providing relief to the Philippines, either through financial contributions to the government or aid organizations or by directly providing relief supplies and emergency personnel. On November 12, 2013, the HCT appealed for $301 million in the Haiyan Action Plan to provide life-saving assistance and early recovery support for a six-month period. On November 22, this plan increased to $348 million, based on assessments completed as partners gained better access to affected areas. Launched on December 27, 2013, the Strategic Response Plan (described above) replaces these earlier appeals and requests $788 million.  Additional pledges and contributions have also been made outside the appeal. A number of countries, including the U.S. government, have provided assistance in the form of direct contributions of items such as food and tents, or through the operation of relief flights and logistics support. As of January 31, 2014, $662.9 million has been contributed to the overall Typhoon Haiyan response, and of that amount, $356.1 million has been contributed to the SRP. As of January 31, 2014, the U.N.'s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has made available approximately $25.3 million to the Plan. The United States and the Republic of the Philippines maintain close ties stemming from the U.S. colonial period (1898-1946), a security alliance, extensive military cooperation, and common strategic and economic interests. Other pillars of the bilateral bond include shared democratic values and people-to-people contacts. Filipino Americans number approximately 4 million, making them the second-largest Asian American population, and comprise the largest foreign-born group in the U.S. Armed Forces. An estimated 150,000 Americans live in the Philippines.  U.S. military forces are involved in several regular joint exercises and ongoing military missions in the Philippines. The two major ones are the Balikatan ( Shoulder to Shoulder ) exercises and the U.S. Joint Special Operations Task Force\u2013Philippines (JSOTF-P) counterterrorism assistance, which involves a U.S. rotating presence on Mindanao Island and the Sulu archipelago. Both of these programs include large humanitarian components. Other annual joint exercises include the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) naval event and the Amphibious Landing Exercise (PHIBLEX). In addition, U.S. warships have made frequent port calls in the Philippines in the past year.  DOD officials stated that the U.S. military had a \"small footprint\" of people and equipment in the Philippines at the time of Typhoon Haiyan. No injuries or damage to them were reported. Currently, there are about 500 U.S. military personnel from JSOTF-P conducting counterterrorism training for selected units of the Philippine military. Some members of JSOTF-P supported Operation Damayan in Ormoc City, Leyte province. The involvement of U.S. military forces in relief efforts following Typhoon Haiyan comes at a time of growing U.S.-Philippine security cooperation. The bilateral security relationship has gained prominence as a key link in the U.S. foreign policy \"pivot\" or \"rebalancing\" toward Asia. Since 2012, U.S. and Philippine officials have discussed increasing U.S. ship and aircraft access to Philippine military facilities, particularly at Subic Bay, site of the former U.S. naval base, and bolstering U.S. military facilities and forces in the country on a rotational or non-permanent basis. Since August 2013, the two sides have been negotiating a framework agreement for the increased U.S. military presence. The Philippines, regarded by Washington as a partner in maintaining regional security, is one of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign assistance in Southeast Asia. U.S. assistance has focused upon poverty reduction, broad-based economic growth, and, increasingly, external security concerns. In the past decade, over half of U.S. assistance to the country supported development programs in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, where there has been a sustained Muslim insurgency, with the aim of reducing the attractiveness of radical or extremist ideologies and activities. For FY2014, the Obama Administration requested raising Foreign Military Financing to the Philippines by 75%, to $50 million. (See Table 1 .) In 2010, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) approved a five-year, $434 million compact with the Philippine government that focused on poverty reduction, transportation, and the modernization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.  The Philippines is a lower middle income country with an estimated population of 105 million\u2014Southeast Asia's second largest. Once one of the wealthiest nations in Southeast Asia, it had been considered one of the region's economic laggards since the 1970s, due in large part to widespread corruption and poor governance. However, in the past three years, the Philippines had emerged as one of Asia's strongest economies. The 7.6% GDP growth rate it posted in 2010 was the country's fastest annual growth rate in 30 years.  The Philippines' overall growth represents a strong resurgence for a country that had been a recipient of IMF loans beginning in 1983, due to fiscal crises in the 1980s and the economic vulnerabilities exposed by the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s. Many Philippine observers felt it was symbolically important that the country became an IMF creditor in 2012, contributing to multilateral loans to Europe. Analysts note that the Philippines, like many Southeast Asian nations, has benefitted from substantial investment inflows over the past three years, but this raises the risks that the trend could reverse, with private capital outflows possibly arising from the typhoon or for other reasons, such as the possible tightening of U.S. monetary policy in the coming years. The areas damaged by Haiyan are some of the poorest parts of the Philippines, many of them dominated by agricultural and fishing industries, with some tourist destinations also severely harmed by the storm. Damage to other crops, such as sugar cane, coconut, and pineapple, is likely to have considerable impacts on livelihoods in the Visayas region. The Philippine government has sought temporary trade arrangements with export markets such as the United States that would allow duty-free access for a limited number of products coming from affected areas. According to some analysts, GDP growth is expected to continue to be strong despite the costs of Typhoon Haiyan, estimated at $13 billion. The Philippines' economy is forecast to expand by 6.7% in 2014, slightly less than the estimated 6.9% growth of 2013. Because the region affected by the storm is one of the country's least developed, impacts on the Philippines' manufacturing base and overall GDP may not be deep. Economists also note that once reconstruction efforts begin, construction spending is likely to spur growth. Furthermore, the storm's drag on the economy may be only slightly greater than the effects of other natural disasters in recent years. Many observers have been surprised the economy has fared so well. Economic Secretary Arsenio Balisikan reportedly called the performance \"a remarkable turnaround.\" Nonetheless, although the affected areas are not the country's largest sources of rice, the damage to rice crops in the region may reverse the Philippines' trend in recent years towards rice self-sufficiency, and rice imports are likely to rise. One important issue for the Philippine economic recovery in the months and years ahead will be whether decentralized governance and corruption limits the efficiency of stimulus efforts. The Philippine central government's relative lack of control over decisions by regional governments has been one of the chief obstacles to Philippine economic development for decades, many observers say. While the World Bank rated the Philippines one of the world's 10 most improved business environments in an October 2013 survey, the strains arising from the typhoon's damage will be a test of whether the central government can effectively implement economic stimulus without running into the issues of corruption or poor local governance. The impact of Typhoon Haiyan is of significant interest to the United States. As the extent of the disaster becomes clearer, other issues may emerge for Congress as it considers the ongoing U.S. response. These fall into several possible categories: The initial humanitarian relief period: Congressional interest and support is likely to focus on the humanitarian impact of the disaster, the U.S. and international response, and ongoing humanitarian developments. Ongoing oversight: Congress may exercise its oversight authority in the ongoing provision of U.S. humanitarian assistance. It may consider how USAID and DOD responses to the Haiyan disaster mesh with overall and existing U.S. foreign aid programs, contributions by other governments, and overall global humanitarian priorities. Longer-term assistance strategy: Given the extensive damage to the central Philippines' economy and infrastructure, Congress may consider broad, long-term U.S. assistance strategies in the Philippines, including policies to boost Philippine exports from storm-affected areas. Lessons learned from the response to the Philippines typhoon may influence future U.S. global disaster assistance strategies and the provision of food aid. Strategic questions: Congress may consider how the U.S. disaster response may impact the U.S.-Philippines relationship as well as regional geopolitical dynamics, and how existing and ongoing U.S. military activities in the Philippines may be affected by DOD's role in disaster relief.

Appendix E. The U.S. Government Emergency Response Mechanism for International Disasters The United States is generally a leader and major contributor to relief efforts in response to humanitarian disasters. The President has broad authority to provide emergency assistance for foreign disasters and the U.S. government provides disaster assistance through several U.S. agencies. The very nature of humanitarian disasters\u2014the need to respond quickly in order to save lives and provide relief\u2014has resulted in a rather unrestricted definition of what this type of assistance consists of at both a policy and an operational level. While humanitarian assistance is assumed to provide for urgent food, shelter, and medical needs, the agencies within the U.S. government providing this support typically expand or contract the definition in response to circumstances. Funds may be used for U.S. agencies to deliver services or to provide grants to international organizations (IOs), international governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private or religious voluntary organizations (PVOs). The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the U.S. government agency charged with coordinating U.S. government and private sector assistance. It also coordinates with international organizations, the governments of countries suffering disasters, and other governments. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) in USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) provides immediate relief materials and personnel, many of whom are already abroad on mission. It is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance and can quickly assemble Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) to assess conditions. OFDA has wide authority to borrow funds, equipment, and personnel from other parts of USAID and other federal agencies. USAID has two other offices that administer U.S. humanitarian aid: Food For Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). USAID administers emergency food aid under the Food for Peace Act (Title II of P.L. 480) and provides relief and development food aid that does not have to be repaid. OTI provides post-disaster transition assistance, which includes mainly short-term peace and democratization projects with some attention to humanitarian elements but not emergency relief. Although not all applicable to the disaster in the Philippines, the Department of Defense (DOD) Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funds three Dodd humanitarian programs: the Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP), Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) Program, and Foreign Disaster Relief and Emergency Response (FDR/ER). OHDACA provides humanitarian support to stabilize emergency situations and deals with a range of tasks including providing food, shelter and supplies, and medical evacuations. In addition the President has the authority to draw down defense equipment and direct military personnel to respond to disasters. The President may also use the Denton program to provide space-available transportation on military aircraft and ships to private donors who wish to transport humanitarian goods and equipment in response to a disaster.  Generally, OFDA provides emergency assistance for 30 to 90 days after a disaster. The same is true for Department of Defense humanitarian assistance. After the initial emergency is over, assistance is provided through other channels, such as the regular country development programs of USAID. The State Department also administers programs for humanitarian relief with a focus on refugees and the displaced. The Emergency Refugee and Migration Account (ERMA) is a contingency fund that provides wide latitude to the President in responding to refugee emergencies. Assistance to address emergencies lasting more than a year comes out of the regular Migration and Refugee Account (MRA) through the Population, Migration, and Refugees (PRM) bureau. PRM assists refugees worldwide, conflict victims, and populations of concern, often extended to include internally displaced people (IDPs). Humanitarian assistance includes a range of services from basic needs to community services. Appendix F. Mass Fatality Management Management of the dead is one challenge of the response to a catastrophe. The task often falls upon local communities, which are typically overwhelmed tending to the needs of the living. A pervasive myth holds that human remains cause epidemics in disaster-stricken communities. Human remains do not carry pathogens that are not already in circulation in a community, and they do not generally pose an additional threat to the public. Rather, epidemics of intestinal illness that follow a disaster typically result from loss of the infrastructures that prevent sewage from contaminating potable water. Under such circumstances, many become exposed to the illnesses of a few.  Upon review of the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) published a first responder manual on mass fatality management. In it they said that \"political pressure brought about by [rumors of epidemics from human remains] causes authorities to use unnecessary measures such as rapid mass burials.... The consequences of mismanagement of the dead include mental distress and legal problems for relatives of the victims.\" Responders are urged to take steps that allow the eventual identification of remains, and the opportunity for relatives to claim remains. Recommended approaches include rapid retrieval of remains by responders who are not medical personnel (in order to focus the efforts of medical personnel on survivors), best practices for victim identification, and options for storage of remains pending identification. Because the means for optimal storage\u2014ice and refrigeration\u2014may be in short supply following a disaster and are also needed by survivors, the manual recommends temporary burial as a good option for immediate storage where no other method is available."
