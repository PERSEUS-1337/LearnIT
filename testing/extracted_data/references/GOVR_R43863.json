    "content": "The size and composition of federal spending directed toward low-income people is a focus of public policy. Particularly in a budget-conscious environment, policy makers want to know what the federal government spends on programs to help needy populations, including the types of assistance provided and the characteristics of those who benefit. This report attempts to identify and provide information about federal programs that are targeted in some way toward low-income people and communities. An earlier version of the report looked at low-income programs and spending in FY2008 and FY2009; this version extends that analysis through FY2013.  Programs included in this report are distinct from social insurance programs such as Social Security, Medicare, or Unemployment Insurance. Those programs are financed largely by contributions from workers and employers and benefits are earned on the basis of an individual's work history. Social insurance plays a major antipoverty role in the United States, but participation is generally meant to be universal (providing insurance to the population at large against becoming poor) and not specifically targeted toward low-income people.  In contrast to social insurance, programs examined in this report are funded through general revenues and provide benefits and services to people with limited income either by tying eligibility to a specific measure of income, or by targeting assistance through funding allocation formulas or other need-related mechanisms. Some programs are highly targeted with detailed eligibility rules for individuals or households, while others encourage or prioritize services to low-income people within a broader target population group, such as the elderly. These programs attempt to ameliorate or mitigate the effects of low income by providing cash or noncash benefits to help people meet basic needs, such as food, housing, and health care. They also seek to address root causes of economic disadvantage by providing education, training, and other services to improve people's employability and earnings capacity. Some programs target assistance to communities with high concentrations of low-income people to compensate for their low tax capacities, and to help finance benefits and services for residents. While they share the common feature of an explicit low-income focus, programs discussed in this report are highly diverse in their purpose, design, and target population. They were established at different times, in response to different policy challenges, and not necessarily in coordination with one another. Readers should exercise caution in any attempt to generalize about these programs or draw conclusions from the information presented in this report. No single label accurately describes all programs in the report. Terms such as \"social welfare\" and \"social safety net\" are often understood to include social insurance programs, and are thus broader than the programs included here. \"Public welfare\" and \"public assistance\" are typically understood as a more narrow set of programs that primarily provide cash or near-cash benefits to low-income people. While such programs are included, programs that provide in-kind benefits and services also are discussed. \"Income-tested\" or \"means-tested\" might be used to describe these programs, but some target assistance toward low-income communities and do not apply a specific income or means test to individual participants or beneficiaries. The report examines programs by category, but the categories themselves are diverse. For example, the health category includes primary care for poor children and their families along with nursing home care for the elderly and disabled whose health costs may have depleted other income and assets. Cash aid includes traditional \"welfare\" in the form of cash assistance to needy families, but also includes pensions for needy veterans and two refundable tax credits for households with earnings, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). Food assistance includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), as well as subsidized meals for low-income schoolchildren and home-delivered meals for the elderly. Similarly, no single trait characterizes the people served by these programs. They include elderly and disabled individuals, children and their families, single adults and couples without children, workers and nonworkers, veterans, homeless people, refugees, students, and others. While some popular perceptions of \"welfare\" assume that beneficiaries are unemployed able-bodied adults of working age, the report demonstrates that people with disabilities actually account for the single largest share of spending under the 10 largest low-income programs. Families with children where an adult is working account for the next largest share of spending, followed by the elderly. Households where no able-bodied adult is working account for a relatively small share of spending under these programs. Readers should also note that most of the programs included in this report are relatively small, and serve a fraction of their potentially eligible target population. The report refers to the collective target population of the programs as persons with \"low\" or \"limited\" income, rather than \"poor\" people. Although some programs limit participation to individuals with income below federal poverty guidelines, income eligibility criteria vary widely and frequently include people with income above the official federal definition of poverty. Key findings of this report are presented in the Summary , above. The body of the report is organized as follows: The report begins with an overview of trends in federal spending for low-income programs over the six-year period from FY2008 through FY2013. It continues with a brief descriptive overview of federal low-income programs by major category (health care, cash aid, food assistance, etc.). Following sections discuss spending trends by category and by budgetary classification (\"mandatory\" or \"discretionary\"). The next section looks specifically at spending and trends over the six-year period for the 10 largest programs included in the report, which together accounted for 82% of all low-income spending in FY2013. Key features of the 10 programs are summarized. Still focusing on the 10 largest programs, the next section presents an analysis of spending by the population groups served, including the elderly and disabled, families with children, and childless adults and couples. Nonelderly nondisabled households are further examined by whether they include working adults. A \"related reading\" section lists additional CRS reports that provide information on federal low-income policy, programs, and spending. The report concludes with several appendixes. Appendix A discusses the methodology used to create the database of low-income programs and spending, and Appendix B explains the methodology used to prepare the analysis of spending by population group. Appendix C provides overview tables of the programs included in the report, and Appendix D is a series of short fact sheets on each program. Federal spending for low-income programs totaled $561 billion in FY2008 and jumped to $708 billion the next year, as the Great Recession of 2007-2009 took hold. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) aimed to stimulate the economy with additional federal funding and was responsible for nearly 60% of the increased spending on low-income programs between FY2008 and FY2009. Caseloads also grew as unemployment rose and incomes declined, making more people eligible for such benefits as SNAP and Medicaid. Federal spending for low-income programs peaked in FY2011 at $764 billion, dropped in FY2012, and edged up again in FY2013. By that year, spending for low-income benefits and services had receded below FY2010 levels, but remained a third higher than comparable spending in FY2008. (See Figure 1 and Table 1 . )  The following sections briefly describe the programs included in each major category of benefits and services, organized by size of spending in FY2013. Tables in Appendix C list and highlight key features of the programs, and brief fact sheets on each program are provided in Appendix D . As noted earlier, these programs are highly diverse and provide a range of benefits and services to a variety of target populations (see \" Important Caveats \"). Just as health care dominates total federal spending on low-income programs, Medicaid dominates the health category. Medicaid accounted for 83% of health care spending in FY2013 and is the single largest program included in this report (accounting for 39% of total FY2013 low-income spending). Medicaid is intended to help specified categories of people who lack the income and resources to afford necessary medical care. Low-income parents, dependent children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities have been the primary target populations served by Medicaid, although the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA, P.L. 111-148 ) expanded Medicaid eligibility to include most nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals with income below a specified level. The program finances the delivery of a wide range of primary and acute medical services as well as long-term supports and services such as nursing home care. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage for low-income children who lack health insurance but whose family income exceeds Medicaid eligibility levels. Other large health programs include the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D, which helps low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities pay for prescription drugs, and medical care for low-income veterans without service-connected disabilities. The latter program pays for an array of primary care, specialized care, and related social and support services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Indian Health Service also offers a variety of health services to its target population, who are American Indians or Alaska Natives living on reservations or within a specified service delivery area. Consolidated Health Centers offer primary and other health services to low-income populations in medically underserved areas, and the Maternal and Child Health block grant supports preventive and primary health care services for low-income women, infants, and children. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is intended to address the unmet care and treatment needs of individuals living with HIV or AIDS who lack insurance or resources to pay for core medical services, including prescription drugs, and related support services. Additional programs focus on specific health services, such as family planning and early breast and cervical cancer detection, or specific populations, such as refugees. Three programs account for the bulk of cash aid spending, and each ranks among the 10 largest of all programs for low-income people. Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which aims to provide a minimum income for aged, blind, or disabled individuals with very low income and resources, accounted for nearly 40% of cash aid spending in FY2013. The refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) accounted for another 38% of cash aid spending, and more than 14% came from the refundable Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). The EITC subsidizes the wages of low-income workers, with most benefits going to those with children. The ACTC is a refundable credit for families whose tax liability is too low for them to fully benefit from the regular nonrefundable Child Tax Credit. Cash aid also includes part of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the welfare reform program that replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1996. As AFDC's successor, TANF is still sometimes viewed as traditional welfare for poor families; however, the majority of TANF expenditures are for activities other than cash aid. TANF aims to increase the flexibility of states in meeting several statutory goals, including assisting needy families so that children can remain in their homes; ending dependence of needy parents through job preparation, work, and marriage; preventing and reducing incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and encouraging the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. In this report, TANF spending has been allocated among three categories\u2014cash aid, social services, and employment and training\u2014based on states' reporting of their actual expenditures. Finally, cash aid programs include pensions for needy elderly or disabled veterans and their dependents or survivors. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps) dominates spending for food assistance, accounting for almost three-quarters of obligations in this category and ranking as the second-largest low-income program in FY2013. SNAP attempts to alleviate hunger and malnutrition and to help low-income households purchase food to support a healthy diet. The next largest area of food assistance spending is for programs that subsidize the costs of breakfast and lunch served to low-income schoolchildren; these programs aim to support learning readiness, promote healthy eating, and protect the health and well-being of low-income children. Related programs subsidize the costs of meals and snacks for children in child care and other out-of-school settings (and some low-income elderly and disabled adults in adult care settings) and for children during the summer when they lack access to school-based meal programs. Another program helps elementary schools with high concentrations of low-income students provide fresh fruit and vegetable snacks during the school day. Food assistance also includes the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which provides supplemental food and nutrition education to low-income pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding women and their infants and young children who are at nutritional risk. The program seeks to protect children's health during critical developmental stages, prevent health problems, and improve health status. Food assistance programs also include congregate and home-delivered meals for the elderly to reduce hunger and promote socialization and well-being for older individuals, and emergency food assistance in the form of commodities for individuals defined by their states as needy. The Federal Pell Grant Program is the largest education program for people with limited incomes, accounting for 58% of targeted federal education spending in FY2013 and ranking as the fifth-largest program in this report. Pell Grants are one of several ways the federal government helps subsidize the costs of higher education for needy students. Other programs with similar goals include Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and Federal Work-Study. In addition to direct assistance to students, the federal government provides institutional aid to help expand the capacity of colleges and universities that serve high proportions of low-income and minority students. Federal TRIO Programs offer grants to institutions of higher education and other organizations to motivate and support disadvantaged students as they move from high school through college. GEAR-UP serves low-income elementary and secondary school students who are at risk of dropping out, and aims to increase the number of such students who enter and succeed in higher education. College Access Challenge Grants pursue a similar goal, through partnerships between government agencies and philanthropic groups. The second-largest education program included in the report (also one of the 10 largest low-income programs) is Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which accounted for more than one-fourth of targeted federal education spending in FY2013. Title I-A provides grants to local educational agencies with high concentrations of disadvantaged children and aims to ensure that all children have an opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach at least minimum proficiency on challenging academic achievement standards. Separate programs have similar goals for children of migrant workers, Indian children, and students in rural school districts. The Bureau of Indian Education operates programs to meet the educational needs of Indian children living on or near reservations. Other elementary and secondary education programs aim to increase student achievement through improvements in teacher and principal quality and to improve teacher knowledge and student performance in mathematics and science.  Literacy is the focus of Adult Basic Education, which helps adults to become literate and obtain the skills necessary for employment and self-sufficiency and to become partners in their own children's educational development. Finally, 21 st Century Community Learning Centers are intended to provide a wide range of remedial education and academic enrichment opportunities during non-school hours for children in high-poverty and low-performing schools. The federal government supports the housing needs of low-income people primarily by subsidizing the cost of rental units in the private market. Section 8 housing vouchers and project-based rental assistance together accounted for nearly two-thirds of all housing and development spending in FY2013. (The voucher component of Section 8 is one of the 10 largest low-income programs.) The overarching goal of Section 8 is to provide low-income people with decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Public Housing, which represented 14% of spending in this category in FY2013, achieves a similar goal by making publicly owned rental units available to low-income tenants at affordable prices. The Public Housing account supports the capital needs and operating costs of publicly owned housing developments, as well as the HOPE VI program and Choice Neighborhoods, which demolish, rehabilitate, and replace distressed public housing units. Additional housing programs are intended to expand the supply of supportive housing for low-income elderly and disabled households, as well as individuals living with AIDS. Homeless Assistance Grants attempt to meet the needs of homeless individuals and families, including individuals with disabilities, for basic shelter, short-term and long-term housing, and related support services. Two block grants\u2014HOME and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)\u2014target federal assistance toward communities with high rates of poverty and aging housing stock (among other factors) to help meet the housing needs of low-income homeowners, homebuyers, and renters (HOME) and to expand the community's supply of decent housing and economic development activities (CDBG). An additional block grant provides housing assistance and helps develop private housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands.  To address housing needs in rural areas, loans are available to help low-income households purchase, build, or renovate homes, and rental subsidies are available for low-income tenants. Low-interest loans and grants also are available to support new and improved water and waste disposal facilities in low-income rural communities. Finally, the housing and development category includes the Public Works and Economic Development program, which provides grants to distressed communities to help them revitalize, expand, and upgrade their physical infrastructure to attract new industries, expand businesses, diversify their economies, and generate job and investment growth. The social services category is diverse and includes a wide range of activities to support low-income or otherwise vulnerable populations. Of spending categorized as social services in this report, the vast majority\u2014more than 90% in FY2013\u2014is focused directly on children and youth or their families. Services funded by TANF are the largest single activity in this category, accounting for more than a quarter of the social services spending in this report. As noted in the earlier discussion of cash aid, TANF is often thought of as traditional welfare for poor families. However, states have flexibility in spending their TANF grants, and the majority of funds are used for noncash aid, including various social services for families with children. TANF spending also includes obligations under competitive grants for promotion of healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood. Head Start is the second-largest program in this category, accounting for more than 20% of social services spending for low-income populations. Head Start aims to promote school readiness for young children through a full array of educational, health, nutritional, social, and other services to children and their families. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), accounting for 14% of social services spending in FY2013, subsidizes the cost of child care for low-income parents while they work or attend school. Additional programs targeted toward children and families include Child Support Enforcement, which assists custodial parents who are seeking child support from their children's noncustodial parent. Foster Care grants are used by states to provide temporary homes for children who cannot remain safely with their families; Adoption Assistance helps facilitate the adoption of children with special needs as defined by their state; and the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program helps current and former foster children transition to a self-sufficient adulthood. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program is intended to promote a range of outcomes, including maternal and newborn health, child protection and prevention of child injuries, school readiness and achievement, reduction in crime or domestic violence, and family economic self-sufficiency. Of social services programs not specifically targeted toward children and families, the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) is the largest and most flexible. The program supports a continuum of services to promote self-sufficiency, but decisions about target populations and services are left to the states. Other social services programs focus on specific target populations. For example, the Older Americans Act authorizes social services for the elderly and the Bureau of Indian Affairs provides various human services for American Indians. Programs that target services at the community level include the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), which aims to reduce poverty and empower low-income individuals and families to become self-sufficient, and Emergency Food and Shelter Grants, which provide services for homeless and hungry individuals in high-need communities. Finally, the Legal Services Corporation attempts to ensure equal access to the justice system for people who are otherwise unable to afford legal counsel. Two programs serving disadvantaged youth comprised 43% of the FY2013 employment and training spending included in this report. Specifically, youth activities under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) provide a variety of services to improve the educational and skill competencies of eligible youth and to develop connections with employers and mentoring opportunities with adults. Job Corps focuses on those disadvantaged youth who can benefit from an intensive residential program to become employable and productive. This category also includes work-related services for needy families with children under TANF, a small employment and training program for recipients of SNAP benefits, and a program that provides employability and related services to help refugees and other humanitarian entrants find jobs quickly. Remaining programs include WIA's adult activities program; Community Service Employment for Older Americans, which helps older individuals (age 55 or older) become self-sufficient through community service jobs and training; and Foster Grandparents, which provides stipends for low-income older individuals to provide services to children with special needs. Two programs make up the energy assistance category. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps low-income households pay their heating and cooling expenses, and the Weatherization Assistance Program helps increase the energy efficiency of homes occupied by low-income people to reduce energy costs and improve health and safety. Health care is by far the largest category of low-income spending, accounting for nearly half of all expenditures in each of the six years from FY2008 through FY2013. Cash aid has consistently been the second-largest category (20% in FY2013), followed by food assistance (more than 14% in FY2013); however, spending for these two categories combined still falls short of spending for low-income health programs. Education, housing and development, and social services rank next in size, accounting for 7%, 6%, and 5%, respectively, of total low-income spending in FY2013. The last two categories\u2014employment and training and energy assistance\u2014each constituted less than 1% of low-income spending in FY2013. (See Figure 2 and Table 2 .) As noted above, health care dominates low-income spending; thus, total low-income spending tends to follow the same pattern as health care spending. (See Figure 3 .) Like total low-income spending, health expenditures during the FY2008-FY2013 period peaked in FY2011, declined in FY2012, and rose again in FY2013. However, other categories show different patterns. Spending for cash aid and food assistance generally rose over each of the six years (with a dip in the cash aid category in FY2012); peak spending for both of these categories occurred in FY2013. (The food category showed the largest growth over the period, with an 82% increase in spending between FY2008 and FY2013.) On the other hand, education spending peaked in FY2011 and declined in both of the subsequent years. Smaller categories\u2014housing and development, social services, employment and training, and energy assistance\u2014all saw their peak spending in FY2009. By FY2013, spending for these four categories combined was only slightly higher than in FY2008. (See Figure 4 .) Of total low-income spending in FY2013, about 82% was classified in budget terms as \"mandatory\" (also called \"direct\" spending) and the remainder as \"discretionary.\" This was a slight shift from FY2008, when 78% of low-income spending was mandatory and 22% was discretionary. In mandatory programs, many of which are entitlements to individuals or units of government, Congress defines eligibility and payment rules in authorizing laws. These rules determine the amount of spending that will occur, so Congress generally must amend the authorizing law in order to control federal spending. The amount of federal spending for discretionary programs, on the other hand, is determined by Congress through the annual appropriations process.  Mandatory spending may be structured as open-ended or capped. In an open-ended entitlement program, no predetermined ceiling is imposed on federal expenditures; instead, federal payments are made to all eligible beneficiaries for eligible expenditures as defined in law. (Medicaid is an example of an open-ended entitlement program.) In a capped program, the authorizing law limits the total amount of federal spending that can occur. (TANF is an example of a capped entitlement program.) Of mandatory spending discussed in this report, 90% was through open-ended programs in FY2013. The pattern of mandatory versus discretionary spending differs by major category of benefits and services. The three largest categories\u2014health care, cash aid, and food assistance\u2014are dominated by mandatory spending, while the smaller categories (with the exception of social services) are primarily or exclusively discretionary. In the top three categories, spending occurs largely through open-ended entitlement programs. Social services spending is a mixture; about two-thirds of such spending in FY2013 was classified as mandatory and the rest discretionary. Of mandatory social services spending, most (about three-fourths) was capped and the balance open-ended. This report describes a large number of programs, but it is important to note that just a few account for the vast majority of spending. (See Figure 5 .) The four largest programs accounted for nearly two-thirds (65%) of total low-income spending in FY2013, and the top 10 comprised almost 82%. The dominance of these large programs has grown somewhat since FY2008, when the same top four made up 61% of total low-income spending, and the top 10 accounted for 78%. Spending for Medicaid\u2014the single largest program\u2014went from 37% of the total in FY2008 to 39% in FY2013, and SNAP grew from 7% to 11%. (See Table 3 .) The 10 largest programs in FY2013 are the same as in FY2008, and Medicaid has consistently been number one; however, some of the others have shifted in rank order. Four programs ranked higher in FY2013 than in FY2008: SNAP, the Low-Income Subsidy for prescription drugs under Medicare Part D (LIS-Part D), the ACTC, and Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. Three programs declined in relative size: SSI, the refundable portion of the EITC, and TANF. Among the 10 largest programs, seven are entitlements, or mandatory spending programs. Of those seven, all but one are open-ended entitlements to individuals. As noted above, this means their spending levels are determined by the number of people who are eligible and apply for the program, rather than the amount Congress chooses to provide through the appropriations process. One mandatory program\u2014TANF\u2014is a capped entitlement to states (rather than individuals), which means that states are entitled to receive a fixed amount each year that is established in the authorizing law. Table 4 provides an overview of key features of each of these top 10 programs. Many low-income assistance programs target their benefits not only on the basis of financial need but also to certain populations, such as the aged, the disabled, or families with children. Other low-income assistance programs\u2014while not explicitly restricting their benefits to certain groups\u2014provide the bulk of assistance to them.  Figure 6 provides estimates of federal spending in FY2011 by population group under the 10 largest low-income assistance programs identified in the previous section. The analysis uses FY2011 because it is the latest year for which data to divide spending among population groups are available for Medicaid. Estimates are provided for federal spending under the top 10 programs for the aged, the disabled, families with children, and childless adults and couples. Childless adults and couples represent nonelderly nondisabled adults in families without children. For families with children and for childless adults and couples, additional estimates are made for those with and without earnings. The figure also provides detail on the type of assistance received by each population group (e.g., health, food, housing, cash). As the figure shows, the population group benefitting from the most federal spending under the top 10 programs is the disabled, who received an estimated $208 billion in federal dollars in FY2011, or 33% of all federal spending under the 10 largest programs. Disabled individuals received $136 billion in health care assistance alone. The population group that received the second-most federal dollars was families with children with earnings, whose federal spending from the top 10 programs totaled $171 billion. This included $77 billion in cash assistance from the two refundable tax credits (EITC and ACTC), which are targeted to low-income families with children and are restricted to such families with earnings.  The aged received $96 billion in low-income aid from the top 10 programs, predominantly in the health care category. Families with children but without wage earners received an estimated $61 billion from the top 10, largely from noncash programs. Childless adults received the least aid from the 10 largest programs; those with earnings received an estimated $9.7 billion in benefits and those without earnings an estimated $12.9 billion, mostly in the form of noncash benefits. Pell Grants, one of the 10 largest low-income assistance programs, provided student aid in FY2011 totaling $41.5 billion, and grants to states for services (education and TANF services) totaled $23 billion. (These are shown in Figure 6 and Table 5 as \"Education and Services,\" rather than in a specific population category.)  Table 5 shows the estimates of federal spending for each of the top 10 low-income assistance programs by population category in FY2011. For two programs, all spending was categorized for a single population group; the ACTC is only available for families with children with earners, and Pell Grants are only available for college students (shown in the \"Education and Services\" category). For the other eight programs, spending was allocated among population groups based on available data. (For a discussion of the methodology used to prepare these estimates by population groups, see Appendix B .) The following CRS reports provide related information on federal low-income policy, programs, and spending. Additional CRS reports are cited in footnotes, and each of the program fact sheets in Appendix D includes a reference to a relevant program-specific CRS report. CRS Report R41625, Federal Benefits and Services for People with Low Income: Programs, Policy, and Spending, FY2008-FY2009 : includes a brief history of federal low-income policy; a detailed discussion of concepts used to define individual eligibility for benefits and services (e.g., federal poverty guidelines and others); a discussion of mechanisms used to target resources on the basis of need (e.g., formula allocation factors and cost-sharing rules); and a discussion of the types of federal grants (formula, competitive, direct benefits to individuals) used to provide assistance, and related policies such as matching requirements. CRS Report R41823, Low-Income Assistance Programs: Trends in Federal Spending : analyzes spending trends for the 10 largest low-income programs (similar but not identical to the top 10 programs identified in this report) from FY1962-FY2013, with projections through FY2024. CRS Report R43731, Poverty: Major Themes in Past Debates and Current Proposals : provides a short history of key federal policies enacted over the past century to address poverty, presents several overarching themes that have recurred in antipoverty policy debates over time, and highlights selected current proposals in the context of these themes. CRS Report RL33069, Poverty in the United States: 2013 : presents detailed statistics on the incidence of poverty among various demographic groups and by geography, and compares measures of poverty under the official federal poverty guidelines and the \"research supplemental poverty measure.\" CRS Report R41187, Poverty Measurement in the United States: History, Current Practice, and Proposed Changes : provides a history of the current official federal poverty measure, and discussion of alternatives. Appendix A. Methodology Used to Create Low-Income Program Database Selection of Low-Income Programs Programs were selected for inclusion in this report if they (1) have provisions that base an individual's eligibility or priority for service on a measure (or proxy) of low or limited income; (2) target resources in some way (e.g., through allocation formulas, variable matching rates) using a measure (or proxy) of low or limited income; or (3) prioritize services to low-income segments of a larger target population.  A few programs without an explicit low-income provision were included because either their target population is disproportionately poor or their purpose clearly indicates a presumption that participants will be low income. Such programs that serve disproportionately low-income people include the Indian Health Service, Homeless Assistance Grants, Indian Education programs, Title I Migrant Education, and Indian Human Services. Programs with purposes that presume a low-income target population include Adult Basic Education and Social Services Block Grants. Federal student loan programs were considered for inclusion because they determine benefit levels through the same need-analysis system that is used for Pell Grants and several smaller postsecondary education programs. However, this system results in students from relatively well-off families receiving assistance, as there is no absolute income ceiling on eligibility. Pell Grants are structured in such a way that the majority of recipients are low-income and the lowest-income students receive the largest benefits. Student loan programs are not as strongly targeted and therefore are not included in the report.  On the other hand, deliberations about whether to include the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) reached a different conclusion. The regular Child Tax Credit (CTC) is a nonrefundable credit and phases out at relatively high income levels. The ACTC is a refundable credit that allows families with no or insufficient tax liability to get all or part of the benefit they would otherwise receive from the CTC. Because of the refundable nature and other design features of the ACTC, it serves predominantly lower-income families . For example, for tax year 2012, 90% of returns that claimed the ACTC were filed by families with adjusted gross income (AGI) below $40,000 and 89% of the credit went to such families. Thus, the ACTC is included in the report. Because the report includes only programs with direct spending, it does not include tax provisions, with the exception of direct spending for the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the refundable ACTC. Finally, one program\u2014Developmental Disabilities Support and Advocacy Grants\u2014was included in the 2011 version of this report (CRS Report R41625, Federal Benefits and Services for People with Low Income: Programs, Policy, and Spending, FY2008-FY2009 ) but dropped in the current version. Only one component of that program had a low-income targeting provision, and that component was below the $100 million threshold for inclusion in this analysis (see below). Categorization of Programs Most programs are easily assigned to broad categories, such as health, cash aid, food assistance, or education. A few, however, have multiple purposes or allowable activities. For some of these programs, spending can be disaggregated into the relevant categories. For example, using state reporting of actual expenditures, it is possible to estimate the amount of TANF obligations attributable to cash aid, social services, and employment and training. Other programs cannot be disaggregated and must be assigned to a single category. For example, Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees was categorized as health care, and Indian Human Services was categorized as social services although it also provides cash and housing assistance.  The social services category, in general, is not well-defined and some analysts might assign some programs\u2014and therefore dollars\u2014differently. Head Start, for example, could be considered an education program, since its purpose is to promote school readiness; however, it supports a very broad range of activities (including activities for children ages 0-3 in its Early Head Start component) that can best be characterized collectively as social services. Foster Care and Adoption Assistance both give cash to families or other care providers, but income support is not these programs' purpose or sole use of funding. Foster Care subsidizes maintenance payments and administrative activities (including case planning) on behalf of children who cannot remain safely at home, and Adoption Assistance helps facilitate the adoption of children who would otherwise lack permanent homes. Thus, these programs were categorized as social services and not cash assistance. Likewise, Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting is included in social services, rather than health care, because of the broad range of its intended purposes. Selection of Spending Measure New obligations incurred in the indicated fiscal year were chosen as the measure of spending for this report, although for many programs readers may be more accustomed to seeing appropriations (budget authority) or outlays. These spending concepts are related. Congress and the President enact budget authority through appropriations measures or other authorizing laws. Budget authority in turn allows federal agencies to incur obligations , through actions such as entering into contracts, employing personnel, and submitting purchase orders. Outlays represent the actual payment of these obligations, usually in the form of electronic transfers or checks issued by the Treasury Department. Obligations are used in this report because they are the most consistent measure available at the necessary level of detail for the majority of programs. The source of obligations data is the U.S. Budget Appendix for the second fiscal year (e.g., FY2015 budget appendix for final FY2013 obligations, FY2014 budget appendix for final FY2012 obligations, etc.). Obligations were either not available or not appropriate for a small number of programs. Because obligations were not available at the necessary program level, appropriations were used for the following: Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees, Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection, the Title I Migrant Education Program, Social Services and Targeted Assistance for Refugees, and Foster Grandparents. For veterans' medical care, the Budget Appendix shows obligations for the entire program, not solely the income-tested component. Thus, estimated obligations for Priority Group 5 veterans (needy veterans without service-connected disabilities) were calculated from Department of Veterans Affairs data on obligations for Priority Groups 1-6 and 7-8 and the number of patients receiving care by individual priority group.  The Budget Appendix also does not show obligations solely for the low-income subsidy portion of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. Therefore, the report uses aggregate reimbursements for the low-income subsidy for the calendar year (instead of fiscal year), available from the annual report of the Medicare trustees. As noted above, TANF obligations provided in the Budget Appendix were disaggregated into the categories of cash aid, social services, and employment and training, based on states' reporting to the Department of Health and Human Services of their actual expenditures.  The Budget Appendix includes obligations for the Section 502 single-family rural housing loan program in combination with other programs in an aggregate amount for the Rural Housing Insurance Fund Account. Thus, loan subsidy budget authority (also found in the Budget Appendix) was used for the Section 502 program in this version of the report. In the 2011 version, loan subsidy outlays were used, adjusted for re-estimates provided in the Federal Credit Supplement to the U.S. Budget for the relevant years; however, budget authority has now been chosen as a better measure. Finally, the report uses obligations from the Budget Appendix for the ACTC in FY2009-FY2013. However, for FY2008, ACTC obligations shown in the Budget Appendix also include an unspecified amount for a one-time $300 per child tax rebate, authorized by the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-185 ), which was not targeted on low-income families. That figure, which overstates the amount spent for the ACTC alone, was used in the 2011 version of this report with appropriate caveats. For the current version, however, data from the Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income for tax year 2007 are used to provide a more accurate picture of the ACTC in FY2008. Spending Threshold Programs are included in this report if they had obligations in any year from FY2008 through FY2013 of at least $100 million. To simplify the analysis without significantly changing the overall picture, smaller programs were excluded, even if they met the low-income criteria. A few programs had spending above the threshold in some years but not in others. Spending totals cited throughout this report include these programs only for the years in which their obligations equaled or exceeded $100 million. In other words, each year's spending total is a snapshot of spending in that year for low-income programs that\u2014 in that year \u2014had obligations totaling at least $100 million. (See Table C-1 for all spending amounts for all programs in each year.) Comparison with Predecessor CRS Report Series From 1979 to 2006, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) issued a series of reports, typically every other year, called Cash and Noncash Benefits for Persons with Limited Income . The series was conceived and produced (except for the last edition in 2006) by [author name scrubbed], Specialist in Social Policy, who retired from CRS in 2004. In 2011, CRS published CRS Report R41625, Federal Benefits and Services for People with Low Income: Programs, Policy, and Spending, FY2008-FY2009 , as a replacement for the Cash and Noncash series. The current report is an update to the 2011 version.  The new report series uses different methodologies to select and categorize programs and measure spending; therefore, it cannot be considered an update of Cash and Noncash for various reasons. For example, the older series did not include certain programs that are now included, such as the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D, Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and Community Development Block Grants. The older series also had no minimum spending threshold, so it included smaller programs that are not included here. In addition, the older series included student loans, which are no longer included for reasons explained above. Several programs were also categorized differently in the previous series (e.g., Head Start was categorized as education, Foster Care and Adoption Assistance as cash aid, and Homeless Assistance Grants as social services). The older series used different measures of spending for different programs, while the new series uses obligations wherever possible. The older series also provided estimates of state-local spending, which are not included here.  Finally, the older series traced spending back to 1968, which is beyond the scope of the current series. Changes in programs and appropriations accounts over time make it virtually impossible to trace obligations backward with precision. However, an analysis of long-term spending trends for 10 major needs-tested programs, using outlays, is available in CRS Report R41823, Low-Income Assistance Programs: Trends in Federal Spending , by [author name scrubbed]. Appendix B. Methodology Used for Analysis of Spending by Population The allocations of federal spending in FY2011 under the 10 largest low-income programs by population groups (see \" Spending for the 10 Largest Programs by Population \") are estimates based on a specific methodology and available data. These estimates also rely upon certain simplifying assumptions and hence, represent an approximate division of spending among the population groups. Note that for most programs, data collected in conjunction with the administration of a program (administrative data) were used as the basis of making the allocations among population groups. However, programs use different definitions of \"elderly\" and \"disabled\" to determine eligibility and program requirements, so the population groupings are not consistent among all programs. For example, Medicaid uses age 65 to determine who is elderly, while a person is considered elderly for purposes of the SNAP program at age 60. Medicaid As noted earlier, the analysis uses FY2011 because it is the latest year for which data to divide spending among population groups are available for Medicaid. The allocation of Medicaid spending is based on a combination of administrative data and data from the Census Bureau's March 2011 Current Population Survey (CPS). FY2011 Medicaid administrative data report that, of total Medicaid expenditures in that year, 23% was received by the elderly and 43% by disabled recipients. These percentages were directly used to allocate federal Medicaid spending among those two population categories.  However, Medicaid administrative data are not sufficient for allocating spending to the population groups representing nonelderly and nondisabled beneficiaries. (For example, they do not include information on whether a family had earnings.) An analysis of March 2011 CPS data was used to determine the allocation of federal spending among those population groups. The CPS identifies individuals covered by Medicaid, and the Census Bureau provides an estimate of the \"market value\" of Medicaid for those covered. The CPS also provides background demographic and economic characteristics of the population, including age, disability, whether the individual is in a family with children, and whether the individual was working or not. These background characteristics were used to identify Medicaid beneficiaries in families with children, as well as childless adult recipients (not aged or disabled) and whether any adult (aged 18 or older) in the family was employed in March 2011. Total Medicaid \"market values\" were computed for each population category, which determined each population category's share of total Medicaid market values for the nonelderly, nondisabled population. These shares were then applied to the 34% of Medicaid spending that remained, after spending was allocated to the elderly and disabled, to determine how much federal Medicaid spending was allocated to the population categories of families with children and childless adults and couples. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program The allocation of federal SNAP spending is based on an analysis of the FY2011 SNAP Quality Control Data files, administrative data that include information on the demographic and economic characteristics of SNAP participants and households. The information is for the full fiscal year, but the data are collected monthly and tabulations of them represent a monthly average.  SNAP households were placed into six categories that were totally inclusive and mutually exclusive in the following order: households with an aged member, households with a disabled member, households with children and earnings, households with children without earnings, childless adults or couples with earnings, childless adults or couples without earnings. If a household could be classified in multiple categories, it was placed in the first category for which it met criteria for inclusion. For example, if the household had an aged member but also had children, it was placed in the \"aged\" category.  Supplemental Security Income The allocation of federal SSI spending to the elderly and disabled is based on administrative data collected and published by the Social Security Administration. The share of spending for the aged and disabled in this report is from Table 2, SSI Annual Statistical Report, 2013 . Earned Income Tax Credit  For the purpose of this report, EITC spending reflects obligations for the refundable portion of the tax credit. The Internal Revenue Service collects and publishes information on the refundable portion of the EITC in its Statistics of Income (SOI) data, derived from information on filed tax forms. The information in this report is based on the division of the refundable portion of the EITC for tax year 2010 (which would be paid in FY2011) between those filers who claimed the credit based on the presence of children versus those who claimed the credit based on having no children.  Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy The allocation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug Low-Income Subsidy between the elderly and disabled is based on unpublished information obtained by CRS from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). They estimated that the elderly account for 55% of the total low-income subsidy, with the disabled accounting for the remaining 45% of the subsidy.  Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers The allocation of Section 8 spending among the population groups is based on an analysis of administrative data collected by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. FY2011 data were not available for Section 8; thus FY2010 data were used for these estimates. As with the SNAP information, households were categorized into population groups in the following order: households with an elderly member; households with a disabled head or child; households with children with earnings; households with children without earnings; households without children (or aged or disabled members) with earnings; and households without children (or aged or disabled members) without earnings.  The Section 8 administrative data use an annual accounting period, representing the characteristics of a household over a year rather than in a month. Thus, families with earnings represent those who had any earnings over a year, rather than earnings in a month. Additionally, the disability information available for Section 8 households was more limited than that for SNAP, with the data only permitting identification of households with a disabled head or disabled child. Rent subsidies were tallied for each of these population shares, with federal Section 8 spending allocated based on each population's share of total subsidies.  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  This report divides TANF spending among three categories: cash assistance, social services, and employment and training. For the analysis of spending by population group, social services and employment and training expenditures were placed in the \"Education/Services\" category. TANF cash assistance was allocated among the population groups based on TANF administrative data, which include information on demographic and other characteristics of families receiving TANF cash assistance. The information is for the full fiscal year, but the data are collected monthly and tabulations of them represent a monthly average. Using these data, TANF families were classified into three population groups:  Disabled, representing families with a parent receiving SSI (not TANF cash), and a cash supplement paid on behalf of the children in the family from TANF; Families with children with earnings, representing those families with adult TANF recipients who had earnings; Families with children without earnings, representing families with adult TANF recipients who had no earnings and families without adult recipients (other than those with parents receiving SSI). TANF benefit amounts for these three categories were totaled, and federal TANF cash assistance spending was then allocated among the three population categories based on their shares of total cash assistance benefits from the administrative data files. Appendix C. Detailed Program Tables The following three tables provide specific information about programs included in this report. Programs are organized by category and listed within categories according to their Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number. (Program fact sheets in Appendix D are presented in the same sequence.)  Table C-1 shows obligations (or another measure of spending, as noted) for each program from FY2008 through FY2013. ARRA amounts are included in the totals for each program, and are also shown in separate columns. The table also indicates the federal administering agency for each program.  Table C-2 identifies, for each program, the general target population and the concept(s) used to determine individual income eligibility and (if relevant) the concept used to target federal resources broadly based on need. The table indicates the general concept used but not the specific application. For example, the table might indicate that federal poverty guidelines (FPG) are used as a concept in determining income eligibility for a particular program, but it does not indicate the specific percent of FPG that is used. Likewise, the table might show that a program uses formula allocation factors to direct federal resources toward areas with the greatest need, but it does not identify the specific factors or their weighting. Readers are referred to the fact sheets in Appendix D , relevant CRS reports, or the statutes themselves for these details.  Table C-3 shows the type of federal assistance provided (typically formula grants, competitive or discretionary grants, or direct benefits) and the immediate recipients of this assistance. As noted in the table, \"immediate\" recipient refers to the level of government or the organization that directly receives the federal grant or award. Many programs require that funds be further distributed (by formula or other criteria) to other units of government or organizations. For example, federal grants may be awarded by formula to states, but states are then required to subaward these funds to local governments or other entities. This table only shows the \"immediate\" grantee. The table also indicates whether a program has provisions for participation by U.S. territories or residents or organizations located within the territories. The specific details of these provisions are not provided in the table; readers are referred to statutory language or the federal agency that administers the program for this information. Appendix D. Program Fact Sheets The following fact sheets provide brief information about each program included in this report's analysis. Efforts were made to present the information in a relatively consistent manner; however, the programs are sufficiently different that the fact sheets vary in scope and level of detail. Readers should note that the number of programs included in this report is not necessarily meaningful. While fact sheets are presented for 87 \"programs,\" some could have been characterized as more than one program and others could have been consolidated.  For each program, the following information is provided: Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number(s); statutory and regulatory citations; the name of the federal administering agency and (where relevant) the specific office within that agency; the program's purpose; the type of benefit or service provided; criteria used to determine individual eligibility; the form and recipient of federal assistance (note that \"state\" includes the District of Columbia); the allocation formula used if relevant; any matching or related nonfederal spending requirements; the amount of new obligations in FY2013; the budgetary classification of the program's spending; some limited detail on program participation; and citations to relevant CRS reports. Information was derived from statutes, regulations, agency websites, and budget documents. Programs are organized by category, and presented in order of their CFDA number. (Note that some programs have multiple CFDA numbers; they may not necessarily be inclusive of all CFDA numbers associated with a particular program.) Readers should note that participation data are provided to give a sense of scope for each program; however, these data use different time periods and units of measurement and therefore are not consistent from one program to another. They should not be totaled or compared. Only selected information is included in these fact sheets. Programs are generally described as they existed in FY2013, with references to major enacted changes that are effective in subsequent years. Certain programs are no longer funded and are described as they existed in their final year. For complete information about a particular program of interest, readers are referred to the legal citations provided, the federal administering agency, or the identified CRS report(s).  The following table provides a list of programs and page numbers, for easier reference to individual program fact sheets.

CRS report: CRS Report RL31269, Refugee Admissions and Resettlement Policy , by [author name scrubbed]. State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (CFDA #93.767) Authority: Statute: Title XXI of the Social Security Act, established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ), reauthorized by the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA, P.L. 111-3 ), and most recently extended through FY2015 by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended); 42 U.S.C. 1397aa-mm. Regulations: 42 C.F.R. Part 457. Federal administering agency: Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Purpose of program: To provide health coverage to uninsured, low-income children in an effective and efficient manner that is coordinated with other sources of health benefits coverage for children. Benefit/service: Health care coverage is available through expansion of a state's existing Medicaid program, creation of a separate CHIP program, or a combination of both approaches where the state operates a CHIP Medicaid expansion and one or more separate CHIP programs concurrently. States that use the CHIP Medicaid expansion option must provide the full range of mandatory Medicaid benefits as well as all optional services specified in their state Medicaid plans. Alternatively, states may enroll CHIP Medicaid expansion children in Alternative Benefit Plans, which must include the same \"essential health benefits\" provided in plans available through the health insurance exchanges established under the ACA. All CHIP Medicaid expansion children are entitled to Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) coverage, which effectively eliminates any state-defined limits on the amount, duration, and scope of any benefit listed in Medicaid statute. CHIP Medicaid expansion programs must follow Medicaid's cost-sharing rules which generally exempt children from program participation fees and service-related cost-sharing. In general, for separate CHIP programs under which the majority of children are enrolled, states may offer one of three benefit options. As one option, states may elect to provide one of the following \"benchmark\" benefit packages: (1) the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider plan offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), (2) the health coverage that is offered and generally available to state employees, and (3) the health coverage that is offered by a health maintenance organization (HMO) with the largest commercial (non-Medicaid) enrollment in the state. As a second option, states may elect to offer \"benchmark-equivalent\" coverage with the same actuarial value as one of the benchmark packages listed above. As a third option, states may elect to offer \"Secretary-approved\" coverage for which benefits are appropriate for the target population. States with separate CHIP programs may vary cost-sharing requirements by family income, but the total annual aggregate cost-sharing (including premiums, copayments, and similar charges) for a family may not exceed 5% of total income in a year, and certain services such as preventive care are exempt from cost-sharing. Under certain conditions, states may also provide premium assistance for health insurance offered through private insurance arrangements for Medicaid children (including CHIP children) and their parents. States may seek CMS approval to waive many of the basic benefit rules described above to conduct demonstration projects under the Section 1115 authority that test alternative methods of meeting the overall purpose of CHIP.  Individual eligibility criteria: Target populations are defined by states within federal parameters. Children must be under age 19, lack health insurance, and not be qualified for regular Medicaid. States may set the upper income limit for targeted children at up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines or 50 percentage points above the applicable pre-CHIP (1997) Medicaid income level. States may seek federal approval to serve higher-income children. States also may cover pregnant women who lack health insurance and meet specified income thresholds. The ACA requires states to maintain CHIP child eligibility standards (as of March 23, 2010) through September 30, 2019, as a condition for receiving payments under Medicaid. Beginning January 1, 2014, in determining CHIP eligibility, states must use modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) income counting rules, which include a standard 5% income disregard. Also beginning January 1, 2014, states are required to transition CHIP children ages 6 through 18 in families with MAGI income less than 133% of federal poverty guidelines to Medicaid. Form and recipient of federal assistance: Formula grants to states. Allows participation by territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Allocation formula: The national appropriation amount is set in statute and is the overall annual ceiling on federal funds available for CHIP in a fiscal year. The law calculates allotment amounts for each state for the federal share of their CHIP expenditures, which they will receive unless the national appropriation is inadequate. The allotment formula is based primarily on states' past and/or projected federal CHIP spending (depending on the year) increased by a growth factor. Annual allotments are available for two years, with unspent funds available for redistribution to shortfall states.  Matching or related requirements: State expenditures are matched at an \"enhanced\" federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP). The E-FMAP for CHIP lowers the state's share of CHIP expenditures by 30% compared to the regular Medicaid FMAP. The CHIP E-FMAP rate is subject to a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. From FY2016 through FY2019, the ACA increases the E-FMAP rate by 23 percentage points (not to exceed 100%) for most CHIP expenditures. This will increase the statutory range of the E-FMAP rate to 88% through 100%. New obligations (FY2013) : $9,357 million. Budgetary classification: Mandatory (capped entitlement to states). Participation data (most recent available) : During FY2013, the total number of children ever enrolled during the year was 8,130,793; and the total number of adults ever enrolled during the year was 219,473.

Voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit\u2014Low-Income Subsidy (CFDA #93.770) Authority: Statute: Part D of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, established by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-173 ); 42 U.S.C. 1395w-101-152. Regulations: 42 C.F.R. Part 423. Federal administering agency: Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and Social Security Administration. Purpose of program: To provide low-income seniors and people with disabilities with comprehensive prescription drug benefits. Benefit/service: Prescription drug coverage with reduced premiums, copayments and other out-of-pocket expenses.  Individual eligibility criteria: Individuals with incomes below 150% of federal poverty guidelines and limited resources are eligible for subsidized prescription drug coverage. Those with incomes no higher than 135% of federal poverty guidelines receive the highest level of subsidy. Certain individuals are automatically eligible: those also eligible for Medicaid (i.e., \"dual eligibles\"); Medicare Savings Program recipients; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients.  Form and recipient of federal assistance: Contracts with participating prescription drug plans; payments are made to plans for the monthly premiums, deductibles and coverage gap expenses of low-income subsidy beneficiaries. Allocation formula: Not applicable. Matching or related requirements: Not applicable. New obligations (FY2013) : $22,400 million (aggregate reimbursements under Low-Income Subsidy in calendar year 2013). Budgetary classification: Mandatory (entitlement to individuals). Participation data (most recent available) : In calendar year 2013, 11.5 million beneficiaries received low-income subsidies.

Medicaid (CFDA #93.778) Authority: Statute: Title XIX of the Social Security Act, established by the Social Security Amendments of 1965 (P.L. 89-97); 42 U.S.C. 1396 to 1396w-5. Regulations: 42 C.F.R. Parts 430-456. Federal administering agency: Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Purpose of program: To provide medical assistance to families with dependent children and aged, blind or disabled individuals who have insufficient income and resources to afford necessary medical care, and to provide rehabilitation and other services to help such families and individuals achieve independence and self-care. Benefit/service: Federal law provides two primary benefit packages for state Medicaid programs: traditional benefits and alternative benefit plans (ABPs). In addition, states can use waiver authority (for example, under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act) to tailor benefit packages to specified Medicaid enrollee groups. Under the traditional Medicaid benefits package, federal law requires states to cover certain services; other services may be offered at state option. Examples of mandatory services for most eligibility groups include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, services provided by qualified federal health centers and free-standing birth clinics, laboratory and x-ray services, physician services, pregnancy-related services, tobacco cessation services for pregnant women, family planning, non-emergency transportation, nursing facility services for individuals 21 and older, and home health care for those entitled to nursing home care. Examples of optional services provided for most eligibility groups in many states include prescription drugs, physician-directed clinic services, other licensed practitioners (e.g., optometrists, podiatrists, psychologists), inpatient psychiatric care for the elderly and individuals under age 21, nursing facility services for individuals under age 21, physical therapy, and prosthetic devices. As an alternative to traditional benefits, states have the option to provide alternative benefit plans (ABPs) to state-specified groups. ABPs may cover fewer benefits than traditional Medicaid, but must cover at least the 10 \"essential health benefits\" required of plans in the health insurance exchanges established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Under both traditional benefits and ABPs, most Medicaid children under age 21 are entitled to Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services, which include well-child visits, immunizations, screening services at regular intervals, and medical care that is necessary to correct or ameliorate identified conditions. Beginning January 1, 2014, states that implement the ACA Medicaid expansion must provide ABPs to the newly eligible enrollees (with exceptions for special-needs subgroups). Individual eligibility criteria: Individuals must meet financial (i.e., income and sometimes resource) and nonfinancial (i.e., categorical) requirements. Federal law defines more than 50 potentially eligible population groups; some groups are mandatory (all states must cover them) and others are optional (states may cover them at their discretion). In some cases, income eligibility standards are tied directly to specified percentages of the federal poverty guidelines. For example, Medicaid mandatory coverage groups include pregnant women and children under age 6 with family incomes at or below 133% of poverty; children ages 6-18 with family incomes at or below 133% of poverty; certain parents and children in working families who are entitled to Medicaid for at least 6 months and up to 12 months if their income does not exceed 185% of poverty (i.e., Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA)); individuals who qualify for Medicare Part A whose incomes do not exceed 100% of poverty (Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs)); and individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A with incomes between 100% and 120% of poverty (Specified Low-Income Beneficiaries (SLMs)). Mandatory groups also include families who qualify via rules applicable to the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program; also, families who lose Medicaid as a result of increased spousal support or earned income may receive TMA for four months. Medicaid optional groups with income eligibility standards tied directly to specified percentages of the federal poverty guidelines include pregnant women and infants with incomes between 133% and 185% of poverty; CHIP-financed targeted low-income children; disabled and elderly (age 65+) individuals with incomes up to 100% of poverty; disabled working individuals whose family income does not exceed 250% of poverty; and individuals who would be QMBs except that their incomes are between 120% and 135% of poverty (i.e., Qualifying Individuals (QI-1s)). Beginning January 1, 2014, the ACA required states to expand Medicaid eligibility to include most nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty guidelines (effectively 138% with the 5% income disregard). However, in the June 28, 2012, decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , the Supreme Court held that the federal government cannot terminate current Medicaid program federal matching funds if a state does not expand its Medicaid program. The U.S. Supreme Court decision effectively made the ACA Medicaid expansion optional. The ACA also required states to transition to a new income counting rule based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) for most non-aged eligibility groups beginning January 1, 2014. Form and recipient of federal assistance: Partial reimbursement to states of eligible expenditures, with no cap on federal spending. Allows participation by territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Allocation formula: Payments to states are based on their eligible expenditures and the applicable FMAP (see below). Matching or related requirements: The federal share of expenditures on Medicaid services is called the federal medical assistance payment (FMAP) and is inversely related to a state's per capita income. The FMAP is higher for states with lower per capita income relative to the national average and vice versa for states with higher per capita income. The FMAP ranges from a statutory low of 50% to a statutory high of 83%. Medicaid administrative expenditures are generally matched at a 50% rate, with certain exceptions. For FY2014 through FY2016, states receive a special 100% FMAP rate for the cost of individuals newly eligible for Medicaid due to the ACA expansion; after 2016, this FMAP phases down to a rate of 90% in 2020 and thereafter. New obligations (FY2013) : $286,920 million. Budgetary classification: Mandatory (open-ended entitlement to states). Participation data (most recent available) : During FY2013, an average of 57.4 million individuals were enrolled in Medicaid each month (including 27.9 million children); and a total of 72.8 million individuals were enrolled during the year (including 35 million children).

Services are provided without charge for individuals whose incomes are below federal poverty guidelines and are provided on a sliding fee scale basis for those whose incomes exceed federal poverty guidelines. Individual eligibility criteria: Individuals and families with HIV disease. Specific clinical and income eligibility criteria are set by states.  Form and recipient of federal assistance: Formula grants to eligible metropolitan areas, \"transitional grant\" areas, and to states and territories; competitive supplemental grants are awarded based on need. Competitive grants are made to qualified health centers, family planning clinics, hemophilia centers, rural health clinics, Indian Health Service facilities and certain other health facilities and organizations; public and private nonprofit organizations; and dental schools. Allows participation by territories (American Samoa, Guam, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Allocation formula: Funds are allocated on the basis of number of living HIV and AIDS cases. Matching or related requirements: Any state with more than 1% of the nation's confirmed cases of HIV/AIDS must provide a nonfederal match equal to $1 for every federal $5 in the first year of payments under the grant, $1 for every federal $4 in the second year, $1 for every federal $3 in the third year, and $1 for every federal $2 in the fourth and fifth years of the grant. New obligations (FY2013) : $2,220 million.  Budgetary classification: Discretionary.

Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection (CFDA #93.919) Authority: Statute: Title XV of the Public Health Service Act, established by the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-354 ) and most recently reauthorized by the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-18 ); 42 U.S.C. 300k. Regulations: no formal program-specific regulations. Federal administering agency: Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. Purpose of program: To provide low-income, uninsured, and underserved women access to timely breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnostic services. Benefit/service: Clinical breast examinations, mammograms, Pap tests, pelvic examinations, diagnostic testing if results are abnormal, and referrals to treatment. No fees for services may be charged for women with incomes below 100% of federal poverty guidelines. (Under the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000, P.L. 106-354 , women who are screened through the CDC program and found to have cancer are an optional Medicaid coverage group, which means that states may offer them medical services through their Medicaid programs.) Individual eligibility criteria: States must give priority to low-income women. CDC defines the eligible population as uninsured and underinsured women with income at or below 250% of federal poverty guidelines, aged 21-64 for cervical screening and 40-64 for breast screening.  Form and recipient of federal assistance: Competitive grants to states, which enter into grants and contracts with public and private nonprofit entities. Allows participation by territories (Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau) and Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Allocation formula: Not applicable. Matching or related requirements: A nonfederal match, in cash or in-kind, of $1 for every federal $3 is required. Programs must also maintain their previous level of effort before additional resources will be considered toward the matching requirement. New obligations (FY2013) : $197 million (appropriations). Budgetary classification: Discretionary.

Maternal and Child Health Block Grant (CFDA #93.994) Authority: Statute: Title V of the Social Security Act, enacted in 1935 and converted into a block grant by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 ( P.L. 97-35 ); 42 U.S.C. 701 to 709. Regulations: 45 C.F.R. Part 96. Federal administering agency: Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Purpose of program: To improve the health of all mothers and children consistent with applicable health status goals and national health objectives established by the Secretary of HHS. Benefit/service: Preventive and primary health care services for women, infants and children, including children with special health care needs. Within broad federal requirements, states determine the actual services provided under the block grant. Services funded by the block grant may include prenatal care, well-child care, dental care, immunization, family planning, and vision and hearing screening services. They may also include inpatient services for children with special health care needs, screening services for lead-based poisoning, and counseling services for parents of sudden infant death syndrome victims. Funds may not be used for inpatient services, other than for children with special health care needs, high-risk pregnant women, and infants (unless approved by the Secretary of HHS). States may not use the block grant funds to provide cash payments to recipients of health services. Individual eligibility criteria: Defined by the states. Federal law emphasizes services to low-income mothers and children, defined as those with income at or below the federal poverty guidelines.  Form and recipient of federal assistance: Formula grants to states. Allows participation by specified territories (Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Palau). Allocation formula: Funds are allocated among states based on two factors: the amount awarded to each state in 1983 under previous programs that were consolidated into the block grant; and each state's relative share of low-income children. Matching or related requirements: States must provide $3 for every $4 in federal funding received. States must maintain their level of spending from state funds in 1989 on maternal and child health services. New obligations (FY2013) : $605 million. Budgetary classification: Discretionary.

Regulations: 45 C.F.R. Parts 260-270.  Federal administering agency: Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Family Assistance. Purpose of program: To increase state flexibility in operating programs designed to (a) provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives; (b) end the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage; (c) prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; and (d) encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. Benefit/service: Benefits or services reasonably calculated to achieve the four statutory goals above, and certain \"grandfathered\" activities conducted under predecessor program (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) prior to enactment of P.L. 104-193 . (Roughly two-thirds of total TANF federal and state expenditures in FY2012 and FY2013 were for noncash services, including child care, work activities, child welfare services, and various social services directed toward the statutory goals of family formation and reduced nonmarital pregnancies.) Cash assistance benefit levels are defined by the individual states. Individual eligibility criteria: Families with dependent children as determined eligible under income and asset criteria defined by the states.  Form of assistance: Formula grants to states; competitive awards to public and private entities for healthy marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood grants. Allows participation by territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and federally recognized Indian tribes and certain Alaskan Native organizations. Allocation formula: The basic TANF block grant is allocated among states according to their peak expenditures for pre-TANF programs during the FY1992-FY1995 period. TANF contingency funds are available to states that meet a test of economic \"need\" and increase spending from their own funds above what they spent in FY1994 on cash, emergency assistance, and job training in TANF's predecessor programs.  Matching or related requirements: None. The basic TANF block grant requires states to maintain spending from their own funds on TANF or TANF-related activities for needy families with children equal to 75% of what was spent from state funds in FY1994 under TANF's predecessor programs. This maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement increases to 80% of FY1994 spending for states that fail to meet TANF work participation requirements. For the TANF contingency fund, a higher state spending requirement applies (100% of the historic level). New obligations (FY2013) : $17,332 million, broken down as follows, with estimates based on states' reporting of expenditures: $6,263 million (cash assistance); $9,491 million (social services); and $1,579 million (employment and training). (Includes obligations under the TANF block grant, supplemental grants, territories and tribal grants, contingency funds, healthy marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood grants. Note that in FY2009 and FY2010, states could draw down additional funds from the TANF Emergency Contingency Fund, created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.) Budgetary classification: Mandatory (capped entitlement to states). Participation data (most recent available) : In FY2013, a monthly average of 1.8 million families, composed of 4.1 million recipients (including 3.1 million children), received TANF- or MOE-funded cash assistance.

Regulations: 34 C.F.R. Part 200. Federal administering agency: Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Student Achievement and School Accountability Programs. Purpose of program: To ensure that all children have a fair, equal and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging state academic achievement standards and state academic assessments. Benefit/service: Additional academic support and learning opportunities for students in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 to help low-achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects. Individual eligibility criteria: Within local educational agencies (LEAs), funds are allocated to school attendance areas and schools in rank order based on their number of children from low-income families. Schools in which at least 40% of children are poor may operate schoolwide programs that serve all children. Otherwise, schools must focus services on children who are failing or most at risk of failing state academic standards. Form and recipient of federal assistance: Formula grants to LEAs. Allows participation by territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands). Allocation formula: Portions of available annual funds are allocated under four different formulas\u2014Basic, Concentration, Targeted, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG)\u2014although funds are then combined and used for the same purposes by recipient LEAs. Although the allocation formulas have several distinctive elements, the primary factors used in all four formulas are an eligible child count and an expenditure factor. The eligible child count includes children aged 5-17: (a) in poor families; (b) in institutions for neglected or delinquent children or in foster homes; and (c) in families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families payments above the poverty level. Each element of the population factor is updated annually. The expenditure factor is the state average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education (subject to a minimum of 80% and maximum of 120% of the national average, further multiplied by 0.40), and is the same for all LEAs in the same state. Both the Targeted and EFIG formulas include weighting schemes to increase aid to LEAs with the highest numbers or concentrations of eligible children. The EFIG formula also includes an effort factor, based on average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education compared to personal income per capita for each state compared to the nation as a whole, and an equity factor, based on variations in average per pupil expenditures among the LEAs in each state. Each formula has a hold-harmless provision (no LEA may receive less than 85%-95% of its previous year grant, depending on the LEA's poverty level and whether the LEA continues to meet the formula's eligibility threshold). All four formulas have state minimum grant provisions. Matching or related requirements: Three requirements apply to total LEA grants under all four formulas: (1) maintenance of effort : recipient LEAs must provide, from state and local sources, a level of funding (either aggregate or per pupil) in the preceding year that is at least 90% as high as in the second preceding year; (2) funds must supplement and not supplant state and local funds that would otherwise be available for the education of disadvantaged pupils in participating schools; and (3) comparability: services provided with state and local funds in schools participating in Title I-A must be comparable to those in non-Title I-A schools of the same LEA. New obligations (FY2013) : $13,757 million. Budgetary classification: Discretionary. Participation data (most recent available) : For school year 2011-2012, about 23 million public and private school students were served (of which about 172,000 or 0.7% were served in private schools).
