    "content": "SECTION 1. YELLOWSTONE BUFFALO PRESERVATION.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Yellowstone \nBuffalo Preservation Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More than any other animal, the American buffalo (Bison \n        bison) is a wildlife icon of the United States. The American \n        buffalo is the symbol that represents the Department of the \n        Interior. The American buffalo is profoundly significant to \n        Native American cultures and, perhaps more than any other \n        wildlife species, has influenced our history.\n            (2) The American buffalo is still under assault, as it was \n        in the late 19th Century when it was nearly exterminated. At \n        the end of the great slaughter, in which tens of millions of \n        buffalo were killed, only a few hundred wild buffalo remained \n        in the Nation and all were located in Yellowstone National \n        Park. Due to poaching, their numbers were reduced to 25 by the \n        year 1900.\n            (3) The offspring of the 25 survivors comprise the \n        Yellowstone buffalo herd and are the only wild, free-roaming \n        American buffalo to continuously occupy their native habitat in \n        the United States.\n            (4) The Yellowstone buffalo herd is genetically unique. \n        Unlike captive ranched buffalo, which are now relatively \n        common, the Yellowstone buffalo herd has never interbred with \n        cattle and has retained its wild character.\n            (5) Because the Park lacks extensive low-elevation winter \n        habitat that provides bison and elk with access to winter \n        forage, wildlife migrate from the high elevation plateau of \n        Yellowstone National Park to lower elevation habitat adjacent \n        to the Park in winter and spring.\n            (6) The Yellowstone buffalo herd was exposed to the \n        bacterium Brucella abortus, which can cause the disease \n        brucellosis, in 1917. Brucellosis is only transmitted through \n        animal ingestion of contaminated reproductive products. \n        Brucellosis can cause abortions in infected animals, but only \n        infectious females who have the bacteria in their reproductive \n        system represent any potential threat of transmission. The risk \n        of transmission between wild buffalo and cattle was deemed low \n        in a 1992 General Accounting Office report, and again in a 1998 \n        National Research Council study. In fact, there has never been \n        a confirmed incidence of brucellosis transmission in the wild \n        from buffalo to cattle. Buffalo with brucellosis and cattle \n        have grazed together for over 50 years in the Jackson Hole area \n        south of Yellowstone without any incident of disease \n        transmission. Despite these facts, the National Park Service, \n        the United States Forest Service, and the State of Montana \n        Department of Livestock haze, capture, and kill members of the \n        Yellowstone buffalo herd in an attempt to keep them unnaturally \n        confined within Yellowstone National Park. At the same time, \n        approximately 13,000 Yellowstone elk, some of which also harbor \n        brucellosis, are allowed unfettered access to Federal land \n        outside the Park. Since 1984, nearly 3,700 American buffalo \n        have been killed in Montana as a result of this policy. In the \n        winter of 2002-2003, 244 buffalo were killed by the Federal and \n        State agencies, including 231 buffalo which were captured and \n        slaughtered by the National Park Service.\n            (7) The key lower elevation habitat needed by American \n        buffalo is primarily on Gallatin National Forest lands adjacent \n        to the north and west sides of the Park. On the north side, \n        taxpayers spent $13,000,000 in 1999 for a private-Federal land \n        exchange intended to make low elevation habitat adjacent to the \n        Yellowstone River accessible to the Yellowstone buffalo herd \n        and other wildlife. The land exchange has not yet been \n        finalized by Federal agencies and therefore key habitat is not \n        available to the Yellowstone buffalo herd.\n            (8) On the west side of the Park, the Horse Butte peninsula \n        provides prime wildlife habitat for grizzly bears, trumpeter \n        swans, bald eagles, wolves, and buffalo. The peninsula \n        comprises approximately 10,000 acres of primarily Gallatin \n        National Forest Federal lands extending into Hebgen Lake.\n            (9) National Park Service lands have been set aside for the \n        conservation of resources and values and for the enjoyment and \n        use of all citizens. The Federal lands adjacent to the Park \n        represent some of the most valuable and important wildlife \n        habitat in the lower forty-eight states. They are integrally \n        connected to the health of wildlife residing seasonally in our \n        Nation's oldest national park. Together, the Park and the \n        adjacent Federal lands provide some of our Nation's richest \n        opportunities for recreation, wildlife viewing, family camping, \n        wildlife conservation, fishing, and other recreational and \n        sporting activities. These Federal lands should be \n        preferentially managed to sustain this rich and diverse \n        wildlife resource and to provide the public with enjoyment of \n        this National treasure.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \nprotection of the Yellowstone buffalo herd by allowing the Yellowstone \nbuffalo herd to freely roam Federal lands outside of the Park. The \nFederal lands that are affected by this Act are those within the Park \nand adjacent to it on the north and west boundaries as indicated by \nzones 2 and 3 on the Modified Preferred Alternative Map on page 181 of \nthe 2000 Bison Management Plan for the State of Montana and Yellowstone \nNational Park Final Environmental Impact Statement.\n    (d) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, the following \ndefinitions apply:\n            (1) Hazing.--The term ``hazing'' means any individual \n        effort to drive away, obstruct, chase, scare, or deter natural \n        movements of wildlife, including hazing efforts carried out on \n        foot or horseback or efforts aided by machinery, aircraft, or \n        any type of noise-making device.\n            (2) Individual.--The term ``individual'' means any person \n        representing a State or Federal Government.\n            (3) Park.--The term ``Park'' means Yellowstone National \n        Park.\n            (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior.\n            (5) Yellowstone buffalo herd.--The term ``Yellowstone \n        buffalo herd'' means the wild, free roaming, unfenced buffalo \n        living primarily within Yellowstone National Park.\n    (e) Prohibited Acts; Criminal Penalties.--\n            (1) Prohibited acts.--No individual may kill, haze, or \n        capture any buffalo on Federal land or land held under Federal \n        conservation easements or use any form of bait to lure buffalo \n        from any Federal land onto private land until the duties under \n        subsection (f) are carried out.\n            (2) Penalties.--\n                    (A) Initial violation.--Any individual found to be \n                in violation of paragraph (1) for the first time shall \n                be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more \n                than 1 year or both.\n                    (B) Subsequent violations.--Any individual found to \n                be in violation of paragraph (1) after the first such \n                finding shall be fined not more than $10,000 or \n                imprisoned not more than 2 years or both.\n                    (C) Reward.--One half of any fine collected under \n                this subsection or $2,500, whichever is less, shall be \n                paid to any person or persons giving information which \n                leads to conviction of a violation of this subsection.\n                    (D) Exception.--This subsection shall not apply to \n                a person that is found to have been hazing a buffalo if \n                the person is physically endangered or private property \n                was damaged by a buffalo.\n    (f) Duties.--The Secretary and other appropriate Federal agencies \nshall ensure that the following is accomplished not later than 3 years \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act:\n            (1) The Yellowstone buffalo herd is allowed to freely roam \n        the Park and the Federal lands adjacent to Yellowstone National \n        Park on the north and west boundaries as indicated by zones 2 \n        and 3 on the Modified Preferred Alternative Map on page 181 of \n        the 2000 Bison Management Plan for the State of Montana and \n        Yellowstone National Park Final Environmental Impact Statement \n        without being hazed. These lands shall be made available \n        preferentially for buffalo and wildlife use.\n            (2) Management authority of the Yellowstone buffalo herd \n        within the Park is under the sole jurisdiction of the National \n        Park Service.\n            (3) The land exchange described in section 1(b)(7) with the \n        private property owner has been finalized, as set forth in the \n        agreement executed in 1999, so that the Yellowstone buffalo \n        herd may freely roam the lands described in paragraph (1).\n            (4) The National Park Service has disassembled the Stephens \n        Creek Buffalo Capture Facility.\n            (5) The Secretary has made every effort practicable to \n        allow the Yellowstone buffalo herd to freely roam Federal lands \n        through incentives and cooperative efforts with adjacent \n        private landowners, including through acquisition, easement, \n        cattle vaccination, and landowner agreement pertaining to \n        temporal and spatial separation of livestock from the \n        Yellowstone buffalo herd."
