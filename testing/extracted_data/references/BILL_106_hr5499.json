FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Coastal States and many island States and territories \n        are vulnerable to the hazards of windstorms. All Midwest, \n        Southern, and Mid-Atlantic States are vulnerable to the hazards \n        of tornadoes and thunderstorms and increased building activity \n        is occurring in high-risk areas such as the seashore and \n        ``tornado alley''.\n            (2) Hurricanes cause enormous loss of life, injury, \n        destruction of property, and economic and social disruption, as \n        evidenced by the 56 deaths and $6,000,000,000 in property \n        damage in 1999 from Hurricane Floyd. From 1990 to 1999 \n        hurricanes caused an average of 14 deaths and $4,970,000,000 in \n        property losses annually while tornadoes and other windstorms \n        caused over 58 deaths and $871,000,000 in property losses \n        annually.\n            (3) Improved windstorm hazard reduction measures, \n        including--\n                    (A) cost-effective and affordable design and \n                construction methods and practices;\n                    (B) informed land use decisions;\n                    (C) impact prediction methodologies and early \n                warning systems; and\n                    (D) public education and involvement programs,\n        have the potential over the next 10 years to reduce these \n        losses. Losses will increase if steps are not taken to help \n        communities reduce their vulnerability.\n            (4) Wind engineering research needs to address both \n        improving new structures and retrofitting existing ones.\n            (5) There is an appropriate role for the Federal Government \n        in the collection, preparation, coordination, and dissemination \n        of windstorm hazards reduction information in order to protect \n        public health and safety and in increasing public awareness of \n        the dangers of windstorms and of affordable steps homeowners \n        can take to preserve life and property. Improved mechanisms are \n        needed to translate existing information and research findings \n        into usable, state-of-the-art specifications, criteria, and \n        cost-effective practices.\n            (6) An effective Federal program in windstorm hazard \n        reduction will require interagency coordination, input from \n        individuals and institutions outside the Federal Government who \n        are expert in the sciences of natural hazards reduction and in \n        the practical application of mitigation measures, and improved \n        mechanisms for the transfer of new knowledge to State and local \n        officials, to homeowners, and to the design and construction \n        industry. Tax credits are an appropriate means of helping \n        homeowners apply mitigation measures.\n            (7) Windstorms are a worldwide problem, and international \n        cooperation is desirable for mutual learning and mitigation.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Director'' means the Director of the Office \n        of Science and Technology Policy.\n            (2) The term ``State'' means each of the States of the \n        United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of \n        Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American \n        Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and \n        any other territory or possession of the United States.\n            (3) The term ``windstorm'' means any storm with a damaging \n        or destructive wind component, such as a hurricane, tropical \n        storm, tornado, or thunderstorm.\n\nSEC. 4.
