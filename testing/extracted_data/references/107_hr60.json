FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Despite Federal efforts to increase uniformity in \n        voting procedures for elections for Federal office, there \n        remains much variation in such procedures among the States.\n            (2) A major goal of the National Voter Registration Act of \n        1993 (commonly known as the ``Motor-Voter Act'') was the \n        standardization of voter registration procedures for elections \n        for Federal office to prevent voter fraud and provide an \n        accurate list of eligible voters.\n            (3) Under the provisions of the Uniformed and Overseas \n        Citizens Absentee Voting Act, absent uniformed services voters \n        and overseas voters can vote by absentee ballot in elections \n        for Federal office and, if a State does not provide an official \n        State absentee ballot in response to a timely request, can \n        write in the names of candidates on a Federal write-in absentee \n        ballot.\n            (4) In North Dakota and in some counties in Wisconsin, \n        individuals may vote without registering.\n            (5) Individuals in Idaho, New Hampshire, Maine, Minnesota, \n        Wisconsin, and Wyoming may register to vote on the day of the \n        election.\n            (6) The duration of the residency requirement for voter \n        registration varies from State to State from 1 to 30 days.\n            (7) In 7 States disability or illness does not provide \n        sufficient grounds for registering as an absentee voter, and in \n        4 States disability or illness does not provide sufficient \n        grounds for voting as an absentee.\n            (8) A few States allow any citizen who is out of the United \n        States or the State to register as an absentee voter.\n            (9) At least 7 different types of voting equipment are used \n        to carry out Presidential elections throughout the United \n        States, and the type of equipment used is determined on the \n        county level.\n            (10) The opening time for polling places in Federal \n        elections varies from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and the closing \n        time for such polling places varies from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 \n        p.m..\n\nSEC. 3.
