    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nArticle 1.5 (commencing with Section 6033) is added to Chapter 5 of Title 7 of Part 3 of the Penal Code, to read:\nArticle  1.5. Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2015\n6033.\nThis article shall be known, and may be cited, as the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2015.\n6033.2.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) The Legislature is committed to reducing recidivism among criminal offenders, ensuring that local governments have adequate funding to achieve this goal, and facilitating the responsible implementation of the criminal justice policies contained in the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.\n(b) By enacting the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, the Legislature affirmed its commitment to justice reinvestment and stated that the purpose of justice reinvestment is to manage criminal justice populations more cost effectively, generating savings that can be reinvested in evidence-based strategies that increase public safety while holding offenders accountable.\n(c) The 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety represents a significant shift of responsibilities. However, the quick and unanticipated nature of the passage of this legislation, in combination with broad county discretion in its implementation, offers a unique opportunity to identify best practices in community corrections and the impacts of correctional decentralization.\n(d) The 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety did not require counties to collect data on outcome measures, nor did it provide specific resources for data collection that if adequately funded and properly implemented would allow policymakers, researchers, stakeholders, and counties to take advantage of the historic opportunity to study and evaluate the changing felon population and the strategies and interventions that counties employ to reduce recidivism.\n(e) The Bureau of State Audits\u2019 September 2013 High Risk report identified the 2011 realignment of criminal justice responsibilities between the state and counties as a \u201chigh-risk\u201d policy, citing a lack of \u201creliable and meaningful realignment data to ensure [the state\u2019s] ability to effectively monitor progress toward achieving intended realignment goals.\u201d\n6033.4.\n(a) The Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2015, which is hereby established, shall be administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections for the purpose of establishing and implementing reporting systems to identify and expand programs that provide proven, evidence-based, local programming opportunities for the successful reintegration of offenders into society. The board shall award grants to assist counties with the creation or expansion of infrastructure that allows each county to consistently collect and report criminal justice information as required by Sections 6033.10 and 6033.12.\n(b) For purposes of this article, \u201cboard\u201d means the Board of State and Community Corrections.\n6033.6.\n(a) On or before June 1, 2015, each local community corrections partnership established pursuant to Section 1230 shall report to the board on the county\u2019s capacity to collect and report the data required by Sections 6033.10 and 6033.12. The report shall include a local plan that identifies the additional resources necessary for that county to consistently collect and report criminal justice information as required by Sections 6033.10 and 6033.12.\n(b) The board shall review each assessment submitted pursuant to subdivision (a) and shall prioritize and award grants pursuant to Section 6033.8.

Grant funds shall be used for programs that are identified in the local plan submitted pursuant to subdivision (a).\n(c) The board shall submit to the Legislature on or before June 15, 2015, a report detailing the estimated need, cost, and schedule for each county to consistently collect and report criminal justice information as required by Sections 6033.10 and 6033.12.
