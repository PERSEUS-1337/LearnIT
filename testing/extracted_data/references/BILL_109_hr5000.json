FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On July 22, 2004 the National Commission on Terrorist \n        Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9/11 \n        Commission) issued a report that included 41 specific \n        recommendations to help prevent future terrorist attacks, \n        including details of a global strategy and government \n        reorganization necessary to implement that strategy.\n            (2) One of the recommendations focused on the protections \n        of civil liberties. Specifically the following recommendation \n        was made: ``At this time of increased and consolidated \n        government authority, there should be a board within the \n        executive branch to oversee adherence to the guidelines we \n        recommend and the commitment the government makes to defend our \n        civil liberties.''.\n            (3) The report also states that ``the choice between \n        security and liberty is a false choice, as nothing is more \n        likely to endanger America's liberties than the success of a \n        terrorist attack at home. Our History has shown that the \n        insecurity threatens liberty at home. Yet if our liberties are \n        curtailed, we lose the values that we are struggling to \n        defend.''.\n            (4) On December 17, 2004, Public Law 108-458, the National \n        Intelligence Reform Act, was signed into law. This law created \n        a civil liberties board that does not have the authority \n        necessary to protect civil liberties.\n            (5) The establishment and adequate funding of a Privacy and \n        Civil Liberties Oversight Board was a crucial recommendation \n        made by the 9/11 Commission.\n            (6) In its Final Report on 9/11 Commission Recommendations, \n        the Commission noted ``very little urgency'' and \n        ``insufficient'' funding as it relates to the establishment of \n        the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\n            (7) While the President's budget submission for fiscal year \n        2006 included $750,000 for the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n        Oversight Board, the President's budget submission for fiscal \n        year 2007 does not contain a funding line for the Board.\n\nSEC. 3. MAKING THE PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OVERSIGHT BOARD \n              INDEPENDENT.\n\n    Section 1061(b) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \nAct of 2004 is amended by striking ``within the Executive Office of the \nPresident'' and inserting ``as an independent agency within the \nExecutive branch''.\n\nSEC. 4.

Three \n        members of the Board shall constitute a quorum.''.\n\nSEC. 5. SUBPOENA POWER FOR THE PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OVERSIGHT \n              BOARD.\n\n    Section 1061(d) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \nAct of 2004 is amended--\n            (1) so that subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) reads as \n        follows:\n                    ``(D) require, by subpoena issued at the direction \n                of a majority of the members of the Board, persons \n                (other than departments, agencies, and elements of the \n                executive branch) to produce any relevant information, \n                documents, reports, answers, records, accounts, papers, \n                and other documentary or testimonial evidence.''; and\n            (2) so that paragraph (2) reads as follows:\n            ``(2) Enforcement of subpoena.--In the case of contumacy or \n        failure to obey a subpoena issued under paragraph (1)(D), the \n        United States district court for the judicial district in which \n        the subpoenaed person resides, is served, or may be found may \n        issue an order requiring such person to produce the evidence \n        required by such subpoena.''.\n\nSEC. 6.
