FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) private sector business concerns, which are free to \n        respond to the private or public demands of the marketplace, \n        constitute the strength of the American economic system;\n            (2) competitive private sector enterprises are the most \n        productive, efficient, and effective sources of goods and \n        services;\n            (3) government competition with the private sector of the \n        economy is detrimental to all businesses and the American \n        economic system;\n            (4) government competition with the private sector of the \n        economy is at an unacceptably high level, both in scope and in \n        dollar volume;\n            (5) when a government engages in entrepreneurial activities \n        that are beyond its core mission and compete with the private \n        sector--\n                    (A) the focus and attention of the government are \n                diverted from executing the basic mission and work of \n                that government; and\n                    (B) those activities constitute unfair government \n                competition with the private sector;\n            (6) current laws and policies have failed to address \n        adequately the problem of government competition with the \n        private sector of the economy;\n            (7) the level of government competition with the private \n        sector, especially with small businesses, has been a priority \n        issue of each White House Conference on Small Business;\n            (8) reliance on the private sector is consistent with the \n        goals of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n        (Public Law 103-62);\n            (9) reliance on the private sector is necessary and \n        desirable for proper implementation of the Federal Workforce \n        Restructuring Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-226);\n            (10) it is in the public interest that the Federal \n        Government establish a consistent policy to rely on the private \n        sector of the economy to provide goods and services that are \n        necessary for or beneficial to the operation and management of \n        Federal Government agencies and to avoid Federal Government \n        competition with the private sector of the economy; and\n            (11) it is in the public interest for the private sector to \n        utilize employees who are adversely affected by conversions to \n        use of private sector entities for providing goods and services \n        on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\nSEC. 3. RELIANCE ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR.\n\n    (a) General Policy.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nexcept as provided in subsection (c), each agency shall procure from \nsources in the private sector all goods and services that are necessary \nfor or beneficial to the accomplishment of authorized functions of the \nagency.\n    (b) Prohibitions Regarding Transactions in Goods and Services.--\n            (1) Provision by government generally.--No agency may begin \n        or carry out any activity to provide any products or services \n        that can be provided by the private sector.\n            (2) Transactions between governmental entities.--No agency \n        may obtain any goods or services from or provide any goods or \n        services to any other governmental entity.\n    (c) Exceptions.--Subsections (a) and (b) do not apply to goods or \nservices necessary for or beneficial to the accomplishment of \nauthorized functions of an agency under the following conditions:\n            (1) Either--\n                    (A) the goods or services are inherently \n                governmental in nature within the meaning of section \n                6(b); or\n                    (B) the Director of the Office of Management and \n                Budget determines that the provision of the goods or \n                services is otherwise an inherently governmental \n                function.\n            (2) The head of the agency determines that the goods or \n        services should be produced, provided, or manufactured by the \n        Federal Government for reasons of national security.\n            (3) The Federal Government is determined to be the best \n        value source of the goods or services in accordance with \n        regulations prescribed pursuant to section 4(a)(2)(C).\n            (4) The private sector sources of the goods or services, or \n        the practices of such sources, are not adequate to satisfy the \n        agency's requirements.\n\nSEC. 4.
