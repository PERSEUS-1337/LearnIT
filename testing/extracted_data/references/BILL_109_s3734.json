FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) under section 1407 of title 28, United States Code \n        (enacted April 29, 1968), the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict \n        Litigation (in this section referred to as the ``Judicial \n        Panel''), a group of 7 Federal judges selected by the Chief \n        Justice of the United States, assists in the centralization of \n        civil actions which share common questions of fact filed in \n        more than 1 Federal judicial district nationwide;\n            (2) civil actions described under paragraph (1)--\n                    (A) often arise from mass single-action torts that \n                cause death and destruction in which the plaintiffs are \n                from many different States; and\n                    (B) often involve issues of critical importance to \n                the Nation, including information technology, \n                intellectual property, antitrust, contracts, and \n                products liability cases;\n            (3) the Judicial Panel--\n                    (A) identifies the 1 United States district court \n                (referred to in this section as the ``transferee \n                court'') best equipped at adjudicating pretrial \n                matters; and\n                    (B) after pretrial, remands individual civil \n                actions back to the district where the civil action was \n                originally filed unless that action has been previously \n                terminated;\n            (4)(A) for approximately 3 decades, the transferee court \n        often invoked a general venue statute that authorizes a \n        district court to transfer a civil action in the interest of \n        justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses;\n            (B) in effect, the transferee court simply transferred all \n        of the civil actions for trial to itself; and\n            (C) this process worked well because the transferee court \n        was well-versed in the facts and law of the centralized \n        litigation and the court could assist all parties to settle \n        when appropriate;\n            (5) in 1998, the United States Supreme Court held that the \n        plain language of section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, \n        requires the Judicial Panel to remand all civil actions for \n        trial back to the respective districts from which such actions \n        were originally referred;\n            (6) the absence of authority to transfer a centralized \n        civil action for trial hampers the Judicial Panel and \n        transferee judges in their ability to achieve the important \n        goals of section 1407 of that title promoting the just and \n        efficient conduct of multidistrict litigation;\n            (7) the Judicial Panel has inherent rulemaking authority to \n        promulgate procedural rules pertaining to multidistrict \n        litigation which the Judicial Panel has already exercised to \n        ensure that when a centralization occurs all civil actions of a \n        similar nature then filed and all later civil actions that may \n        be filed are sent to 1 district court;\n            (8) Congress has statutorily conferred the Judicial Panel \n        with rulemaking authority for the conduct of its business not \n        inconsistent with the United States Constitution, Acts of \n        Congress, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and\n            (9) in civil actions in which punitive damages are to be \n        imposed, individual courts, including transferee courts, must \n        ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and \n        proportionate to the amount of harm to plaintiffs and to the \n        amount of compensatory damages received.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the litigation \nsystem in the Nation to allow a Federal judge to whom a civil action is \ntransferred under section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, to \nretain jurisdiction over certain civil actions for trial to determine \nliability and compensatory and punitive damages, if appropriate, in \ncompliance with due process requirements.\n\nSEC. 3. MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION.\n\n    Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) in the third sentence of subsection (a), by inserting \n        ``or ordered transferred to the transferee or other district \n        under subsection (i)'' after ``terminated''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(i)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and except as provided in \nsubsection (j), any action transferred under this section by the panel \nmay be transferred for trial purposes, by the judge or judges of the \ntransferee district to whom the action was assigned, to the transferee \nor other district in the interest of justice and for the convenience of \nthe parties and witnesses.\n    ``(2) Any action transferred for trial purposes under paragraph (1) \nshall be remanded by the panel for the determination of compensatory \ndamages to the district court from which it was transferred, unless the \ncourt to which the action has been transferred for trial purposes also \nfinds, for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the \ninterests of justice, that the action should be retained for the \ndetermination of compensatory damages.''.\n\nSEC. 4. TECHNICAL AMENDMENT TO MULTIPARTY, MULTIFORM TRIAL JURISDICTION \n              ACT OF 2002.\n\n    Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, as amended by section \n3 of this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(j)(1) In actions transferred under this section when \njurisdiction is or could have been based, in whole or in part, on \nsection 1369 of this title, the transferee district court may, \nnotwithstanding any other provision of this section, retain actions so \ntransferred for the determination of liability and punitive damages. An \naction retained for the determination of liability shall be remanded to \nthe district court from which the action was transferred, or to the \nState court from which the action was removed, for the determination of \ndamages, other than punitive damages, unless the court finds, for the \nconvenience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice, \nthat the action should be retained for the determination of damages.\n    ``(2) Any remand under paragraph (1) shall not be effective until \n60 days after the transferee court has issued an order determining \nliability and has certified its intention to remand some or all of the \ntransferred actions for the determination of damages. An appeal with \nrespect to the liability determination and the choice of law \ndetermination of the transferee court may be taken during that 60-day \nperiod to the court of appeals with appellate jurisdiction over the \ntransferee court. In the event a party files such an appeal, the remand \nshall not be effective until the appeal has been finally disposed of. \nOnce the remand has become effective, the liability determination and \nthe choice of law determination shall not be subject to further review \nby appeal or otherwise.\n    ``(3) An appeal with respect to determination of punitive damages \nby the transferee court may be taken, during the 60-day period \nbeginning on the date the order making the determination is issued, to \nthe court of appeals with jurisdiction over the transferee court.\n    ``(4) Any decision under this subsection concerning remand for the \ndetermination of damages, other than punitive damages, shall not be \nreviewable by appeal or otherwise.\n    ``(5) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the authority of \nthe transferee court to transfer or dismiss an action on the ground of \ninconvenient forum.''.\n\nSEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    (a) Multidistrict Litigation.--The amendments made by section 3 \nshall apply to any civil action pending on or brought on or after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Technical Amendment.--The amendment made by section 4 shall be \neffective as if enacted in section 11020(b) of the Multiparty, \nMultiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-273; 116 \nStat. 1826 et seq.)."
