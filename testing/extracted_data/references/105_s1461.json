FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) millions of young people in America live in areas in \n        which drug use and violent and property crimes are pervasive;\n            (2) unfortunately, many of these same young people come \n        from single parent homes, or from environments in which there \n        is no responsible, caring adult supervision;\n            (3) all children and adolescents need caring adults in \n        their lives, and mentoring is an effective way to fill this \n        special need for at-risk children. The special bond of \n        commitment fostered by the mutual respect inherent in effective \n        mentoring can be the tie that binds a young person to a better \n        future;\n            (4) through a mentoring relationship, adult volunteers and \n        participating youth make a significant commitment of time and \n        energy to develop relationships devoted to personal, academic, \n        or career development and social, artistic, or athletic growth;\n            (5) rigorous independent studies have confirmed that \n        effective mentoring programs can significantly reduce and \n        prevent the use of alcohol and drugs by young people, improve \n        school attendance and performance, improve peer and family and \n        peer relationships, and reduce violent behavior;\n            (6) since the inception of the Federal JUMP program, dozens \n        of innovative, effective mentoring programs have received \n        funding grants;\n            (7) unfortunately, despite the recent growth in public and \n        private mentoring initiatives, it is reported that between \n        5,000,000 and 15,000,000 additional children in the United \n        States could benefit from being matched with a mentor; and\n            (8) although great strides have been made in reaching at-\n        risk youth since the inception of the JUMP program, millions of \n        vulnerable American children are not being reached, and without \n        an increased commitment to connect these young people to \n        responsible adult role models, our country risks losing an \n        entire generation to drugs, crime, and unproductive lives.\n\nSEC. 3. JUVENILE MENTORING GRANTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 288B of the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5667e-2) is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``The \n        Administrator shall'';\n            (2) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n            ``(2) are intended to achieve 1 or more of the following \n        goals:\n                    ``(A) Discourage at-risk youth from--\n                            ``(i) using illegal drugs and alcohol;\n                            ``(ii) engaging in violence;\n                            ``(iii) using guns and other dangerous \n                        weapons;\n                            ``(iv) engaging in other criminal and \n                        antisocial behavior; and\n                            ``(v) becoming involved in gangs.\n                    ``(B) Promote personal and social responsibility \n                among at-risk youth.\n                    ``(C) Increase at-risk youth's participation in, \n                and enhance the ability of those youth to benefit from, \n                elementary and secondary education.\n                    ``(D) Encourage at-risk youth participation in \n                community service and community activities.\n                    ``(E) Provide general guidance to at-risk youth.''; \n                and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Amount and Duration.--Each grant under this part shall be \nawarded in an amount not to exceed a total of $200,000 over a period of \nnot more than 3 years.\n    ``(c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, and \n2002 to carry out this part.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
