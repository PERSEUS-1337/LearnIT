    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Ocean and Coastal Observation System \nAct of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Ocean and coastal observations provide vital \n        information for protecting human lives and property from marine \n        hazards, predicting weather, improving ocean health and \n        providing for the protection and enjoyment of the resources of \n        the Nation's coasts, oceans, and Great Lakes.\n            (2) The continuing and potentially devastating threat posed \n        by tsunamis, hurricanes, storm surges, and other marine hazards \n        requires immediate implementation of strengthened observation \n        and data management systems to provide timely detection, \n        assessment, and warnings to the millions of people living in \n        coastal regions of the United States and throughout the world.\n            (3) The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States, \n        including the Great Lakes, is vital to the Nation's prosperity, \n        contributing over $117 billion to the national economy in 2000, \n        supporting jobs for more than 200 million Americans, and \n        supporting commercial and sport fisheries valued at more than \n        $50 billion annually.\n            (4) Responding to coastal hazards and managing fisheries \n        and other coastal activities require improved monitoring of the \n        Nation's waters and coastline, including the ability to provide \n        rapid response teams with real-time environmental conditions \n        necessary for their work.\n            (5) While knowledge of the ocean and coastal environment \n        and processes is far from complete, advances in sensing \n        technologies and scientific understanding have made possible \n        long-term and continuous observation from shore, from space, \n        and in situ of ocean and coastal characteristics and \n        conditions.\n            (6) Many elements of an ocean and coastal observing system \n        are in place, but require national investment, consolidation, \n        completion, and integration at Federal, regional, State, and \n        local levels.\n            (7) The Commission on Ocean Policy recommends a national \n        commitment to a sustained and integrated ocean and coastal \n        observing system and to coordinated research programs in order \n        to assist the Nation and the world in understanding the oceans, \n        improving weather forecasts, strengthening management of ocean \n        and coastal resources, and mitigating marine hazards.\n            (8) In 2003, the United States led more than 50 nations in \n        affirming the vital importance of timely, quality, long-term \n        global observations as a basis for sound decision-making, \n        recognizing the contribution of observation systems to meet \n        national, regional, and global needs, and calling for \n        strengthened cooperation and coordination in establishing a \n        Global Earth Observation System of Systems, of which an \n        integrated ocean and coastal observing system is an essential \n        part.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide for--\n            (1) the planning, development, and maintenance of an \n        integrated ocean and coastal observing system that provides the \n        data and information to sustain and restore healthy marine and \n        Great Lakes ecosystems and the resources they support, enable \n        advances in scientific understanding of the oceans and the \n        Great Lakes, and strengthen science education and \n        communication;\n            (2) implementation of research, development, education, and \n        outreach programs to improve understanding of the oceans and \n        Great Lakes and achieve the full national benefits of an \n        integrated ocean and coastal observing system;\n            (3) implementation of a data and information management \n        system required by all components of an integrated ocean and \n        coastal observing system and related research to develop early \n        warning systems and insure usefulness of data and information \n        for users; and\n            (4) establishment of a system of regional ocean, coastal, \n        and Great Lakes observing systems to address local needs for \n        ocean information.\n\nSEC. 3.
