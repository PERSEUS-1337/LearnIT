    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Girls Count Act of 2014''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the United States Census Bureau's 2013 \n        international figures, 1 person in 12--or close to 900,000,000 \n        people--is a girl or young woman age 10 through 24.\n            (2) The data also asserts that young people are the fastest \n        growing segment of the population in developing countries.\n            (3) Even though most countries do have birth registration \n        laws, nearly one-third of all children under the age of 5 \n        worldwide have never had their births registered. Moreover, an \n        estimated 45 percent of children under the age of 5 worldwide \n        (about 290 million children) do not possess a birth \n        certificate.\n            (4) A nationally recognized proof of birth is the key to \n        determining a child's citizenship, nationality, place of birth, \n        parentage and age, without which a passport, drivers license, \n        or national identification card are impossible to obtain. Those \n        who lack such documentation are often prevented from officially \n        participating in and benefitting from the formal economic, \n        legal, and political sectors in their countries.\n            (5) The lack of birth registration among girls worldwide is \n        particularly concerning as it exacerbates their \n        disproportionate vulnerability to trafficking, child marriage, \n        and lack of access to health and education services.\n            (6) A lack of birth registration among women and girls can \n        also aggravate what in many places amounts to an already \n        reduced ability to seek employment, participate in civil \n        society or purchase or inherit land and other assets.\n            (7) Girls undertake much of the domestic labor needed for \n        poor families to survive: carrying water, harvesting crops, \n        tending livestock, caring for younger children, and doing \n        chores.\n            (8) Accurate assessments of access to education, poverty \n        levels, and overall census activities are hampered by the lack \n        of official information on women and girls. Without this \n        rudimentary information, assessments of foreign assistance and \n        domestic social welfare programs cannot be accurately gauged.\n            (9) To ensure that women and girls are fully integrated \n        into United States foreign assistance policies and programs, \n        that the specific needs of girls are, to the maximum extent \n        possible, addressed in the design, implementation, and \n        evaluation of development assistance programs, and that women \n        and girls have the power to affect the decisions that affect \n        their lives, all girls should be counted and have access to \n        birth certificates and other official documentation.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to--\n            (1) encourage countries to uphold the Universal Declaration \n        of Human Rights and enact laws that ensure girls and boys of \n        all ages are full participants in society, including requiring \n        birth certifications and some type of national identity card to \n        ensure that all citizens, including girls, are counted;\n            (2) enhance training and capacity-building to developing \n        countries, local nongovernmental organizations, and other civil \n        society organizations to effectively address the needs of birth \n        registries in countries where girls are undercounted;\n            (3) include organizations representing children and \n        families in the design, implementation, and monitoring of \n        programs under this Act; and\n            (4) mainstream into the design, implementation, and \n        evaluation of policies and programs at all levels an \n        understanding of the distinctive impact that such policies and \n        programs may have on girls.\n\nSEC. 4.
