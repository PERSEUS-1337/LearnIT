ENERGY CREDIT FOR COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SYSTEM PROPERTY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 48(a)(3)(A) (defining energy property) is \nby striking ``or'' at the end of clause (iii), by inserting ``or'' at \nthe end of clause (iv), and by adding at the end the following new \nclause:\n    ``(v) combined heat and power system property,''.\n    (b) Combined Heat and Power System Property.--Section 48 is amended \nby adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(d) Combined Heat and Power System Property.--For purposes of \nsubsection (a)(3)(A)(v)--\n            ``(1) Combined heat and power system property.--The term \n        `combined heat and power system property' means property \n        comprising a system--\n                    ``(A) which uses the same energy source for the \n                simultaneous or sequential generation of electrical \n                power, mechanical shaft power, or both, in combination \n                with the generation of steam or other forms of useful \n                thermal energy (including heating and cooling \n                applications),\n                    ``(B) which has an electrical capacity of not more \n                than 50 megawatts or a mechanical energy capacity of \n                not more than 67,000 horsepower or an equivalent \n                combination of electrical and mechanical energy \n                capacities,\n                    ``(C) which produces--\n                            ``(i) at least 20 percent of its total \n                        useful energy in the form of thermal energy \n                        which is not used to produce electrical or \n                        mechanical power (or combination thereof), and\n                            ``(ii) at least 20 percent of its total \n                        useful energy in the form of electrical or \n                        mechanical power (or combination thereof),\n                    ``(D) the energy efficiency percentage of which \n                exceeds 60 percent, and\n                    ``(E) which is placed in service before January 1, \n                2011.\n            ``(2) Special rules.--\n                    ``(A) Energy efficiency percentage.--For purposes \n                of this subsection, the energy efficiency percentage of \n                a system is the fraction--\n                            ``(i) the numerator of which is the total \n                        useful electrical, thermal, and mechanical \n                        power produced by the system at normal \n                        operating rates, and expected to be consumed in \n                        its normal application, and\n                            ``(ii) the denominator of which is the \n                        higher heating value of the primary fuel \n                        sources for the system.\n                    ``(B) Determinations made on btu basis.--The energy \n                efficiency percentage and the percentages under \n                paragraph (1)(C) shall be determined on a Btu basis.\n                    ``(C) Input and output property not included.--The \n                term `combined heat and power system property' does not \n                include property used to transport the energy source to \n                the facility or to distribute energy produced by the \n                facility.\n                    ``(D) Certain exception not to apply.--The first \n                sentence of the matter in subsection (a)(3) which \n                follows subparagraph (D) thereof shall not apply to \n                combined heat and power system property.\n            ``(3) Systems using bagasse.--If a system is designed to \n        use bagasse for at least 90 percent of the energy source--\n                    ``(A) paragraph (1)(D) shall not apply, but\n                    ``(B) the amount of credit determined under \n                subsection (a) with respect to such system shall not \n                exceed the amount which bears the same ratio to such \n                amount of credit (determined without regard to this \n                subparagraph) as the energy efficiency percentage of \n                such system bears to 60 percent.\n            ``(4) Nonapplication of certain rules.--For purposes of \n        determining if the term `combined heat and power system \n        property' includes technologies which generate electricity or \n        mechanical power using back-pressure steam turbines in place of \n        existing pressure-reducing valves or which make use of waste \n        heat from industrial processes such as by using organic \n        rankine, stirling, or kalina heat engine systems, paragraph (1) \n        shall be applied without regard to subparagraphs (C) and (D) \n        thereof.''.\n    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \napply to periods after December 31, 2007, in taxable years ending after \nsuch date, under rules similar to the rules of section 48(m) of the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 (as in effect on the day before the date \nof the enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990)."
