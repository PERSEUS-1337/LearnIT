FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Event data recorders offer important benefits for motor \n        vehicle safety, such as enabling automatic crash notification \n        systems for improved emergency responses to crashes, increasing \n        understanding of vehicle crashworthiness and safe highway \n        design, and providing greater insight into trends in motor \n        vehicle defects.\n            (2) More than 38,000 people die each year on roads in the \n        United States, and such fatalities could be reduced by taking \n        full advantage of the benefits of event data recorders.\n            (3) According to the event data recorder working group of \n        the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the degree \n        to which the benefits of event data recorders are realized is \n        directly proportional to the number of motor vehicles equipped \n        with such recorders.\n            (4) Requiring the inclusion of event data recorders in new \n        motor vehicles would produce valuable safety benefits that \n        would far outweigh the nominal financial burden on \n        manufacturers.\n            (5) The National Transportation Safety Board has \n        recommended that event data recorders be installed on light \n        passenger vehicles and on schoolbuses and motorcoaches.\n\nSEC. 3. EVENT DATA RECORDERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 301 of part A of subtitle \nVI of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new sections:\n``Sec. 30129.
