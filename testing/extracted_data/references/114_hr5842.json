    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Our Veterans with Chronic \nPain and Opioid Addiction Act of 2016''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Many veterans and their families have been affected by \n        the national opioid epidemic caused in part by the prescription \n        of opioid medication to manage pain.\n            (2) Prescription opioid overdose rates for veterans \n        receiving medical care furnished by the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs are twice the national average.\n            (3) More than 50 percent of veterans receiving such care \n        are suffering from chronic pain.\n            (4) Almost one in three veterans receiving such care are \n        prescribed opioids to manage pain.\n            (5) Many veterans prescribed opioids for the management of \n        chronic pain are at risk of developing a dependency on opioids.\n            (6) Many veterans receive health care from both the \n        Department and community providers but the lack of care \n        coordination among the Department and community providers when \n        veterans receive purchased care places veterans at risk for \n        poor health outcomes and results in inefficient use of finite \n        health care resources.\n            (7) Veteran-centric care coordination is associated with \n        improved patient outcomes, as Department and non-Department \n        health care teams coordinate and collaborate to provide the \n        best care for veterans.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) veterans suffering from opioid dependency should \n        receive timely access to treatment and social services at \n        Department of Veterans Affairs facilities or through qualified \n        community providers and should have care and services managed \n        and coordinated by the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n            (2) veterans who are authorized by the Secretary of \n        Veterans Affairs to receive opioid addiction treatment in the \n        community must not lose the high quality, safety, care \n        coordination, and other veteran-centric elements that the \n        health care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        provides; and\n            (3) if the Secretary purchases care for veterans from a \n        community provider, such care must be secured in a cost-\n        effective manner, in a way that complements the larger health \n        care system of the Department by using industry standards for \n        care and costs.\n\nSEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE TREATMENT FOR VETERANS SUFFERING FROM \n              OPIOID ADDICTION AND CHRONIC PAIN.\n\n    (a) In General.--Beginning not later than 120 days after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \nconduct a pilot program under which the Secretary provides health and \nsocial services and coordination of care and case management to covered \nveterans in need of treatment for opioid addiction and chronic pain \nthrough facilities of the Department and through qualified non-\nDepartment health care providers.\n    (b) Program Locations.--\n            (1) In general.--The pilot program shall be carried out \n        within at least five areas within different States.\n            (2) Selection.--\n                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall select five \n                States with Department medical facilities to \n                participate in the pilot program.
