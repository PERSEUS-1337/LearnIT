STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to support the autonomous governance of \nHong Kong and the future well-being of the Hong Kong people by ensuring \nthe continuity of United States laws with respect to Hong Kong after \nits reversion to the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997, and to \noutline circumstances under which the President of the United States \ncould modify the application of United States laws with respect to Hong \nKong if the People's Republic of China fails to honor its commitment to \ngive the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong a high degree of \nautonomy.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Joint Declaration of the Government of the United \n        Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the \n        Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of \n        Hong Kong, done at Beijing on December 19, 1984, is a binding \n        international agreement which sets forth the commitments made \n        by both governments on the reversion of Hong Kong to the \n        People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997.\n            (2) The People's Republic of China in the Joint Declaration \n        pledges, among other things, that ``the Hong Kong Special \n        Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, \n        except in foreign and defence affairs. . .,'' that basic human \n        rights and freedoms ``will be ensured by law. . .,'' and that \n        ``[t]he legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative \n        Region shall be constituted by elections.''.\n            (3) Senior government officials of the People's Republic of \n        China have repeatedly assured a smooth transfer of Hong Kong to \n        Chinese sovereignty, a successful implementation of the ``one \n        country, two systems'' policy, long-term prosperity for Hong \n        Kong, and continued respect for the basic rights of the Hong \n        Kong people.\n            (4) Despite general assertions guaranteeing the autonomous \n        governance of Hong Kong, several official acts and statements \n        by senior officials of the Government of the People's Republic \n        of China reflect an attempt to infringe upon the current and \n        future levels of autonomy in Hong Kong. These acts or \n        statements include, but are not limited to--\n                    (A) initial proposals, which were later withdrawn, \n                by officials of the Government of the People's Republic \n                of China to obtain confidential files on civil servants \n                of the Hong Kong Government or require such civil \n                servants to take ``loyalty oaths'';\n                    (B) the decision of the Government of the People's \n                Republic of China to dissolve the democratically \n                elected Legislative Council on July 1, 1997, and the \n                appointment of a provisional legislature in December of \n                1996;\n                    (C) the delineation by officials concerning the \n                types of speech and association which will be permitted \n                by the Government of the People's Republic of China \n                after the reversion;\n                    (D) initial warnings, which were later withdrawn, \n                to religious institutions not to hold certain \n                gatherings after the reversion; and\n                    (E) the decision on February 23, 1997, of the \n                Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of \n                the People's Republic of China to repeal or amend \n                certain Hong Kong ordinances, including the Bill of \n                Rights Ordinance, the Societies Ordinance of 1992 \n                (relating to freedom of association), and the Public \n                Order Ordinance of 1995 (relating to freedom of \n                assembly).\n            (5) The reversion of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of \n        China has important implications for both United States \n        national interests and the interests of the Hong Kong people. \n        The United States Government has a responsibility to ensure \n        that United States interests are protected during and after \n        this transition, and it has a profound interest in ensuring \n        that basic and fundamental human rights of the Hong Kong people \n        are also protected.\n            (6) The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 sets \n        forth United States policy concerning Hong Kong's reversion to \n        the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997, and Hong Kong's \n        special status as a Special Administrative Region of that \n        country. It ensures the continuity of United States laws \n        regarding Hong Kong while establishing a mechanism in section \n        202 of that Act whereby the President can modify the \n        application of United States laws with respect to Hong Kong if \n        the President ``determines that Hong Kong is not sufficiently \n        autonomous to justify treatment under a particular law of the \n        United States, or any provision thereof, different from that \n        accorded the People's Republic of China''.\n            (7) One of the principal purposes of the Congress in \n        enacting the United States Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 was to \n        maintain Hong Kong's autonomy by ensuring that the United \n        States will continue to treat Hong Kong as a distinct legal \n        entity, separate and apart from the People's Republic of China, \n        for all purposes, in those areas in which the People's Republic \n        of China has agreed that Hong Kong will continue to enjoy a \n        high degree of autonomy, unless the President makes a \n        determination under section 202 of that Act.\n            (8) Although the United States Government can have an \n        impact on ensuring the future autonomy of the Hong Kong \n        Government and in protecting the well-being of the Hong Kong \n        people, ultimately the future of Hong Kong will be determined \n        by the willingness of the Government of the People's Republic \n        of China to maintain the freedoms now enjoyed by the people of \n        Hong Kong and to rely on the people of Hong Kong to govern \n        themselves.\n\nSEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATIONS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following declarations:\n            (1) Recognizing that the United States Government and the \n        Hong Kong Government have long enjoyed a close and beneficial \n        working relationship, for example between the United States \n        Customs Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug \n        Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization \n        Service, the Secret Service, and their corresponding agencies \n        of the Hong Kong Government, the United States urges the two \n        governments to continue their effective cooperation.\n            (2) Recognizing that the preservation of Hong Kong's \n        autonomous customs territory has important security and \n        commercial implications for the United States and the people of \n        Hong Kong, the United States calls upon the People's Republic \n        of China to fully respect the autonomy of the Hong Kong customs \n        territory.\n            (3) Recognizing that Hong Kong has historically been an \n        important port of call for United States naval vessels, the \n        United States urges the Government of the People's Republic of \n        China to consider in a timely and routine manner United States \n        requests for port calls at Hong Kong.\n            (4) Recognizing that Hong Kong enjoys a robust and \n        professional free press with important guarantees on the \n        freedom of information, the United States declares that a free \n        press and access to information are fundamentally important to \n        the economic and commercial success of Hong Kong and calls upon \n        the Government of the People's Republic of China to fully \n        respect these essential rights of the Hong Kong people.\n            (5) Recognizing that the first fully democratic elections \n        of a legislature in Hong Kong took place in 1995, following \n        nearly 150 years of colonial rule, the United States recognizes \n        that the Joint Declaration of 1984 requires that the Special \n        Administrative Region legislature ``shall be constituted by \n        elections'', declares that the failure to have an elected \n        legislature would be a violation of the Joint Declaration of \n        1984, and calls upon the Government of the People's Republic of \n        China to honor its treaty obligations.\n            (6) Recognizing that the United Kingdom belatedly reformed \n        Hong Kong laws with respect to the civil rights of the Hong \n        Kong people, the Hong Kong people have nevertheless long \n        enjoyed essential rights and freedoms as enumerated in the \n        Universal Declaration of Human Rights; therefore, the United \n        States declares that the decision of the National People's \n        Congress to repeal or amend certain ordinances is a serious \n        threat to the Hong Kong people's continued enjoyment of their \n        freedom of association, speech, and other essential human \n        rights, unless those rights are reestablished no later than \n        July 1, 1997, and calls upon the National People's Congress to \n        reconsider its decision.\n            (7) Recognizing that under the terms of the Joint \n        Declaration of 1984 the provisions of the International \n        Covenant on Civil and Political Rights will continue to apply \n        in Hong Kong, the United States welcomes the public statement \n        by the Chief Executive-designate of Hong Kong that the \n        legislation which will replace repealed or amended sections of \n        the Societies Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance will be the \n        subject of public consultation, and urges that the new \n        legislation should reflect both the clearly expressed wishes of \n        the people of Hong Kong and the provisions of the International \n        Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n            (8) Recognizing that Hong Kong currently maintains an \n        efficient capitalist economy and trade system by strictly \n        adhering to the rule of law, by honoring the sanctity of \n        contract, and by operating without corruption and with minimum \n        and transparent regulation, the United States calls upon the \n        Government of the People's Republic of China to fully respect \n        the autonomy and independence of the chief executive, the civil \n        service, the judiciary, the police of Hong Kong, and the \n        Independent Commission Against Corruption.\n\nSEC. 5.
