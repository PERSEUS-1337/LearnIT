FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the safe and efficient movement of individuals and \n        freight in interstate commerce, including the movement of \n        individuals and freight on highways over long distances, is \n        essential to the economic growth and prosperity of the United \n        States, including both rural and metropolitan areas;\n            (2) the highway movement of freight will be, for the \n        foreseeable future, on roads that serve both freight and \n        passenger traffic, requiring effective and unified planning and \n        funding for the preservation and improvement of highways in the \n        interest of effective transportation of both individuals and \n        freight in rural and metropolitan areas;\n            (3) it is essential and appropriate that Federal programs \n        to preserve and improve highway transportation infrastructure \n        ensure consideration of the needs of freight as part of an \n        overall, unified, and multimodal approach to meeting the \n        national interest in the safe and efficient transportation of \n        both individuals and freight;\n            (4) vehicle miles traveled on the National Highway System, \n        including the Interstate System, represent nearly 45 percent of \n        all vehicle miles traveled in the United States, even as \n        National Highway System routes comprise only 4 percent of \n        public road mileage in the United States; and\n            (5) a well-preserved and improved system of National \n        Highway System routes, including Interstate System routes, is \n        essential to the effective movement of individuals and freight \n        in the United States in both rural and metropolitan areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
