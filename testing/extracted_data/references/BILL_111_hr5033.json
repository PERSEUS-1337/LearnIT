PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to develop and carry out research and \ndemonstration projects on new and existing program interventions to \nprovide youth in racial or ethnic minority or immigrant communities the \ninformation and skills needed to reduce teenage pregnancies, build \nhealthy relationships, and improve overall health and well-being.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Teenage pregnancy is one of the most critical issues \n        facing the Nation today. The United States has the highest \n        teenage pregnancy rate of any developed nation, with nearly \n        750,000 teenage girls (ages 15 to 19) becoming pregnant each \n        year, and 80 percent of those pregnancies unplanned.\n            (2) Nationally, teenage pregnancy has significant fiscal \n        implications, costing taxpayers at least $9,100,000,000 \n        annually.\n            (3) Communities of color disproportionately suffer from \n        teenage pregnancy. Fifty-two percent of Latinas and 50 percent \n        of African-American girls will become pregnant at least once \n        before they turn 20. In comparison, only 19 percent of non-\n        Hispanic white teenage girls under the age of 20 become \n        pregnant.\n            (4) Between 2005 and 2006, the teen pregnancy rate \n        increased for every racial/ethnic subgroup. Hispanic teens \n        continue to have the highest rates of both teen pregnancy and \n        birth.\n            (5) Research shows that starting a family too soon may have \n        significant social, educational, and financial impacts on the \n        lives of young people. Less than half of teenage mothers finish \n        high school and less than 2 percent go on to finish college, \n        making it difficult to find and maintain a job.\n            (6) New research shows that teenage dating violence and \n        abuse are serious public health problems and are associated \n        with higher levels of teenage pregnancy and unplanned \n        pregnancy. Studies show that 1 in 5 teenage girls in the United \n        States report having experienced physical or sexual intimate \n        partner violence.\n            (7) Promoting and building healthy relationships are \n        fundamental to prevent teenage pregnancies and unplanned \n        pregnancies.\n\nSEC. 4.
