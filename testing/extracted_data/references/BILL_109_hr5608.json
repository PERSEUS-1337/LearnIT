FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One third of older adults over age 65 fall each year. \n        Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among individuals \n        for this population with risk of falling and injury rates \n        increasingly common with advanced age.\n            (2) Older adults are hospitalized for fall-related injuries \n        five times more often than for injuries from other causes.\n            (3) In 2003, falls among older adults accounted for 12,900 \n        deaths, 1,800,000 emergency department visits, and 421,000 \n        hospitalizations.\n            (4) In 2003, unintentional falls accounted for more than \n        62.7 percent of nonfatal injuries for people age 65 or older.\n            (5) 87 percent of all fractures among older adults are due \n        to falls.\n            (6) Among older adults who fall, 20 to 30 percent suffer \n        moderate to severe injuries such as hip fractures or head \n        traumas that reduce mobility and independence, increase the \n        risk of premature death, and lead to serious health problems.\n            (7) Hospital admissions for hip fractures among the elderly \n        have increased from 231,000 admissions in 1988 to 338,000 in \n        1999, with an average hospital stay of one week.\n            (8) From 2000 to 2040, the number of people age 65 or older \n        is projected to increase from 34.8 million to 77.2 million. \n        Given our aging population, by the year 2040, the number of hip \n        fractures is expected to exceed 500,000.\n            (9) 25 percent of older adults who sustain hip fractures \n        remain institutionalized for at least one year and 50 percent \n        of all older people hospitalized for hip fractures cannot \n        return home or live independently after their injury, never \n        returning to their prior level of mobility.\n            (10) 25 percent of adults age 65 or older who sustain a hip \n        fracture die within a year.\n            (11) Annually, more than 64,000 individuals who are over 65 \n        years of age sustain a traumatic brain injury as a result of a \n        fall.\n            (12) The total cost of all fall injuries for people age 65 \n        and older was calculated in 1994 to be $27,300,000,000 (in 2004 \n        dollars). By 2020 the cost of fall injuries is expected to \n        reach $43,800,000,000 annually.\n            (13) A national approach to reducing falls among older \n        adults, which focuses on the daily life of senior citizens in \n        residential, institutional, and community settings, is needed.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Part J of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280b et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating section 393B (as added by section 1401 \n        of Public Law 106-386) as section 393C and transferring such \n        section so that it appears after section 393B (as added by \n        section 1301 of Public Law 106-310); and\n            (2) by inserting after section 393C (as redesignated and \n        transferred by paragraph (1)) the following:\n\n``SEC. 393D.
