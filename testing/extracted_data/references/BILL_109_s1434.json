However, States \n        are still finding it difficult to provide high-quality teachers \n        in the areas of mathematics and science and for secondary \n        schools.\n            (2) Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n        1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), as amended by the No Child Left \n        Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110, 115 Stat. 1425), States \n        are required to ensure that all teachers teaching in core \n        academic subjects within the State are highly qualified by not \n        later than the end of the 2005-2006 school year. Yet schools in \n        rural areas and high-poverty schools have trouble attracting \n        and retaining such teachers.\n            (3) Teacher retention is at the main root of teacher \n        shortages, and recruitment initiatives alone will not solve \n        this problem.\n\nSEC. 3.
