FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Renewable energy resources have the potential to help \n        diversify our Nation's energy portfolio with few adverse \n        environmental effects. By their very nature, renewable \n        resources are distributed. Our ability to cost effectively take \n        advantage of our renewable, indigenous resources can be greatly \n        advanced through systems that minimize the intermittency of \n        these resources through distributed power hybrid systems.\n            (2) Distributed power sources configured as distributed \n        power hybrid systems can maximize benefits to the energy \n        consumer. The primary benefits of distributed power hybrid \n        systems are that they can--\n                    (A) shelter consumers from temporary energy price \n                volatility created by supply and demand mismatches;\n                    (B) increase the reliability of energy supply, \n                thereby avoiding significant costs associated with \n                power outages;\n                    (C) provide a cost-effective means to minimize the \n                impact of intermittent resources, thereby expanding the \n                Nation's energy supply reserve;\n                    (D) decrease environmental impacts of energy \n                supply; and\n                    (E) be tailored to address significant local \n                differences in power and economic development needs and \n                resource availability that exist throughout the United \n                States.\n            (3) Realizing these benefits will require a concerted and \n        integrated effort that focuses on removing market barriers to \n        the adoption of distributed power hybrid systems by--\n                    (A) providing tools that enable States and regions \n                to assess their indigenous renewable energy resources;\n                    (B) developing the technological foundation that \n                enables designing, testing, certifying, and operating \n                distributed power hybrid systems; and\n                    (C) providing the policy framework that reduces \n                such barriers, including making net metering available \n                on a broader scale to enable consumers to reap the full \n                value of these systems, thereby lowering their overall \n                energy bill.\n            (4) While many of the individual distributed power hybrid \n        systems components are either available or under development in \n        existing private and public sector programs, the capabilities \n        to integrate these components into workable distributed power \n        hybrid systems that maximize benefits to consumers in a safe \n        manner are deficient and not coherently being addressed.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n     For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) the term ``distributed power hybrid system'' means a \n        system using 2 or more distributed power sources, operated \n        together with associated supporting equipment, including \n        storage equipment, and software necessary to provide electric \n        power to the grid or on site; and\n            (2) the term ``distributed power source'' means an \n        independent electric energy source of usually 10 megawatts or \n        less located close to a residential, commercial, or industrial \n        load center, including--\n                    (A) reciprocating engines;\n                    (B) turbines;\n                    (C) microturbines;\n                    (D) fuel cells;\n                    (E) solar electric systems;\n                    (F) wind energy systems;\n                    (G) biomass power systems;\n                    (H) geothermal power systems; or\n                    (I) electrical components of cogeneration systems.\n\nSEC. 4.
