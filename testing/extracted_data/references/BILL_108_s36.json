ELIMINATION OF GEOGRAPHIC PHYSICIAN WORK ADJUSTMENT FACTOR FROM \n              GEOGRAPHIC INDICES USED TO ADJUST PAYMENTS UNDER THE \n              PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Variations in the geographic physician work adjustment \n        factors under section 1848(e) of the Social Security Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 1395w-4(e)) result in inequity between localities in \n        payments under the medicare physician fee schedule.\n            (2) Beneficiaries under the medicare program that reside in \n        areas where such adjustment factors are high have relatively \n        more access to services that are paid based on such fee \n        schedule.\n            (3) There are a number of studies indicating that the \n        market for health care professionals has become nationalized \n        and historically low labor costs in rural and small urban areas \n        have disappeared.\n            (4) Elimination of the adjustment factors described in \n        paragraph (1) would equalize the reimbursement rate for \n        services reimbursed under the medicare physician fee schedule \n        while remaining budget-neutral.\n    (b) Elimination.--Section 1848(e) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395w-4(e)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)(A)(iii), by striking ``an index'' and \n        inserting ``for services provided before January 1, 2003, an \n        index''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``, for services \n        provided before January 1, 2003,'' after ``paragraph (4)), \n        and''.\n    (c) Budget Neutrality Adjustment for Elimination of Geographic \nPhysician Work Adjustment Factor.--Section 1848(d) of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4(d)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking ``The conversion'' and \n        inserting ``Subject to paragraph (5), the conversion''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(5) Budget neutrality adjustment for elimination of \n        geographic physician work adjustment factor.--Before applying \n        an update for a year under this subsection, the Secretary shall \n        (if necessary) provide for an adjustment to the conversion \n        factor for that year to ensure that the aggregate payments \n        under this part in that year shall be equal to aggregate \n        payments that would have been made under such part in that year \n        if the amendments made by section 2(b) of the Medicare Equity \n        Act of 2003 had not been enacted.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
