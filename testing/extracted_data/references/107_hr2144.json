FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) tan oak, coast live oak, Shreve's oak, and black oak \n        trees are among the most beloved features of the topography of \n        California and the Pacific Northwest and efforts should be made \n        to protect those trees from disease;\n            (2) the die-off of those trees, as a result of the exotic \n        Phytophthora fungus, is approaching epidemic proportions;\n            (3) very little is known about the new species of \n        Phytophthora, and scientists are struggling to understand the \n        causes of sudden oak death syndrome, the methods of \n        transmittal, and how sudden oak death syndrome can best be \n        treated;\n            (4) the Phytophthora fungus has been found on--\n                    (A) Rhododendron plants in nurseries in California; \n                and\n                    (B) wild huckleberry plants, potentially \n                endangering the commercial blueberry and cranberry \n                industries;\n            (5) sudden oak death syndrome threatens to create major \n        economic and environmental problems in California, the Pacific \n        Northwest, and other regions, including--\n                    (A) the increased threat of fire and fallen trees;\n                    (B) the cost of tree removal and a reduction in \n                property values; and\n                    (C) loss of revenue due to--\n                            (i) restrictions on imports of oak products \n                        and nursery stock; and\n                            (ii) the impact on the commercial \n                        rhododendron, blueberry, and cranberry \n                        industries; and\n            (6) Oregon and Canada have imposed an emergency quarantine \n        on the importation of oak trees, oak products, and certain \n        nursery plants from California.\n\nSEC. 3.
