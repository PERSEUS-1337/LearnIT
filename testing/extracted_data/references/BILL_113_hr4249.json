FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 2012, nearly one in five children in America lived \n        in a household that lacked access to nutritious food on a \n        regular basis. That is 15.9 million American children who \n        struggled with hunger at some time during the year.\n            (2) Children who experience hunger are more likely to get \n        sick and are more likely to be obese than those who do not. \n        Children facing chronic hunger also find it more difficult to \n        concentrate in school and tend to exhibit higher levels of \n        behavioral, emotional, and academic problems.\n            (3) Federal programs play an important role in addressing \n        childhood hunger. In 2013, 21 million students participated in \n        the free or reduced-price lunch program. Eleven million \n        students participated in the free or reduced-price breakfast \n        program. Three million low-income children received free meals \n        during the summer months. Forty-seven percent of participants \n        in the supplemental nutrition assistance program are under the \n        age of 18.\n            (4) On average, students who eat school breakfast achieve \n        17.5 percent higher scores on standardized math tests, and \n        attend 1.5 more days of school each year than those who do not. \n        Students who attend class more regularly are 20 percent more \n        likely to graduate from high school. Participation in the \n        school breakfast program is associated with children having a \n        lower Body Mass Index.\n\nSEC. 3. SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM.\n\n    Section 9(b) of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is \namended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)(A), by inserting after the third \n        sentence the following: ``Notwithstanding any other provision \n        of this Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, for each \n        school year beginning on or after the July 1 of the year \n        following the year of enactment of the Helping Hungry Students \n        Learn Act, the income guidelines for determining eligibility \n        for free lunches shall be 185 percent of the applicable family \n        size income levels contained in the nonfarm income poverty \n        guidelines prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget, \n        as adjusted annually in accordance with subparagraph (B)''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (9)(B), by inserting at the end the \n        following:\n                            ``(iii) Termination of reduced-price \n                        category.--Beginning with the school year \n                        beginning July 1 of the year following the year \n                        of enactment of the Helping Hungry Students \n                        Learn Act, no child shall be determined \n                        eligible for a reduced price lunch.''.\n\nSEC. 4.

Russell National School Lunch Act, for each \nschool year beginning on or after the July 1 of the year following the \nyear of enactment of the Helping Hungry Students Learn Act, the \nnational average payment for each breakfast served to any child shall \nbe equal to the national average payment for each free breakfast served \nduring the school year beginning July 1 of the year of enactment of the \nHelping Hungry Students Learn Act (which shall be adjusted pursuant to \nsection 11(a) of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act).''.\n    (c) Severe Need Assistance.--Section 4(d)(1) of the Child Nutrition \nAct of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773(d)(1)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``(A) during'' and inserting: ``(A)(i) \n        during'';\n            (2) by striking ``(B) in'' and inserting ``(ii) in'';\n            (3) by striking ``subparagraph (A)'' and inserting ``clause \n        (i)'';\n            (4) by striking ``met.'' and inserting ``met; and''; and\n            (5) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(B) for each school year beginning on or after \n                the July 1 of the year following the year of enactment \n                of the Helping Hungry Students Learn Act, there is an \n                alternative breakfast serving model to increase \n                participation in the school breakfast program, such as \n                by serving breakfast in the classroom or having a \n                school breakfast cart.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
