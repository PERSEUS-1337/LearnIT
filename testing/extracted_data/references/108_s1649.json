Bush concurred with the \n        recommendation of Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan, Jr., \n        that Congress designate the Ojito Wilderness based on the high \n        quality wilderness values, close proximity to the Albuquerque \n        and Santa Fe population centers, cultural and paleontological \n        special features, and the lack of resource conflicts in the \n        area;\n            (4) the Pueblo of Zia has worked in cooperation with other \n        interested parties to reach an agreement under which the Pueblo \n        would acquire public land adjacent to the Zia Reservation and \n        the Ojito Wilderness Study Area that would--\n                    (A) enhance the protections for the land in the \n                Ojito area; and\n                    (B) ensure that the land will remain open to the \n                public for recreational, scenic, scientific, \n                educational, paleontological, and conservation uses; \n                and\n            (5) the transfer of certain parcels of public land to the \n        Pueblo of Zia and the designation of the Ojito Wilderness as a \n        component of the National Wilderness Preservation System--\n                    (A) is in the best interest of people of the State \n                of New Mexico and people from other States;\n                    (B) would preserve and maintain the Ojito as an \n                enduring resource of wilderness; and\n                    (C) would provide for the management and promotion \n                of the wilderness character and various resources of \n                the Ojito area for wildlife habitat protection, scenic \n                and historic preservation, scientific research and \n                education, primitive recreation, solitude, and \n                inspiration for present and future generations of the \n                people of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
