FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n        illuminated many flaws in the Nation's domestic security, \n        especially in its identification system.\n            (2) Drivers' licenses and identification cards issued by \n        States have become the favored form of identity verification in \n        the United States and are used by government agencies and \n        private entities alike.\n            (3) Inconsistent requirements between the States for \n        initial identity verification and insufficient verification of \n        identity documents have made the identification systems of \n        States a prime target for fraud and identity theft.\n            (4) Different designs on drivers' licenses and \n        identification cards issued by States have created a market, \n        including sales on the Internet, for fake cards that look real \n        to those who are unfamiliar with the official designs.\n            (5) The use of new technologies will improve the security \n        of State identification systems.\n            (6) Identification card technologies that accommodate other \n        government and private applications create a Federal benefit \n        that justifies Federal assistance.\n            (7) Improving the security of drivers' licenses and \n        identification cards issued by the States will eliminate \n        multiple licensing of individuals who commit fraud, impede the \n        purchase of alcohol and tobacco products by underage \n        individuals, and severely reduce identity theft.\n            (8) The report of the Markle Foundation Task Force on \n        National Security in the Information Age, published in December \n        2003, recommended that the Federal Government develop standards \n        for State drivers' licenses and identification cards and \n        examine the application of smart card and biometric information \n        technologies to such drivers' licenses and identification \n        cards.\n            (9) The Final Report of the National Commission on \n        Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the \n        ``9/11 Commission'') described the potential for biometric \n        identifiers in reducing identity fraud and specifically \n        recommended that the Federal Government set standards for the \n        issuance of drivers' licenses.\n\nSEC. 3.
