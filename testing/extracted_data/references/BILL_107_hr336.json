FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs by law provides \n        benefits not only to veterans of service in the Armed Forces \n        but also to eligible surviving spouses and dependents of \n        deceased veterans.\n            (2) There are over 600,000 surviving spouses and dependents \n        receiving dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) or death \n        pensions from the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n            (3) Presently, the Department of Veterans Affairs does not \n        target this population with specific outreach efforts, nor does \n        it provide program outreach coordinators designated at each \n        regional office of the Department to assist this population and \n        other survivors who may be eligible for benefits from the \n        Department.\n            (4) Approximately 1,600 veterans die daily, many survived \n        by widows and dependents who may not be fully informed as to \n        their eligibility for benefits under laws administered by the \n        Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n            (5) There is no formal program for coordination of benefits \n        for surviving spouses and dependents at any level within the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs.\n            (6) Due to insufficient outreach efforts, informational \n        updates targeted specifically to surviving spouses and \n        dependents are not provided. Outreach efforts to provide \n        information concerning changes in service-connection for \n        disabilities presumed associated with exposure to herbicides \n        and ionizing radiation and former prisoners of war have been \n        insufficient to inform survivors of benefits to which they may \n        now be entitled.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL GOAL TO FULLY INFORM AND ASSIST SURVIVING SPOUSES AND \n              DEPENDENTS REGARDING ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS AND HEALTH \n              CARE SERVICES.\n\n    (a) National Goal.--Congress hereby declares it to be a national \ngoal to fully inform surviving spouses and dependents regarding their \neligibility for benefits and health care services under laws \nadministered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n    (b) Cooperative Efforts Encouraged.--Congress hereby encourages all \nelements within the Department of Veterans Affairs and private and \npublic sector entities (including veterans service organizations and \nveterans widows organizations) to work cooperatively to fully inform \nthe surviving spouses and dependents of veterans regarding their \neligibility for benefits and health care services under laws \nadministered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\nSEC. 4. REQUIREMENT FOR OUTREACH EFFORTS AND DEDICATED STAFF AT EACH \n              REGIONAL OFFICE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs have \nhistorically targeted certain specific populations for outreach efforts \nconcerning benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs.
