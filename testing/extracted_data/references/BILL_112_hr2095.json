FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the utility sector is the largest single source of \n        greenhouse gas emissions in the United States today, producing \n        approximately one-third of the country's emissions;\n            (2) heating and cooling homes accounts for nearly 60 \n        percent of residential electricity usage in the United States;\n            (3) shade trees planted in strategic locations can reduce \n        residential cooling costs by as much as 30 percent;\n            (4) shade trees have significant clean-air benefits \n        associated with them;\n            (5) every 100 healthy large trees removes about 300 pounds \n        of air pollution (including particulate matter and ozone) and \n        about 15 tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year;\n            (6) tree cover on private property and on newly developed \n        land has declined since the 1970s, even while emissions from \n        transportation and industry have been rising; and\n            (7) in over a dozen test cities across the United States, \n        increasing urban tree cover has generated between two and five \n        dollars in savings for every dollar invested in such tree \n        planting.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Secretary'' refers to the Secretary of \n        Energy.\n            (2) The term ``retail power provider'' means any entity \n        authorized under applicable State or Federal law to generate, \n        distribute, or provide retail electricity, natural gas, or fuel \n        oil service.\n            (3) The term ``tree-planting organization'' means any \n        nonprofit or not-for-profit group which exists, in whole or in \n        part, to--\n                    (A) expand urban and residential tree cover;\n                    (B) distribute young trees for planting;\n                    (C) increase awareness of the environmental and \n                energy-related benefits of trees;\n                    (D) educate the public about proper tree planting, \n                care, and maintenance strategies; or\n                    (E) carry out any combination of the foregoing \n                activities.\n            (4) The term ``tree-siting guidelines'' means a \n        comprehensive list of science-based measurements outlining the \n        species and minimum distance required between trees planted \n        pursuant to this Act, in addition to the minimum required \n        distance to be maintained between such trees and--\n                    (A) building foundations;\n                    (B) air conditioning units;\n                    (C) driveways and walkways;\n                    (D) property fences;\n                    (E) preexisting utility infrastructure;\n                    (F) septic systems;\n                    (G) swimming pools; and\n                    (H) other infrastructure as deemed appropriate.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a grant program to assist \nretail power providers with the establishment and operation of targeted \nresidential tree-planting programs, for the following purposes:\n            (1) Reducing the peak-load demand for electricity in \n        residential areas during the summer months through direct \n        shading of buildings provided by strategically planted trees.\n            (2) Reducing wintertime demand for energy in residential \n        areas by blocking cold winds from reaching homes, which lowers \n        interior temperatures and drives heating demand.\n            (3) Protecting public health by removing harmful pollution \n        from the air.\n            (4) Utilizing the natural photosynthetic and transpiration \n        process of trees to lower ambient temperatures and absorb \n        carbon dioxide, thus mitigating the effects of climate change.\n            (5) Lowering electric bills for residential ratepayers by \n        limiting electricity consumption without reducing benefits.\n            (6) Relieving financial and demand pressure on retail power \n        providers that stems from large peak-load energy demand.\n            (7) Protecting water quality and public health by reducing \n        stormwater runoff and keeping harmful pollutants from entering \n        waterways.\n            (8) Ensuring that trees are planted in locations that limit \n        the amount of public money needed to maintain public and \n        electric infrastructure.\n\nSEC. 5. GENERAL AUTHORITY.\n\n    (a) Assistance.--The Secretary is authorized to provide financial, \ntechnical, and related assistance to retail power providers to assist \nwith the establishment of new, or continued operation of existing, \ntargeted residential tree-planting programs.\n    (b) Public Recognition Initiative.--In carrying out the authority \nprovided under this Act, the Secretary shall also create a national \npublic recognition initiative to encourage participation in tree-\nplanting programs by retail power providers.\n    (c) Eligibility.--Only those programs which utilize targeted, \nstrategic tree-siting guidelines to plant trees in relation to \nresidence location, sunlight, and prevailing wind direction shall be \neligible for assistance under this Act.\n    (d) Requirements.--In order to qualify for assistance under this \nAct, a tree-planting program shall meet each of the following \nrequirements:\n            (1) The program shall provide free or discounted shade-\n        providing or wind-reducing trees to residential consumers \n        interested in lowering their home energy costs.\n            (2) The program shall optimize the electricity-consumption \n        reduction benefit of each tree by planting in strategic \n        locations around a given residence.\n            (3) The program shall either--\n                    (A) provide maximum amounts of shade during summer \n                intervals when residences are exposed to the most sun \n                intensity; or\n                    (B) provide maximum amounts of wind protection \n                during fall and winter intervals when residences are \n                exposed to the most wind intensity.\n            (4) The program shall use the best available science to \n        create tree siting guidelines which dictate where the optimum \n        tree species are best planted in locations that achieve maximum \n        reductions in consumer energy demand while causing the least \n        disruption to public infrastructure, considering overhead and \n        underground facilities.\n            (5) The program shall receive certification from the \n        Secretary that it is designed to achieve the goals set forth in \n        paragraphs (1) through (4). In designating criteria for such \n        certification, the Secretary shall collaborate with the United \n        States Forest Service's Urban and Community Forestry Program to \n        ensure that certification requirements are consistent with such \n        above goals.\n    (e) New Program Funding Share.--The Secretary shall ensure that no \nless than 30 percent of the funds made available under this Act are \ndistributed to retail power providers which--\n            (1) have not previously established or operated qualified \n        tree-planting programs;\n            (2) are operating qualified tree-planting programs which \n        were established no more than three years prior to the date of \n        enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 6.
