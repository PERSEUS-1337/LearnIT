FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Research has shown that early childhood is an important \n        time for developing dietary and physical activity behaviors \n        that support health and well-being and may help prevent \n        obesity.\n            (2) Infants as young as 7 months have shown eating patterns \n        that are similar to older children and adults.\n            (3) For children under 1 year of age, promoting \n        opportunities for movement (such as reaching, crawling, and \n        creeping) may be the most effective way to increase physical \n        activity and improve children's motor skills.\n            (4) Children who are exposed to healthy foods early are \n        more likely to prefer and eat healthy foods and to develop \n        eating habits that promote healthy growth that can continue \n        throughout childhood.\n            (5) Healthy eating can improve a child's learning ability \n        and potentially lead to higher academic performance, along with \n        his or her mental, social, and physical well-being and can \n        contribute to increased self-esteem.\n            (6) A 2010 study indicated that daily physical activity is \n        not only essential for healthy weight maintenance, but also for \n        practicing and learning fundamental gross motor skills and \n        socioemotional and cognitive skills. Furthermore, when children \n        have the opportunity for adequate physical activity, they \n        benefit physically, psychologically and socially.\n            (7) Nearly 20 percent (1 in 5) of 2-year-olds spend more \n        than 2 hours of a typical day watching television or videos.\n            (8) The Journal of the American Medical Association \n        Pediatrics found that each incremental hour of watching \n        television at age 2 is associated with corresponding declines \n        in school engagement, math achievement, and weekend physical \n        activity, and with increases in bullying by classmates, \n        consumption of soft drinks and snacks, and BMI at age 10.\n            (9) A major study published in the New England Journal of \n        Medicine, found that a third of children who were overweight in \n        kindergarten were obese by eighth grade. Almost every child who \n        was very obese remained that way, suggesting that efforts must \n        start much earlier and focus more on the children at greatest \n        risk.\n            (10) In 2012, three-fourths of United States preschool-aged \n        children were in child care, and most of their day was spent in \n        sedentary activities.\n            (11) Center-based programs serve approximately 6,980,000 \n        children birth through age 5 years but not yet in kindergarten, \n        making the early childhood care and education setting an \n        important one for promoting healthful habits.\n            (12) Early care and education learning collaboratives in 9 \n        States have reached nearly 156,000 children and improved early \n        childhood care and education provider practices for nutrition \n        and physical activity.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) establish a program that will influence practices, \n        policies, and environments in early care and education settings \n        to support healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time \n        reduction for children ages birth through 5;\n            (2) enhance the training and knowledge of early care and \n        education providers on strategies for promoting healthy eating \n        (including early feeding best practices), physical activity, \n        and screen time reduction in early care and education settings;\n            (3) monitor progress of healthy eating and physical \n        activity promotion in early care and education settings; and\n            (4) identify emerging, and expand existing, approaches to \n        engaging families and parents of children ages birth to 5 in \n        healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time reduction.\n\nSEC. 3. HEALTHY KIDS PROGRAM.\n\n    Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                     ``PART W--HEALTHY KIDS PROGRAM\n\n``SEC. 399OO.
