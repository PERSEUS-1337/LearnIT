FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the United Nations, there were--\n                    (A) 33,200,000 people living with HIV/AIDS \n                worldwide in 2007, including 22,500,000 people in sub-\n                Saharan Africa;\n                    (B) 2,500,000 new HIV/AIDS infections in 2007, \n                including 1,700,000 in sub-Saharan Africa; and\n                    (C) 2,010,000 people on antiretroviral therapy in \n                developing countries in 2006.\n            (2) Over 2,100,000 people die from AIDS every year.\n            (3) Fewer than 10 percent of HIV-infected individuals in \n        the developing world receive treatment.\n            (4) More than 80 percent of people with HIV/AIDS in \n        developing countries are unaware of their status.\n            (5) Peer-reviewed studies have shown that patients who are \n        well managed on anti-retroviral therapy achieve low viral \n        loads, which may reduce their chances of infecting others.\n            (6) Perinatal transmission is the leading cause of \n        pediatric HIV infections, despite medical advances that have \n        made it possible to nearly eliminate perinatal HIV \n        transmission.\n            (7) Research studies have demonstrated that the \n        administration of antiretroviral medication during pregnancy, \n        during labor, and immediately following birth can significantly \n        reduce the transmission of HIV from an infected mother to her \n        baby.\n            (8) Nevirapine, an antiretroviral drug that costs less than \n        $4 a dose, has been proven to prevent HIV transmission from \n        mother to child with the administration of just two doses.\n            (9) Even if treatment begins shortly after birth, \n        antiretroviral therapy can substantially reduce the chance that \n        an HIV-exposed infant will become infected.\n            (10) The American Medical Association recommends universal \n        HIV testing of all newborns with appropriate treatment for \n        affected mothers and children.\n            (11) Testing newborns whose mothers' statuses are unknown \n        ensures that every child at risk for HIV is identified.\n            (12) The provision of testing of pregnant women and \n        newborns with appropriate counseling and treatment can \n        significantly reduce the number of pediatric HIV infections, \n        including AIDS cases, improve access to medical care for women \n        and children, and provide opportunities to further reduce \n        transmission among adults.\n            (13) The provision of such testing, counseling, and \n        treatment can reduce the overall cost of pediatric HIV \n        infections, including AIDS cases.\n            (14) Saving lives with HIV/AIDS treatment is the best way \n        to prevent children from becoming orphans and to preserve the \n        family and community structure so essential to social cohesion \n        and economic prosperity in communities affected by AIDS.\n            (15) The provision of HIV/AIDS treatment has brought hope, \n        health, and a future to communities living under a death \n        sentence, and with worldwide death rates still exceeding \n        2,100,000 per year, other objectives, although meritorious, \n        must defer to testing and treatment.\n\nSEC. 3. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR THERAPEUTIC MEDICAL CARE.\n\n    Section 403(a) of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673(a)) is amended by \nstriking ``(a) Therapeutic Medical Care.--'' and all that follows \nthrough ``related care.
