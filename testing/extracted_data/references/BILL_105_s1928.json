FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Some payphone service providers have increased the \n        charge for the use of a coin-operated pay telephone for a local \n        call to 35 cents but have not put into place a system for \n        providing change to users of such telephones for amounts \n        deposited in such telephones in excess of such charge.\n            (2) Payphone service providers should charge pay telephone \n        users only for the actual time of use of pay telephones.\n            (3) Most consumers, if given a choice, would prefer that \n        any amount of such excess deposits that are not refunded to \n        consumers be used for pay telephones for public health, safety, \n        and welfare purposes rather than have such excess deposits \n        accrue to the financial benefit of payphone service providers.\n            (4) There are approximately 2,000,000 pay telephones in the \n        United States, and payphone service providers accrue \n        substantial revenue at the expense of Americans who do not have \n        the exact amount of the charge for their use.\n            (5) A decision of the Federal Communications Commission to \n        deregulate the provision of payphone service was premature and \n        did not address adequately the need for local competition that \n        would benefit users of pay telephones.\n            (6) The decision of the Commission does not promote the \n        widespread deployment of affordable payphone service that would \n        benefit the general public, nor does the decision promote the \n        widespread deployment of public interest telephones.\n            (7) The use of coin-operated pay telephones represents an \n        increasing commercial activity that substantially affects \n        interstate commerce.\n            (8) Public interest telephones should be maintained in each \n        State and should be provided to promote the public safety, \n        health, and welfare.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is--\n            (1) to require payphone service providers--\n                    (A) to provide cash change to pay telephone users \n                who deposit amounts for local telephone calls in excess \n                of the amounts charged for such calls; or\n                    (B) in the event that such providers do not provide \n                such change, to transfer amounts equal to such change \n                to appropriate State entities for public interest \n                purposes related to telephone service;\n            (2) to encourage such changes in pay telephone technology \n        as are needed to assure that payphone service providers--\n                    (A) do not overcharge pay telephone users who do \n                not have the exact amount of the charge for local pay \n                telephone calls; and\n                    (B) do not charge pay telephone users for any time \n                in which pay telephones are not actually in use; and\n            (3) to require the Federal Trade Commission to determine--\n                    (A) whether dysfunctions exist in the market for \n                payphone service including locational monopolies in \n                which the size of the market concerned results in the \n                availability of payphone service from a single \n                provider; and\n                    (B) whether rates for coin-operated pay telephones \n                for local telephone calls are market based.\n\nSEC. 3. PUBLIC INTEREST PAY TELEPHONES.\n\n    Section 276(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n276(b)(2)) is amended to read as follows:\n            ``(2) Public interest pay telephones.--\n                    ``(A) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of \n                Congress that--\n                            ``(i) in the interest of the public health, \n                        safety, and welfare, public interest pay \n                        telephones should be available and maintained \n                        in locations where there would not otherwise \n                        likely be a pay telephone; and\n                            ``(ii) such public interest pay telephones \n                        should be fairly and equitably supported.\n                    ``(B) Use of funds.--In accordance with such \n                regulations as the Commission shall prescribe, each \n                State agency that receives amounts under subsection \n                (c)(2)(A) shall use such amounts to promote or \n                otherwise support the installation, maintenance, and \n                use of public interest pay telephones, including \n                specially designed payphones for the disabled and the \n                provision of payphone service in remote locations, \n                nursing homes, emergency homeless shelters, hospitals, \n                facilities that assist the disabled, schools, and other \n                appropriate locations determined by the State agency \n                concerned.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
