FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) in the aftermath of the 4 hurricanes that occurred \n        within 6 weeks in the southeast United States during 2004, many \n        of the inspectors and managers employed to inspect and document \n        disaster-related damage in that area had criminal records;\n            (2) preliminary damage assessments provide important \n        information about the impact and magnitude of damage and the \n        needs of individuals, businesses, the public sector, and the \n        community as a whole; and\n            (3) the failure to conduct a preliminary damage assessment \n        can result in Federal funds being provided to areas that have \n        not suffered the level of damage that would qualify an area for \n        Federal disaster assistance.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure the appropriate use of public funds;\n            (2) to protect disaster victims; and\n            (3) to require more stringent background checks for \n        contractors of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nSEC. 2.
