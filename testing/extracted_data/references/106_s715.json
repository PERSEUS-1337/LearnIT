    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 50-mile Hanford Reach--\n                    (A) is the last free-flowing nontidal segment of \n                the Columbia River in the United States; and\n                    (B) has been preserved in a relatively natural \n                condition because of its location within the Hanford \n                Nuclear Reservation.\n            (2) Public Law 100-605 (102 Stat. 3043) required an \n        analysis of protection alternatives for the Hanford Reach and a \n        report to Congress by the Secretary of the Interior, who \n        concluded in the Hanford Reach Final Environmental Impact \n        Statement dated June 1994 that the Hanford Reach should be \n        designated as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic \n        Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.).\n            (3) The Hanford Reach is a vital migration corridor for \n        anadromous fish and contains some of the most productive \n        spawning areas in the Northwest United States, producing an \n        estimated 80 percent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook \n        salmon and healthy runs of naturally spawning steelhead trout, \n        sturgeon, and other highly valued fish species.\n            (4) The Hanford Reach provides important habitat for \n        wintering and migrating wildlife, including waterfowl, bald \n        eagles, deer, elk, and numerous Federal and State-listed \n        threatened and endangered plant and animal species, some of \n        which are found nowhere else.\n            (5) The shoreline area known as White Bluffs and the \n        pristine conditions of the Hanford Reach offer scenic beauty \n        and opportunities for solitude and recreation, including \n        hunting, fishing, boating, hiking, swimming, and wildlife \n        observation, in close proximity to the cites of Richland, \n        Pasco, and Kennewick, Washington.\n            (6) The Hanford Reach and its salmon runs have been \n        important to mid-Columbia Native Americans for subsistence, \n        cultural, and religious purposes for more than 10,000 years, \n        and there are 150 registered archaeological sites in the area.\n            (7) The southern shore of the Hanford Reach chronicles the \n        history of--\n                    (A) the Manhattan Project;\n                    (B) defense nuclear production during the cold war; \n                and\n                    (C) early Euro-American settlement of the area.\n            (8) The White Bluffs and adjacent shoreline areas are \n        significant paleontological resources and rich with fossilized \n        remains from the Pliocene period.\n            (9) Protection of the Hanford Reach as a component of the \n        national wild and scenic rivers system could enhance local \n        revenues from outdoor recreation and increase economic \n        investment in the cites of Richland, Pasco, and Kennewick, \n        Washington, by highlighting the quality of life and natural \n        amenities of the area.\n            (10) Economic activities along the river corridor in \n        existence on the date of enactment of this Act, such as \n        agriculture, power production and transmission, and water \n        withdrawal, are compatible with the designation of the Hanford \n        Reach as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers \n        Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.).\n            (11) Designation of the Hanford Reach as a recreational \n        river under such Act cannot be changed except by a subsequent \n        Act of Congress.\n            (12) Designation of the Hanford Reach as a recreational \n        river under such Act can facilitate, and make less costly, the \n        remediation of contaminated areas of the Hanford Nuclear \n        Reservation by--\n                    (A) establishing future land use within the river \n                corridor; and\n                    (B) helping to ensure the Federal commitment to the \n                cleanup of the Hanford Site.\n            (13) The Hanford Reach has special significance as an \n        outdoor laboratory and classroom and offers a singular \nopportunity for government agencies, Indian tribes, and community \norganizations to develop a partnership around an education and \ninterpretation program focused on the area's unique natural and human \nhistory.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect the natural, cultural, scenic, and \n        recreational resources of the Hanford Reach of the Columbia \n        River by designating the Hanford Reach as a recreational river \n        under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.);\n            (2) to encourage education and interpretation of the \n        Hanford Reach; and\n            (3) to protect the land adjacent to the Hanford Reach.\n\nSEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF THE HANFORD REACH OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER AS A \n              RECREATIONAL RIVER UNDER THE WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS ACT.\n\n    (a) Designation.--Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act \n(16 U.S.C. 1274(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(160) Hanford Reach, Columbia River, Washington.--Subject to \nsection 3A, the river segment from river mile 346.5 to river mile 396 \nof the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River, Washington, as a \nrecreational river.''.\n    (b) Special Requirements.--The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is \namended by inserting after section 3 (16 U.S.C. 1274) the following:\n\n``SEC. 3A.
