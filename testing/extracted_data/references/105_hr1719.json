FINDINGS; POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Fishing is an important and traditional recreational \n        activity in which 36,000,000 Americans 16 years old and older \n        participate.\n            (2) Hunting is an important and traditional recreational \n        activity in which 14,000,000 Americans 16 years old and older \n        participate.\n            (3) Survey data from a recent comprehensive 3-year study \n        entitled ``Factors Related to Hunting and Fishing Participation \n        in the United States'' suggest that an overwhelming majority of \n        Americans approved of fishing and hunting.\n            (4) Anglers and hunters have been and continue to be among \n        the foremost supporters of sound wildlife management and \n        conservation practices in the United States.\n            (5) Persons who hunt or fish and organizations related to \n        those activities provide direct assistance to wildlife managers \n        and enforcement officers of Federal, State, and local \n        governments.\n            (6) Funds raised through license, permit, and stamp \n        purchases, as well as through excise taxes on goods used by \n        anglers and hunters, have generated more than $6,000,000,000 \n        for wildlife research and management.\n            (7) Fishing and hunting are essential components of \n        effective wildlife management, in that they tend to reduce \n        conflicts between people and wildlife and provide incentives \n        for the conservation of wildlife and habitats and ecosystems on \n        which wildlife depends.\n            (8) Each State has established one or more agencies staffed \n        by professionally trained fish and wildlife management \n        personnel, has legal authority to manage the fish and wildlife \n        found within the State, and carries out sound programs of fish \n        and wildlife management.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that in \nperforming duties under Federal law, all Federal agencies that have \nauthority to manage a natural resource or the Federal public land and \nwater on which a natural resource depends shall exercise the authority, \nconsistent with section 3(e), in a manner so as to support, promote, \nand enhance hunting and fishing opportunities to the extent permitted \nunder State law and regulation and in accordance with applicable \nFederal law.\n\nSEC. 3. TAKING OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ON FEDERAL PUBLIC LANDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Federal public land and water shall be open to \naccess and use for fishing and hunting except--\n            (1) as limited by the State in which the Federal public \n        land or water is located; or\n            (2) as limited by the Federal agency responsible for the \n        Federal public land or water--\n                    (A) for reasons of national security;\n                    (B) for reasons of public safety; or\n                    (C) for reasons specifically authorized in \n                applicable statutes.\n    (b) Limitations on Terms of Federal Closure to Fishing or \nHunting.--\n            (1) Limitation on duration.--Any closure of Federal public \n        land or water to fishing or hunting may continue in effect only \n        during the period in which the specific circumstances for which \n        the closure is established exist.\n            (2) Rule of construction.--Any authority of a Federal \n        agency to close particular land or water to hunting or fishing \n        shall not be construed as authority to protect or manage fish \n        or wildlife.\n    (c) Certain Federal Public Land and Water Administered by the \nNational Park Service.--Nothing in this Act shall compel the opening to \nhunting or fishing of national parks or national monuments administered \nby the National Park Service.\n    (d) No Priority.--This section does not require a Federal agency to \ngive preference to fishing or hunting over other uses of Federal public \nland or water or land or water management priorities established in \nFederal law.\n    (e) Authority of the States.--\n            (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act impairs the primacy of \n        State authority in regulating the taking of fish and wildlife \n        on land or water within the State, including Federal public \n        land or water.\n            (2) Federal authority.--Except as expressly provided by Act \n        of Congress, the authority of a Federal agency regarding the \n        taking of fish and wildlife on Federal public land or water \n        managed by the Federal agency shall be no greater than the \n        rights of a private owner of land or water.\n\nSEC. 4.

EVALUATION OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT EFFECTS.\n\n    (a) Statement.--No Federal agency action that may significantly \ndiminish opportunities or access to engage in fishing or hunting on \nFederal public land or water shall be effective until the agency \nprepares a detailed statement evaluating the effect of the action on \nfishing and hunting.\n    (b) Notice and Hearing.--Before taking an action described in \nsubsection (a), a Federal agency shall--\n            (1) provide notice of the proposed agency action to the \n        appropriate State agency responsible for the conduct or \n        oversight of fish and wildlife management; and\n            (2) conduct a public hearing in the vicinity of the \n        proposed action.\n    (c) Judicial Review.--An individual or entity that may be adversely \naffected by a loss of fishing or hunting opportunities on Federal \npublic land or water as a result of an agency action described in \nsubsection (a) may bring a civil action in a United States district \ncourt for review of the adequacy of the statement required in \nsubsection (a).\n    (d) Emergencies.--Nothing in this section precludes an agency from \nexercising statutory authority to close Federal public land or water in \nan emergency or other exigent circumstances.\n    (e) Effect on Other Law.--Nothing in this section affects or has \napplication to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) or \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. \n1801 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 6. CIVIL ACTIONS.\n\n    (a) Intervention.--A person interested in participating in fishing \nor hunting shall be entitled to intervene as a matter of right in a \ncivil action brought under any other Federal law relating to the use of \nany Federal public land or water in which the plaintiff seeks an order \nthat would require the use (or nonuse) of the land or water in such a \nmanner as to impair access to or use of the land or water for the \npurpose of fishing or hunting as required by this Act.\n    (b) Consideration of Interests.--If an intervenor under subsection \n(a) shows that the application of another Federal law as sought by the \nplaintiff would be likely to impair access to or use of the Federal \npublic land or water for the purpose of fishing or hunting as required \nby this Act, the court shall not grant the relief sought unless the \nplaintiff shows that the interest intended to be advanced by the other \nFederal law clearly outweighs the interest of protecting access to and \nuse of Federal public land or water for fishing and hunting.\n    (c) State Deemed Indispensable Party.--In any civil action brought \nin any United States district court under any other Federal law \nrelating to the use of any Federal public land or water, a State is \ndeemed an indispensable party if management by the State of fish and \nresident wildlife, including hunting and fishing, would be curtailed or \nif opportunities provided by the State for hunting and fishing would be \nreduced or eliminated by a grant of preliminary or final relief.\n\nSEC. 7. STANDING TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION.\n\n    An individual who is licensed by a State to engage in fishing or \nhunting, or an organization representing the interests of such \nindividuals, may bring a civil action in a United States district court \nto seek declaratory or injunctive relief regarding the implementation \nof any provision of this Act, including a declaration that a civil \naction brought by another person may significantly disrupt or eliminate \nopportunities for fishing or hunting and an injunction against the \nprosecution of the civil action.\n\nSEC. 8.
