FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The average life expectancy in the United States has \n        increased to 80 years of age, causing an ever-increasing demand \n        for medical care.\n            (2) In 1975, United States medical schools graduated \n        approximately 12,716 physicians. Half of these physicians \n        entered programs of medical studies as graduates of United \n        States colleges and universities. The other half consisted of \n        graduates of foreign institutions admitted to United States \n        medical schools under the J-1 Visa Program.\n            (3) Presently, the number of applicants, foreign and \n        domestic, seeking admission to United States medical schools \n        has decreased to approximately 39,109.\n            (4) During the last 20 years, median tuition and fees at \n        medical schools have increased by 229 percent (122 percent \n        adjusted for inflation) in private schools and by 479 percent \n        (256 percent adjusted for inflation) in public schools.\n            (5) The Association of American Medical Colleges, in its \n        Statement on the Physician Workforce, dated June, 2006, called \n        for an increase of 1,500 National Health Service Corps program \n        awards per year to help meet the need for physicians caring for \n        underserved populations and to help address rising medical \n        student indebtedness.\n            (6) The National Health Service Corps program has a proven \n        record of supplying physicians to underserved areas, and has \n        played an important role in expanding access for underserved \n        populations in rural and inner city communities.\n            (7) Continued expansion of the National Health Service \n        Corps program is strongly recommended.\n            (8) The growing debt incurred by graduating medical \n        students is likely to increase the interest and willingness of \n        graduates of United States medical schools to apply for \n        National Health Service Corps program funding and awards.\n            (9) One third (250,000) of active physicians are over the \n        age of 55 and are likely to retire in the next ten years, while \n        the population will have increased by 24 percent. These \n        demographic changes will cause the population-to-physician \n        ratio to peak by the year 2020.\n            (10) The Indiana State Medical Licensing Board has \n        estimated that in 20 years there will be 200,000 fewer \n        physicians available to deliver medical services.\n            (11) In 2005, the Council on Graduate Medical Education \n        stated in a report to Congress that there will be a shortage of \n        not fewer than 90,000 full-time physicians by 2020.\n            (12) A decrease in Federal spending to carry out programs \n        authorized by title VII of the Public Health Service Act \n        threatens the viability of programs used to solve the problem \n        of inadequate access to health care.\n            (13) A continuing decline in the number of family \n        physicians may lead to renewed shortages of safety net and \n        rural physicians.\n            (14) There is a declining ability to recruit qualified \n        medical students from rural and underserved areas, coupled with \n        greater difficulty on the part of community health centers and \n        other clinics to attract adequate personnel.\n\nSEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS SCHOLARSHIP \n              PROGRAM AND LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Reauthorization of Appropriations.--Section 338H(a) of the \nPublic Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254q(a)) is amended by striking \n``$146,250,000'' and all that follows through the period and inserting \n``$300,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011.''.\n    (b) Scholarships for Medical Students.--Section 338H of such Act is \nfurther amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Scholarships for Medical Students.--Of the amounts \nappropriated under subsection (a) for a fiscal year, the Secretary \nshall obligate $30,000,000 for contracts for scholarships under this \nsubpart to individuals who are accepted for enrollment, or enrolled, in \na course of study or program described in section 338A(b)(1)(B) that \nleads to a degree in medicine or osteopathic medicine.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
