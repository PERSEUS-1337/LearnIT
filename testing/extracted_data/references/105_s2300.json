FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) a long line of decisions of the United States Supreme \n        Court has established that States have the right to collect \n        lawfully imposed nondiscriminatory State excise, sales, and \n        transaction taxes on the purchase of a good or service from an \n        Indian tribe (including a tribal government or tribal \n        corporation) by a person who is not a member of that Indian \n        tribe;\n            (2) the collection of the taxes referred to in paragraph \n        (1) has been impeded by the assertion of tribal immunity by \n        Indian tribes (including tribal governments and corporations) \n        and members of an Indian tribe as a defense in an action in a \n        Federal court that is necessary to enforce the collection of \n        the State taxes that apply to the sales referred to in \n        paragraph (1); and\n            (3) the failure of an Indian tribe (including a tribal \n        government or tribal corporation) or a member of an Indian \n        tribe to act as an agent of a State to collect a State tax \n        referred to in paragraph (1)--\n                    (A) unlawfully deprives that State of essential tax \n                revenues needed for infrastructure improvement and \n                ensuring the health and welfare of all of the citizens \n                of that State; and\n                    (B) creates a disadvantage for law-abiding \n                businesses that are not associated with the Indian \n                tribe and that fulfill their obligation to act as an \n                agent of the State, and, as a result of that \n                disadvantage, some of those businesses may be forced \n                out of business.\n\nSEC. 3. COLLECTION OF STATE TAXES.\n\n    Section 1362 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``The \n        district courts'';\n            (2) by inserting ``(referred to in this section as an \n        `Indian tribe')'' after ``Interior'';
