FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) According to the Department of Justice, in the past 7 \n        years, an average of 150 Federal law enforcement officers per \n        year sustained physical injuries while dealing with an \n        assaultive subject.\n            (2) More than 70 Federal agencies employ Federal law \n        enforcement officers but only 2 such agencies have an awards \n        mechanism to recognize Federal law enforcement officers who are \n        injured in the line of duty.\n            (3) In contrast to the lack of an awards mechanism for \n        Federal law enforcement officers, the President awards the \n        Purple Heart for military personnel wounded or killed during \n        armed service, and most State and local police departments have \n        commendations and medals for officers who are injured in the \n        line of duty.\n            (4) Formal congressional recognition does not exist to \n        honor Federal law enforcement officers who are injured in the \n        line of duty.\n            (5) It is appropriate for Congress to recognize and honor \n        the brave men and women in Federal law enforcement who are \n        injured while putting themselves at personal risk in the line \n        of duty.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF A BADGE.\n\n    The Attorney General may award, and a Member of Congress or the \nAttorney General may present, in the name of Congress a Congressional \nBadge of Bravery (in this Act referred to as the ``Badge'') to a \nFederal law enforcement officer who is cited by the Attorney General, \nupon the recommendation of the Congressional Badge of Bravery Board, \nfor sustaining a physical injury while in the line of duty.\n\nSEC. 4.
