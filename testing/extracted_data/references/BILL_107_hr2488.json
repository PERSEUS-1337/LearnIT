If the United \nStates determines that additional water resources are needed for the \npurposes of this Act, the United States shall work with or through any \nagency that is eligible to hold in-stream flow water rights to acquire \nsuch rights in accordance with the water laws of the State of Utah.\n\nSEC. 3.

ADJACENT MANAGEMENT.\n\n    The Congress does not intend for the designation of the Pilot Range \nWilderness to lead to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer \nzones around any such wilderness. The fact that nonwilderness \nactivities or uses can be seen or heard within the Pilot Range \nWilderness shall not, of itself, preclude such activities or uses up to \nthe boundary of that wilderness.\n\nSEC. 5. WITHDRAWAL.\n\n    Subject to valid existing rights, the Federal lands within the \nPilot Range Wilderness are hereby withdrawn from all forms of entry, \nappropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; and from \nlocation, entry, and patent under the United States mining laws; and \nfrom disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal \nleasing, and mineral materials, and all amendments thereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 "
