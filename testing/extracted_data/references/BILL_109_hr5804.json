DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Little Shell Tribe \n        of Chippewa Indians of Montana.\n            (2) Member.--The term ``member'' means an individual who is \n        enrolled in the Tribe pursuant to section 7.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians is one of \n        the political successors to signatories to the Pembina Treaty \n        of 1863, by which a large area of land in what is now North \n        Dakota was ceded to the United States.\n            (2) The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa of North Dakota, \n        and the Chippewa-Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation of \n        Montana, which also are political successors to the signatories \n        to the Pembina Treaty of 1863, already have been recognized by \n        the Federal Government as distinct Indian tribes.\n            (3) The members of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa \n        continue to live in Montana as their ancestors have done for \n        more than a century since their ancestors ceded their lands in \n        North Dakota.\n            (4) The Little Shell Tribe repeatedly petitioned the \n        Federal Government for reorganization in the 1930s and 1940s \n        under the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.; commonly \n        referred to as the ``Indian Reorganization Act''). Federal \n        agents who visited the Little Shell Tribe and Commissioner of \n        Indian Affairs John Collier attested to the Federal \n        Government's responsibility toward the Little Shell Indians. \n        These officials concluded that Little Shell tribal members were \n        eligible for and should be provided with trust land, thereby \n        making the Tribe eligible for reorganization under the Indian \n        Reorganization Act. Due to a lack of Federal appropriations \n        during the Depression, however, the Bureau lacked adequate \n        financial resources to purchase land for the Tribe, and the \n        Little Shell people were thereby denied the opportunity to \n        reorganize.\n            (5) In spite of the Federal Government's failure to \n        appropriate adequate funding to secure land for the Tribe as \n        required for reorganization under the Indian Reorganization \n        Act, the Tribe continued to exist as a separate community with \n        leaders exhibiting clear political authority. The Tribe, \n        together with the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa of North \n        Dakota, and the Chippewa-Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's \n        Reservation of Montana, filed two suits under the Indian Claims \n        Commission Act of 1946 to petition for additional compensation \n        for lands ceded to the United States by the 1863 Treaty and \n        1892 McCumber Agreement. These tribes received Indian Claims \n        Commission awards, which were distributed under 1971 and 1982 \n        Acts of Congress.\n            (6) The Tribe petitioned the Bureau of Indian Affairs for \n        recognition through the Bureau's Federal Acknowledgement \n        Process in 1978. Nearly 30 years later, the Tribe's petition is \n        still pending.\n            (7) The United States Government, the State of Montana, and \n        the other federally recognized Indian Tribes of Montana have \n        had continuous dealings with the recognized political leaders \n        of the Little Shell Tribe from the 1930s through the present.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL RECOGNITION.\n\n    Federal recognition of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians \nof Montana is hereby extended. All laws and regulations of the United \nStates of general application to Indians or nations, tribes, or bands \nof Indians, including the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) \nthat are not inconsistent with any specific provision of this Act, \nshall be applicable to the Tribe and its members.\n\nSEC. 5.
