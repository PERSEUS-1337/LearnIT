FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) From 1966 through 1991, the Medicare program paid \n        physicians based on what they charged for services. The Omnibus \n        Reconciliation Act of 1989 required the establishment of a \n        national Medicare physician fee schedule, which was implemented \n        in 1992, replacing the charge-based system.\n            (2) The Medicare physician fee schedule currently includes \n        more than 7,000 services together with their corresponding \n        payment rates. In addition, each service on the fee schedule \n        has three relative value units (RVUs) that correspond to the \n        three physician payment components of physician work, practice \n        expense, and malpractice expense.\n            (3)(A) Each geographically adjusted RVU measures the \n        relative costliness of providing a particular service in a \n        particular location referred to as a locality. Physician \n        payment localities are primarily consolidations of the carrier-\n        defined localities that were established in 1966.\n            (B) When physician payment localities were redesignated in \n        1997, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n        Services acknowledged that the new payment locality \n        configuration had not been established on a consistent \n        geographic basis. Some were based on zip codes or Metropolitan \n        Statistical Areas (MSAs) while others were based on political \n        boundaries, such as cities, counties, or States.\n            (C) The Medicare program has not revised the geographic \n        boundaries of the physician payment localities since the 1997 \n        revision.\n            (4) Medicare's geographic adjustment for a particular \n        physician payment locality is determined using three GPCIs \n        (Geographic Practice Cost Indices) that also correspond to the \n        three Medicare physician payment components of physician work, \n        practice expense, and malpractice expense.\n            (5) The major data source used in calculating the GPCIs is \n        the decennial census which provides new data only once every 10 \n        years.\n            (6) This system of geographic payment designation has \n        resulted in more than half of the current physician payment \n        localities having counties within them with a large payment \n        difference of 5 percent or more. A disproportionate number of \n        these underpaid counties are located in California, Georgia, \n        Minnesota, Ohio, and Virginia.\n            (7) For purposes of payment under the Medicare program, \n        hospitals are organized and reimbursed for geographic costs \n        according to MSAs.\n            (8) Studies by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n        (MedPAC) in 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in \n        2007, the Urban Institute in 2008, and Acumen LLC in 2008 have \n        all documented this physician GPCI payment discrepancy--\n        specifically that more than half of the current physician \n        payment localities had counties within them with a large \n        payment difference (that is, a payment difference of 5 percent \n        or more) between GAO's measure of physicians' costs and \n        Medicare's geographic adjustment for an area. All these \n        objective studies have recommended changes to the locality \n        system to correct the payment discrepancies.\n            (9) A common recommendation among the GPCI payment \n        discrepancy studies referred to in paragraph (8) is to \n        eliminate the county-based locality and replace it with one \n        determined by Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nSEC. 3.
