RESOURCE STAFF FOR STUDENTS.\n\n    Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \nU.S.C. 8001 et. seq) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                 ``PART L--RESOURCE STAFF FOR STUDENTS\n\n``SEC. 10993. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Although 7,500,000 children under the age of 18 \n        require mental health services, fewer than 1 in 5 of these \n        children receive the services.\n            ``(2) Across the United States, counseling professionals \n        have an extremely busy caseload and often students do no get \n        the help they need. The current national average ratio of \n        students to counselors in elementary and secondary schools is \n        513:1.\n            ``(3) Schools in the United States need more mental health \n        professionals, and the funds needed to hire staff to \n        specifically serve students.\n            ``(4) The maximum recommended ratio of students-to-\n        counselors is 250:1.\n            ``(5) Existing counselors are severely taxed to perform \n        duties that are largely administrative in nature, such as \n        scheduling. They are burdened with many demands regarding \n        placement in colleges, texting, career guidance, and the like.\n            ``(6) Student populations are expected to grow \n        significantly over the next few years. School-based services \n        for students will be in great demand. With expected large scale \n        retirements, more than 100,000 new dedicated resource staff for \n        students will be needed to increase student-to-staff service \n        availability.\n            ``(7) Federal support for reducing the student-to-staff \n        ratio would pay for itself, through reduced violence and \n        substance abuse, and through improvements in students' academic \n        achievement.\n\n``SEC. 10994. PURPOSES.\n\n    ``The purposes of this part are to assist local educational \nagencies in recruiting, training, and hiring 100,000 school-based \nresource staff to specifically work with students--\n            ``(1) to reduce the student-to-counseling ratios \n        nationally, in grades 6-12, to an average of 1 such staff for \n        every 250 students as recommended in a report by the Institute \n        of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences relating to \n        schools and health, issued in 1997;\n            ``(2) to help address the mental, emotional, and \n        developmental needs of public school students; and\n            ``(3) to support other school staff and teachers in \n        reaching students early before problems arise, conducting \n        behavioral interventions to improve school discipline, and \n        developing the awareness and skills to identify early warning \n        signs of violence and the need for mental health services.\n\n``SEC. 10995.
