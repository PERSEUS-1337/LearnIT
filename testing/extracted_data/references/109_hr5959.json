SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``To Encourage Alternatively fueled \nvehicle Manufacturing up for Energy Independence Act of 2006'' or the \n``TEAM up for Energy Independence Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) Climate change threatens the security and stability of \n        our planet. The temperature of the Earth is increasing at a \n        rate unseen in modern times. The rate of warming has been \n        nearly 3 times the century-long average since 1970.\n            (2) Climate forecasters predict that if greenhouse gases \n        continue to accumulate in the atmosphere at the current rate, \n        temperatures will rise dramatically, weather patterns sharply \n        shift, ice sheets shrink, and sea levels will rise.\n            (3) Climate scientists agree that human activities are the \n        driving force behind the rise in global temperatures. \n        Smokestacks and automobile emissions have been primary \n        contributors of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases \n        that significantly contribute to the warming trend.\n            (4) In addition to the alarming data about climate change, \n        rising gas prices and instability in oil producing regions have \n        reinforced the need for the United States to secure our energy \n        independence, and make progress by developing and distributing \n        alternatively fueled vehicles.\n            (5) Alternative fueled cars can lessen the impact of \n        climate change, and help provide for the stability and safety \n        of the world.\n            (6) Biodiesel helps to provide hope that our country can \n        achieve sustainable energy independence and combat the effects \n        of global warming.\n            (7) Vehicles which utilize E-85 ethanol fuel could reduce \n        our usage of petroleum fuels by up to 40 percent.\n            (8) Currently, there are just 6,000,000 E-85 capable \n        vehicles on United States roads, compared to approximately \n        230,000,000 gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles.\n            (9) Just 556 fueling stations in the United States \n        currently provide E-85 fuel, accounting for less than one \n        percent of fueling stations. Only 450 retail pumps currently \n        provide consumers with biodiesel fuel.\n            (10) Congress must do more to make alternative fueled \n        vehicles practical and accessible to everyone.\n\nSEC. 3. EXCISE TAX ON AUTOMOBILES SOLD IN UNITED STATES THAT ARE NOT \n              ALTERNATIVE FUELED AUTOMOBILES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Part I of subchapter A of chapter 32 of the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting before section \n4064 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 4061.
