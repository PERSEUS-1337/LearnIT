    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Hass Avocado Quality Assurance Act \nof 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Hass avocados are an integral food source in the United \n        States that are a valuable and healthy part of the human diet \n        and are enjoyed by millions of persons every year for a \n        multitude of everyday and special occasions.\n            (2) Hass avocados are a significant tree fruit crop grown \n        by many individual producers both domestically and abroad.\n            (3) Hass avocados move in interstate and foreign commerce \n        and Hass avocados that do not move in interstate or foreign \n        channels of commerce but only in intrastate commerce directly \n        affect interstate commerce of Hass avocados.\n            (4) The maintenance and expansion of markets in existence \n        on the date of enactment of this Act, and the development of \n        new or improved markets or uses for Hass avocados, are needed \n        to preserve and strengthen the economic viability of the \n        domestic Hass avocado industry for the benefit of producers, \n        importers, and other persons associated with the producing, \n        importing, marketing, processing, and consuming of Hass \n        avocados.\n            (5) The marketing of immature Hass avocados adversely \n        affects demand for all Hass avocados because immature avocados \n        are unpalatable and unfit for human consumption and, when \n        marketed, result in dissatisfied customers who will cease \n        purchasing Hass avocados.\n            (6) There is no better method of ensuring the maturity of \n        Hass avocados than through requiring that Hass avocados meet an \n        established mandatory minimum maturity standard, as measured by \n        percentage of dry matter.\n            (7) The application of consistent and mandatory minimum \n        maturity standards for all Hass avocados is necessary for the \n        maintenance, expansion, and development of markets for Hass \n        avocados.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to set forth certain \nmandatory quality standards in the form of mandatory minimum maturity \nrequirements for all Hass avocados, and to provide the Secretary with \nthe authority necessary to ensure that such standards are met, with the \nintention of--\n            (1) strengthening the position of the Hass avocado industry \n        in the domestic marketplace; and\n            (2) maintaining, developing, and expanding markets and uses \n        for Hass avocados.\n\nSEC. 3. MATURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR HASS AVOCADOS.\n\n    Subtitle A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 209.
