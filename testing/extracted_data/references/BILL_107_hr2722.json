FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Funds derived from the sale of rough diamonds are being \n        used by rebels and state actors to finance military activities, \n        overthrow legitimate governments, subvert international efforts \n        to promote peace and stability, and commit horrifying \n        atrocities against unarmed civilians. During the past decade, \n        more than 6,500,000 people from Sierra Leone, Angola, and the \n        Democratic Republic of the Congo have been driven from their \n        homes by wars waged in large part for control of diamond mining \n        areas. A million of these are refugees eking out a miserable \n        existence in neighboring countries, and tens of thousands have \n        fled to the United States. Approximately 3,700,000 people have \n        died during these wars.\n            (2) The countries caught in this fighting are home to \n        nearly 70,000,000 people whose societies have been torn apart \n        not only by fighting but also by terrible human rights \n        violations.\n            (3) Human rights advocates, the diamond trade as \n        represented by the World Diamond Council, and the United States \n        Government recently began working to block the trade in \n        conflict diamonds. Their efforts have helped to build a \n        consensus that action is urgently needed to end the trade in \n        conflict diamonds.\n            (4) The United Nations Security Council has acted at \n        various times under chapter VII of the Charter of the United \n        Nations to address threats to international peace and security \n        posed by conflicts linked to diamonds. Through these actions, \n        it has prohibited all states from exporting weapons to certain \n        countries affected by such conflicts. It has further required \n        all states to prohibit the direct and indirect import of rough \n        diamonds from Angola and Sierra Leone unless the diamonds are \n        controlled under specified certificate of origin regimes and to \n        prohibit absolutely for a period of 12 months the direct and \n        indirect import of rough diamonds from Liberia.\n            (5) In response, the United States implemented sanctions \n        restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Angola and \n        Sierra Leone to those diamonds accompanied by specified \n        certificates of origin and fully prohibiting the importation of \n        rough diamonds from Liberia. In order to put an end to the \n        emergency situation in international relations, to maintain \n        international peace and security, and to protect its essential \n        security interests, and pursuant to its obligations under the \n        United Nations Charter, the United States is now taking further \n        action against trade in conflict diamonds.\n            (6) Without effective action to eliminate trade in conflict \n        diamonds, the trade in legitimate diamonds faces the threat of \n        a consumer backlash that could damage the economies of \n        countries not involved in the trade in conflict diamonds and \n        penalize members of the legitimate trade and the people they \n        employ. To prevent that, South Africa and more than 30 other \n        countries are involved in working, through the ``Kimberley \n        Process'', toward devising a solution to this problem. As the \n        consumer of a majority of the world's supply of diamonds, the \n        United States has an obligation to help sever the link between \n        diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an \n        effective solution.\n            (7) Failure to curtail the trade in conflict diamonds or to \n        differentiate between the trade in conflict diamonds and the \n        trade in legitimate diamonds could have a severe negative \n        impact on the legitimate diamond trade in countries such as \n        Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania.\n            (8) Initiatives of the United States seek to resolve the \n        regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa which facilitate the \n        trade in conflict diamonds.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Conflict diamonds.--The term ``conflict diamonds'' \n        means rough diamonds the import of which is prohibited by \n        United Nations Security Council Resolutions because that trade \n        is fueling conflict.\n            (2) Diamonds.--The term ``diamonds'' means diamonds \n        classifiable under subheading 7102.31.00 or subheading \n        7102.39.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n        States.\n            (3) Polished diamonds.--The term ``polished diamonds'' \n        means diamonds classifiable under subheading 7102.39.00 of the \n        Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n            (4) Rough diamonds.--The term ``rough diamonds'' means \n        diamonds that are unworked, or simply sawn, cleaved, or bruted, \n        classifiable under subheading 7102.31.00 of the Harmonized \n        Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n            (5) United states.--The term ``United States'', when used \n        in the geographic sense, means the several States, the District \n        of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of \n        the United States.\n\nSEC. 4.

PROHIBITION OF POLISHED DIAMONDS AND JEWELRY.\n\n    The President may prohibit specific entries of polished diamonds \nand jewelry containing diamonds if the President has credible evidence \nthat such polished diamonds and jewelry were produced with conflict \ndiamonds.\n\nSEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    Diamonds and jewelry containing diamonds imported into the United \nStates in violation of any prohibition imposed under section 4 or 5 are \nsubject to the seizure and forfeiture laws, and all criminal and civil \nlaws of the United States shall apply, to the same extent as any other \nviolation of the customs and navigation laws of the United States.\n\nSEC. 7. REPORTS.\n\n    (a) Annual Reports.--Not later than one year after the effective \ndate of this Act, and every 12 months thereafter, the President shall \ntransmit to Congress a report--\n            (1) describing actions taken by countries that have \n        exported rough diamonds to the United States during the \n        preceding 12-month period to implement effective measures to \n        stop trade in conflict diamonds;\n            (2) identifying those countries that have exported rough \n        diamonds to the United States during the preceding 12-month \n        period and are not implementing effective measures to stop \n        trade in conflict diamonds and whose failure to do so has \n        significantly increased the likelihood that conflict diamonds \n        are being imported into the United States;\n            (3) describing appropriate actions, which may include \n        actions under sections 4 and 5, that may be taken by the United \n        States, or actions that may be taken or are being taken by each \n        country identified under paragraph (2), to ensure that conflict \n        diamonds are not being imported into the United States from \n        such country; and\n            (4) identifying any additional countries involved in \n        conflicts linked to rough diamonds that are not the subject of \n        United Nations Security Council Resolutions on conflict \n        diamonds.\n    (b) Semiannual Reports.--For each country identified in subsection \n(a)(2), the President shall, every 6 months after the initial report in \nwhich the country was identified, transmit to Congress a report that \nexplains what actions have been taken by the United States or such \ncountry since the previous report to ensure that conflict diamonds are \nnot being imported from that country into the United States. The \nrequirement to issue a semiannual report with respect to a country \nunder this subsection shall remain in effect until such time as the \ncountry implements effective measures.\n\nSEC. 8. GAO REPORT.\n\n    Not later than 3 years after the effective date of this Act, the \nComptroller General of the United States shall transmit a report to \nCongress on the effectiveness of the provisions of this Act in \npreventing the importation of conflict diamonds under section 4. The \nComptroller General shall include in the report any recommendations on \nany modifications to this Act that may be necessary.\n\nSEC. 9. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) International Arrangement.--It is the sense of Congress that \nthe President should take the necessary steps to negotiate an \ninternational arrangement, working in concert with the Kimberley \nProcess referred to in section 2(6), to eliminate the trade in conflict \ndiamonds. Such an international arrangement should create an effective \nglobal system of controls covering countries that export and import \nrough diamonds, and should contain the elements described in section \n4(b)(3).\n    (b) Additional Security Council Resolutions.--It is the sense of \nCongress that the President should take the necessary steps to seek \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolutions with respect to trade in \ndiamonds from additional countries identified under section 7(a)(4).\n    (c) Trade in Legitimate Diamonds.--It is the sense of Congress that \nthe provisions of this Act should not impede the trade in legitimate \ndiamonds with countries which are working constructively to eliminate \ntrade in conflict diamonds, including through the negotiation of an \neffective international arrangement to eliminate trade in conflict \ndiamonds.\n    (d) Implementation of Effective Measures.--It is the sense of \nCongress that companies involved in diamond extraction and trade should \nmake financial contributions to countries seeking to implement any \neffective measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds described in \nsection 4(b), if those countries would have financial difficulty \nimplementing those measures.\n\nSEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There is authorized to be appropriated to the President $5,000,000 \nfor each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to provide assistance to \ncountries seeking to implement any effective measures to stop trade in \nconflict diamonds described in section 4(b), if those countries would \nhave financial difficulty implementing those measures.\n\nSEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this \nAct.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives November 28, 2001.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 JEFF TRANDAHL,\n\n                                                                 Clerk.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       "
