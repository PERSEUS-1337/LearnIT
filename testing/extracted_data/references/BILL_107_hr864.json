FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As a limit on governmental power, Constitutional \n        framers vested Federal powers in three coequal branches of \n        government, each with unique and limited powers and each with a \n        coequal duty to uphold and sustain the Constitution of the \n        United States.\n            (2) A Supreme Court justice stated, ``The doctrine of the \n        separation of powers was adopted by the convention of 1787 not \n        to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary \n        power. The purpose was not to avoid friction, but, by means of \n        the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the \n        governmental powers among three departments, to save the people \n        from autocracy.'' Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 293 \n        (1926) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).\n            (3) James Madison, quoting Montesquieu, stated in \n        Federalist 47, ```There can be no liberty where the legislative \n        and executive powers are united in the same person, or body of \n        magistrates.'''\n            (4) Article I of the Constitution provides, ``All \n        legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress \n        of the United States.''\n            (5) A congressional committee print has noted that, \n        ``[b]ecause the President has no power or authority over \n        individual citizens and their rights except where he is granted \n        such power and authority by a provision in the Constitution or \n        by statute, the President's proclamations are not legally \n        binding and are at best hortatory unless based on such grants \n        of authority.'' 85th Cong., 1st Sess., Executive Orders and \n        Proclamations: A Study of a Use of Presidential Powers (Comm. \n        Print 1957).\n            (6) The Supreme Court has stated that, even if Presidents \n        have, without congressional authority, taken actions only the \n        Congress may take, ``Congress has not thereby lost its \n        exclusive constitutional authority to make laws necessary and \n        proper to carry out the powers vested by the Constitution `in \n        the Government of the United States, or any Department of \n        Officer thereof.''' (Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n        343 U.S. 579 (1952)).\n            (7) Treaties or Executive Agreements which purport to \n        assign powers not amongst those specifically granted to the \n        Federal Government by the Constitution are non-binding and \n        cannot constitute law.\n\nSEC. 3.

REQUIREMENT OF STATEMENT OF AUTHORITY FOR PRESIDENTIAL ORDERS.\n\n    (a) Statement of Authority.--The President shall provide for each \nPresidential order a statement of the specific statutory or \nconstitutional provision which in fact grants the President the \nauthority claimed for such action.\n    (b) Invalidity of Nonconforming Orders.--A Presidential order which \ndoes not include the statement required by subsection (a) is invalid, \nto the extent such Presidential order is issued under authority granted \nby a congressional enactment.
