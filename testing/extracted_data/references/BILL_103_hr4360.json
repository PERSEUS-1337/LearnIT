PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to promote the reuse and recycling of scrap material in \n        furtherance of the goals of waste minimization and natural \n        resource conservation while protecting human health and the \n        environment;\n            (2) to level the playing field between the use of virgin \n        materials and recycled materials; and\n            (3) to remove the disincentives and impediments to \n        recycling because of potential Superfund liability.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA FOR RECYCLING \n              TRANSACTIONS.\n\n    Title I of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, \nand Liability Act of 1980 is amended by adding at the end the following \nnew section:\n\n``SEC. 127. RECYCLING TRANSACTIONS.\n\n    ``(a) Liability Clarification.--As provided in subsections (b), \n(c), and (d), a person who arranged for the recycling of recyclable \nmaterial shall not be liable under section 107(a)(3) or 107(a)(4).\n    ``(b) Recyclable Material Defined.--For purposes of this section, \nthe term `recyclable material' means scrap paper, scrap plastic, scrap \nglass, scrap textiles, scrap rubber (other than whole tires), scrap \nmetal, or scrap lead-acid and nickel-cadmium batteries, as well as \nminor amounts of material incident to or adhering to the scrap material \nas a result of its normal and customary use prior to becoming scrap.\n    ``(c) Transactions Involving Scrap Paper, Plastic, Glass, Textiles, \nor Rubber.--Transactions involving scrap paper, scrap plastic, scrap \nglass, scrap textiles, or scrap rubber (other than whole tires) shall \nbe deemed to be arranging for recycling if the person who arranged for \nthe transaction (by selling recyclable material or otherwise arranging \nfor the recycling of recyclable material) can demonstrate by a \npreponderance of the evidence that all of the following criteria were \nmet at the time of the transaction:\n            ``(1) The recyclable material met a commercial \n        specification grade.\n            ``(2) A market existed for the recyclable material.\n            ``(3) A substantial portion of the recyclable material was \n        made available for use as a feedstock for the manufacture of a \n        new saleable product.\n            ``(4) The recyclable material could have been a replacement \n        or substitute for a virgin raw material, or the product made \n        from the recyclable material could have been a replacement or \n        substitute for a product made, in whole or in part, from a \n        virgin raw material.\n            ``(5) For transactions occurring 90 days or more after the \n        date of enactment of this section, the person exercised \n        reasonable care to determine that the facility where the \n        recyclable material would be handled, processed, reclaimed, or \n        otherwise managed by another person (hereinafter in this \n        section referred to as a `consuming facility') was in \n        compliance with substantive (not procedural or administrative) \n        provisions of any Federal, State, or local environmental law or \n        regulation, or compliance order or decree issued pursuant \n        thereto, applicable to the handling, processing, reclamation, \n        storage, or other management activities associated with the \n        recyclable material. For purposes of this subsection, \n        `reasonable care' shall be determined using criteria that \n        includes (but is not limited to) (A) the price paid in the \n        recycling transaction; (B) the ability of the person to detect \n        the nature of the consuming facility's operations concerning \n        its handling, processing, reclamation, or other management \n        activities associated with the recyclable material; and (C) the \n        result of inquiries made to the appropriate Federal, State, or \n        local environmental agency (or agencies) regarding the \n        consuming facility's past and current compliance with \n        substantive (not procedural or administrative) provisions of \n        any Federal, State, or local environmental law or regulation, \n        or compliance order or decree issued pursuant thereto, \n        applicable to the handling, processing, reclamation, storage, \n        or other management activities associated with the recyclable \n        material. For the purposes of this paragraph, a requirement to \n        obtain a permit applicable to the handling, processing, \n        reclamation, or other management activity associated with the \n        recyclable materials shall be deemed to be a substantive \n        provision.\n    ``(d) Transactions Involving Scrap Metal.--\n            ``(1) Transactions involving scrap metal shall be deemed to \n        be arranging for recycling if the person who arranged for the \n        transaction (by selling recyclable material or otherwise \n        arranging for the recycling of recyclable material) can \n        demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that at the time \n        of the transaction--\n                    ``(A) the person met the criteria set forth in \n                subsection (c) with respect to the scrap metal;\n                    ``(B) the person was in compliance with any \n                applicable regulations or standards regarding the \n                storage, transport, management, or other activities \n                associated with the recycling of scrap metal that the \n                Administrator promulgates under the Solid Waste \n                Disposal Act subsequent to the enactment of this \n                section and with regard to transactions occurring after \n                the effective date of such regulations or standards;
