MARKET-BASED DETERMINATION OF LENDER RETURNS.\n\n    (a) Joint Planning Study To Select Auction Mechanisms for \nTesting.--\n            (1) Planning study.--The Secretaries of Education and \n        Treasury jointly shall conduct a planning study, in \n        consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, the \n        Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability \n        Office, and other individuals and entities the Secretaries \n        determine appropriate, to--\n                    (A) examine the matters described in paragraph (2) \n                in order to determine which market-based mechanisms for \n                determining lender returns on loans made, insured, or \n                guaranteed under part B of title IV of the Higher \n                Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq.) shall be \n                tested under the pilot programs described in subsection \n                (c); and\n                    (B) determine what related administrative and other \n                changes will be required in order to ensure that high-\n                quality services are provided under a successful \n                implementation of market-based determinations of lender \n                returns for all loans made, insured, or guaranteed \n                under such part.\n            (2) Matters examined.--The planning study under this \n        subsection shall examine--\n                    (A) whether it is most appropriate to auction \n                existing loans under part B of title IV, to auction the \n                rights to originate loans under such part, or whether \n                the sale of securities backed by federally owned \n                student loan assets originated by banks acting as \n                agents of the Federal Government would provide the most \n                efficient market-based alternative;\n                    (B) matters related to efficient financial \n                organization of any auctions or sales, including how \n                loans and origination rights are bundled, the capital \n                structure of any securitization plan, and issues \n                related to servicing; and\n                    (C) how to ensure that statutory, regulatory, and \n                administrative requirements do not impede separate \n                management and ownership of loans or assets backed by \n                loans under part B of title IV.\n            (3) Mechanisms.--In determining which market-based \n        mechanisms are the most promising models to test the pilot \n        programs under subsection (b), the planning study shall take \n        into account whether a particular market-based mechanism will--\n                    (A) ensure loan availability under part B of title \n                IV to all eligible students at all participating \n                institutions;\n                    (B) minimize administrative complexity for \n                borrowers, institutions, lenders, and the Federal \n                Government; and\n                    (C) reduce Federal costs if used on a program-wide \n                basis.\n            (4) Report.--A report on the results of the planning study, \n        together with a plan for implementation of one or more pilot \n        programs using promising market-based approaches for \n        determining lender returns, shall be transmitted to Congress \n        not later than 6 months following the date of enactment of this \n        Act.\n            (5) Exclusion.--In conducting the planning study, and \n        proposing pilot programs for testing under this section, the \n        Secretaries of Education and the Treasury shall exclude from \n        consideration the Federal PLUS loans described in section 428B \n        that are the subject of the competitive loan auction pilot \n        program under section 499 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n        (as added by section 701 of the College Cost Reduction and \n        Access Act).\n    (b) Pilot Programs To Be Tested.--\n            (1) Authorization.--\n                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other \n                provision of law, after the report described in \n                subsection (a)(4) is transmitted to Congress, the \n                Secretary of Education shall, in consultation with the \n                Secretary of the Treasury, begin preparations necessary \n                to carry out pilot programs meeting the requirements of \n                this subsection in accordance with the implementation \n                plan included in the report.\n                    (B) Implementation date.--The Secretary of \n                Education shall commence implementation of the pilot \n                programs under this subsection not earlier than July 1, \n                2009.\n                    (C) Duration and loan volume.--The pilot programs \n                under this subsection shall be not more than two \n                academic years in duration, and the Secretary of \n                Education may use the pilot programs to determine the \n                lender returns for not more than--\n                            (i) 10 percent of the annual loan volume \n                        under this part B of title IV during the first \n                        year of the pilot programs under this \n                        subsection;
