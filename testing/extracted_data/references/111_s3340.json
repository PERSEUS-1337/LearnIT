SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``NIST Grants for Energy Efficiency, \nNew Job Opportunities, and Business Solutions Act of 2010'' or the \n``NIST GREEN JOBS Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Over its 20-year existence, the Hollings Manufacturing \n        Extension Partnership Program has proven its value to \n        manufacturers as demonstrated by the resulting impact on jobs \n        and the economies of all 50 States and the Nation as a whole.\n            (2) The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership \n        Program has helped thousands of companies reinvest in \n        themselves through process improvement and business growth \n        initiatives leading to more sales, new markets, and the \n        adoption of technology to deliver new products and services.\n            (3) Manufacturing is an increasingly important part of the \n        construction sector as the industry moves to the use of more \n        components and factory built sub-assemblies.\n            (4) Construction practices must become more efficient and \n        precise if the United States is to construct and renovate its \n        building stock to reduce related carbon emissions to levels \n        that are consistent with combating global warming.\n            (5) Many companies involved in construction are small, \n        without access to innovative manufacturing techniques, and \n        could benefit from the type of training and business analysis \n        activities that the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \n        routinely provides to the Nation's manufacturers and their \n        supply chains.\n            (6) Broadening the competitiveness grant program under \n        section 25(f) of the National Institute of Standards and \n        Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278k(f)) could help develop and \n        diffuse knowledge necessary to capture a large portion of the \n        estimated $100 billion dollars or more in energy savings if \n        buildings in the United States met the level and quality of \n        energy efficiency now found in buildings in certain other \n        countries.\n            (7) It is therefore in the national interest to expand the \n        capabilities of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership to be \n        supportive of the construction and green energy industries.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPETITIVE \n              GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 25(f)(3) of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278k(f)(3)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``to develop'' in the first sentence and \n        inserting ``to add capabilities to the MEP program, including \n        the development of''; and\n            (2) by striking the last sentence and inserting ``These \n        themes--\n                    ``(A) shall be related to projects designed to \n                increase the viability both of traditional \n                manufacturing sectors and other sectors, such as \n                construction, that increasingly rely on manufacturing \n                through the use of manufactured components and \n                manufacturing techniques, including supply chain \n                integration and quality management;\n                    ``(B) shall be related to projects related to the \n                transfer of technology based on the technological needs \n                of manufacturers and available technologies from \n                institutions of higher education, laboratories, and \n                other technology producing entities; and\n                    ``(C) may extend beyond these traditional areas to \n                include projects related to construction industry \n                modernization.''.\n    (b) Selection.--Section 25(f)(5) of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278k(f)(5)) is amended to read \nas follows:\n            ``(5) Selection.--Awards under this section shall be peer \n        reviewed and competitively awarded.
