    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Numerous studies by the Office of the Inspector General \n        of the Department of the Interior, the General Accounting \n        Office, and independent auditors have criticized the absence of \n        independent oversight or other forms of internal control over \n        the Department's management of Indian trust assets and trust \n        funds.\n            (2) Indian and tribal account holders have indicated that \n        they will have little or no confidence in the reform of the \n        trust management system if the reform is carried out by the \n        same entities that are responsible for the management of the \n        system on the date of enactment of this Act.\n            (3) It would constitute an inherent conflict of interest or \n        at least the appearance of a conflict of interest if the entity \n        establishing internal controls for a trust management system \n        were to be appointed, supervised, and subject to removal by the \n        entity that such internal controls are written for.\n            (4) Account holder confidence will be improved if the same \n        official is not simultaneously responsible for the immediate \n        supervision of the fiduciary and financial reporting activities \n        of both the trust fund accounting system and the trust asset \n        and accounting management system.\n            (5) To the extent practicable, the reform of activities and \n        creation of internal controls as described in the Department of \n        the Interior's Trust Management Improvement Project, High Level \n        Implementation Plan dated July 1998, and any amendments or \n        modifications to that plan, should be carried out by private \n        contractors.\n\nSEC. 2.
