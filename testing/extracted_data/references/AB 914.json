Improved performance may be demonstrated by factors that include, but are not limited to, increased passenger throughput or improved travel times. The San Bernardino County Transportation Commission shall make the determination required by this paragraph in a public meeting prior to operation of the value-pricing program.\n(3) The San Bernardino County Transportation Commission shall have the authority to set, levy, and collect tolls, user fees, or other similar charges payable for the use of the toll facilities in the County of San Bernardino, and any other incidental or related fees or charges, and to collect those revenues, in a manner determined by the San Bernardino County Transportation Commission, in amounts as required for the following expenditures relative to the program and for the purposes of paragraph (4):\n(A) Development, including the costs of design, construction, right-of-way acquisition, and utilities adjustment.\n(B) Operations and maintenance, including, but not limited to, insurance, collection, and enforcement of tolls, fees, and charges.\n(C) Repair, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.\n(D) Indebtedness incurred and internal loans and advances, including related financial costs.\n(E) Administration, which shall not exceed 3 percent of the revenues of toll facilities and associated transportation facilities.\n(F) Reserves for the purposes described in subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive.\n(4) All revenue generated pursuant to paragraph (3) in excess of the expenditure needs of that paragraph shall be used exclusively for the benefit of the transportation corridors included in the value-pricing program created pursuant to this section.
