FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Four million American women give birth each year, and \n        an estimated 700 will die annually during pregnancy, \n        childbirth, or the postpartum period.\n            (2) The United States ranks 47th for maternal mortality \n        rate globally, and is one of only eight countries in which the \n        maternal mortality rate is rising. It is estimated that, \n        between 2000 and 2014, the United States maternal mortality \n        rate grew by 26.6 percent.\n            (3) Common causes of maternal mortality include obstetric \n        hemorrhage, hypertension and preeclampsia, sepsis, and \n        substance use disorder and overdose.\n            (4) More than half of maternal deaths are likely \n        preventable.\n            (5) Additionally, 65,000 American women experience severe \n        maternal morbidity (SMM) annually, meaning the physical and \n        psychological conditions that result from, or are aggravated \n        by, pregnancy have an adverse effect on the health of a woman.\n            (6) Racial and ethnic disparities persist across the \n        Nation, and Black women are three to four times more likely to \n        die from complications of pregnancy or childbirth than White \n        women.\n\nSEC. 3. PLAN FOR REDUCING MATERNAL MORTALITY.\n\n    The Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section \n229 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 237a) the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 229A.
