FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) American bioscience research corporations conduct long-\n        term research and development on breakthrough medical \n        technologies. This commercial bioscience research industry \n        forms an irreplaceable link between pure scientific discovery \n        and the development of powerful biomedical products and \n        technologies. It is critical to the maintenance of American \n        competitiveness internationally that these long-term research \n        and development projects be encouraged.\n            (2) Such long-term research projects have the greatest \n        potential to revolutionize whole fields of science and industry \n        for the benefit of the standard of living of Americans; and to \n        yield solutions for critical social needs, even though these \n        solutions might not result in large sales and profits (such as \n        ``orphan'' drugs and other treatments alleviating great \n        suffering in their recipients).\n            (3) Long-term biomedical research companies are among the \n        most research-intensive and capital-intensive companies in the \n        world.\n            (4) In addition to the scientific and technical risks \n        attending their long-term research programs, many biomedical \n        research companies must subject their technologies to lengthy \n        and expensive regulatory reviews before they are permitted \n        access to the marketplace.\n            (5) Biomedical research companies typically operate in \n        financially challenging circumstances. These companies must \n        engage in intensive research activity for many years in order \n        to develop their products and earn profits. Many are small \n        businesses lacking the internal cash flow, stability and \n        borrowing capacity of large corporations.\n            (6) The long-term commercial bioscience research industry \n        is heavily dependent on outside sources of equity capital to \n        fund lengthy and intensive research prior to earning any \n        revenues. The industry's long lead times and high levels of \n        scientific and regulatory risk often impede access to capital.\n            (7) The longstanding national policy of Government support \n        and tax incentives for breakthrough commercial research \n        reflects a recognition that the capital marketplace tends to \n        allocate insufficient resources to sustain the Nation's need \n        for such foundational scientific research and development.\n            (8) American long-term bioscience research companies \n        constitute one of the core commercial sectors which Congress \n        intended to benefit from existing tax incentives for commercial \n        research.\n            (9) However, the current Federal income tax incentives are \n        simply not working in the case of many bioscience companies \n        focused on breakthrough medical technologies.\n            (10) Current Federal income tax incentives do not work as \n        intended for most high technology bioscience companies because \n        they typically incur net operating losses for a decade or more \n        during their lengthy research and development phases and \n        therefore receive no contemporaneous benefit from these tax \n        incentives.\n            (11) Further, Federal tax rules aimed chiefly at preventing \n        corporate loss trafficking and tax-motivated mergers and \n        acquisitions penalize these companies. The very process of \n        raising successive increments of private capital through \n        routine equity financings triggers these rules and subjects \n        biomedical research companies to severe limitations on net \n        operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. These limitations \n        practically eliminate for the commercial bioscience industry \n        any economic benefit from these tax incentives.\n            (12) These tax incentives instead tend to favor investment \n        by large, profitable companies, often engaged in secondary or \n        tertiary research activities, and thus to discriminate against \nand to cause under-investment in longer-term breakthrough technologies, \na bias which is harmful to American competitiveness.\n            (13) The inability to benefit from existing Federal income \n        tax incentives for commercial research places long-term \n        bioscience research companies at a substantial disadvantage in \n        the capital marketplace where they must compete with other \n        companies able to use these tax incentives currently.\n            (14) A tax system that does not discriminate would ensure \n        that existing tax incentives in favor of research and \n        experimentation have the same cost-reducing impact on companies \n        conducting both short-term and long-term research and thus \n        render this tax incentive program neutral with regard to short-\n        term and long-term research objectives, minimizing capital \n        marketplace distortions caused by differences in tax and income \n        status.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide that long-term \nbiomedical research corporations will not incur limitations on \nresearch-related tax incentive carryforwards simply because they engage \nin the routine equity financings that are the financial lifeblood of \nthe industry.\n\nSEC. 3.
