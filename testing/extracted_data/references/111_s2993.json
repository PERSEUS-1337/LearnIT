    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``10 Million Solar Roofs and 10 \nMillion Gallons of Solar Water Heating Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1)(A) there is huge potential for increasing the quantity \n        of electricity produced in the United States from distributed \n        solar photovoltaics and solar water heating systems;\n            (B) the use of solar photovoltaics on the roofs of 10 \n        percent of existing buildings could meet 70 percent of peak \n        electric demand; and\n            (C) a key barrier to increased deployment of solar \n        photovoltaic and hot water heating systems is the upfront cost \n        of capital, even though over time the systems are cost-\n        effective;\n            (2) investment in solar photovoltaics technology will \n        create economies of scale that will allow the technology to \n        deliver electricity at prices that are competitive with \n        electricity from fossil fuels;\n            (3) electricity produced from distributed solar \n        photovoltaics helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, does \n        not emit harmful air pollutants, such as mercury, sulfur \n        dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, uses existing rooftop space, and \n        does not require additional land for generation, thereby \n        conserving natural resources and wildlife habitat;\n            (4) electricity produced from distributed solar \n        photovoltaics enhances national energy security and helps to \n        meet peak power demand without requiring the construction and \n        siting of new transmission infrastructure;\n            (5) investments in renewable energy stimulate the \n        development of green jobs in the United States that provide \n        substantial economic benefits;\n            (6)(A) rebate programs in several States have been \n        successful in increasing the quantity of solar energy from \n        distributed solar photovoltaics and solar water heating \n        systems;\n            (B) the State of California leads the United States in \n        installed solar photovoltaic systems and has used rebate \n        programs to promote the installation of more than 500 megawatts \n        of grid-connected solar photovoltaics, with 226 megawatts \n        installed during the 3-year period ending on the date of \n        enactment of this Act due to the Solar Initiative of the State;\n            (C) the State of New Jersey is second in the United States \n        in installed solar photovoltaic systems and has used incentive \n        programs to achieve 90 megawatts of installed solar capacity;\n            (D) the State of Hawaii leads the United States in solar \n        water heating systems installed, and will require all new homes \n        to have solar water heating systems starting in 2010, which is \n        projected to save the average household $600 annually and \n        reduce the oil consumption of the State by 30,000 barrels in \n        2010 alone; and\n            (E) the State of Florida has used consumer and business \n        rebate programs for solar photovoltaic and solar water heating \n        systems and is second in the United States in installed solar \n        hot water systems;\n            (7) despite inventing solar technology, the United States \n        has fallen behind nations with less solar resources because \n        those nations have set in place policies to promote solar \n        energy, and the United States now ranks fourth in installed \n        solar behind Germany, Spain, and Japan;\n            (8) there are more than 1,500,000 solar water heating \n        systems in the United States that rely on a free fuel source, \n        the sun, to provide hot water, and there is enormous potential \n        for additional solar hot water systems to displace fossil fuel \n        use in water heating; and\n            (9) homes in the United States spend more than \n        $13,000,000,000 on energy for water heating, which is \n        equivalent to 11.4 barrels of oil per home and accounts for \n        approximately 30 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions of an \n        average home, but solar water heating systems can reduce the \n        cost of water heating and reduce residential carbon dioxide \n        emissions.\n\nSEC. 3. REBATES FOR PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS \n              AND SOLAR WATER HEATING SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy (referred to in this Act \nas the ``Secretary'') shall establish a program under which the \nSecretary shall provide rebates to eligible individuals or entities for \nthe purchase and installation of solar photovoltaic systems and solar \nwater heating systems for residential and commercial properties in \norder to install, over the 10-year period beginning on the date of \nenactment of this Act, at least--\n            (1) an additional 10,000,000 solar systems in the United \n        States (as compared to the number of solar systems installed in \n        the United States as of the date of enactment of this Act) with \n        a cumulative capacity of at least 30,000 megawatts; and\n            (2) an additional 200,000 solar water heating systems in \n        the United States (as compared to the number of solar water \n        heating systems installed in the United States as of the date \n        of enactment of this Act) with a cumulative capacity of \n        10,000,000 gallons.\n    (b) Eligibility.--\n            (1) In general.--To be eligible for a rebate under this \n        section--\n                    (A) the recipient of the rebate shall be a \n                homeowner, business, nonprofit entity, or State or \n                local government that purchased and installed a solar \n                photovoltaic system or solar water heating system for a \n                property located in the United States;
