FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The participation of young people in public life is \n        thwarted by perceptions that the legislative process is \n        corrupted by special interests which overwhelm ethical concerns \n        in the consideration and formation of public policy, and by a \n        feeling among young people that idealism is disrespected by \n        elected officials.\n            (2) Elie Wiesel's leadership against indifference, \n        intolerance, and injustice encourages political activism by all \n        members of society, and in particular provides inspiration to \n        our youth.\n            (3) Elie Wiesel is a fitting role model for the youth of \n        America.\n            (4) Elie Wiesel has dedicated his life to leadership for \n        social justice and equality for all. He is a survivor of the \n        Holocaust and has worked tirelessly to gain acknowledgment of \n        the atrocities suffered by the Jewish people.\n            (5) Elie Wiesel has published over 40 books dealing with \n        the moral responsibility of all people to fight hatred, racism, \n        and genocide.\n            (6) Elie Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the \n        Congressional Gold Medal, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom \n        in recognition of his many contributions to human rights.\n            (7) A congressional fellowship can create opportunities for \n        young leaders by enabling them to observe directly how public \n        decisions are made.\n            (8) A congressional fellowship can be designed to allow \n        youth to focus on ethical decision-making in preparation for \n        future leadership roles.\n            (9) Such a congressional fellowship should be named the \n        Elie Wiesel Youth Leadership Congressional Fellowship after \n        Elie Wiesel, because Elie Wiesel's service to society will \n        complement and inspire the Fellowship's purpose of developing \n        ethically informed youth leadership.\n\nSEC. 3.
