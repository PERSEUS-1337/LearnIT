    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bridge Life Extension Act of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Corrosion of highway bridges costs the United States \n        economy $8.3 billion each year according to a Federal Highway \n        Administration report (FHWA-RD-01-157) that was delivered to \n        Congress in 2002.\n            (2) The ongoing cost of corrosion on United States highway \n        bridges represents a needless waste of taxpayer dollars.\n            (3) One-third of the ongoing cost of corrosion on United \n        States highway bridges would be saved if existing, fully-\n        developed corrosion prevention technologies were applied to \n        bridge decks and their substructures.\n            (4) The application of corrosion technologies to United \n        States highway bridges is necessary, but currently underused.\n            (5)   The application of corrosion prevention strategies \n        should be required in the design and rehabilitation of bridge \n        structures that use Federal funding and the development of new \n        corrosion prevention technologies should be encouraged.\n\nSEC. 3. CORROSION MITIGATION AND PREVENTION PLANS FOR BRIDGES RECEIVING \n              FEDERAL FUNDING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, is \namended by inserting after section 149 the following:\n``Sec. 150. Corrosion mitigation and prevention plans\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary may approve Federal assistance for \na project for construction of a bridge using amounts apportioned under \nsection 104(b)(1) or 104(b)(3) or a project for replacement or \nrehabilitation of a bridge under section 144 only if--\n            ``(1) the State or States applying for such assistance \n        develop and submit to the Secretary a corrosion mitigation and \n        prevention plan for the bridge; and\n            ``(2) the Secretary approves the plan.\n    ``(b) Plan Requirements.--The Secretary may approve a corrosion \nmitigation and prevention plan for a bridge submitted by a State or \nStates under subsection (a) only if the plan contains, at a minimum, \nthe following:\n            ``(1) An estimate of the expected useful life of the \n        bridge.\n            ``(2) An estimate of environmental exposure of the bridge, \n        including marine, deicer application, industrial, rural, \n        rainfall, temperature, freeze-thaw, and other factors that \n        influence corrosion prevention and corrosion mitigation \n        strategies.\n            ``(3) An identification of the functional classification of \n        the bridge.\n            ``(4) Details of corrosion mitigation and prevention \n        methods that will be used with respect to the bridge, taking \n        into account--\n                    ``(A) material selection;\n                    ``(B) coating considerations;\n                    ``(C) cathodic protection considerations;\n                    ``(D) design considerations for corrosion; and\n                    ``(E) concrete requirements.\n            ``(5) Details of a project maintenance program for the life \n        of the bridge.\n            ``(6) A certification that the plan was developed by the \n        State or States and approved by a corrosion expert.\n            ``(7) A certification that each individual conducting \n        inspections of Federal-aid highway bridges in the State or \n        States receives training from a corrosion expert.\n    ``(c) Approval and Disapproval.--The Secretary shall approve or \ndisapprove each corrosion mitigation and prevention plan submitted by a \nState or States under subsection (a). If the Secretary disapproves a \nplan, the Secretary shall inform the State or States of the reasons for \nthe disapproval and shall permit the State or States to resubmit the \nplan with such modifications as the Secretary determines necessary.\n    ``(d) Modifications Following Plan Approval.--A State or States may \nmodify a corrosion mitigation and prevention plan approved under \nsubsection (c) to incorporate newly developed corrosion prevention \ntechniques, methods, applications, and best practices if the State or \nStates provide advance written notice of the modification to the \nSecretary.\n    ``(e) Corrosion Expert.--In this section, the term ``corrosion \nexpert'' means an individual who is accredited or certified as being \nqualified by an international technical society dedicated to the \nmitigation and prevention of corrosion or who is a registered \nprofessional engineer who has certification or licensing that includes \neducation and experience in corrosion prevention and control of \nbridges.\n    ``(f) Applicability.--\n            ``(1) In general.--This section shall take effect beginning \n        on the first day of the second fiscal year beginning after the \n        date of enactment of this section.\n            ``(2) Waivers.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the \n        Secretary may waive the application of requirements of this \n        section with respect to a bridge for the 6-month period \n        beginning on the first day referred to in paragraph (1) if--\n                    ``(A) a corrosion mitigation and prevention plan \n                has been submitted for the bridge before such first \n                day; and\n                    ``(B) the Secretary determines that such a waiver \n                is appropriate.\n    ``(g) Funding.--Funds made available to a State under sections \n104(b)(1), 104(b)(3), and 144 may be used by the State for activities \nto comply with the requirements of this section.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for such chapter is amended \nby inserting after the item relating to section 149 the following:\n\n``150. Corrosion mitigation and prevention plans.''."
