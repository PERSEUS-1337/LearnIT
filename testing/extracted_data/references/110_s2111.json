    "title": "A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to allow State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and schools to increase implementation of early intervention services, particularly school-wide positive behavior supports.",
    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Positive Behavior for Effective \nSchools Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Educators, parents, and the general public cite a lack \n        of discipline as a leading challenge facing many public \n        schools.\n            (2) Negative and reactive school management practices, such \n        as metal detectors or surveillance cameras, and zero tolerance \n        or other get-tough approaches to school discipline, are \n        ineffective and often counterproductive.\n            (3) Learning is linked to student behavior. Successful \n        schools implement high academic and behavior standards, where \n        improvements in student behavior and school climate are \n        correlated with improved academic outcomes.\n            (4) Effective implementation of positive behavior supports \n        is linked to greater academic achievement, significantly fewer \n        disciplinary problems, lower suspension and expulsion rates, \n        and increased time for instruction.\n            (5) Evidence-based and scientifically valid practices for \n        improving behavior and creating a school climate more conducive \n        to learning have not been widely adopted, accurately \n        implemented, or sustained.\n            (6) Early intervening services are an effective strategy \n        for instructional support. Following implementation of positive \n        behavior support, out-of-school suspensions at an elementary \n        school in Illinois decreased 85 percent, from 243 to 37 or \n        fewer in 2 subsequent years, with a resultant gain of 386 days \n        of instructional time. The percentage of students meeting or \n        exceeding proficiency on State standards increased measurably.\n            (7) Problem behaviors can be minimized with effective \n        positive behavior support, including active supervision, \n        positive feedback, and social skills instruction, which reduce \n        the need for more intensive and more costly interventions. Upon \n        implementing such supports, an elementary school in Maryland \n        witnessed a decrease in office discipline referrals for major \n        rule violations by 42 percent, recouping 119 days of \n        instructional time for students, and 40 days of administrator \n        time, within 1 school year.\n            (8) Schools that implement school-wide positive behavior \n        supports are perceived by teachers to be safer teaching \n        environments. In South Carolina, a school using a system of \n        positive behavior supports found that teacher transfer requests \n        declined by 100 percent and teacher absence days decreased by \n        36 percent.\n            (9) When approaches such as positive behavior support are \n        paired with effective interventions and services for students \n        with significant needs, all students, including those with the \n        most challenging behaviors, can succeed.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to expand the use of \npositive behavior supports and other early intervening services in \nschools in order to systematically create a school climate that is \nhighly conducive to learning, to reduce discipline referrals, and to \nimprove student academic outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``positive behavior support'' means a \nsystematic approach to embed proven practices for early intervening \nservices, including a range of systemic and individualized strategies \nto reinforce desired behaviors and eliminate reinforcement for problem \nbehaviors, in order to achieve important social outcomes and increase \nstudent learning, while preventing problem behaviors.\n\nSEC. 4. SCHOOLWIDE POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT.\n\n    (a) Flexibility To Use Title I Funds To Implement School-Wide \nPositive Behavior Support.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 1003(b) of the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6303(b)) is \n        amended--\n                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as \n                subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively;\n                    (B) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``Of the amount''; \n                and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(2) Of the amount reserved under subsection (a) for any fiscal \nyear, the State educational agency may allocate funds to develop and \nimplement coordinated, early intervening services (including school-\nwide positive behavior supports) for all students, including those who \nhave not been identified as needing special education but who need \nadditional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general \neducation environment.
