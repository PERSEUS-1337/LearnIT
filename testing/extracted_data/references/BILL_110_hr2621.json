FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the National Center for Education \n        Statistics, over the next 10 years, the United States will need \n        more than 2,000,000 new teachers to replace the teachers who \n        are retiring or leaving the classroom for other careers.\n            (2) The Hart-Rudman National Security Report on education \n        recommended that the President direct the Department of \n        Education to work with the States to devise a comprehensive \n        plan to avert a looming shortage of high-quality teachers.\n            (3) According to the National Center for Education \n        Statistics, 20 percent of all new teachers leave the teaching \n        profession within 3 years. Providing loan forgiveness or loan \n        cancellation is one step that would help retain high-quality \n        teachers in schools that need teachers.\n            (4) The American Hospital Association has reported more \n        than 118,000 unfilled registered nurse positions in hospitals \n        in the United States. Additionally, the National Commission on \n        Nursing Workforce for Long-Term Care released a report in May, \n        2005, stating that there are nearly 100,000 vacant nursing \n        positions in long-term care facilities on any given day, and \n        the nurse turnover rate exceeds 50 percent. The shortage is \n        costing long-term care facilities an estimated $4 billion a \n        year in recruitment and training expenses.\n            (5) College loans are more of a burden than ever for \n        students and families. According to a recent United States \n        Public Interest Research Group report, average student loan \n        debt almost doubled from $9,200 in 1992-1993 to $16,928 in \n        1999-2000.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve access to, and \nthe delivery of, high-quality educational and health services \nthroughout the United States by reducing the shortage of qualified \nteachers and nurses.\n\nSEC. 3. LOAN FORGIVENESS.\n\n    (a) Loan Forgiveness.--Section 428J of the Higher Education Act of \n1965 (20 U.S.C. 1078-10) is amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 428J.
