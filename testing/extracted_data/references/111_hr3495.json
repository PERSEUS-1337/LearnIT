    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving \nEquitable Access to Community-based Home Health (PEACH) Act of 2009''.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to preserve access to \nhome health services for all Americans, regardless of their ability to \npay or their severity of illness.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Medicare home health benefit is vulnerable to \n        agency selection of the most profitable beneficiaries and \n        avoidance of the most complex and costly beneficiaries.\n            (2) Such ``cherry picking'' by some home health agencies \n        compromises access to care for the most complex, highest risk \n        beneficiaries.\n            (3) The Government Accountability Office has reported that \n        hospital discharge planners have difficulty placing more than \n        10 percent of eligible patients in home health due to their \n        extensive care needs.\n            (4) Proposals to reduce Medicare payments to home health \n        agencies (in response to large aggregate margins across all \n        home health agencies) may undermine the financial viability of \n        mission-driven and non-profit home health agencies, which often \n        have low to negative margins, while allowing high-margin \n        agencies to remain in operation.\n\nSEC. 3. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR PEACH AGENCIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--There shall be established a fund (to be known as \nthe ``PEACH fund'') from which home health agencies meeting specified \ncriteria shall be paid supplemental amounts in addition to their \nstatutory payment amounts under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. \nIs this to be a trust fund? Where is this fund to be established? Who \nadminsters it? What are the sources of funding that goes into the fund? \nWhat are the allowed uses of such funding?\n    (b) Peach Program.--Title XVIII of the Social Security Act is \namended by inserting after section 1895 the following new section:\n\n               ``supplemental payments for peach agencies\n\n    ``Sec. 1895A.
