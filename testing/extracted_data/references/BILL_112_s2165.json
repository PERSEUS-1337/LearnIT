FINDINGS.\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Since 1948, United States Presidents and both houses of \n    Congress, on a bipartisan basis and supported by the American \n    people, have repeatedly reaffirmed the special bond between the \n    United States and Israel, based on shared values and shared \n    interests.\n        (2) The Middle East is undergoing rapid change, bringing with \n    it hope for an expansion of democracy but also great challenges to \n    the national security of the United States and our allies in the \n    region, particularly to our most important ally in the region, \n    Israel.\n        (3) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is \n    continuing its decades-long pattern of seeking to foment \n    instability and promote extremism in the Middle East, particularly \n    in this time of dramatic political transition.\n        (4) At the same time, the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n    Iran continues to enrich uranium in defiance of multiple United \n    Nations Security Council resolutions.\n        (5) A nuclear-weapons capable Iran would fundamentally threaten \n    vital United States interests, encourage regional nuclear \n    proliferation, further empower Iran, the world's leading state \n    sponsor of terror, and pose a serious and destabilizing threat to \n    Israel and the region.\n        (6) Over the past several years, with the assistance of the \n    Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Syria, Hizbollah \n    and Hamas have increased their stockpile of rockets, with more than \n    60,000 now ready to be fired at Israel. The Government of the \n    Islamic Republic of Iran continues to add to its arsenal of \n    ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, which threaten Iran's \n    neighbors, Israel, and United States Armed Forces in the region.\n        (7) As a result, Israel is facing a fundamentally altered \n    strategic environment.\n        (8) Pursuant to chapter 5 of title 1 of the Emergency Wartime \n    Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11; 117 Stat. \n    576), the authority to make available loan guarantees to Israel is \n    currently set to expire on September 30, 2012.\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n    It is the policy of the United States:\n        (1) To reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the security of \n    the State of Israel as a Jewish state. As President Barack Obama \n    stated on December 16, 2011, ``America's commitment and my \n    commitment to Israel and Israel's security is unshakeable.'' And as \n    President George W. Bush stated before the Israeli Knesset on May \n    15, 2008, on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the State of \n    Israel, ``The alliance between our governments is unbreakable, yet \n    the source of our friendship runs deeper than any treaty.''.\n        (2) To help the Government of Israel preserve its qualitative \n    military edge amid rapid and uncertain regional political \n    transformation.\n        (3) To veto any one-sided anti-Israel resolutions at the United \n    Nations Security Council.\n        (4) To support Israel's inherent right to self-defense.\n        (5) To pursue avenues to expand cooperation with the Government \n    of Israel both in defense and across the spectrum of civilian \n    sectors, including high technology, agriculture, medicine, health, \n    pharmaceuticals, and energy.\n        (6) To assist the Government of Israel with its ongoing efforts \n    to forge a peaceful, negotiated settlement of the Israeli-\n    Palestinian conflict that results in two states living side-by-side \n    in peace and security, and to encourage Israel's neighbors to \n    recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state.\n        (7) To encourage further development of advanced technology \n    programs between the United States and Israel given current trends \n    and instability in the region.\nSEC. 4. UNITED STATES ACTIONS TO ASSIST IN THE DEFENSE OF ISRAEL AND \nPROTECT UNITED STATES INTERESTS.\n    It is the sense of Congress that the United States Government \nshould take the following actions to assist in the defense of Israel:\n        (1) Seek to enhance the capabilities of the Governments of the \n    United States and Israel to address emerging common threats, \n    increase security cooperation, and expand joint military exercises.\n        (2) Provide the Government of Israel such support as may be \n    necessary to increase development and production of joint missile \n    defense systems, particularly such systems that defend against the \n    urgent threat posed to Israel and United States forces in the \n    region.\n        (3) Provide the Government of Israel assistance specifically \n    for the production and procurement of the Iron Dome defense system \n    for purposes of intercepting short-range missiles, rockets, and \n    projectiles launched against Israel.\n        (4) Provide the Government of Israel defense articles and \n    defense services through such mechanisms as appropriate, to include \n    air refueling tankers, missile defense capabilities, and \n    specialized munitions.\n        (5) Provide the Government of Israel additional excess defense \n    articles, as appropriate, in the wake of the withdrawal of United \n    States forces from Iraq.\n        (6) Examine ways to strengthen existing and ongoing efforts, \n    including the Gaza Counter Arms Smuggling Initiative, aimed at \n    preventing weapons smuggling into Gaza pursuant to the 2009 \n    agreement following the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as well as \n    measures to protect against weapons smuggling and terrorist threats \n    from the Sinai Peninsula.\n        (7) Offer the Air Force of Israel additional training and \n    exercise opportunities in the United States to compensate for \n    Israel's limited air space.\n        (8) Work to encourage an expanded role for Israel with the \n    North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), including an enhanced \n    presence at NATO headquarters and exercises.\n        (9) Expand already-close intelligence cooperation, including \n    satellite intelligence, with Israel.\nSEC. 5.
