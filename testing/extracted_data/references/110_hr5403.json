Revenues distributed by \n        or received from the 13th Regional Corporation are not subject \n        to the requirements of subsections (j), (k), (l), (m), and (n) \n        of this section.\n            (B) The Regional Corporations, including the 13th Regional \n        Corporation shall determine the revenues required to be \n        distributed pursuant to this subsection in accordance with the \n        section 7(i) Settlement Agreement by and between the 12 \n        Regional Corporations created pursuant to subsection (a), as \n        previously or hereafter amended, and shall be bound by the \n        provisions of that Agreement with respect to the revenues they \n        distribute. The 13th Regional Corporation shall be bound by any \n        amendment to the section 7(i) Settlement Agreement unless the \n        amendment is not of general applicability to the other Regional \n        Corporations. Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n        grant the 13th Regional Corporation any rights with respect to \n        any revenues distributed by the 12 Regional Corporations \n        pursuant to section 7(i), or to grant the 13th Regional \n        Corporation the right or power to approve any amendment to the \n        section 7(i) Settlement Agreement."
