FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The worldwide trafficking of persons has a \n        disproportionate impact on women and girls and has been and \n        continues to be condemned by the international community as a \n        violation of fundamental human rights.\n            (2) The fastest growing international trafficking business \n        is the trade in women, whereby women and girls seeking a better \n        life, a good marriage, or a lucrative job abroad, unexpectedly \n        find themselves in situations of forced prostitution, sweatshop \n        labor, exploitative domestic servitude, or battering and \n        extreme cruelty.\n            (3) Trafficked women and children, girls and boys, are \n        often subjected to rape and other forms of sexual abuse by \n        their traffickers and often held as virtual prisoners by their \n        exploiters, made to work in slavery-like conditions, in debt \n        bondage without pay and against their will.\n            (4) The President, the First Lady, the Secretary of State, \n        the President's Interagency Council on Women, and the Agency \n        for International Development have all identified trafficking \n        in women as a significant problem.\n            (5) The Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing \n        Conference) called on all governments to take measures, \n        including legislative measures, to provide better protection of \n        the rights of women and girls in trafficking, to address the \n        root factors that put women and girls at risk to traffickers, \n        and to take measures to dismantle the national, regional, and \n        international networks on trafficking.\n            (6) The United Nations General Assembly, noting its concern \n        about the increasing number of women and girls who are being \n        victimized by traffickers, passed a resolution in 1998 calling \n        upon all governments to criminalize trafficking in women and \n        girls in all its forms and to penalize all those offenders \n        involved, while ensuring that the victims of these practices \n        are not penalized.\n            (7) Numerous treaties to which the United States is a party \n        address government obligations to combat trafficking, including \n        such treaties as the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the \n        Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and \n        Practices Similar to Slavery, which calls for the complete \n        abolition of debt bondage and servile forms of marriage, and \n        the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, which undertakes \n        to suppress and requires signatories not to make use of any \n        forced or compulsory labor.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to condemn and combat the \ninternational crime of trafficking in women and children and to assist \nthe victims of this crime by--\n            (1) setting a standard by which governments are evaluated \n        for their response to trafficking and their treatment of \n        victims;\n            (2) authorizing and funding an interagency task force to \n        carry out such evaluations and to issue an annual report of its \n        findings to include the identification of foreign governments \n        that tolerate or participate in trafficking and fail to \n        cooperate with international efforts to prosecute perpetrators;\n            (3) assisting trafficking victims in the United States by \n        providing humanitarian assistance and by providing them \n        temporary nonimmigrant status in the United States;\n            (4) assisting trafficking victims abroad by providing \n        humanitarian assistance; and\n            (5) denying certain forms of United States foreign \n        assistance to those governments which tolerate or participate \n        in trafficking, abuse victims, and fail to cooperate with \n        international efforts to prosecute perpetrators.\n\nSEC. 4.
