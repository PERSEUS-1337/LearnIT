FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A network of ports and harbors is essential to the \n        United States economy, competitiveness in world trade, and \n        national security. Approximately 95 percent of United States \n        overseas trade moves on ships in and out of United States \n        ports.\n            (2) The Nation's coastal, ocean, and freshwater resources \n        are critical assets which must be protected, conserved, and \n        restored. These resources provide numerous economic and \n        environmental benefits.\n            (3) Port facilities serve as a key link in the intermodal \n        transportation chain and can realize their full potential as \n        magnets for shipping and commerce only if timely, cost-\n        effective, and environmentally sound dredging and dredged \n        material management occurs.\n            (4) Approximately 400,000,000 cubic yards of sediment are \n        dredged from our Nation's ports each year, 300,000,000 cubic \n        yards of which is dredged from Federal channels.\n            (5) Improved environmental responsibility requires that \n        dredged material demonstrating a potential to unreasonably \n        degrade human health or the environment be appropriately \n        managed to minimize negative environmental interactions, yet \n        suitable disposal sites are often not readily available.\n            (6) All Federal navigation dredging projects are approved \n        because they are in the national interest and therefore should \n        not be blocked because of a lack of disposal capacity that \n        meets the necessary Federal requirements.\n            (7) The cost of disposal and management of sediments \n        dredged in the course of constructing and maintaining a \n        navigation project are integral to the total project costs and \n        as such should be cost shared according to the allocations \n        under existing law.\n            (8) Inconsistent cost-sharing policies for the use of open \n        water, upland, and confined disposal facilities create an \n        economic incentive to use open water disposal sites even when \n        more environmentally positive alternatives are preferable.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide Federal-non-\nFederal cost sharing for the construction and operation of confined \ndisposal facilities for contaminated dredged materials in order to make \nsuitable alternatives to open water disposal available nationwide.\n\nSEC. 3. CREATION OF CONFINED DREDGED MATERIAL DISPOSAL FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) Federal Share.--Section 101(b) of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2211(b)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``The Federal share'' and inserting the \n        following:\n            ``(1) General federal share.--The Federal share'';\n            (2) by moving the text of paragraph (1), as so designated, \n        2 ems to the right; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(2) Federal share for confined disposal facilities.--The \n        Federal share of the cost of project features that are \n        necessary for creation of confined dredged material disposal \n        facilities shall be determined in accordance with subsection \n        (a)(1). The cost sharing requirements of this paragraph shall \n        apply to projects authorized before, on, or after the the date \n        of the enactment of this paragraph.\n            ``(3) Confined disposal facility defined.--In this section \n        and section 210, the term `confined disposal facility' means \n        any alternative to ocean disposal or ocean disposal with \n        capping, including subaqueous borrow pits, containment islands, \n        and upland confined disposal facilities.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 101 of such Act is further \namended--\n            (1) in the second sentence of subsection (a)(2)--\n                    (A) by inserting ``and'' after ``rights-of-way,''; \n                and\n                    (B) by striking ``, and dredged material disposal \n                areas'';\n            (2) in subsection (a)(3)--\n                    (A) by inserting ``and'' after ``rights-of-way,''; \n                and\n                    (B) by striking ``, and dredged material disposal \n                areas'' and inserting ``, including those required for \n                confined dredged material disposal facilities,''; and\n            (3) in subsection (e)(1) by striking ``, and to provide \n        dredged material disposal areas''.\n\nSEC. 4. FUNDING FROM HARBOR MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND.\n\n    Section 210 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (33 \nU.S.C. 2238) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) Inclusion of Disposal Costs as O&M Costs.--For purposes of \nthis section, the term `operation and maintenance costs' includes costs \nrelated to disposal of dredged materials in a confined dredged material \ndisposal facility. Operation and maintenance costs other than costs \nrelated to such disposal shall receive priority consideration for \nfunding from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.''.\n\nSEC. 5.         CONFINED DISPOSAL FACILITY IN THE PORT OF NEW YORK AND \n              NEW JERSEY.\n\n    (a) Creation and Operation.--Not later than 18 months after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Army, in \ncooperation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency and State and local governmental agencies, shall create, \noperate, and maintain a         confined dredged material disposal \nfacility in the Port of New York and New Jersey. The facility shall be \ndesigned for the disposal of dredged materials that do not meet \napplicable criteria for open water disposal."
