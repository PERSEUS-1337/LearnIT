FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The economic and national security interests of the \n        United States are enhanced when--\n                    (A) the United States military has affordable and \n                timely access to commercially-available automotive \n                products and technologies, including products and \n                technologies relating to safety, vehicle handling, and \n                fuel efficiency; and\n                    (B) companies doing business in the United States \n                can freely export commercially-available automotive \n                products and technologies that would not make a \n                significant contribution to the military potential of \n                other countries, except to countries, organizations, \n                and individuals that are subject to United States trade \n                sanctions.\n            (2) The economic and national security interests of the \n        United States are not advanced by export control regulations \n        that restrict the United States military's access to \n        commercially-available automotive products and technologies \n        that either--\n                    (A) are widely available for use on non-military \n                automotive vehicles; or\n                    (B) would not make a significant contribution to \n                the military potential of other countries.\n            (3) Current and proposed United States export control \n        regulations result in unnecessary restrictions on commercially-\n        available automotive products and technologies, including--\n                    (A) the need to obtain a license from the \n                Department of State or Department of Commerce before \n                exporting commercially-available automotive products \n                and technologies if modified even in insignificant ways \n                for use on a military vehicle; and\n                    (B) the need to obtain a license from the \n                Department of State or Department of Commerce before \n                placing the specifications for such products on a \n                computer system to which a foreign national worker has \n                access.\n            (4) None of the multilateral export control regimes of \n        which the Unites States is a party requires the export \n        restrictions that currently apply to commercially-available \n        automotive products and technologies.\n            (5) The unnecessary restrictions described in this section \n        limit the ability of the United States military to procure \n        commercially-available automotive products and technologies in \n        a timely and affordable manner, adversely affect the safety and \n        fuel economy of United States military vehicles, put the United \n        States military at a comparative disadvantage against its \n        adversaries, create barriers to job creation in the United \n        States, burden taxpayers unnecessarily with increased costs for \n        military vehicles and related parts and components, place \n        unnecessary regulatory burdens on United States companies, and \n        waste valuable licensing and enforcement resources on \n        controlling the exportation of militarily insignificant \n        products and technologies.\n\nSEC. 3.
