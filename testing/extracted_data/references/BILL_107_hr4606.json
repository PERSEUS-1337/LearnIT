FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Alzheimer's disease is a disorder that destroys cells \n        in the brain. The disease is the leading cause of dementia, a \n        condition that involves gradual memory loss, decline in the \n        ability to perform routine tasks, disorientation, difficulty in \n        learning, loss of language skills, impairment of judgment, and \n        personality changes. As the disease progresses, people with \n        Alzheimer's disease become unable to care for themselves. The \n        loss of brain cells eventually leads to the failure of other \n        systems in the body.\n            (2) In the United States, 4,000,000 people have Alzheimer's \n        disease and 19,000,000 people say that they have a family \n        member with the disease. By 2050, 14,000,000 people in the \n        United States will have Alzheimer's disease unless science \n        finds a way to prevent or cure the disease.\n            (3) One in 10 people over the age of 65, and nearly half of \n        those over the age of 85 have Alzheimer's disease. Younger \n        people also get the disease.\n            (4) The Alzheimer's disease process may begin in the brain \n        as many as 20 years before the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease \n        appear. A person will live an average of 8 years and as many as \n        20 once the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease appear.\n            (5) The average lifetime cost of Alzheimer's disease, per \n        person, is $174,000. The total annual cost of Alzheimer's \n        disease care in the United States today is not less than \n        $100,000,000,000.\n            (6) In 2000, medicare alone spent $31,900,000,000 for the \n        care of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and this amount is \n        projected to increase to $49,300,000,000 in 2010.\n            (7) Forty-nine percent of medicare beneficiaries who have \n        Alzheimer's disease also receive medicaid. Of the total \n        population dually eligible for medicare and medicaid, 22 \n        percent have Alzheimer's disease.\n            (8) Seven in 10 people with Alzheimer's disease live at \n        home. While almost 75 percent of home care is provided by \n        family and friends, the average annual cost of paid care for \n        people with Alzheimer's disease at home is $12,500.\n            (9) At least half of all nursing home residents have \n        Alzheimer's disease or another dementia. The average annual \n        cost of Alzheimer's disease nursing home care is $42,000 but \n        exceeds $70,000 in some areas. Medicaid pays nearly half of the \n        total nursing home bill and helps 2 out of 3 residents pay for \n        their care. Medicaid expenditures for nursing home care for \n        people with Alzheimer's disease are estimated to increase from \n        $18,200,000,000 in 2000 to $33,000,000,000 in 2010.\n            (10) In fiscal year 2002, the Federal Government will spend \n        an estimated $585,000,000 on Alzheimer's disease research, a \n        modest investment when compared with the annual \n        $100,000,000,000 cost of the disease. If science can find a way \n        to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease symptoms for even 5 \n        years, our Nation will save at least $50,000,000,000 in annual \n        health and long term care costs.\n            (11) Seventy percent of people with Alzheimer's disease \n        live at home where families provide at least 75 percent of \n        their care.\n            (12) A study commissioned by the United Hospital Fund \n        estimated that the annual value of this informal care system is \n        $196,000,000,000. Family caregiving comes at enormous physical, \n        emotional, and financial sacrifice, putting the whole system at \n        risk.\n            (13) One in 8 Alzheimer's disease caregivers becomes ill or \n        injured as a direct result of caregiving. One in 3 uses \n        medication for problems related to caregiving. Older caregivers \n        are 3 times more likely to become clinically depressed than \n        others in their age group.\n            (14) Elderly spouses strained by caregiving are 63 percent \n        more likely to die during a given 4-year period than other \n        spouses their age.\n            (15) Three of 4 caregivers are women. One in 3 has children \n        or grandchildren under the age of 18 living at home. Caregiving \n        leaves them less time for other family members and they are \n        much more likely to report family conflicts because of their \n        caregiving role.\n            (16) Most Alzheimer's disease caregivers work outside the \n        home before beginning their caregiving careers, but caregiving \n        forces them to miss work, cut back to part-time, take less \n        demanding jobs, choose early retirement, or give up work \n        altogether. As a result, in 2002, Alzheimer's disease will cost \n        American business an estimated $36,500,000,000 in lost \n        productivity, as well as an additional $24,600,000,000 in \n        business contributions to the total cost of care.\n\nSEC. 3.
