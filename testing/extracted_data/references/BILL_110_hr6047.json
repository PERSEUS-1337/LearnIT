FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Section 506(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n        Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356(a)(1)) requires the Secretary of \n        Health and Human Services, at the request of the sponsor of a \n        new drug, to ``facilitate the development and expedite the \n        review of such drug if it is intended for the treatment of a \n        serious or life-threatening condition and it demonstrates the \n        potential to address unmet medical needs for such a \n        condition'', designating such a drug to be a ``fast track \n        product''.\n            (2) Section 506(b)(1) of such Act, however, provides that \n        the Secretary need not approve an application for approval of a \n        fast track product, even though the Secretary has determined \n        ``that the product has an effect on a clinical endpoint or on a \n        surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict \n        clinical benefit''.\n            (3) Section 312.34(a) of title 21, of the Code of Federal \n        Regulations, provides for treatment use of a new drug, although \n        such ``drug . . . is not yet approved for marketing,'' but is \n        ``under clinical investigation for a serious or immediately \n        life-threatening disease condition in patients for whom no \n        comparable or satisfactory alternative drug or other therapy is \n        available''.\n            (4) Although the stated purpose of both current law and \n        regulations, as stated under section 312.34(a) of such title, \n        is ``to facilitate the availability of promising new drugs to \n        desperately ill patients as early in the drug development \n        process as possible, before general marketing begins'', in \n        practice applications for approval of promising therapies \n        intended to treat such desperately ill patients suffering from \n        serious and immediately life-threatening diseases for whom no \n        comparable or alternative drug or other therapy is available \n        have encountered unjustified delays and denials.\n            (5) As a consequence of such delays and denials of \n        applications for such treatment use, desperately ill patients \n        suffering from serious and immediately life-threatening disease \n        conditions have been denied the last, and perhaps the only, \n        best chance for treatment protocols that might have saved their \n        lives.\n            (6) Applications for such treatment use ought not be \n        subject to the discretion of the Secretary, but should be \n        granted, in all cases, if such applications meet the statutory \n        criteria governing such applications.\n            (7) Applications for fast track product review ought not be \n        subject to the discretion of the Secretary, but should be \n        granted, in all cases, if such applications meet the statutory \n        criteria governing such applications as set forth in section \n        506(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n        U.S.C. 356(b)(1)).\n\nSEC. 3. TREATMENT USE APPROVAL SYSTEM.\n\n    Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n355) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(v) Treatment Use of an Investigational Drug.--\n            ``(1) In general.--A drug that is not approved for \n        marketing, but is under clinical investigation for a serious or \n        immediately life-threatening disease condition in patients for \n        whom no comparable or satisfactory alternative drug or other \n        therapy is available, shall be made available for treatment use \n        by an individual patient if--\n                    ``(A) the drug is intended to treat a serious or \n                immediately life-threatening disease condition;\n                    ``(B) there is no comparable or satisfactory \n                alternative drug or other therapy available to treat \n                that stage of the disease in the person for whom the \n                drug is intended;\n                    ``(C) the drug is under investigation in a \n                controlled clinical trial as an investigational new \n                drug under subsection (i) in effect for the trial or \n                all clinical trials have been completed;
