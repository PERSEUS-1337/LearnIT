    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Currency Harmonization Initiative \nthrough Neutralizing Action Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The benefit of trade concessions can be adversely \n        affected by misalignments in currency.\n            (2) Misalignments in currency caused by government policies \n        intended to maintain an unfair trade advantage nullify and \n        impair trade concessions.\n            (3) Under article XV of the GATT 1994, a country is \n        considered to be manipulating its currency to obtain an unfair \n        trade advantage if--\n                    (A) its currency manipulation has a subsidy-like \n                effect;\n                    (B) its currency manipulation constitutes a \n                nullification and impairment of the benefits of the \n                GATT 1994; or\n                    (C) its currency manipulation results in a \n                contravention of the intention of the GATT 1994.\n            (4) The International Monetary Fund also prohibits the use \n        of currency manipulation as a method of gaining unfair trade \n        advantage. The International Monetary Fund defines such \n        manipulation as large-scale and protracted intervention in one \n        direction to gain an unfair trade advantage.\n            (5) Sections 301 through 309 of the Trade Act of 1974 \n        contain the authority under United States law to take \n        retaliatory action, including import restrictions, to enforce \n        the rights of the United States against any unjustifiable, \n        unreasonable, or discriminatory practice or policy of a country \n        that burdens or restricts United States commerce.\n            (6) In 2002, the United States trade deficit with the \n        People's Republic of China exceeded $103,000,000,000, the \n        largest bilateral trade deficit in the world. Based on the \n        first four months of 2003, the United States trade deficit with \n        the People's Republic of China is estimated to reach more than \n        $120,000,000,000 in 2003.\n            (7) United States imports from the People's Republic of \n        China have been growing at more than twice the rate of United \n        States exports to that country.\n            (8) The People's Republic of China is accumulating foreign \n        currency reserves, mostly United States dollars, at a rate of \n        more than $6,000,000,000 per month; this intervention has kept \n        the Chinese renminbi (RMB) from appreciating despite large \n        trade surpluses and investment flows. China's total foreign \n        currency reserves currently stand at almost $300,000,000,000.\n            (9) The People's Republic of China has kept its currency \n        pegged at approximately 8.3 RMB to the dollar since 1994.\n            (10) The large and growing trade surplus of the People's \n        Republic of China with the United States strongly suggests that \n        the RMB is undervalued against the dollar. Recently, economists \n        have estimated that the RMB is undervalued against the United \n        States dollar by as much as 40 percent.\n            (11) Import tariffs of the People's Republic of China \n        currently average about 15 percent. Assuming the recent \n        estimates of Chinese RMB undervaluation against the dollar are \n        correct, the effect of a free and open currency market would be \n        more than twice as large as the effect of eliminating every \n        tariff that the People's Republic of China imposes on United \n        States goods.\n            (12) In the long run, revaluation of the RMB by the \n        Government of the People's Republic of China would mitigate the \n        ever increasing United States trade deficit with that country.\n            (13) The President should formally initiate action against \n        the People's Republic of China, on account of the manipulation \n        of its currency, pursuant to article XV of the GATT 1994, the \n        rules of the International Monetary Fund, and sections 301 \n        through 309 of the Trade Act of 1974.\n    (b) Definition.--In this section the term ``GATT 1994'' has the \nmeaning given that term in section 2 of the Uruguay Round Agreements \nAct (19 U.S.C. 3501).\n\nSEC. 3. ANALYSIS OF AND REPORT ON EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES OF CHINA.\n\n    (a) Analysis.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, upon the \nenactment of this Act and annually thereafter, analyze the exchange \nrate policies of the People's Republic of China in order to determine \nwhether that country manipulates the rate of exchange between the \ncurrency of that country and the United States dollar for purposes of \npreventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining an \nunfair competitive advantage in international trade.\n    (b) Computation of Rate of Manipulation.--If the Secretary of the \nTreasury makes an affirmative determination under subsection (a), the \nSecretary shall compute the rate of manipulation against the dollar in \nthe form of a percentage.\n    (c) Reports to Congress.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \nsubmit to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \nRepresentatives and to the Committee on Finance of the Senate a report \non the Secretary's analysis and findings under subsection (a), and any \nrate computed under subsection (b). The report shall be submitted--\n            (1) with respect to the analysis conducted upon the \n        enactment of this Act, not later than 60 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act; and\n            (2) with respect to each subsequent analysis, at the end of \n        each 1-year period thereafter.\n\nSEC. 4. ADDITIONAL TARIFFS.\n\n    (a) Additional Tariff.--In any case in which a report of the \nSecretary of the Treasury submitted under section 3(c) includes a rate \nof manipulation under section 3(b), the Secretary shall, not later than \n30 days after the report is submitted, impose on all products of China \nthat enter the customs territory of the United States, in addition to \nany duty that otherwise applies, a tariff equal to the applicable \npercentage of the appraised value of the product at the time of entry. \nFor purposes of this subsection, the ``applicable percentage'' is the \npercentage equal to the rate of manipulation.\n    (b) Annual Modification.--Any tariff imposed under subsection (a) \nshall be modified annually to the extent necessary to comply with the \nmost recent report of the Secretary of the Treasury under section 3(c)."
