PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To remedy the inequitable distribution of State and \n        local funds within the areas served by local educational \n        agencies.\n            (2) To reinforce the supplementary intent of funds made \n        available under title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n        Education Act of 1965, ensuring that these funds serve their \n        original purpose of subsidizing the increased costs associated \n        with educating students in concentrated poverty.\n            (3) To address the statutory, regulatory, and enforcement \n        weaknesses that have undermined the role of the comparability \n        requirement in ensuring comparability within school districts.\n            (4) To require the inclusion of real teacher salaries in \n        calculations of per-pupil expenditures.\n            (5) To provide sufficient transparency, accountability, and \n        disclosure to allow parents, communities, educators, and local \n        agency officials to ensure students have access to the \n        resources they need to achieve at high levels.\n\nSEC. 3.
