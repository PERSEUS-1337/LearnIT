SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Raise And Index to Sustainably and \nEfficiently Invest in Transportation Act of 2017'' or the ``RAISE IT \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since the passage of SAFETEA-LU, Congress has \n        transferred over $140 billion from the General Fund to the \n        Highway Trust Fund, in order to maintain solvency.\n            (2) The Congressional Budget Office estimates after the end \n        of Fiscal year 2021, annual General Fund transfers of over $20 \n        billion will be necessary in order to maintain current Highway \n        Trust Fund spending levels.\n            (3) The American Society for Civil Engineers estimates that \n        in order to meet our economic and transportation needs, the \n        United States should invest an additional $1.1 trillion in our \n        surface transportation system by 2025.\n            (4) The National Commission on Fiscal Reform and \n        Responsibility report, often referred to as the ``Simpson-\n        Bowles'' plan, includes a recommendation to raise the gas tax \n        by fifteen cents.\n            (5) The National Surface Transportation Infrastructure \n        Financing Commission recommended, in their 2009 report, that \n        Congress take action to prevent the Highway Trust Fund from \n        becoming insolvent, and to avoid any reductions in \n        infrastructure spending. The Commission also noted that a \n        Federal funding system based on a vehicle miles traveled \n        system, is the consensus choice for the future.\n            (6) Nine different states raised gas taxes to generate \n        transportation revenue in 2015 and 2016.\n    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Replacement of Gas Tax.--It is the \nsense of Congress that by 2027 the gas tax should be repealed and \nreplaced with a more sustainable, stable funding source.\n\nSEC. 3.
