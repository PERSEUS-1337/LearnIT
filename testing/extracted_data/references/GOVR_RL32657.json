    "content": "Reliable documents that accurately indicate the status and identity of the bearer are critical to the effective administration of immigration law. A range of documents, including immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, permits, border crossing cards, and alien registration receipt cards, may enable an alien to enter the United States and/or be eligible for various benefits for the duration of his or her stay. The integrity of the immigration system depends on the genuineness of (1) the documents indicating the eligibility of an alien to enter and remain in the United States or receive certain benefits and (2) the records and papers submitted to obtain such documents. To enter or remain in the United States and be eligible for various immigration-related benefits, aliens must comply with a number of document requirements under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended. Attempts to circumvent these document requirements have been prohibited and punishable since at least 1924. Under the INA, an alien who uses, acquires, or produces fraudulent documents for immigration-related purposes may be subjected to civil penalties and denied certain immigration benefits, including the ability to enter or remain in the United States. Further, certain fraudulent actions may carry criminal penalties under both the INA and the United States Criminal Code. This report discusses the primary civil, criminal, and immigration-related penalties associated with immigration-related document fraud. It does not discuss criminal statutes generally barring fraud or identity theft (other than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028) that could also potentially be used to penalize immigration-related document fraud. The primary provision of the INA concerning immigration-related document fraud is INA \u00a7\u00a0274C. In general, INA \u00a7 274C prohibits the fraudulent production, use, or possession of documents in order either (1) to acquire benefits under the INA or (2) to satisfy an INA requirement. Specifically, INA \u00a7 274C makes it unlawful for any person or entity (including non-aliens) to knowingly forge, counterfeit, alter, or falsely make any document for the purpose of satisfying an INA requirement or obtaining a benefit under the INA; use, attempt to use, possess, obtain, accept, receive, or provide any forged, counterfeit, altered, or falsely made document for the purpose of satisfying an INA requirement or obtaining a benefit under the INA; use, attempt to use, provide, or attempt to provide any document lawfully issued to or with respect to a person other than the possessor for the purpose of satisfying an INA requirement or obtaining a benefit under the INA; accept, receive or provide any document lawfully issued to or with respect to a person other than the possessor for the purpose of complying with INA \u00a7\u00a0274A(b) (relating to alien employment verification) or obtaining a benefit under the INA; prepare, file, or assist another in preparing or filing, any application for benefits under the INA, or any document required under the INA, or any document submitted in connection with such application or document, with knowledge or in reckless disregard of the fact that such application or document was falsely made or, in whole or in part, does not relate to the person on whose behalf it was or is being submitted; or present before boarding a common carrier for the purpose of coming to the United States a document which relates to the alien's eligibility to enter the United States, and subsequently fail to present such document to an immigration officer upon arrival at a United States port of entry. Persons or entities found to have violated INA \u00a7 274C may be ordered to cease and desist engaging in the unlawful activity and be assessed a civil money penalty. In the case of most first-time offenders, this penalty is between $375 and $3,200 for each fraudulent document or proscribed activity (and between $275 and $2,200 for each violation prior to March 27, 2008). For subsequent offenses, the civil penalty is between $3,200 and $6,500 (and between $2,200 and $5,500 for each violation prior to March 27, 2008). In the case of first-time offenders under INA \u00a7 274C(a)(5) (relating to the preparation or filing of a fraudulent INA document) or \u00a7\u00a0274C(a)(6) (failing to present entry documents upon arrival in United States), the penalty is between $275 and $2,200 for each fraudulent document or proscribed activity (and between $250 and $2,000 for each violation prior to March 27, 2008). Subsequent offenses are punishable by between $2,200 and $5,000 for each violation (and between $2,000 and $5,000 for each violation prior to March 27, 2008). Immigration authorities may investigate allegations of document fraud either on their own initiative or upon receiving third-party complaints with a substantial probability of validity. Immigration authorities may issue subpoenas to examine evidence against persons or entities being investigated. If immigration authorities conclude that a person or entity has violated \u00a7\u00a0274C, they may issue a Notice of Intent to Fine the alleged offender. If the alleged offender contests the issuance of the Notice of Intent to Fine, the respondent may request a hearing regarding the alleged violation within 60 days. Hearings are conducted by administrative law judges under the supervision of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer of the Department of Justice's Executive Office of Immigration Review. If a hearing is not requested within this period, or the respondent otherwise waives the right to a hearing, a final order may be issued by immigration authorities. If a hearing is requested, an immigration judge may issue a final order imposing civil penalties if the preponderance of evidence indicates that the accused has violated the requirements of INA \u00a7 274C. The civil penalties for violating \u00a7 274C may be waived in limited circumstances for aliens who failed to show the same immigration documents to U.S. immigration authorities as were used to board the carrier to travel to the United States, if the alien is granted asylum or withholding of removal. An alien's unauthorized presence within the United States\u2014that is, being an \"illegal alien\"\u2014is generally not a crime in and of itself. However, many types of immigration-related document fraud that may facilitate an alien's entry into or continued presence within the United States are criminal offenses. The following sections discuss the primary criminal statutes covering immigration-related document fraud, many of which are overlapping in coverage with civil statutes prohibiting immigration-related document fraud. In addition to these statutes, a number of other criminal statutes can potentially be used to prosecute aliens for document fraud in certain circumstances. Further, persons may be held criminally liable for aiding and abetting or conspiring to commit such offenses. Besides imposing civil penalties for immigration-related document fraud, INA \u00a7 274C also includes criminal penalties for those who prepare or assist in preparing fraudulent immigration documents for a fee or other remuneration. More particularly, failure to disclose a role in the preparation of a falsely made application for immigration benefits may result in a fine and/or imprisonment for up to five years, as well as being prohibited from preparing or assisting in the preparation of any other such applications in the future. Subsequent offenses are subject to fines and imprisonment for up to 15 years. A much broader criminal provision than \u00a7 274C of the INA, section 1546 of the United States Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546) makes it a criminal offense for a person to knowingly produce, use, or facilitate the production or use of fraudulent, immigration-related documents such as immigrant or nonimmigrant visas, permits, border crossing cards, alien registration receipt cards, and other documents prescribed by immigration-related statute or regulation. Activities prohibited include knowingly forging, counterfeiting, altering, or falsely making any immigrant or nonimmigrant visa, permit, border crossing card, alien registration receipt card, or other document prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay or employment in the United States; using or attempting to use, possessing, obtaining, or acquiring any such fraudulent document knowing that it was made or obtained unlawfully; possessing blank immigration-related permits, engraving plates, or document-producing materials; impersonating another to evade immigration laws or apply for an immigrant or nonimmigrant visa, permit, or other document required for entry into the United States; offering to sell or otherwise dispose of another person's visa, permit, or other immigration-related document to any person not authorized by law to receive such document; making false statements with respect to a material fact in any application, affidavit or other document required by immigration laws and regulations; or presenting any document required by immigration laws and regulations that is known to either contain false statements or lack any reasonable basis in law or fact. Persons convicted of violating \u00a7 1546(a) are subject to a fine and/or imprisonment up to either 25 years (if the offense was committed to facilitate an act of international terrorism), 20 years (if the offense was committed to facilitate a drug trafficking crime), 10 years (in the case of the first or second such offense, if the offense was not committed to facilitate either an act of international terrorism or a drug trafficking crime), or 15 years (in the case of any other offense). Section 1546(b) criminalizes the use of fraudulent documents or false attestation to satisfy INA verification requirements relating to the employment of aliens. Persons who violate this provision are subject to a fine and/or imprisonment for up to five years. Section 1015 of the United States Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1015) criminalizes acts of fraud relating to naturalization, citizenship, or alien registry. Specifically, it is a criminal offense for a person to knowingly make any false statement under oath, in any case, proceeding, or matter relating to, or under, or by virtue of any law of the United States relating to naturalization, citizenship, or registry of aliens; with intent to avoid any duty or liability imposed or required by law, deny that he or she has been naturalized or admitted to be a citizen, after having been so naturalized or admitted; use or attempt to use any certificate of arrival, declaration of intention, certificate of naturalization, certificate of citizenship or other documentary evidence of naturalization or of citizenship, or any duplicate or copy thereof, knowing the same to have been procured by fraud or false evidence or without required appearance or hearing of the applicant in court or otherwise unlawfully obtained; make any false certificate, acknowledgment or statement concerning the appearance before him or her or the taking of an oath or affirmation or the signature, attestation or execution by any person with respect to any application, declaration, petition, affidavit, deposition, certificate of naturalization, certificate of citizenship or other paper or writing required or authorized by the laws relating to immigration, naturalization, citizenship, or registry of aliens; make any false statement or claim that he is, or at any time has been, a citizen or national of the United States, with the intent to obtain, for himself or another, any federal or state benefit or service, or to engage unlawfully in employment in the United States; or make any false statement or claim that he or she is a citizen of the United States in order to register to vote or to vote in any U.S. election. Persons convicted of such offenses are subject to fine and/or imprisonment for up to five years. Additionally, INA \u00a7 266 imposes criminal penalties upon any alien (or parent or legal guardian of an alien) who improperly files an application for alien registration, or who procures or attempts to procure registration either for himself or another through fraud. Such an offense is subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months. Persons who, with unlawful intent, engage in the counterfeiting of alien registration documents, may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to five years. Section 1028 of the United States Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028) criminalizes fraud and related activity in connection with identification documents and document authentication features. Specifically, it is a criminal offense for an individual to knowingly produce an identification document, authentication feature, or a false identification document without lawful authority; transfer an identification document, authentication feature, or a false identification document knowing that such document or feature was stolen or produced without lawful authority; possess with intent to use unlawfully or transfer unlawfully five or more identification documents (other than those issued lawfully for the use of the possessor), authentication features, or false identification documents; possess an identification document (other than one issued lawfully for the use of the possessor), authentication feature, or a false identification document, with the intent such document or feature be used to defraud the United States; produce, transfer, or possess a document-making implement or authentication feature with the intent such document-making implement or authentication feature will be used to produce a false identification document or to make another document-making implement or authentication feature that will be used to produce a false identification document; possess an identification document or authentication feature that is or appears to be an identification document or authentication feature of the United States, knowing that such document or feature was stolen or produced unlawfully; transfer, possess, or use, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with a violation of federal law or a state or local felony; or traffic in false or actual authentication features for use in false identification documents, document-making implements, or means of identification. In general, persons convicted of such offenses are subject to a fine and/or imprisonment for up to one, five, or 15 years, depending on the particular offense and circumstances, including whether the fraudulently produced or obtained identification document or authentication feature is or appears to be (1) issued by or under the authority of the United States or (2) a birth certificate, a driver's license, or personal identification card. A person convicted of an offense under this section is subject to imprisonment for up to 20 years if he or she (1) has previously been convicted of an offense under this section, (2) committed an offense under this section to facilitate a drug trafficking crime, or (3) committed an offense under this section in connection with a crime of violence. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 raised the maximum criminal penalty from 25 to 30 years imprisonment for persons who commit an offense under \u00a7 1028 to facilitate an act of terrorism. Immigration-related document fraud also bears upon an alien's eligibility to enter or remain in the United States, and in certain circumstances such fraud may make the alien ineligible for certain other immigration-related benefits. These statutory grounds may be waived by immigration authorities in certain circumstances. The INA categorizes certain classes of aliens as inadmissible\u2014\"ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United States.\" Any alien who has, by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact, sought to procure or has procured either admission into the United States or a benefit under the INA is inadmissible. A final order under INA \u00a7 274C is not necessary to make such a determination, though a final order is also a specific ground for inadmissibility. An alien who falsely represents himself or herself to be a U.S. citizen for any purpose or benefit under the INA or any other federal or state law is also inadmissible for life, except under narrow circumstances. There is no immigrant waiver available for inadmissibility on this ground. A separate ground for inadmissibility exists for aliens who have been convicted of or have admitted committing a crime of moral turpitude. Actions constituting crimes of moral turpitude are defined by judicial and administrative case law rather than by statute. In general, crimes that are considered to evidence an evil or predatory intent constitute crimes of moral turpitude. Fraud, forgery, counterfeiting, and perjury have all been recognized as crimes of moral turpitude. Accordingly, immigration-related document fraud may also constitute a crime of moral turpitude in certain circumstances, making the offending alien inadmissible. Immigration-related document fraud is also a ground for deportation. Any alien who is subject to a final order under INA \u00a7 274C is deportable, although this designation may be waived if (1) the alien was admitted for lawful permanent residence; (2) no previous civil money penalty was imposed against the alien under \u00a7 274C; and (3) the offense was committed solely to assist, aid, or support the alien's spouse or child (and no other individual). A violation, attempt to violate, or conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1546 of the United States Criminal Code (relating to fraud and misuse of visas and other entry documents) is also a ground for removal. In certain circumstances, an alien who enters a fraudulent marriage to be permitted entry into the United States or falsely claims U.S. citizenship is also deportable. Further, criminal convictions for certain forms of immigration-related document fraud may constitute either aggravated felonies under the INA or crimes of moral turpitude, both of which constitute grounds for deportation. Immigration-related document fraud has a number of other immigration consequences. As previously discussed, in certain circumstances immigration-related document fraud may constitute either a crime of moral turpitude or an aggravated felony. Aggravated felonies, crimes of moral turpitude, and falsely giving testimony to receive INA benefits all prevent an alien from being found to possess good moral character, which is a necessary requirement for an alien to become a U.S. citizen. Such crimes may also limit an offending alien's ability to be granted certain benefits and remedies under the INA. Among the benefits that may be denied in certain circumstances to an alien who has committed and/or been convicted of immigration-related document fraud include the following: canceling an alien's removal from the United States (relief from removal denied to legal permanent residents convicted of an aggravated felony and nonpermanent residents who commit immigration-related document fraud); granting an alien asylum (relief from removal denied to aliens convicted of an aggravated felony); withholding an alien's removal from the United States (relief from removal denied to aliens convicted of one or more aggravated felonies with an aggregate sentence of five or more years, unless they are more likely than not to face torture if removed); adjusting an alien's status to legal permanent residency (benefit denied to aliens designated as inadmissible, including those who have committed document fraud); permitting the alien to voluntarily depart the United States before or after a removal proceeding against the alien is completed (benefit denied before or after a removal proceeding is completed to aliens who have committed an aggravated felony, and also denied to aliens seeking voluntary departure after proceedings have been completed if the aliens have not possessed good moral character for the five years preceding); and providing nationals of countries that have been designated as experiencing widespread upheaval with temporary protected status within the United States (benefit denied to aliens who have committed crimes of moral turpitude, have multiple criminal convictions, or have been convicted of one felony or two or more misdemeanors in the United States). Additional background on the immigration-related consequences of criminal activity can be found in CRS Report RL32480, Immigration Consequences of Criminal Activity , by Yule Kim and [author name scrubbed]. Immigration reform is likely to be an issue in the 111 th Congress, and it is possible that some legislative proposals will contain provisions addressing immigration-related document fraud. Proposals made in recent years that have received legislative action or significant congressional interest include measures that would amend and rewrite chapter 75 of title 18 of the United States Code (concerning fraud and misuse related to visas, passports, and other travel and immigration documents), including by, inter alia, (1) increasing the maximum sentences available for violations under the chapter; (2) establishing new penalties for the unauthorized trafficking of passports or immigration documents; (3) making it a crime to defraud any person on a matter that is authorized by or arises under immigration laws (with specific provisions dealing with persons who knowingly misrepresent themselves as attorneys in immigration matters); (4) specifying that an attempt or conspiracy to commit a violation of any provision of chapter 75 is punishable to the same degree as is a completed violation of such provision; (5) permitting the seizure and forfeiture of any property and/or proceeds traceable to a violation of chapter 75; (6) extending criminal jurisdiction of chapter 75 to cover violations occurring in the U.S. special maritime and territorial jurisdiction as well as (in many cases) outside the United States; and (7) specifying that material omissions of pertinent facts in the preparation or completion of immigration documents constitute \"false statements or misrepresentations\" for purposes of chapter 75; require the establishment of prosecutorial guidelines to ensure that any prosecution of an alien seeking entry into the United States by fraud is consistent with U.S. international obligations concerning the treatment of refugees and asylum-seekers; heighten the criminal penalties for persons who knowingly enter into marriages or commercial enterprises for the purpose of evading any provision of the immigration laws, and establish new penalties for certain conduct related to marriage fraud; and make inadmissible and deportable those aliens who violate certain provisions of chapter 75 of title 18, U.S. Code (as amended), including through immigration document and passport fraud and immigration-related marriage fraud."
