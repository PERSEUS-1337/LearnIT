FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Obesity is related to more than 30 chronic conditions, \n        including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and \n        arthritis.\n            (2) Obesity has become a major health concern for millions \n        of Americans, as 1 in 3 adults and nearly 1 in 5 children have \n        obesity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention.\n            (3) Left unchecked, nearly 50 percent of Americans will be \n        obese by 2030, according to a recent study.\n            (4) Rates of obesity among children and adolescents have \n        nearly tripled since 1980, according to the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention.\n            (5) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        estimates that more than 75 percent of health care costs are \n        due to chronic conditions.\n            (6) A recent study conducted by researchers at Cornell \n        University and Lehigh University concluded that obesity \n        accounts for nearly 21 percent of health care costs in America.\n            (7) Direct medical spending on obesity could exceed \n        $300,000,000,000 annually by 2018, according to an analysis \n        conducted by McKinsey and Company.\n            (8) Obesity has become a threat to national security and is \n        the leading medical reason for applicants failing to qualify \n        for military service, according to a report issued by \n        Mission:Readiness.\n            (9) A report issued by the Trust for America's Health \n        concludes that reducing the average body mass index by 5 \n        percent in the United States could lead to more than \n        $29,000,000,000 in health care savings in five years.\n            (10) Studies show that an overweight or obese child or \n        adolescent is significantly more likely to have obesity as an \n        adult.\n            (11) Tracking, measuring, and monitoring body mass index \n        for children is vital in facilitating a lifetime of healthy \n        behaviors.\n            (12) Body mass index should be considered as a vital sign.\n\nSEC. 3.
