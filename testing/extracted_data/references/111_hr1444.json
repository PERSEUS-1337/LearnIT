    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional Commission on Civic \nService Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The social fabric of the United States is stronger if \n        individuals in the United States are committed to protecting \n        and serving our Nation by utilizing national service and \n        volunteerism to overcome our civic challenges.\n            (2) A more engaged civic society will strengthen the Nation \n        by bringing together people from diverse backgrounds and \n        experiences to work on solutions to some of our Nation's major \n        challenges.\n            (3) Despite declines in civic health in the past 30 years, \n        national service and volunteerism among the Nation's youth are \n        increasing, and existing national service and volunteer \n        programs greatly enhance opportunities for youth to engage in \n        civic activity.\n            (4) In addition to the benefits received by nonprofit \n        organizations and society as a whole, volunteering and national \n        service provide a variety of personal benefits and satisfaction \n        and can lead to new paths of civic engagement, responsibility, \n        and upward mobility.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established in the legislative branch a commission to be \nknown as the ``Congressional Commission on Civic Service'' (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.
