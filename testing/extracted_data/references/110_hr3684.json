FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A principal negotiating objective of the United States \n        regarding trade barriers and other trade distortions must be to \n        expand competitive market opportunities for United States \n        exports and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of trade \n        by reducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers and \n        policies and practices of foreign governments directly related \n        to trade that hinders market opportunities for United States \n        exports or otherwise distorts United States trade.\n            (2) One of the fundamental tenets of the World Trade \n        Organization (WTO) is reciprocal market access and, in fact, \n        this principle is underscored in the Marrakesh Agreement \n        Establishing the World Trade Organization which called for \n        ``entering into reciprocal and mutually advantageous \n        arrangements directed to the substantial reduction of tariffs \n        and other barriers to trade and to the elimination of \n        discriminatory treatment in international trade relations''.\n            (3) If negotiations between the United States and a foreign \n        country do not provide meaningful market access for products of \n        United States domestic producers who have sought market access \n        assistance from the United States Government, then the United \n        States must not reduce or eliminate tariffs for products of the \n        foreign country, having the same physical characteristics and \n        uses pursuant to any trade agreement entered into between the \n        United States and the foreign country.\n            (4) With each subsequent round of bilateral, regional, and \n        multilateral trade negotiations, tariffs have been \n        significantly reduced or eliminated for many manufactured \n        goods, leaving nontariff barriers as the most pervasive, \n        significant, and challenging barriers to United States exports \n        and market opportunities.\n            (5) The United States market is widely recognized as one of \n        the most open markets in the world: average United States \n        tariff rates are very low and the United States has limited, if \n        any, nontariff barriers.\n            (6) Consequently, the leverage the United States has to \n        obtain removal of nontariff barriers of foreign countries is \n        often tariffs on imports from foreign countries into the United \n        States.\n            (7) Under the current negotiating process, negotiations to \n        reduce or eliminate tariff barriers and nontariff barriers are \n        separate and self-contained, meaning that tradeoffs are tariff-\n        for-tariff and nontariff-for-nontariff. As a result, a tariff \n        can be reduced or eliminated without securing elimination of \n        the real barrier or barriers that deny United States industry \n        access to a foreign market.\n            (8) The United States should not engage in trade \n        negotiations in such a compartmentalized manner thereby \n        effectively and unilaterally disarming itself by leveraging its \n        limited tariff barriers without securing elimination of \n        nontariff barriers of foreign countries and ensuring that new \n        barriers are not created or discovered.\n            (9) The United States should seek to ensure market access \n        results are obtained before reducing or eliminating domestic \n        tariffs. Specifically, the United States Trade Representative \n        should seek to ensure market access for products of United \n        States domestic producers who have sought market access \n        assistance from the United States Government and have provided \n        a reasonable indication of the denial of meaningful market \n        access.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that United \nStates trade negotiations achieve real and meaningful results for \nUnited States industry by ensuring that trade agreements result in \nmeaningful market access for the exports of United States domestic \nproducers and not just the elimination of tariffs on imports into the \nUnited States.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RATES OF DUTY \n              PURSUANT TO CERTAIN TRADE AGREEMENTS.\n\n    (a) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, \nthe President may not agree to a modification of any existing duty that \nwould reduce or eliminate the bound or applied rate of such duty on any \nproduct in order to carry out any trade agreement entered into between \nthe United States and a foreign country on or after the date of the \nenactment of this Act until the President transmits to Congress a \ncertification described in subsection (b).\n    (b) Certification.--A certification referred to in subsection (a) \nis a certification of the President that--\n            (1) the United States has obtained the reduction or \n        elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and \n        practices of the government of the foreign country described in \n        subsection (a) with respect to United States exports of any \n        product identified by United States domestic producers that has \n        the same physical characteristics and uses as the product for \n        which a modification of any existing duty is sought by the \n        President to carry out the trade agreement described in \n        subsection (a); and\n            (2) a violation of any provision of the trade agreement \n        described in subsection (a) relating to the matters described \n        in paragraph (1) is immediately enforceable in accordance with \n        the provisions of section 4.\n\nSEC. 4.
