    "title": "An act to add Part 16 (commencing with Section 54000) to Division 31 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to housing, by providing the funds necessary therefor through an election for the issuance and sale of bonds of the State of California and for the handling and disposition of those funds, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately.",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) California is experiencing an extreme housing shortage with 2.2 million extremely low income and very low income renter households competing for only 664,000 affordable rental homes. This leaves more than 1.54 million of California\u2019s lowest income households without access to affordable housing.\n(b) While homelessness across the United States is in an overall decline, homelessness in California is rising. In 2015, California had 115,738 homeless people, which accounted for 21 percent of the nation\u2019s homeless population. This is an increase of 1.6 percent from the prior year. California also had the highest rate of unsheltered people, at 64 percent or 73,699 people; the largest numbers of unaccompanied homeless children and youth, at 10,416 people or 28 percent of the national total; the largest number of veterans experiencing homelessness, at 11,311 or 24 percent of the national homeless veteran population; and the second largest number of people in families with chronic patterns of homelessness, at 22,582 or 11 percent of the state\u2019s homeless family population.\n(c) California is home to 21 of the 30 most expensive rental housing markets in the country, which has had a disproportionate impact on the middle class and the working poor. California requires the third highest wage in the country to afford housing, behind Hawaii and Washington, D.C. The fair market rent, which indicates the amount of money that a given property would require if it were open for leasing, for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,386. To afford this level of rent and utilities, without paying more than 30 percent of income on housing, a household must earn an hourly \u201chousing wage\u201d of $26.65 per hour. This means that a person earning minimum wage must work an average of three jobs to pay the rent for a two-bedroom unit. In some areas of the state, these numbers are even higher.\n(d) Low-income families are forced to spend more and more of their income on rent, which leaves little else for other basic necessities. Many renters must postpone or forgo home ownership, live in more crowded housing, commute further to work, or, in some cases, choose to live and work elsewhere.\n(e) California has seen a significant reduction of state funding in recent years. The funds from Proposition 46 of 2002 and Proposition 1C of 2006, totaling nearly $5 billion for a variety of affordable housing programs, have been expended. Combined with the loss of redevelopment funds, $1.5 billion of annual state investment dedicated to housing has been lost, leaving several critical housing programs unfunded.\n(f) High housing costs and the shortage of housing stock in California directly affect the future health of California\u2019s economy and, given the staggering numbers indicated above, bold action is necessary. Investment in existing and successful housing programs to expand the state\u2019s housing stock should benefit California\u2019s homeless and low-income earners, as well as some of the state\u2019s most vulnerable populations, including foster and at-risk youth, persons with developmental and physical disabilities, farmworkers, the elderly, single parents with children, and survivors of domestic violence. Investments should also be made in housing for Medi-Cal recipients served through a county\u2019s Section 1115 Waiver Whole Person Care Pilot program and family day care providers.\n(g) Investment in housing creates jobs and provides local benefits. The estimated one-year impacts of building 100 rental apartments in a typical local area include $11.7 million in local income, $2.2 million in taxes and other revenue for local governments, and 161 local jobs or 1.62 jobs per apartment. The additional annually recurring impacts of building 100 rental apartments in a typical local area include $2.6 million in local income, $503,000 in taxes and other revenue for local governments, and 44 local jobs or .44 jobs per apartment.\nSEC. 2.\nPart 16 (commencing with Section 54000) is added to Division 31 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:\nPART 16. Affordable Housing Bond Act of 2018\nCHAPTER  1.

All bonds herein authorized which have been duly issued, sold, and delivered as provided herein shall constitute valid and binding general obligations of the state, and the full faith and credit of the state is hereby pledged for the punctual payment of both principal of and interest on those bonds when due.\n54012.\nThe bonds authorized by this part shall be prepared, executed, issued, sold, paid, and redeemed as provided in the State General Obligation Bond Law (Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 16720) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code), except subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 16727 of the Government Code to the extent that those provisions are inconsistent with this part, and all of the provisions of that law as amended from time to time apply to the bonds and to this part, except as provided in Section 54028, and are hereby incorporated in this part as though set forth in full in this part.\n54014.\n(a) Solely for the purpose of authorizing the issuance and sale, pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law, of the bonds authorized by this part, the committee is continued in existence.
