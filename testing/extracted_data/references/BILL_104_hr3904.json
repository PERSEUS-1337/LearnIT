FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Clinical research is critical to the advancement of \n        scientific knowledge and to the development of cures and \n        improved treatment for disease.\n            (2) Tremendous advances in biology are opening doors to new \n        insights into human physiology, pathophysiology and disease, \n        creating extraordinary opportunities for clinical research.\n            (3) The United States spent more than $1 trillion on health \n        care in 1994, but the Federal budget for health research at the \n        National Institutes of Health was $10 billion, only 1 percent \n        of that total.\n            (4) Studies at the Institute of Medicine, the National \n        Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences have all \n        addressed the current problems in clinical research.\n            (5) The Director of the National Institutes of Health has \n        recognized the current problems in clinical research and has \n        through the use of an advisory committee begun to evaluate \n        these problems.\n            (6) The current level of training and support for health \n        professionals in clinical research is fragmented, frequently \n        undervalued, and potentially underfunded.\n            (7) Young investigators are not only apprentices for future \n        positions but a crucial source of energy, enthusiasm, and ideas \n        in the day-to-day research that constitutes the scientific \n        enterprise. Serious questions about the future of life-science \n        research are raised by the following:\n                    (A) The number of young investigators applying for \n                grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993.\n                    (B) The number of federally funded research (R01) \n                grants awarded to persons under the age of 36 have \n                decreased by 70 percent from 1985 to 1993.\n                    (C) Newly independent life-scientists are expected \n                to raise funds to support their new research programs \n                and a substantial proportion of their own salaries.\n            (8) The following have been cited as reasons for the \n        decline in the number of active clinical researchers, and those \n        choosing this career path:\n                    (A) A medical school graduate incurs an average \n                debt of $63,000, as reported in the Medical School \n                Graduation Questionnaire by the American Association of \n                Medical Colleges (AAMC).\n                    (B) The prolonged period of clinical training \n                required increases the accumulated debt burden.\n                    (C) The decreasing number of mentors and role \n                models.\n                    (D) The perceived instability of funding from the \n                National Institutes of Health and other Federal \n                agencies.\n                    (E) The almost complete absence of clinical \n                research training in the curriculum of training grant \n                awardees.\n                    (F) Academic Medical Centers are experiencing \n                difficulties in maintaining a proper environment for \n                research in a highly competitive health care \n                marketplace, which are compounded by the decreased \n                willingness of third party payers to cover health care \n                costs for patients engaged in research studies and \n                research procedures.\n            (9) In 1960, general clinical research centers were \n        established under the Office of the Director of the National \n        Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of \n        $3,000,000.\n            (10) Appropriations for general clinical research centers \n        in fiscal year 1995 equal $136,640,000.\n            (11) In fiscal year 1995, there are 75 general clinical \n        research centers in operation, supplying patients in the areas \n        in which such centers operate with access to the most modern \n        clinical research and clinical research facilities and \n        technologies.\n            (12) The average annual amount allocated for each general \n        clinical research center is $1,000,000, establishing a current \n        funding level of 75 percent of the amounts approved by the \n        Advisory Council of the National Center for Research Resources.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide additional \nsupport for and to expand clinical research programs.\n\nSEC. 3.
