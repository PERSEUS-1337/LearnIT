FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has for \n        years operated in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \n        (North Korea) in violation of United Nations rules and internal \n        auditing recommendations. Examples of such violations include \n        the following:\n                    (A) The local staff of the UNDP in North Korea is \n                dominated by employees who are hand-picked by the \n                Government of North Korea. The Government of North \n                Korea provides only one candidate for each position and \n                does not provide detailed qualifications, work \n                experience, or personal details to the UNDP.\n                    (B) The salaries of the local staff of the UNDP in \n                North Korea are paid to the Government of North Korea \n                and not to the individual staffers. Such local staff \n                are instead provided with cash food stipends against \n                UNDP regulations.\n                    (C) Officials of the Government of North Korea have \n                performed financial and core managerial functions of \n                UNDP activities in violation of UNDP regulations.\n                    (D) The UNDP pays cash to local suppliers of the \n                Government of North Korea in violation of UNDP \n                regulations.\n                    (E) The UNDP provides funding to programs and \n                projects controlled by the Government of North Korea \n                without appropriate audits or other oversight in \n                violation of UNDP regulations.\n            (2) According to the United States Department of State, in \n        2005 the Government of the United States contributed $108 \n        million to the general fund of the UNDP. This amount accounts \n        for 11.8 percent of the total funding of the UNDP.\n            (3) The Government of North Korea has developed and tested \n        nuclear weapons in violation of international treaties.\n            (4) North Korea continues to pose a threat to East Asia and \n        the world in the form of its nuclear weapons program.\n            (5) The Government of North Korea maintains a police state \n        wherein citizens are prevented from access to the outside \n        world.\n            (6) Kim Jong-Il and other senior officials of the \n        Government of North Korea have used their power to purchase \n        personal luxuries, possibly with UNDP funds, while citizens \n        face starvation.\n            (7) Representatives of the Government of North Korea are \n        members of the executive board of the UNDP, thereby governing \n        the amount of UNDP assistance that North Korea will receive and \n        overseeing UNDP programs around the world.\n            (8) The Government of North Korea maintains a state of war \n        with the democratically-elected Government of the Republic of \n        Korea (South Korea).\n            (9) Former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein used United Nations \n        programs to launder approximately $100 billion into his regime \n        in what has become known as the ``Oil-for-Food Scandal''.\n            (10) Illicit funding of this kind undermines the strong \n        sanctions that have been imposed by the United States and the \n        United Nations against North Korea.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the United Nations--\n                    (A) should ensure that the United Nations \n                Development Program (UNDP) enforces its rules regarding \n                financing, staffing, accounting, and auditing of its \n                activities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \n                (North Korea);\n                    (B) should authorize an external investigation of \n                all UNDP activities in North Korea; and\n                    (C) should ensure that--\n                            (i) any local staff of the UNDP in North \n                        Korea who may have committed crimes are \n                        prosecuted in the appropriate court of law; and\n                            (ii) any local staff of the UNDP in North \n                        Korea who have violated UNDP regulations are \n                        appropriately sanctioned; and\n            (2) the President should instruct the United States \n        representative on the Executive Board of the UNDP to use the \n        voice, vote, and influence of the United States to ensure \n        that--\n                    (A) the UNDP ceases any activities in North Korea \n                that are in violation of UNDP regulations;\n                    (B) the UNDP conducts a full audit, open for review \n                to all members of the Executive Board, of UNDP \n                activities in North Korea since 1998; and\n                    (C) the UNDP establishes regulations to ensure that \n                no funds allocated to UNDP activities in North Korea \n                are provided to the Government of North Korea.\n\nSEC. 3. WITHHOLDING OF UNITED STATES CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNITED \n              NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.\n\n    The Secretary of State shall withhold any United States \ncontribution to the general funds of the United Nations Development \nProgram (UNDP) until such time as the Secretary certifies to Congress \nthat the UNDP meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) through (C) \nof section 2(2) of this Act."
