FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1)(A) On November 27, 1995, the President affirmed that \n        United States participation in the multinational military \n        Implementation Force in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n        would terminate in one year.\n            (B) The President declared the expiration date of the \n        mandate for the Implementation Force to be December 20, 1996.\n            (2) The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \n        Chiefs of Staff likewise expressed their confidence that the \n        Implementation Force would complete its mission in one year.\n            (3) The exemplary performance of United States Armed Forces \n        personnel has significantly contributed to the accomplishment \n        of the military mission of the Implementation Force. The \n        courage, dedication, and professionalism of such personnel have \n        permitted a separation of the belligerent parties to the \n        conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and have \n        resulted in a significant mitigation of the violence and \n        suffering in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n            (4) On October 3, 1996, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n        Staff announced the intention of the United States \n        Administration to delay the removal of United States Armed \n        Forces personnel from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n        until March 1997 due to operational reasons.\n            (5) Notwithstanding the fact that the President, the \n        Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n        Staff assured the Congress of their resolve to end the mission \n        of United States Armed Forces in the Republic of Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina by December 20, 1996, in November 1996 the \n        President announced his intention to further extend the \n        deployment of United States Armed Forces in the Republic of \n        Bosnia and Herzegovina until June 1998.\n            (6) Before the announcement of the new policy referred to \n        in paragraph (5), the President did not request authorization \n        by the Congress of a policy that would result in the further \n        deployment of United States Armed Forces in the Republic of \n        Bosnia and Herzegovina until June 1998.\n    (b) Declarations of Policy.--The Congress--\n            (1) expresses its serious concerns and opposition to the \n        policy of the President that has resulted in the deployment \n        after December 20, 1996, of United States Armed Forces on the \n        ground in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina without prior \n        authorization by the Congress; and\n            (2) urges the President to work with our European allies to \n        begin an orderly transition of all peacekeeping functions in \n        the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the United States \n        to appropriate European countries in preparation for a complete \n        withdrawal of all United States Armed Forces by September 30, \n        1997.\n\nSEC. 3.
