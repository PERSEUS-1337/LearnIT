FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) small communities often struggle to meet environmental \n        goals because of difficulty in securing funding;\n            (2) often, sources of funding for environmental projects \n        require expensive, complex studies or other application \n        materials;\n            (3) a small community that secures funding for an \n        environmental project from a traditional source often is unable \n        to provide matching funds required by the traditional source; \n        and\n            (4) small communities would benefit from a grant program \n        designed to provide funding for environmental projects--\n                    (A) through a simplified application process; and\n                    (B) without the requirement of matching funds.\n\nSEC. 3.
