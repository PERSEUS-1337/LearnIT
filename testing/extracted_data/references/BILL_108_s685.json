ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO FEDERALLY INSURED \n              FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR TAXPAYERS.\n\n    (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n                    (A) Approximately 40,000,000 Americans are unbanked \n                and not utilizing mainstream, insured financial \n                institutions.\n                    (B) In 1999, nearly half of the $30,000,000,000 in \n                earned income tax credits (EITC) claimed nationwide was \n                refunded through refund anticipation loans, and an \n                estimated $1,750,000,000 intended to assist low-income \n                families through the EITC was received by commercial \n                tax preparers and affiliated national banks to pay for \n                tax assistance, electronic filing of returns, and high-\n                cost refund loans.\n                    (C) Refund anticipation loans carry interest rates \n

check cashing services, which \n                reduces EITC benefits by $130,000,000.\n                    (E) Individuals with bank accounts can receive \n                their tax refunds faster than waiting for a paper check \n                and without the need to utilize refund anticipation \n                loans or check cashiers.\n                    (F) Individuals with federally insured depository \n                accounts have an increased opportunity to access \n                financial services at mainstream financial \n                institutions, which typically have reduced costs for \n                consumers.\n            (2) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n        establish a grant program to provide unbanked low- and \n        moderate-income taxpayers with tax preparation services and \n        increase their access to financial services by the \n        establishment of an account at a federally insured depository \n
