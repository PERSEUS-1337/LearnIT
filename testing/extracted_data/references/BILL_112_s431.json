FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress hereby finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States Marshals, the first Federal law \n        enforcement officers in America, were established under section \n        27 of the Act of Congress entitled ``Chapter XX.--An Act to \n        Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States'' and \n        enacted on September 24, 1789 (commonly referred to as the \n        ``Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789''), during the 1st \n        Session of the 1st Congress, and signed into law by the 1st \n        President of the United States, George Washington.\n            (2) George Washington had carefully considered the \n        appointments to the Judicial Branch long before the enactment \n        of the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, and nominated the \n        first 11 United States Marshals on September 24, and the \n        remaining two Marshals on September 25, 1789. The Senate \n        confirmed all 13 on September 26, 1789, 2 days after the \n        Judiciary Act was signed into law.\n            (3) In 1969, by order of the Department of Justice, the \n        United States Marshals Service was created, and achieved Bureau \n        status in 1974. The United States Marshals Service has had \n        major significance in the history of the United States, and has \n        directly contributed to the safety and preservation of this \n        Nation, by serving as an instrument of civil authority used by \n        all 3 branches of the United States Government.\n            (4) One of the original 13 United States Marshals, Robert \n        Forsyth of Georgia, a 40-year old veteran of the Revolutionary \n        War, was the first civilian official of the United States \n        Government, and the first of many United States Marshals and \n        deputies, to be killed in the line of duty when he was shot on \n        January 11, 1794, while trying to serve civil process.\n            (5) The United States Marshals Service Commemorative Coin \n        will be the first commemorative coin to honor the United States \n        Marshals Service.\n            (6) The United States should pay tribute to the Nation's \n        oldest Federal law enforcement agency, the United States \n        Marshals Service, by minting and issuing commemorative coins, \n        as provided in this Act.\n            (7) A commemorative coin will bring national and \n        international attention to the lasting legacy of this Nation's \n        oldest Federal law enforcement agency.\n            (8) The proceeds from a surcharge on the sale of such \n        commemorative coins will assist the financing of national \n        museums and charitable organizations.\n\nSEC. 3.
