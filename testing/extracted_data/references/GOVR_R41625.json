    "content": "People and communities with limited resources are a major focus of public policy. While policymakers might disagree in theory on whether or to what extent government should act to protect the economic well-being of individuals and families, the federal government in fact spends large sums of money on numerous programs targeted toward those with limited income and assets. This report attempts to identify and analyze these programs and provide a broad overview of the policies underlying them. In FY2009, federal spending on programs for people with low income was almost $708 billion, and totaled nearly $578 billion the previous year. Most of the growth between the two years was related to the recession and associated policy responses, with almost two-thirds (64%) of the increase coming from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ). In both years, four programs accounted for almost 60% of total spending, and 10 programs accounted for more than 75%.  The distinguishing feature of federal programs examined here is their explicit focus on low-income populations, as distinct from social insurance programs such as Social Security, Medicare, or Unemployment Insurance. Social insurance programs aim to protect American workers universally against lost wages and work-related benefits due to retirement, disability, or temporary periods of unemployment. They are financed in large part through contributions from workers and employers and their aggregate spending is much larger than programs intended specifically for those with low income. Social insurance programs play a major role in reducing poverty among significant segments of the population.  In contrast to social insurance, programs examined in this report are funded through general revenues and provide benefits and services to people with limited income either by explicitly tying eligibility to a measure of income, or by targeting assistance through funding allocation formulas or other need-related mechanisms. They attempt to ameliorate or mitigate the effects of low income by providing cash or noncash benefits to help people meet basic needs, such as food, housing, and health care. They also seek to address root causes of economic disadvantage by providing education, training, and other services to improve people's employability and earnings capacity. Some programs combine these purposes by conditioning aid on participation in work or training or providing incentives to engage in these activities. Finally, some programs target assistance to communities with significant concentrations of low-income people to compensate for their low tax capacities, and help provide revenues to support benefits and services to residents.  These programs are extremely diverse in their purpose, design, and target populations. Many were created independently of one another, at different times and in response to different perceived policy problems. They also changed over time in response to various societal and other factors. \"Social welfare,\" \"social safety net,\" and \"public welfare\" are generic terms sometimes used to refer to these programs; however, there is no single label that best describes all programs included in this report. Key findings of the report are presented in the Summary, above. The body of the report is organized as follows: The report begins with a very brief history of federal low-income policy, to provide context for the subsequent discussion of current programs. The report then gives an overview of current federal spending on benefits and services for low-income people, including a review of the budgetary classification of these funds (mandatory or discretionary). The next section looks specifically at the 10 largest programs, which together account for three-fourths of all spending in the report, followed by an overview of all programs, organized by major category in order of FY2009 spending: health care, cash aid, food assistance, housing and development, education, social services, energy assistance, and employment and training. The next two sections look in greater detail at the ways in which benefits and services are directed toward people with limited income, either by establishing explicit eligibility criteria for individuals or families, or by targeting assistance toward communities or entities based on a measure of need. These sections look at use of the federal poverty guidelines and other income measures in defining eligibility or otherwise targeting assistance, as well as criteria that enable certain categories of people to qualify automatically. The form of federal assistance\u2014formula grants, competitive or discretionary awards, direct payments to individuals\u2014is the focus of the next section, which also looks at the immediate recipients of federal funds, such as states, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. The section discusses matching or other requirements for nonfederal spending, and very briefly addresses the participation of Indian tribes and U.S. territories. The report generally does not discuss the value of benefits or services provided; however, the next section shows maximum benefit levels under selected cash and near-cash benefit programs. The report concludes by identifying potential questions for further analysis. The report includes several appendixes: Appendix A discusses the methodologies used to prepare the analysis; Appendix B provides overview tables of programs included in the report; and Appendix C is a series of short fact sheets on each program. Appendix D gives references to information about the federal poverty guidelines and other income measures and eligibility tests.  The analysis in this report required numerous decisions about which programs to include, how to categorize them, and what measure of federal spending to use. The methodologies chosen are described in Appendix A . Readers should be aware, however, of the following caveats: The report refers to the target population of these benefits and services as persons with \"low\" or \"limited\" income, rather than \"poor\" people. Although some programs limit participation to individuals with income below federal poverty guidelines, income eligibility criteria vary widely and frequently include people with income above the federal definition of poverty. The number of programs included in this report is not meaningful. While fact sheets are presented for 82 \"programs,\" some could have been characterized as more than one program and others could have been consolidated. In addition, only programs with new obligations of $100 million or more in a given year are included. If smaller programs were included, the overall number of programs would be larger, but the analysis would essentially be unchanged. The assignment of programs\u2014and therefore dollars\u2014to broad categories (health care, cash aid, food assistance, etc.) is not perfect. Certain programs provide multiple types of assistance and spending could not be disaggregated, so spending was assigned to a single category. Some programs are ambiguous; different analysts might categorize them differently. The analysis might be changed somewhat if different assignments had been made. The report does not include tax programs, with the exception of direct spending for the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the refundable Additional Child Tax Credit. The report does not provide long-term trend data on spending. For reasons explained in Appendix A , obligations are generally used as the measure of spending. While obligations are the most consistent program-specific measure available for the majority of programs included here, they are difficult to trace backward. Spending is provided for FY2009 because it is the most recent year for which final amounts are available for all programs included. Because FY2009 was an unusual year, however, with a large infusion of funding from the economic stimulus law (ARRA), FY2008 spending is also shown. The report provides a snapshot of policies and spending for low-income programs in FY2008 and FY2009. It does not address the effectiveness of these programs in meeting their policy goals. Readers familiar with the CRS series of reports entitled Cash and Noncash Benefits for Persons with Limited Income should know that this report is not an update of that earlier series. This report is meant to replace that series but it uses different methodologies and is therefore not comparable to the Cash and Noncash reports. See Appendix A for an explanation of the differences. A review of the evolution of federal policy for low-income people provides useful context for understanding today's programs and policies. The following is a quick overview of key milestones, such as the New Deal of the 1930s and the Great Society of the 1960s. While many current programs trace their roots to these eras, few exist today in the same form. Today's programs reflect policy changes enacted over many decades in response to numerous factors, particularly the shift in societal expectations about mothers working outside the home. Federal aid initially focused on groups who were not expected to work, including mothers of dependent children; however, federal policy today generally favors work among able-bodied aid recipients and includes incentives to \"make work pay.\" Federal policy also expanded over time to include efforts to address root causes of poverty and disadvantage, in addition to helping people meet their basic needs. Federal involvement in providing benefits and services for people with low income generally began in the first part of the 20 th century, largely after the Great Depression overwhelmed the resources of states, local governments, and private organizations, which previously had borne primary responsibility for helping the disadvantaged. With some key exceptions, such as veterans' benefits and tax credits for low-wage workers, state and local governments still play a significant role in most programs intended for low-income populations, regardless of whether they are partially or fully federally funded.  Benefits for veterans, initially to meet the medical needs of those who became disabled during service, are among the oldest in the United States, and date back in some form to the beginning of the country. By the early 1900s, these benefits had grown to include medical care and cash assistance for the indigent as well as veterans with disabilities, including assistance for dependents and survivors of veterans. These were the primary benefit programs administered by the federal government until the Great Depression of the 1930s. The New Deal was the federal government's response to the Depression, and the Social Security Act of 1935 was its cornerstone. The act brought the federal government into the fields of social insurance and cash relief for populations who either could not work or who society at that time did not expect to work. The original act established income security programs for aged and retired workers and for temporarily unemployed workers (the beginning of today's Social Security and Unemployment Compensation programs). It also authorized federal grants to states to make cash aid payments to two groups, in addition to the elderly, who were not expected to work. These groups were fatherless (dependent) children and the blind, although within these categories, the act gave states the authority to define specific eligibility and benefit levels.  Aid to Dependent Children, as created in 1935, was amended over the succeeding decades and became Aid to Families with Dependent Children in 1962. Aid was provided to parents (typically single mothers) in addition to the children. However, at the same time, expectations about mothers' work began to change. Starting in the late 1960s and continuing over the next 30 years, Congress imposed work registration and work or training requirements on certain parents receiving cash benefits. In 1996, Congress replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which established time limits on the receipt of benefits and conditioned cash aid on participation in work activities. States continue to make key decisions regarding eligibility and benefit levels under TANF, and have the added flexibility to use funds for noncash services. (In fact, the majority of TANF funds are now used for noncash services, such as social services and employment-related activities.) The 1996 law also gave states more federal funding for child care for low-income working families. The 1930s also marked the federal government's entry into the field of housing. In response to trouble in the mortgage market resulting from the Depression, the U.S. Housing Act of 1934 encouraged lending for housing construction through a new Federal Housing Administration. The U.S. Housing Act of 1937 subsequently created the low-rent Public Housing program, which required states to establish quasi-governmental local public housing authorities (PHAs) to administer the program. In 1949, Congress declared the federal goal of \"a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family,\" and over the next two decades it enacted provisions to provide affordable housing through incentives to private developers to build low-cost housing. The Housing Act of 1974 created a new rental assistance program, known as Section 8, which provided rental subsidies for private properties, in lieu of development subsidies. Section 8 was later expanded to include portable rental vouchers administered by PHAs. While Section 8 vouchers have effectively replaced subsidies for new development, many housing units that were subsidized under these earlier programs still provide affordable housing today. They are administered by PHAs or private properties, under contract with the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). An early version of food stamps existed for several years during the Depression and was revived in 1961 as a small pilot program. The program became permanent during the Great Society, through the Food Stamp Act of 1964. Originally, states set their own eligibility rules, and benefits varied regionally. This changed in 1971 when the program was effectively converted to a national income guarantee, providing an amount of food stamps to participating households sufficient to buy items equivalent to the Agriculture Department's \"economy diet.\" However, recipients had to contribute a monthly \"purchase requirement\" based on their income in order to obtain benefits. The law set nationally uniform eligibility rules and federally paid benefit levels, but states continued to administer the program. Congress enacted a number of major policy changes to the Food Stamp program over the next three decades, including removal of the purchase requirement in the late 1970s, allowing automatic eligibility for those receiving other public assistance benefits or services in 1985, and limiting access for able-bodied adults without dependents in 1996. In 2008, the Food Stamp program was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). States continue to administer SNAP and have some leeway in determining eligibility through application of the automatic eligibility rules, but benefit levels remain federally financed and nationally uniform. A central feature of the Great Society was the War on Poverty, and the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 was its primary legislative vehicle. That act and its subsequent amendments authorized numerous programs that sought to address the causes of economic disadvantage, and to ameliorate its effects. Programs were designed to meet the multiple needs of low-income preschool children and their families, and the employability needs of low-income youth and adults, and to give low-income people a formal role in planning services for their communities. Modern-day programs with origins in the War on Poverty include Head Start, Job Corps, Adult Basic Education, components of the Workforce Investment Act, the Legal Services Corporation, Weatherization Assistance, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, School Breakfast, the Summer Food Service Program, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the Community Services Block Grant. The Great Society also focused on education; both the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Higher Education Act became law in 1965.  The Great Society also saw the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, which have grown into the nation's largest health care programs. Medicare was created in 1965, providing health coverage as a form of social insurance to elderly and disabled individuals with a significant attachment to the workforce. The same legislation created Medicaid, a means-tested entitlement that finances medical services and long-term care for specified low-income and categorical groups. Medicaid replaced two earlier programs of federal grants to states that provided medical care to welfare recipients and the elderly. Both Medicare and Medicaid have been amended numerous times over the years, expanding both eligible populations and services. A prescription drug benefit was added to Medicare in 2003, which includes a subsidy for low-income beneficiaries. And most recently, the 2010 health reform law\u2014the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 , as amended by P.L. 111-152 )\u2014significantly expanded Medicaid, so that, beginning in FY2014 (or potentially sooner, at state option), Medicaid will cover low-income childless adults in addition to the program's traditional target populations of low-income parents and children, and elderly and disabled individuals. The original Social Security Act's grants to states for cash aid to needy blind and aged individuals were expanded over time to include people with disabilities. However, in contrast to cash aid and related programs for needy families with children, which remain state-administered, Congress \"federalized\" programs for low-income aged, blind, and disabled people in 1972. These earlier programs were replaced by Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which has uniform federal minimum eligibility and benefit rules (rather than state-determined policies) and serves blind and disabled children as well as adults.  Also in the early 1970s, Congress considered but did not enact welfare reform legislation that would have replaced AFDC with a federal minimum cash guarantee for poor families, including working families with two parents. Instead, in 1975 Congress enacted a temporary \"work bonus\" or wage supplement intended to return a portion of Social Security taxes to low-income working households. This program was made permanent in 1978 and became the current Earned\u00a0Income\u00a0Tax Credit (EITC). The credit has been expanded several times over the past 30 years and is currently one of the largest cash assistance programs for low-income households, reflecting the prevailing policy goal of \"make work pay.\"  Consistent with the emphasis on promoting work for low-income families, the welfare reform law of 1996 created TANF, which, as noted above, conditions cash aid on participation in work activities, and also expanded funding for child care. In the year following enactment of welfare reform, low-income families not sufficiently poor for Medicaid gained access to health insurance for their children through enactment of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1997. The Child Tax Credit and refundable Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) also were created in 1997, although the impact of the ACTC originally was limited. In 2001 and subsequent years, the ACTC was expanded so that it now targets assistance toward low-income families. Most recently, Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) in 2009, in an effort to stimulate the economy during recession. While ARRA did not create significant new initiatives for people with limited income, it revised and expanded certain existing policies, at least temporarily, to make them more responsive to the needs of people and communities affected by the downturn. As the following discussion shows, ARRA resulted in a substantial increase in spending on benefits and services for low-income populations between FY2008 and FY2009. The bulk of funding provided by ARRA was intended to be spent during FY2009 and FY2010. Federal spending on benefits and services for low-income people totaled $708 billion in FY2009 and $578 billion in FY2008. These programs generally seek to mitigate the effects of low income by helping people meet basic needs such as health care, food, or shelter, or to address the root causes of economic disadvantage through services, education, or job training. Notably, few programs have poverty reduction as an explicit goal or purpose. Key target populations for many of these programs, including some of the largest, include low-income elderly and disabled individuals, and dependent children and their families. Other target groups for selected programs include veterans, students, people who are homeless, Indians, and refugees, among others.  Figure 1 illustrates the composition of spending, by category, in FY2008 and FY2009. Figure 2 displays FY2008 and FY2009 spending by category, and also highlights the portion of spending in FY2009 attributable to ARRA. Table 1 shows this information, both overall and by category, and the percent change in spending from FY2008 to FY2009. See Appendix Table B -1 for a listing of specific programs in each category. As Figure 1 shows, spending for health care dominates all other categories, accounting for close to half (45%) of total spending for limited-income populations in FY2009. Cash aid is the second largest category but trails health care by a wide margin, with 18% of spending in FY2009. Food assistance is third (11% of FY2009 spending), followed by housing and development (almost 9%), education (8%), social services (6%), energy assistance (almost 2%), and employment and training (1%).  Overall spending on federal benefits and services for low-income populations grew by 22% between FY2008 and FY2009, largely due to policy responses to the recession. Almost two-thirds (64%) of the additional spending was provided under ARRA, the economic stimulus enacted in February 2009. Some large entitlement programs (e.g., Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)) saw additional growth in spending beyond that provided under ARRA, likely due to an increase in eligible and enrolled individuals as a result of the economic downturn. Spending growth from FY2008 to FY2009 was uneven among categories. The largest percentage increase was for energy assistance, which represented less than 1% of all spending in FY2008 and more than tripled in FY2009. Spending for housing and development programs rose by 51%, education by 39%, and employment and training by 38%. Spending on food assistance increased between the two years (32%), as did spending for health care (24%) and social services (22%). Spending for cash aid appeared to drop by 3% between FY2008 and FY2009; however, this was the result of a one-time $300-per-child tax rebate, which was included as spending under the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) in FY2008 but was not targeted toward low-income families. In terms of dollar increases between the two years, health care saw the largest growth, with $61 billion of additional obligations in FY2009. More than half of this increase (54%) resulted from provisions in ARRA that temporarily raised the federal share of Medicaid costs. However, growth in Medicaid spending\u2014regardless of ARRA\u2014accounted for another 30% of the dollar increase in low-income health spending from FY2008 to FY2009. The next largest dollar increase was for housing and development programs, which grew by $20 billion between FY2008 and FY2009. Most of this growth (71%) resulted from additional appropriations provided under ARRA for such programs as Public Housing, Homeless Assistance Grants (specifically for a new Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program), and Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance. ARRA also funded two temporary grants related to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. Spending for food assistance rose by almost $19 billion between FY2008 and FY2009. More than a quarter of this growth resulted from ARRA provisions that increased the dollar value of SNAP benefits. As noted above, however, SNAP grew significantly regardless of the ARRA provisions, as more households became eligible and enrolled in the program during the recession and its aftermath. Additional SNAP obligations unrelated to ARRA accounted for 60% of the FY2009 spending increase in the food assistance category.  Education spending grew by $16 billion from FY2008 to FY2009, although without additional appropriations provided under ARRA, this category would have decreased by $2 billion. However, ARRA was enacted before final decisions were made on total FY2009 appropriations, so appropriators were able to take into consideration the additional amounts already provided through ARRA. Pell Grants for postsecondary students and grants to disadvantaged school districts under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act were the largest beneficiaries of ARRA funding among education programs specifically targeted on low-income populations. Spending for social services rose by $8 billion between FY2008 and FY2009, with almost half of the increase coming from appropriations made by ARRA, specifically for Head Start, the Child Care and Development Fund, and the Community Services Block Grant. Energy spending grew by $7 billion, of which nearly two-thirds (64%) was ARRA funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program. Finally, employment and training saw a $2 billion increase in spending in FY2009, with more than three-quarters (77%) coming from appropriations under ARRA for the Workforce Investment Act and Job Corps. As noted above, cash assistance spending appeared to go down in FY2009, by about $4 billion. However, FY2008 obligations in this category included an unspecified amount of spending for a one-time $300-per-child tax rebate, authorized under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-185 ). This one-time rebate was counted as spending under the ACTC, but was not targeted toward low-income families. Thus, FY2008 spending for low-income people under the ACTC appears higher than it actually was. While ARRA made changes in both the Earned Income Tax Credit and the ACTC, these changes did not take effect until tax year 2009, and therefore associated spending would generally not be seen until FY2010.  Of total spending on programs for low-income people, about 75% is classified in budget terms as \"mandatory\" (also called \"direct\" spending) and the remainder as \"discretionary.\" In mandatory programs, many of which are entitlements to individuals or units of government, Congress defines eligibility and payment rules in authorizing laws. These rules determine the amount of spending that will occur, so Congress generally must amend the authorizing law in order to control federal spending. The amount of federal spending for discretionary programs, on the other hand, is determined by Congress through the annual appropriations process.  Mandatory spending may be structured as open-ended or capped. In an open-ended entitlement program, no predetermined ceiling is imposed on federal expenditures; instead, federal payments are made to all eligible beneficiaries for eligible expenditures as defined in law. (Medicaid is an example of an open-ended entitlement program.) In a capped program, the authorizing law limits the total amount of federal spending that can occur. (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is an example of a capped entitlement program.) Of mandatory spending discussed in this report, more than 90% is through open-ended programs. The pattern of mandatory versus discretionary spending differs by major category of benefits and services. All cash aid spending, and most spending for health care and food assistance, is mandatory. In all three of these categories, spending occurs largely through open-ended entitlement programs. In contrast, all spending for energy assistance and employment and training, and most spending for housing and development and education, is discretionary. Social services spending is a mixture; about two-thirds is mandatory and the rest is discretionary. Of the mandatory social services spending, a little more than half is capped and the balance is open-ended. This report generally looks at spending and policy by major category, such as health care, cash aid, or food assistance. It illustrates the enormous diversity among and within categories in terms of target population and various design elements. However, it is important to note that a few individual programs account for the vast majority of spending for low-income populations, and these programs merit special attention. The four largest programs contributed almost 60% of total spending in each of FY2008 and FY2009, and the top 10 accounted for more than three-fourths. The following provides an overview of these programs; they are discussed in the context of all low-income programs in the balance of the report. Table 2 shows spending for these programs in FY2008 and FY2009, and separately under ARRA. Table 3 highlights key features of these\u00a0programs. As Table 2 shows, Medicaid is the single largest program and alone accounts for nearly 40% of low-income spending. Next in size are the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Notably, SNAP became the second largest program in FY2009 but was number four in spending in FY2008, behind SSI and EITC. Rounding out the top 10 are Pell Grants, the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the low-income drug subsidy under Part D of Medicare, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers.  Because of the effect of Medicaid, more than half (53% in FY2009) of spending under the top 10 programs fell into the health category. Spending for programs in the cash assistance category equaled 23% of spending under the 10 largest programs in FY2009, followed by programs categorized as food assistance (10%) and education (9%). Small percentages of total spending for the top 10 programs went to those categorized as housing (3%), social services (2%), and employment and training (less than 1%). Low-income elderly, disabled, and families with dependent children are the focus of much of the spending under the top 10 programs. Medicaid provides health care for low-income people within certain categorical groups, which are primarily the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and dependent children and their families. Low-income elderly and disabled Medicare recipients receive subsidized prescription drug insurance under Part D. Cash aid goes to low-income elderly and disabled beneficiaries under SSI, and to low-income working households through the EITC and ACTC. TANF serves families with dependent children; states define specific eligibility rules but federal law emphasizes participation in work activities for recipients of cash aid. SNAP provides assistance specifically for the purchase of food to households below a certain income threshold. While the program does not target benefits to certain demographic groups, nearly half of SNAP recipients in FY2009 were children and another 8% were age 60 or older. The law also requires able-bodied non-elderly adults without dependent children to participate in work or training to receive benefits for more than a brief period of time.  The 10 largest programs also include housing vouchers for low-income families (\"families\" are defined by local public housing authorities and may include single individuals). Two education programs are among the top 10, including Pell Grants, which assist students whose family resources are not adequate to meet their college costs. The system used to determine benefit amounts under Pell sometimes gives aid to students with relatively high family income; however, the benefits given to these students are likely to be low. Finally, low-income school districts receive grants through Title I-A of ESEA, but individual students do not necessarily have to be low-income to be served by the program. As noted earlier, about 75% of all spending for limited-income populations is classified as mandatory. This percentage is higher for the top 10 programs; close to 90% of spending under these programs is mandatory, which means the amount spent is a function of program rules set forth in law rather than annual decisions made by congressional appropriators. Moreover, of mandatory programs in the top 10, only TANF is capped; the rest are open-ended. Three of the top 10 programs are classified as discretionary. These are Pell Grants (which also includes a mandatory component), Title I-A of ESEA, and housing vouchers.  With one exception, the 10 largest programs all require that beneficiaries must be determined individually eligible to receive aid. In other words, except for Title I-A of ESEA, individuals or households must meet an income (or equivalent) test to benefit from these programs. The particular income test used, however, varies with the program. For example, Medicaid, SNAP, and the Part D subsidy all use different multiples of the federal poverty guidelines to determine eligibility, in addition to criteria that allow beneficiaries of certain other programs to qualify automatically. Specific dollar amounts are used to define eligibility for SSI and also to determine when EITC benefits begin to phase out. Section 8 housing vouchers use income limits that are based on area median income to define eligibility, and TANF income eligibility thresholds, as noted earlier, are set by states. No absolute income threshold determines eligibility for Pell Grants; however, the lowest-income students receive the largest grants.  As stated above, children are not required to meet an income eligibility test to receive benefits funded by Title I-A of ESEA. Rather, the program uses allocation formulas to direct federal resources toward local educational agencies with relatively high concentrations of low-income students. Once these funds are received by an individual school, students may be served regardless of their family income. Title I-A is an example of a formula grant program. (Other mechanisms for distributing funds include competitive or discretionary awards, and direct benefits to individuals.) Medicaid, TANF, and Section 8 housing vouchers also use formulas to distribute funds, but the specifics vary. Because Medicaid is an open-ended entitlement, the federal government reimburses states for all eligible expenditures with no cap on federal spending; however, the federal \"matching rate\" is calculated for each state by a formula inversely related to its per capita income (poorer states get a larger federal match, and wealthier states get a smaller federal match). TANF allocates block grants to states according to a formula that considers their spending patterns under the predecessor Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Funding to renew existing housing vouchers is distributed to local public housing authorities (not states) according to a formula established by Congress each year in appropriations law, which typically is related to the use and cost of vouchers in the local area.  As noted above, formula grants are one of three major ways that federal programs for low-income populations distribute funds; the other two are competitive or discretionary awards, and direct benefits to individuals. None of the 10 largest programs award funds on a competitive or discretionary basis, other than a relatively small component of TANF. Instead, these large programs either allocate funds to states or another unit of government by formula, as just described, or give benefits to eligible individuals directly (or through a nongovernment intermediary). Federal benefits are provided directly under SNAP (although states administer the program), SSI (although states may supplement the federal benefit), EITC, ACTC, Pell Grants, and the Medicare Part D subsidy. Benefits provided by the federal government directly to eligible individuals typically are 100% federally funded, although, as noted above, states incur administrative costs under SNAP (which are reimbursed at a 50% federal rate) and may supplement federal payments under SSI. Some states also operate their own earned income tax credit programs, which supplement the federal EITC. Medicaid and TANF, however, are federal-state programs, and states must spend a significant amount of their own money to receive federal funds. As noted above, state Medicaid expenditures are reimbursed by the federal government at prescribed matching rates. Unlike Medicaid, TANF is not a matching grant; however, to receive TANF block grant funds, states must maintain a certain level of their own spending from prior years. Local educational agencies that receive Title I-A grants also are required to maintain a certain amount of prior-year spending and must use federal funds to \"supplement and not supplant\" nonfederal funds that would otherwise be used for the same purpose.  The following sections provide brief overviews of the programs included in each major category of benefits and services, organized by size of spending in FY2009. Tables included in Appendix B individually list and identify key features of the programs, and brief fact sheets on each program are provided in Appendix C . As health care dominates federal spending on benefits and services for people with limited income, Medicaid dominates spending within the health care category. Medicaid accounted for 83% of health care spending in FY2009 and, as noted above, was nearly 40% of all spending in this report. Medicaid is intended to provide medical assistance to specified categories of low-income people who lack the income and resources to afford necessary medical care. Low-income parents, dependent children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities have been the primary target populations served by Medicaid. The program finances the delivery of a wide range of primary and acute medical services as well as long-term care. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage for low-income children who lack health insurance but whose family income exceeds Medicaid eligibility levels. The next largest health programs are the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D, which helps low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities pay for prescription drugs, and medical care for low-income veterans without service-connected disabilities. The latter program pays for an array of primary care, specialized care, and related social and support services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Indian Health Service also offers a wide variety of health services to its target population, who are American Indians or Alaskan Natives living on reservations or within a specified service delivery area. Consolidated Health Centers offer primary and other health services to low-income populations in medically underserved areas, and the Maternal and Child Health block grant supports preventive and primary health care services for low-income women, infants, and children. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is intended to address the unmet care and treatment needs of individuals living with HIV or AIDS who lack insurance or resources to pay for core medical services, including prescription drugs, and related support services. Additional programs focus on specific health services, such as family planning and early breast and cervical cancer detection, or specific populations, such as refugees. Three programs account for the bulk of cash aid spending, and each is among the 10 largest of all programs for low-income people. SSI, which aims to provide a minimum income for aged, blind, or disabled individuals with very low income and resources, is the largest and accounted for slightly more than 40% of cash aid spending in FY2009. The refundable portion of the EITC accounted for another 33% of cash aid spending, and almost 19% resulted from the refundable ACTC. The EITC subsidizes the wages of low-income workers, with most benefits going to those with children. The ACTC is a refundable credit for families whose tax liability is too low for them to fully benefit from the regular nonrefundable Child Tax Credit. The cash aid category also includes TANF, the welfare reform program that replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1996. As AFDC's successor, TANF is still sometimes viewed as traditional \"welfare\" for poor families; however, the majority of TANF expenditures are for activities other than cash aid. TANF aims to increase the flexibility of states in meeting several statutory goals, including assisting needy families so that children can remain in their homes; ending dependence of needy parents through job preparation, work, and marriage; preventing and reducing incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and encouraging the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. In this report, TANF spending has been allocated among cash aid, social services, and employment and training, based on states' reporting of their actual expenditures. Finally, cash aid programs include pensions for needy elderly or disabled veterans and their dependents or survivors. SNAP (formerly food stamps) dominates spending for food assistance, accounting for about two-thirds of obligations in this category and registering as the second largest of all low-income programs in FY2009. SNAP attempts to alleviate hunger and malnutrition and to help low-income households purchase food to support a healthy diet. The next largest area of food assistance spending is for programs that subsidize the costs of breakfast and lunch served to low-income schoolchildren; these programs aim to support learning readiness, promote healthy eating, and protect the health and well-being of low-income children. Related programs subsidize the costs of meals and snacks for children in child care and other out-of-school settings (and some low-income elderly and disabled adults in adult care settings) and for children during the summer when they lack access to school-based meal programs.  Food assistance programs also include the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which provides supplemental food and nutrition education to low-income pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding women and their infants and young children who are at nutritional risk. The program seeks to protect children's health during critical developmental stages, to prevent health problems, and to improve health status. Food assistance programs also include congregate and home-delivered meals for the elderly to reduce hunger and promote socialization and well-being for older individuals, and emergency food assistance in the form of commodities for individuals defined by their states as needy. The federal government supports the housing needs of low-income people primarily by subsidizing the cost of rental units in the private market. Section 8 housing vouchers and project-based rental assistance together accounted for 43% of all housing and development spending in FY2009. (The voucher component of Section 8 is one of the 10 largest low-income programs.) The overarching goal of Section 8 is to provide low-income people with decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Public Housing, which represented 18% of spending in this category in FY2009, achieves a similar goal by making publicly owned rental units available to low-income tenants at affordable prices. Federal spending for Public Housing supports the capital needs and operating costs of publicly owned housing developments, as well as the HOPE VI program, which demolishes, rehabilitates, and replaces distressed public housing units. Additional housing programs are intended to expand the supply of supportive housing for low-income elderly and disabled households, as well as individuals living with AIDS. Homeless Assistance Grants attempt to meet the needs of homeless individuals and families, including individuals with disabilities, for basic shelter, short-term and long-term housing, and related support services. Two block grants\u2014HOME and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)\u2014target federal assistance toward communities with high rates of poverty and aging housing stock (among other factors) to help meet the housing needs of low-income homeowners, homebuyers, and renters (HOME) and to expand the community's supply of decent housing and economic development activities (CDBG). An additional block grant provides housing assistance and helps develop private housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands.  To address housing needs in rural areas, loans are available to help low-income households purchase, build, or renovate homes, and rental subsidies are available for low-income tenants. Low-interest loans and grants also are available to support new and improved water and waste disposal facilities in low-income rural communities. Finally, the housing and development category includes the Public Works and Economic Development program, which provides grants to distressed communities to help them revitalize, expand, and upgrade their physical infrastructure to attract new industries, expand businesses, diversify their economies, and generate job and investment growth. Certain temporary programs are included in the housing and development category. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program-1 was established by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-289 ) to assist in rehabilitating abandoned and foreclosed homes for occupancy by low-income tenants. Obligations under this program occurred in FY2009. Likewise, FY2009 spending includes obligations under two temporary programs created by ARRA as adjuncts to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. These temporary programs offered grants to states in lieu of tax credits and provided capital investments for owners of certain LIHTC-financed properties. They were enacted in response to the financial crisis, which, along with the departure of several large tax credit investors, made it difficult for developers to sell their tax credits to raise capital. Finally, ARRA added funds to HUD's Homeless Assistance Grants, specifically for a new Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program. The Federal Pell Grant Program is the single largest education program for people with limited incomes, accounting for 43% of targeted federal education spending in FY2009. The program is among the 10 largest in this report. Pell Grants are one of several ways the federal government helps subsidize the costs of higher education for needy students. Other grant programs with similar goals include Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants, Federal Work-Study, and the Academic Competitiveness and Smart Grant programs. In addition to direct assistance to students, the federal government provides institutional aid to help expand the capacity of colleges and universities that serve high proportions of low-income and minority students. Federal TRIO Programs offer grants to institutions of higher education and other organizations to motivate and support disadvantaged students as they move from high school through college. The GEAR-UP program provides services to low-income children in elementary and secondary schools who are at risk of dropping out and aims to increase the number of such students who enter and succeed in higher education. The second largest education program included in the report (also one of the 10 largest low-income programs) is Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which accounted for more than one-third of targeted federal education spending in FY2009. Title I-A provides grants to local educational agencies with high concentrations of disadvantaged children and aims to ensure that all children have an opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach at least minimum proficiency on challenging academic achievement standards. A separate program has similar goals for children of migrant workers, and the Rural Education Achievement Program helps rural school districts meet academic achievement standards. The Bureau of Indian Education operates several programs to meet the educational needs of Indian children living on or near reservations. Other elementary and secondary education grant programs aim to increase student achievement through improvements in teacher and principal quality and to improve teacher knowledge and student performance in mathematics and science.  Literacy is the focus of the Adult Basic Education program, which helps adults to become literate and obtain the skills necessary for employment and self-sufficiency, and to become partners in their own children's educational development. Reading First and Early Reading First also promoted literacy, focusing specifically on young children, from preschool through grade 3. Finally, 21 st Century Community Learning Centers are intended to provide a wide range of remedial education and academic enrichment opportunities during non-school hours for children in high-poverty and low-performing schools. The social services category is diverse and includes a wide variety of activities to support low-income or otherwise vulnerable populations. Of spending categorized as social services in this report, the vast majority\u201493% in FY2009\u2014is focused directly on children and youth or their families. Services funded by TANF are the largest single activity in this category, accounting for almost a quarter of social services spending in this report. As noted in the earlier discussion of cash aid, TANF is often thought of as traditional welfare for poor families. However, states have flexibility in spending their TANF grants, and the majority of funds are used for noncash aid, including a wide variety of social services for families with children. TANF spending in the social services category also includes obligations under competitive grants for promotion of healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood. Head Start is the second largest program in this category, accounting for more than 20% of social services spending for low-income populations. Head Start aims to promote school readiness for young children through a full array of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to children and their families. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), with 16% of social services spending in FY2009, subsidizes the cost of child care for low-income parents while they work or attend school. Additional programs targeted toward children and families include Child Support Enforcement, which provides services on behalf of custodial parents who are seeking support for their children from the children's noncustodial parent. Foster Care grants are used by states to provide temporary homes for children who cannot remain safely with their families; Adoption Assistance helps facilitate the adoption of children with special needs as defined by their state; and the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program helps current and former foster children transition to a self-sufficient adulthood. Of social services programs not specifically targeted toward children and families, the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) is the largest and most flexible. The program supports a continuum of services to promote self-sufficiency but decisions about target populations and services are left to the states. Other social services programs focus on specific target populations. For example, social services for the elderly are provided under the Older Americans Act; support and advocacy grants help people with developmental disabilities; and various human services are provided for American Indians. Programs that focus services at the community level include the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), which aims to reduce poverty and empower low-income individuals and families to become self-sufficient, and Emergency Food and Shelter Grants, which provide services for homeless and hungry individuals in high-need communities. Finally, the Legal Services Corporation attempts to ensure equal access to the justice system for people who are otherwise unable to afford legal counsel. Two programs make up the energy assistance category. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps low-income households pay their heating and cooling expenses, and the Weatherization Assistance Program helps increase the energy efficiency of homes occupied by low-income people to reduce energy costs and improve health and safety.  Two programs serving disadvantaged youth comprised almost half of FY2009 employment and training spending included in this report. Specifically, youth activities under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) provide a variety of services to improve the educational and skill competencies of eligible youth and to develop connections with employers and mentoring opportunities with adults. Job Corps focuses on those disadvantaged youth who can benefit from an intensive residential program to become employable and productive. The employment and training category also includes work-related services for needy families with children under TANF, a small employment and training program for recipients of SNAP benefits, and a program that provides employability and related services to help refugees and other humanitarian entrants find jobs quickly. Remaining programs include WIA's adult activities program; Community Service Employment for Older Americans, which helps older individuals (age 55 or older) become self-sufficient through community service jobs and training; and Foster Grandparents, which provides stipends for low-income older individuals to provide services to children with special needs. As described above, federal programs for low-income people can be grouped into several major categories of benefits and services. Key target groups for these benefits and services include the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and children and families, among others. Within these broad target populations, there is not necessarily a coherent policy regarding who should receive assistance, although some themes emerge within categories. Programs use different concepts to define who is eligible. Many programs use explicit income eligibility criteria that individuals, families, or households must meet, but the specific levels and measures of income vary. Some measures are uniform throughout the country; others vary by geography. Some are adjusted annually for inflation; others are not. In some cases, income criteria are used to set priorities for who is served but are not necessarily applied to every participant. Some programs use asset tests in addition to income tests. Many programs have categorical requirements, such as age or disability, in addition to income criteria; and some use alternative criteria that allow specified groups or categories of people to qualify automatically without having to meet an individual income test. Automatic \"exclusions\" exist under some programs, so that people who would otherwise qualify based on their income are excluded if they fall into specified categories. Finally, some programs establish federal parameters for eligibility but allow states or other entities to set their own income eligibility criteria within these parameters. This section of the report discusses the various ways in which individual eligibility is determined. The section looks at use of the federal poverty guidelines, as well as other measures of economic need used to define eligibility such as specific dollar amounts, percentages of area or state median income, and the \"need analysis\" system used for postsecondary student aid. The section briefly discusses asset limits, and then turns to nonfinancial or categorical rules. Table 4 summarizes the various concepts used in determining individual eligibility and Table B -2 in Appendix B shows the concepts used by specific programs.  It is important to note that being eligible for a program does not necessarily mean that an individual will receive benefits from that program. While some of the programs included here, especially some of the larger ones, are entitlements to individuals, which means that all eligible applicants must receive benefits, most programs are either discretionary (subject to annual appropriations) or capped entitlements, and eligible individuals are served only to the extent that funds are available. Finally, not all programs require participants to be determined individually eligible. Some target federal resources toward communities or entities where low-income populations are likely to be concentrated and do not examine the income, assets, or other characteristics of a particular individual or family. Such targeting mechanisms are discussed in the next major section of this\u00a0report. As already stated, programs in this report do not strictly serve the poor. Rather, target populations are more accurately characterized as people with \"low\" or \"limited\" income. Even among programs that use the federal poverty guidelines as a criterion for determining eligibility, very few limit participation to individuals or households with income at or below \"poverty\" as defined by the federal government. Most programs that use the federal poverty guidelines (FPG) as an element in defining eligibility use a multiple of poverty, with some programs defining eligibility as high as 200% or 300% of FPG.  The poverty guidelines trace their origin to a 1963 Social Security Administration study that based poverty income cutoffs on the amount families needed to spend to meet their basic food needs (the \"Economy Food Plan\") and the relationship between expenditures on food and expenditures on other items. With food accounting for roughly one-third of low-income budgets in a 1950s survey of consumption, the poverty cutoffs were set at three times the Economy Food Plan for a given family size and type. These poverty cutoffs were subsequently adopted by the Census Bureau for counting the poor, and are also the basis for the HHS poverty guidelines used for administering programs. They are uniform nationwide (except for Alaska and Hawaii) and are updated annually for inflation (see Table 4 ). Most health care programs that serve people with limited income use FPG as a criterion in determining eligibility, typically in conjunction with categorical requirements. Mandatory coverage groups under Medicaid, for example, which has numerous pathways to eligibility, include different categories of children and families with income ranging from 100% to 185% of FPG. Optional coverage groups (which states may serve at their discretion) include additional categories, including certain elderly and disabled individuals, with income as high as 250% of FPG. The CHIP program serves children with family income above Medicaid eligibility levels, at income thresholds established by states with federal approval. (As of January 2009, the highest reported income standard was 350% of FPG, in New Jersey. ) Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for the low-income prescription drug subsidy under Part D if their income is no higher than 150% of FPG, although the deepest subsidy goes to those below 135% of poverty. Remaining health programs that use FPG either give priority to people below 100% of poverty (Family Planning and the Maternal and Child Health block grant), or provide services free of charge to those below 100% but allow higher-income participants on a sliding fee scale basis (up to 200% of FPG under Consolidated Health Centers and 250% for Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection).  Cash aid, housing and development, and education programs generally do not use the poverty guidelines in determining eligibility. An exception is the TRIO programs for certain low-income postsecondary students, which cap income eligibility at 150% of FPG. TANF eligibility thresholds are established by states and are well below the federal poverty guidelines in most\u00a0states. Food assistance programs typically use multiples of the federal poverty guidelines in determining eligibility, but they also provide automatic eligibility to categorical groups. The SNAP program generally serves those with gross income up to 130% of poverty. Child nutrition programs serve meals free to children with family income up to 130% of poverty, and at a reduced price to children with family income up to 185%. The WIC program caps eligibility at 185% of poverty. The nutrition program authorized by the Older Americans Act gives priority to certain groups, including seniors with the greatest economic need, defined as 100% of poverty.  In the social services category, CSBG and Head Start use 100% of the federal poverty guidelines as their income eligibility limit, but they both provide flexibility to states (in the case of CSBG) or grantees (for Head Start) in adjusting this limit upwards. Likewise, the Legal Services Corporation sets eligibility at 125% of FPG, but allows it to be increased up to 200% in certain circumstances. The SSBG has no federal income eligibility limit except for services funded by TANF grants that are transferred to the SSBG, which may only be used for families with income below 200% of FPG. Like the elderly nutrition program mentioned above, the Older Americans Act grant programs for supportive services and senior centers and for family caregivers give priority to seniors with income below 100% of poverty. LIHEAP uses 150% of poverty as its income eligibility limit, or 60% of state median income, if higher. Weatherization formerly used 150% of FPG to define income eligibility, but effective in FY2009, this was increased to 200%. Both weatherization and LIHEAP allow automatic eligibility for those eligible for certain other programs.  Employment and training programs for people with limited income use the federal poverty guidelines as one of several eligibility criteria, which include other measures of low income as well as categorical groups. Job Corps limits eligibility to those with income no higher than 100% of FPG; however, certain groups qualify automatically. Youth activities under WIA set eligibility at 100% of FPG, or 70% of the lower living standard income level (described below), if higher. The same criteria are used to give priority for certain adult activities under WIA. Both adult and youth activities under WIA also allow automatic eligibility for specified groups. Community Service Employment for Older Americans and Foster Grandparents (as in effect in FY2009) both limit eligibility to those with income no higher than 125% of poverty. Three alternative measures of income are most commonly used to define eligibility for programs that have individual income eligibility criteria but do not use the federal poverty guidelines. These measures are used primarily, but not exclusively, in three categories of federal benefits and services. Specifically, most cash assistance programs set an actual dollar amount that determines who is eligible; housing and development programs typically use a percentage of area median income; and student financial assistance programs use a relative concept of need that considers both available family resources and the actual cost of education. A fourth alternative measure is the lower living standard income level, which is used in conjunction with the poverty guidelines in certain employment and training programs. In the cash assistance category, specific dollar amounts are used to determine eligibility (and benefit levels) for pensions for needy veterans; the same concept is used in the health care category to determine eligibility for free medical care for needy veterans. Specific dollar amounts also are used to determine eligibility and benefit levels under SSI, and to determine when EITC benefits begin to phase out. Veterans' benefits, SSI, and EITC are generally adjusted each year for price inflation. Veterans' benefits and SSI adjustments are tied to Social Security cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs); and EITC is adjusted for price changes through indexing to the Consumer Price Index.  As noted previously, under TANF, states set their own dollar limits to define who is eligible to participate. (See Appendix D for references to further information about the current VA income thresholds, SSI eligibility limits, and EITC phase-out limits.) Housing and development programs typically use the concept of area median income, with various percentages of local area median income used to define \"low-income,\" \"very low-income\" and \"extremely low-income.\" These income limits are then used to determine program eligibility. For example, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers serve \"very low-income\" families, defined as those with income no higher than 50% of the area median. However, 75% of the Section 8 vouchers that become available each year must go to \"extremely low-income\" people, defined as those with income no higher than 30% of area median. Under limited circumstances, vouchers may go to \"low-income\" households, with income up to 80% of area median. Similarly, Public Housing serves low-income families (80% of area median) but at least 40% of units that become available each year must go to extremely low-income families (30% of area median). Supportive housing programs for the elderly and disabled limit eligibility to households with income no higher than 50% of area median, while Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) and Indian Housing Block Grants serve people with income up to 80% of area median. The single-family rural housing loan program makes guaranteed loans available to households with income as high as 115% of area median, while direct loans are limited to those with income no higher than 80% of area median. (See Appendix D for references to further information about area median family incomes published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.) Few non-housing programs use the median income concept. Exceptions are the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) and LIHEAP, which both use state median income as a component of their eligibility criteria. CCDF allows states to define their own income eligibility limits within the federal maximum of 85% of state median income, and LIHEAP, as noted earlier, uses 60% of state median income as an alternative measure of low income, if higher than 150% of the federal poverty guidelines. There is no absolute income threshold for certain postsecondary student aid programs. As noted above, these programs use a relative concept to determine the amount of aid a student is eligible to receive. Applicants provide information about family income and assets through completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Assistance (FAFSA). This information is then used to determine the Expected Family Contribution (EFC), or the amount the student's family is expected to contribute toward the student's education. Different EFC formulas are applied to three different groups of students: those considered dependent on their parents; independent students with no dependents other than a spouse; and independent students with dependents other than a spouse. The federal need analysis methodology is used for Pell Grants and several smaller higher education programs such as Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Federal Work-Study, and Academic Competiveness and Smart Grants. Aid is capped under the Pell Grant program, so that higher income students are likely to receive smaller awards and the majority of students who receive Pell grants are low-income. (See Appendix D for references to additional information on the need analysis system.) Employment and training programs for adults and youth under WIA, as discussed earlier, use the lower living standard income level (LLSIL) as one component in eligibility determinations. The LLSIL has its origins in a series of family budgets developed by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In 1967, BLS published estimates for family budgets at three standards of living\u2014lower, intermediate, and higher\u2014based on a list of goods and services needed to achieve those standards of living and their prices. These budgets were last fully priced in 1969. They were subsequently updated by summary components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) through 1981, when the BLS family budget series was discontinued. Since 1981, the LLSIL has been updated annually based on overall changes in the CPI-U. (See Appendix D for references to further information about the current LLSILs.) Under WIA, individuals are determined eligible (or, in the case of certain adult activities, receive priority) if their income is at or below 100% of the federal poverty guidelines, or 70% of the LLSIL, whichever is higher. Unlike the federal poverty guidelines, the LLSIL vary by region and by metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. As illustrated in the discussion above, measures of income used to determine eligibility vary widely among federal programs. It is important to note that definitions of countable income also vary. Some programs have explicit rules for counting income while many do not. A full discussion of the treatment of income is beyond the scope of this report; however, readers should know there may be differences between programs, so that income counted in determining eligibility for one program might not be counted in another, even though the programs might appear to use similar eligibility criteria.  Wages are typically counted as income, although some programs disregard a portion of earned income as an incentive for aid recipients to work. Programs differ as to whether they count Social Security and retirement income, public or private disability insurance, other work-related benefits such as Unemployment Compensation and Workers' Compensation, and investment income such as interest and dividends. Benefits provided under means-tested programs often\u2014but not always\u2014are excluded from the definition of income when determining eligibility for another means-tested program. Programs vary as to whether they count the income of the individual applicant, or also the income of a spouse, children, or other household members; in other words, the definition of \"filing unit\" varies among programs. Income can be looked at before tax, or after tax; on a monthly or an annual basis. Finally, some programs specify allowable deductions from countable income.  Moreover, income (and assets, as discussed below) used to determine eligibility for a particular program might be evaluated differently when determining benefit levels under that program. Individuals with the same amount of countable income or assets might qualify for different levels of benefits, because of the program's specific calculation rules. This section of the report has focused primarily on eligibility rules; benefit determinations are discussed briefly in a later\u00a0section. In addition to income eligibility rules, some programs use explicit asset or resource tests to limit eligibility. In other words, applicants may not have assets (e.g., cars, bank accounts; see Table 4 ) valued above a certain level to be eligible for a particular program. As with income eligibility rules, the amount of assets or resources that are subject to limits varies widely among programs. Likewise, programs define countable assets differently, although typically they are limited to liquid assets. Many exclude the value of a primary residence and personal belongings, and some overlook all or part of the value of a car.  Within the health care category, asset tests apply for the VA medical care program and the low-income subsidy under Part D of Medicare. Under CHIP, states have the option of applying an asset test, although few states currently do, and Medicaid is required to use an asset test only for certain categories of beneficiaries that are age 65 or older, have disabilities, and/or have high medical expenses. In the cash assistance category, asset rules apply to pensions for needy veterans and to the SSI program. States also may choose to apply asset tests in their TANF programs, and the majority of states currently do. SNAP is the only food assistance program with an explicit resource test, although it is not applied to households that are automatically eligible because they have already received benefits or services under another means-tested program. While housing programs do not have asset tests, several impute a certain amount of income from assets. These include single-family rural housing loans, supportive housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities, and Section 8 vouchers and project-based rental assistance. Higher education programs that use the \"need analysis\" system consider assets along with income and the cost of school attendance to determine how much financial aid a student may receive. Programs that were historically linked to the former AFDC program, including Foster Care and Adoption Assistance, still have remnants of the AFDC assets test. And, Legal Services Corporation grantees are required to establish \"reasonable\" asset limits for eligible individuals and households. For many programs, categorical requirements apply in addition to financial eligibility rules, so that an applicant must be both income-eligible and a member of the program's target population. While some programs are intended to help people in general below a certain income level, most are targeted on specific segments of the low-income population. As noted previously, key target populations for low-income programs, including many of the largest included here, are the elderly and individuals with disabilities, and dependent children and their families. Other target groups for selected programs include veterans, students, people who are homeless, Indians, and refugees, among others. Some programs also impose behavioral requirements as a condition of eligibility. For example, recipients of TANF cash assistance must comply with work and training requirements and cooperate with child support enforcement efforts; student aid recipients must generally maintain good academic standing; and certain Public Housing residents must participate in a self-sufficiency program or engage in community service. Able-bodied adults without dependent children must comply with work and training requirements to receive SNAP benefits for more than a limited time, and the EITC and ACTC go only to workers with earnings and their families. To receive CCDF-funded child care, parents must be working or in training, in addition to meeting income eligibility criteria. Certain behaviors or characteristics automatically exclude individuals from participating in some programs. For example, postsecondary students, households with members on strike (unless they were eligible before the strike), or people living in institutions are automatically disqualified from SNAP, even if they otherwise meet eligibility rules. Federal law bars individuals who are fleeing arrest or have been convicted of a drug-related felony from participation in SNAP and TANF, and individuals fleeing prosecution or confinement for a felony also are disqualified from SSI. TANF further allows states to test cash aid applicants and recipients for substance abuse and to sanction those who fail. Federal housing law prohibits individuals who have been convicted of producing methamphetamine on federally-assisted housing property or who are subject to lifetime registration on a state sex offender registry from admission to Public Housing or receipt of Section 8 vouchers. Public housing authorities have the discretion to adopt additional criteria, barring admission to households on the basis of such factors as other criminal convictions, poor credit histories, poor rental histories, or other criteria set by the PHA.  Treatment of noncitizens under federal programs serving low-income populations is a complex topic that is beyond the scope of this report. Federal policy in this area is found in the various programs' authorizing statutes, but also in overarching provisions enacted in the 1996 welfare reform ( P.L. 104-193 ) and immigration reform ( P.L. 104-208 ) laws, as subsequently amended, as well as policy interpretations by executive branch agencies. Eligibility of noncitizens varies across and within programs and often depends on the noncitizens' immigration status, when they arrived in the U.S., how long they have lived here legally, their work history and military connection, and policies in the state where they live. Aliens living in the U.S. without legal authorization are generally barred from access to most federal benefits. As distinct from categorical or behavioral requirements that apply in addition to income eligibility rules, a concept of \"automatic eligibility\" is sometimes used as an alternative to individual income eligibility. If someone meets the eligibility criteria for one program, that person is automatically deemed eligible for another program, simplifying the process for both the applicant and the administering agency. In some programs, people are automatically determined eligible because they fit a particular demographic group or have a particular characteristic.  Among health care programs, Medicaid, the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D, and services for refugees allow some degree of automatic eligibility. For example, SSI recipients are one of several groups that automatically qualify for Medicaid; SSI and Medicaid recipients are automatically eligible for the Part D subsidy; and unaccompanied minor children are automatically eligible for transitional medical services for refugees.  Cash assistance programs typically do not allow automatic eligibility for specified groups, while almost all food assistance programs do. TANF and SSI recipients automatically qualify for SNAP; TANF and SNAP recipients are automatically eligible for child nutrition programs; and TANF, SNAP and Medicaid recipients are automatically eligible for WIC, if they also are at nutritional risk. Head Start children, residents of emergency shelters, and runaway and homeless youth are examples of other groups that automatically qualify for some nutrition programs. Most housing and development programs that have individual income eligibility criteria do not allow automatic eligibility for particular groups as an alternative. Homeless Assistance Grants, however, base eligibility on a person's residential status rather than their income, and Indian Housing Block Grants allow certain non-low-income households to receive assistance if they meet other criteria related to their need for housing. In the education category, the Pell Grant program allows certain postsecondary students\u2014dependent students and independent students with dependents other than a spouse\u2014to qualify for an automatic zero EFC (expected family contribution). This means they would receive the maximum Pell Grant award if they enroll full-time at a school where the cost of attendance equals or exceeds the maximum award. In general, to qualify for the automatic zero EFC, these students must have received means-tested benefits from other federal programs or had been eligible to file certain federal income tax returns, or had been a dislocated worker. However, parents or students also must have family income levels at or below certain annual thresholds ($30,000 in award year 2010-2011), to qualify. Children of deceased Iraq/Afghanistan service members also may qualify for an automatic zero EFC. One of the benefits of qualifying for an automatic zero EFC is that it greatly reduces the response burden associated with completing financial aid forms. With the exception of postsecondary student aid, education programs typically do not require individuals to be determined income-eligible for assistance; rather, they target assistance toward areas or entities where low-income students are likely to be served (such targeting mechanisms are discussed later in the report). However, certain education programs use alternative criteria to identify eligible participants. For example, Adult Basic Education serves adults who lack basic skills or credentials; the Title I Migrant Education Program serves the children of migrant workers; and Education for Homeless Children and Youth bases eligibility on children's living situations. GEAR-UP serves students determined to be at risk of dropping out, and Reading First and Early Reading First based eligibility on a child's reading proficiency. Indian education programs generally serve children who are members of federally recognized tribes. Among social services programs, Child Support Enforcement automatically serves families receiving TANF, foster care payments, or who are eligible for Medicaid. Children receiving public assistance, foster children, and homeless children automatically qualify for Head Start, along with a limited number of non-low-income children if they meet other criteria related to their likelihood to benefit from the program. Individuals with developmental disabilities are eligible for services under Developmental Disabilities Basic Support and Advocacy Grants, regardless of their individual income status. Likewise, older foster children and former foster children may participate in the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, without meeting individual income eligibility criteria. Both energy programs included in the report allow automatic eligibility for TANF and SSI recipients. Weatherization also allows states to make LIHEAP recipients automatically eligible, and LIHEAP provides automatic eligibility for beneficiaries of SNAP and certain veterans benefits. Finally, in the employment and training category, public assistance recipients, homeless youth, and certain foster youth automatically qualify for WIA youth activities and Job Corps. And, the WIA adult program gives priority for certain services to adults considered low-income, which may include those who receive public assistance or are homeless.  The previous section looked at the ways in which programs define individual eligibility for federal benefits and services for low-income people. In most programs, the process of determining individual eligibility and delivering benefits and services is done through entities such as states, local governments, or private organizations. Federal funds are often provided to these entities via mechanisms that target areas with the greatest need or concentration of eligible individuals. These targeting provisions also may compensate for variation in fiscal capacity at the state and local level.  This section looks at three primary concepts used to target federal resources: allocation formulas that distribute funding to states or other areas based, at least in part, on factors related to need; cost-sharing rules that vary the federal share of total program costs by a measure of need; and provisions that limit federal funds only to certain institutions or jurisdictions that serve low-income people. As with individual eligibility rules, specific targeting provisions vary widely, even within the same general concept. Moreover, some programs use a combination of these concepts; in other words, federal funds might be allocated to states according to factors related to the target population, but the federal share of the program's costs might also be determined by a measure of need. Table 5 provides a summary of these targeting concepts, and Table B -2 in Appendix B shows use of the concepts by program. There is considerable overlap between programs that impose individual eligibility criteria (those discussed in the previous section) and those that also target federal resources by a measure of need. In other words, programs may use targeting mechanisms to distribute federal funds, but individuals still must be determined income-eligible for the program. Some programs, however, rely on broad targeting mechanisms only, and do not require participants or beneficiaries to meet an individual eligibility test. Federal grant programs, especially those targeted toward a particular population, frequently use formulas to allocate funding among states or, sometimes, local governments or other entities. Many programs in this report are formula grants (as compared with competitive or discretionary awards, or direct benefits to individuals), and use population-based allocation factors as a way to direct resources toward areas with large concentrations of the program's target group. Programs that allocate funding in this way usually have a cap on total federal spending, so that allocation factors determine each jurisdiction's relative share of the total amount available.  While programs for low-income people often allocate funds in part on a measure of economic need (e.g., population with income at or below the poverty guidelines), not all formula factors are need-based. Some programs base allocations in whole or in part on historic spending patterns, which may reflect a wide variety of factors; if current population-based formulas were applied to these programs, the distribution of resources might change significantly. Moreover, \"hold-harmless\" provisions, small-state minimums, and \"ceilings\" and \"floors\" are often used to mitigate large changes in a particular jurisdiction's formula-based allotment from one year to the next. The specific data sources to be used also are significant and sometimes are specified in statute.  The following provides an overview of the types of allocation factors used in low-income programs, but does not constitute a complete explanation of any particular formula, nor does it discuss the effectiveness or efficiency of these allocation factors in actually directing resources toward areas with the greatest need.  In the health care category, the CHIP program for low-income children without health insurance currently (effective FY2009) allocates funds among states according to past and projected spending. Previously, however, CHIP allocated funds among states, in part, using two relevant population factors: the number of low-income children in the state and the number of such children without health insurance. The Ryan White program for low-income people with HIV or AIDS allocates funds to metropolitan areas and states based on relative population size and incidence of AIDS cases, but does not use an income factor. The Maternal and Child Health block grant allocates funds according to states' relative shares of funding under predecessor programs, and according to their population of low-income children. TANF block grants are allocated among states according to their historic spending under the predecessor AFDC program, so that states with higher expenditures under AFDC get relatively larger grants under TANF. Among food assistance programs, WIC uses a formula that reflects actual food and caseload costs, and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program allocates resources according to caseload, based on past participation. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) allocates resources based on the number of poor people in each state, in combination with the number of unemployed persons. Nutrition for the elderly under the Older Americans Act allocates funds among states based on the population age 60 and older, with no income factor. Most housing and development programs use a need-based formula to allocate funds, but the formulas vary widely. Rural programs use such factors as state shares of rural population, rural poverty, overcrowded housing or housing units without plumbing, and unemployment. Housing programs for the elderly and people with disabilities use measures of elderly or disabled individuals, in addition to housing factors. Community Development Block Grants go to eligible communities and states based on poverty, population, overcrowded housing, age of housing, and slow population growth; somewhat similar factors are used for Emergency Shelter Grants and Indian Housing Block Grants. The HOME program uses the number of older housing units occupied by low-income households and number of poor families. The temporary Neighborhood Stabilization Program-1 allocated funds to states and local governments on the basis of home foreclosures, subprime mortgages, and homes in default or delinquency. In the case of Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, Congress establishes a formula, typically in annual appropriations laws, for allocating funding among public housing authorities to renew their existing vouchers. The formula is usually based on some measure of the utilization and cost of vouchers in the local area. However, the geographic distribution of vouchers that are renewed each year is a function of historic patterns and may not necessarily reflect the current distribution of the eligible population. Likewise, operating and capital funds for Public Housing are allocated by formula, but the distribution of public housing units that receive these funds is a reflection of decisions made by local communities to participate in the program in its earlier days. Many education programs are designed as formula grants and rely in some way on counts of poor children. Title I-A of ESEA distributes funds to local educational agencies according to four separate formulas that consider such factors as number of school-aged children in poverty and average per-pupil expenditures in the state. Areas with high concentrations of poverty receive additional weighting under two of the four formulas. Aggregate state allocations under Title I-A in turn determine state shares under other ESEA programs, including Education for Homeless Children and Youth and 21 st Century Community Learning Centers. The number of school-aged children in poverty also is an allocation factor for Reading First, Math/Science Partnerships, and Improving Teacher Quality Grants.  Certain education programs use allocation factors related to the target population, but not explicitly tied to income. The Migrant Education Program (under Title I of ESEA) allocates funds according to the number of eligible migrant children and state average per pupil expenditures, and Adult Basic Education bases allocations on the number of individuals age 16 or older who have not completed high school. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and the Federal Work-Study Program both allocate funds to participating institutions of higher education, based on the aggregate \"need\" of their students, as indicated through the need analysis system discussed earlier. Most social services programs allocate funds by formulas, which often include a poverty-related allocation factor. Components of the CCDF are distributed through several formulas, which use such factors as a state's relative share of children under age 5, children who receive free or reduced-price school meals (a proxy for low-income children), and children under age 13, as well as state per capita income and historic funding patterns. Head Start allocates funds among states (from which awards are made to local grantees) according to several factors, including poor children under age 5. The Legal Services Corporation allocates funds according to each state's poverty population. As with a number of the education programs discussed above, some social services programs use allocation factors tied to their target population but not explicitly to their income. The Older Americans Act allocates funds for supportive services and senior centers according to each state's relative share of population aged 60-plus, and for the family caregiver program according to population aged 70-plus. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program bases allocations on each state's number of foster children; the Emergency Food and Shelter Program allocates funds to local jurisdictions based on their number of unemployed persons; and SSBG allocates funds according to total state population. CSBG allocates funds based on historic funding patterns; the total amount received in 1981 by local antipoverty agencies in each state, under a now-defunct provision of the Economic Opportunity Act, determines the state's allotment of CSBG funds\u00a0today. Weatherization funds go to states based on a combination of factors, including low-income population, climate conditions, and residential energy expenditures by low-income households. LIHEAP uses a particularly complex formula, which, among other things, includes total residential energy consumption, temperature variation, and low-income heating and cooling\u00a0consumption. Finally, among employment and training programs, Community Service Employment for Older Americans gives states an amount based on historic funding, and then allocates funds according to state shares of the nation's population age 55-plus and state per capita income. WIA funds go to states based on their shares of \"substantial\" unemployment (unemployment rate of at least 6.5%), \"excess\" unemployment (rate above 4.5%), and the \"disadvantaged\" population (disadvantaged adults for the WIA adult activities program, and disadvantaged youth for the youth program). Funding for employability services for refugees (referred to as \"social services and targeted assistance\") are allocated according to the number of refugees, asylees, and other humanitarian cases that entered a state during the previous 36 months. Under certain programs, the federal government pays a larger share of total costs depending on the income level or concentration of poverty in the state or community to be served. This increased federal share can happen through use of a federal matching rate that is tied to income or another measure of need, or through special provisions that raise the matching rate or federal share under specified circumstances. Relatively few programs use need-related cost-sharing mechanisms; however, these programs include Medicaid which, as noted previously, is the single largest program included in this report. As discussed earlier, Medicaid is a federal-state partnership, in which the federal government and states share the costs of providing health care services to eligible beneficiaries, with no predetermined cap on federal spending. The federal government's share of expenditures for most Medicaid services is called the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). Generally determined annually, the FMAP varies by state and is inversely related to state per capita income, so the federal government pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in lower-income states and a smaller portion in higher-income states. For expenditures in FY2009 (and extended through June 2011 by subsequent legislation), ARRA (the economic stimulus legislation) authorized increased FMAPs for states. Most Medicaid administrative expenditures are matched at a uniform 50% rate.  The CHIP program uses an enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) to determine the federal share of program funding, which is more generous than the regular FMAPs used under Medicaid. CHIP is a capped entitlement program and, as discussed earlier, allotments to states are based on past and projected spending, among other factors. Because CHIP is a federal-state matching program, states must spend a portion of their own money, determined through use of the E-FMAP, to receive their full formula-determined allocation of federal funds. In the social services category, the Medicaid FMAP is used to calculate the federal matching rate for certain child care funds under the CCDF, and for expenditures on maintenance payments and adoption assistance payments in the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs. The rural Water and Waste Disposal program varies the amount of federal support provided by the income level of the community served. The lowest interest rates are provided to projects in communities where median household income is no higher than 80% of state nonurban median income or the poverty guidelines. In addition, federal resources may cover up to 75% of costs in such communities, but no more than 45% of costs in communities where income is higher. Under the Public Works and Economic Development program, the usual 50% federal share of program costs may be increased up to 80%, depending on the relative needs of the area where a project is located, and may reach 100% for grantees that have exhausted their borrowing and/or taxing capacity. In the education category, the 21 st Century Community Learning Center program allows states to require local grantees to match federal funds; however, the match is adjusted based on the relative poverty of the grantee's target population. The developmental disabilities program requires a nonfederal match of 25%, which may be reduced to as low as 10% for projects conducted in poverty areas. As discussed previously, many programs for low-income people require individual participants or beneficiaries to meet a need-related eligibility test. Some programs also (or instead) require the geographic area or participating entity to meet an income or need-related test, which is the third general concept used to target federal resources toward low-income populations. Under this approach, funding is not necessarily distributed nationwide, but only to areas or entities meeting specified criteria. The approach is not used widely, but the following provides examples. Consolidated Health Centers assist people who are \"medically underserved,\" defined to mean they live in an area designated by the federal government as having a shortage of personal health services. In designating such an area, economic factors such as the area's poverty population may be considered.  Although TANF block grants go to all states, TANF contingency funds are available only to states that meet a test of \"economic need,\" based on either unemployment rates or food stamp (SNAP) caseloads. TANF supplemental grants go to states that meet criteria related to high population growth and/or low historic spending for welfare.  A few housing and development programs limit eligibility to communities or areas based on need. For example, Water and Waste Disposal grants and loans only go to communities that are unable to finance their projects through other means. To receive funding under the Public Works and Economic Development program, projects must be located in areas with either low per capita income (at or below 80% of the national average), high unemployment (above the national average for the most recent 24 months), or a special need arising from severe unemployment or changes in economic conditions.  Education programs that target resources in this way include Institutional Aid for higher education; eligible institutions must have high proportions of students receiving need-based assistance or Pell Grants, or be minority-serving institutions. Funding goes to states by formula under the 21 st Century Community Learning Center program but must be used to serve children attending high-poverty schools. Similarly, certain formula grants to states under the Rural Education Achievement Program must go to local educational agencies where at least 20% of children are poor. To be eligible for GEAR-UP grants, partnerships must include a low-income middle school.  Finally, in the social services category, eligible jurisdictions in the Emergency Food and Shelter Grant program are chosen by measures of population, unemployment, and poverty. As discussed in the previous section, federal benefits and services are frequently structured as nationwide grant programs, in which federal funds are provided to specified jurisdictions according to some type of formula; government agencies or other entities within these jurisdictions deliver the benefits and services to eligible individuals. Some programs are structured as competitive or discretionary grants, leaving decisions about specific grantees and award amounts to the federal administering agency, within parameters set forth in law. Certain federal benefits are provided to eligible individuals directly.  This section looks at the three primary forms of federal assistance for low-income people\u2014formula-based grants, competitive or discretionary awards, and direct benefits\u2014and the immediate recipients of these funds (see Table B -3 in Appendix B ). It also discusses matching and related requirements for state or local spending, and briefly examines policies affecting participation of Indian tribes and U.S. territories. Most programs for low-income people allocate funds nationwide, dividing federal resources among jurisdictions according to a formula based on specified factors (e.g., number of children with family income below the poverty guidelines). Formula-based grants also include those that use cost-sharing formulas to determine the amount of federal funds a jurisdiction will receive (such as the Medicaid FMAP, described above, which determines the amount of state expenditures that the federal government will reimburse). Formulas are most often used to determine funding levels for states (as opposed to localities), and state governments or specified state agencies are typically the recipients of the funds. However, some programs distribute funds by formula at the local level. Moreover, programs that award formula funds to states sometimes require the states to pass through a portion (or all) of the funding to local entities, either using a substate formula specified in law or at the state's discretion. And, some programs award funds directly to local agencies, but use a state-level formula to determine the aggregate amount that grantees in the state may receive.  In the health care category, Medicaid makes payments to states based on their eligible expenditures and the applicable federal matching rate. CHIP, the Maternal and Child Health block grant, and Transitional Cash and Medical Services for refugees all use formulas to allocate and award funds to states. The Ryan White program for low-income people with HIV or AIDS allocates and awards funds by formula both to states and to eligible localities. Cash aid is the only major category that does not rely significantly on formula grants. TANF operates as a formula grant to states, but all other cash programs award benefits directly to eligible individuals. Most food assistance programs operate as formula grants to states (usually state educational agencies for child nutrition programs), which then distribute resources to participating schools, institutions, or other local sponsors. SNAP is something of a hybrid; although SNAP benefits go directly to eligible individuals, states administer the program and the federal government reimburses states for part of their administrative costs, using a cost-sharing formula of 50% federal and 50% state. Housing and development formula grants typically allocate and award funds at the substate level, with a few exceptions. For example, the Water and Waste Disposal program allocates funds among the Department of Agriculture's state rural development offices using state-level formula factors, but makes loans and grants directly to local governments and organizations. Both of the temporary ARRA-created programs related to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit made formula grants at the state level, awarding funds to state housing credit agencies. Among other housing and development formula grants, however, Community Development Block Grants go to substate \"entitlement communities\" and to states only on behalf of non-entitlement communities. Emergency Shelter Grants (one of HUD's homeless assistance programs), HOME, HOPWA, and the temporary NSP-1 all allocate and award federal funds to a combination of metropolitan cities and urban counties and to states on behalf of non-metropolitan areas. Funding for Public Housing and Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers is allocated and awarded to local public housing authorities, while Indian Housing Block Grants go to Indian tribes. Education programs under ESEA are a combination of formula grants to state and local educational agencies (SEAs and LEAs). Adult Basic Education and Education for Homeless Children and Youth are non-ESEA programs that operate as formula grants to states, which in turn award funds to local projects or LEAs. Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants and the Federal Work-Study program allocate and award funds by formula directly to institutions of higher education. Almost all social services programs are structured as formula grants to states. An exception is the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, which allocates funding among eligible local jurisdictions and makes grants to local boards in those jurisdictions. In addition, both Head Start and the Legal Services Corporation use state-level data to allocate funds among states, but grants are awarded from those allocations directly to local programs. CSBG requires states to pass through most of their allotments to local \"eligible entities\" and Older Americans Act grants are suballocated to local area agencies on aging.  Weatherization and LIHEAP grants are allocated and awarded to states, which in turn use a network of local agencies and organizations to operate their programs. Among employment and training programs, WIA allocates federal funds among states by formula, but the majority of these funds are awarded directly to local workforce investment boards, with a portion given to the states. The Community Service Employment Program under the Older Americans Act allocates and awards funding by formula both to states and national organizations.  Federal programs are sometimes structured as competitive or discretionary grants, in which federal agencies select specific grantees and determine amounts to be awarded. Authorizing laws provide criteria or parameters for federal agencies to follow in making such decisions, but these criteria can range from very specific to relatively broad. Grantees may be selected through an annual competition or for multi-year periods with a presumption of renewal. Competitive awards are less common than formula grants among federal benefits and services for limited-income populations. No cash, food, or energy assistance programs are structured this way; however, a number of such programs exist in other categories. In health care, Family Planning and Consolidated Health Centers are both competitive grants to eligible public and nonprofit agencies. Under the Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection program, states compete for grants and in turn, enter into grants or contracts with public and private nonprofits. The Ryan White program, in addition to its formula grants described earlier, makes competitive awards to specified health care providers. Under the Public Works and Economic Development program, a variety of entities are eligible to compete for grants, including designated economic development districts, states, local governments, institutions of higher education, and public and private nonprofit organizations. With the exception of the formula-driven Emergency Shelter Grants program described above, Homeless Assistance Grants award funds on a competitive basis; states, local governments, public housing authorities, private nonprofits, and (for certain grants) community mental health centers may apply. HOPWA includes a competitive grant component in addition to its formula grants, with states, local governments and nonprofit organizations eligible to apply. The HOPE VI component of Public Housing also operates as a competitive grant, open to public housing authorities. The federal government directly administers a few discretionary education programs, including Institutional Aid for colleges and universities; the TRIO programs, which are open to institutions of higher education and other public and private organizations; and GEAR-UP, which is open to states and partnerships that include an institution of higher education and a low-income middle\u00a0school.  While TANF is primarily a formula grant program, it includes certain grants designated for social services to promote healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood. These grants are awarded by the federal government directly to public and private nonprofit agencies through a competitive process. As described earlier, both Head Start and the Legal Services Corporation are social services programs that allocate funds among states by formula, but award funds directly to local grantees. These grantees are selected on a competitive basis, but grantees retain their designations for several years at a time.  Among employment and training programs, public and nonprofit organizations may apply for sponsorship of the Foster Grandparents program, and the federal government enters into contracts for operation of Job Corps centers with selected federal, state and local agencies, area vocational schools, residential vocational schools, and other public and private organizations. A relatively small number of programs make benefits available directly to eligible individuals, or through a nongovernmental intermediary organization or entity. These programs, however, include six of the 10 largest programs in this report. Among health programs, both the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Indian Health Service (IHS) provide free medical care directly to eligible needy veterans and American Indians and Alaskan Natives, respectively, at VA and IHS facilities. The Part D Medicare program subsidizes the costs of prescription drug insurance directly through contracts with participating drug plans.  Other than TANF, all cash aid is provided directly to beneficiaries. The Social Security Administration makes payments to eligible elderly and disabled individuals under SSI (although medical determinations of disability are made by state agencies). The Internal Revenue Service administers the EITC and ACTC, issuing refund checks directly to eligible workers. The VA makes direct payments to recipients of pensions for needy veterans. As noted earlier, SNAP is a hybrid of direct benefits and formula grants to states. States play a key role in SNAP\u2014determining eligibility and benefit levels and administering a related employment and training program\u2014but assistance to purchase food is provided directly to beneficiaries, typically through electronic benefit transfer. A few housing and development programs provide benefits directly. For example, the Department of Agriculture either makes or guarantees single-family rural housing loans, and makes direct payments to property owners who participate in the Rural Rental Assistance Payments program. Likewise, HUD makes payments directly to property owners under the Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance Program; these subsidies enable owners to rent units to low-income families at affordable rates. Among education programs, Pell Grants and Academic Competitiveness and Smart Grants are paid to participating institutions on behalf of eligible students; the schools receive an administrative allowance for the cost of determining students' eligibility and benefit levels. This report does not attempt to quantify nonfederal spending related to federal programs for limited-income populations. However, a significant amount of such spending occurs. For example, as already explained, Medicaid is a federal-state matching program in which states spend considerable amounts of their own money. Specifically, in calendar year (CY) 2009, national health expenditures under Medicaid totaled $385 billion, of which $254 billion were federal and $131 billion were state or local. In CY2008, national expenditures under Medicaid totaled $354 billion, of which $209 billion were federal and $145 billion were state or local. The decrease in state and local expenditures from CY2008 to CY2009 is likely a function of the increased federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) in effect for FY2009, as authorized by ARRA ( P.L. 111-5 ). Many low-income programs have provisions that require states or other grantees to match federal funds with a specified amount of nonfederal resources (\"matching\" requirements), or require grantees to maintain the same level of their own spending that occurred in a previous year (\"maintenance-of-effort\" provisions), or prohibit grantees from substituting federal funds for nonfederal funds that would have been available otherwise (\"supplement and not supplant\" requirements). Matching grants are generally designed in one of two ways. Under certain programs (e.g., Medicaid), the federal government reimburses grantees for a portion of their eligible expenditures, generally based on a cost-sharing formula. Additional examples are CHIP, Child Support Enforcement, Foster Care, and Adoption Assistance.  More typically, matching programs require grantees to demonstrate that they can provide nonfederal resources equal to a percentage of the federal grant, but the federal government is not necessarily reimbursing grantees for expenditures already incurred. Some federal programs require the nonfederal share to be in cash, but many also allow in-kind contributions (e.g., the value of donated real estate or other property, the services of volunteers). Programs with nonfederal matching requirements include the Ryan White program for people with HIV/AIDS, Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection, and the Maternal and Child Health block grant; Older Americans Act nutrition and social services programs; the Public Works and Economic Development program, certain Homeless Assistance Grants, and HOME; Adult Basic Education, Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants, and GEAR-UP; Head Start, State Councils on Developmental Disabilities, the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program; Community Service Employment for Older Americans, and Foster Grandparents. As noted above, some programs use maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirements to ensure a minimum level of nonfederal spending. A key example is TANF, which requires states to spend annually at least 75% of the amount they had spent under the predecessor AFDC program in FY1994 (or 80% if they fail to meet certain work participation requirements). Other programs with MOE provisions include School Lunch, The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), Title I-A of ESEA, and CCDF. Education programs in particular use the \"supplement and not supplant\" concept, which provides that grantees may not use federal funds to replace nonfederal (or in some cases, other federal) funds that would otherwise have been used for the same purpose. Programs with such provisions include Title I-A of ESEA, the Rural Education Achievement Program, Math and Science Partnerships, Improving Teacher Quality State Grants, and Institutional Aid for higher education. Several programs specifically for Indian populations are included in this report, namely the Indian Health Service, Indian Housing Block Grants, Indian Education, and Indian Human Services. However, tribes and tribal organizations are eligible to participate in additional programs, either by applying for competitive or discretionary awards, or through funding specifically set-aside for them. Moreover, individuals who are American Indians or Native Americans likely participate in many programs for limited-income populations, not because of their heritage or tribal affiliation but because they otherwise meet a program's eligibility rules. Examples of programs for which tribes and tribal organizations or other Indian entities are explicitly eligible to participate include the Ryan White program and Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection; WIC and TEFAP; Water and Waste Disposal grants and loans, Public Works and Economic Development, Homeless Assistance Grants, and HOME; Institutional Aid for colleges and universities; the Community Service Employment Program for Older Americans, Foster Grandparents and Job Corps. In addition, tribes may apply to the federal government to participate directly (rather through states) under several block grant programs, including TANF, CSBG, Weatherization Assistance, and LIHEAP. Several education programs reserve funds specifically for transfer to the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) for schools overseen by BIE. These programs include Title I-A of ESEA, Education for Homeless Children and Youth, 21 st Century Community Learning Centers, Reading First, a component of the Rural Education Achievement Program, and Improving Teacher Quality State Grants. In the social services category, funds are set-aside for Indian tribes under CCDF and for Indian Head Start programs.  The authorizing laws for certain programs establish a separate Indian component that is funded and administered independently of the primary program. These include SNAP (the law authorizes a separate Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations), the Older Americans Act (Title VI authorizes separate nutrition and social services programs for Native Americans), and Community\u00a0Development Block Grants (the law authorizes a separate Indian Community Development grant). United States territories or their residents are eligible to participate in the majority of federal programs that provide benefits and services to people with limited income. The specific territories that are eligible to participate, however, and the rules that apply to their participation vary by program. Territories may or may not actually participate in all programs for which they are eligible. In addition, Title V of P.L. 95-134 authorizes federal agencies to consolidate grants for certain territories, specifically American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (which include Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau).  A detailed discussion of the eligibility of U.S. territories and their rules of participation, by program, is beyond the scope of this report. A few general observations can be made about the treatment of territories in programs included here. About two-thirds of programs included in this report have some provisions for participation by at least one of the territories. Among programs that include the territories, Puerto Rico, along with American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, are most commonly included; however, not every program includes every one of these territories. Some statutes also allow for participation by Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. Puerto Rico is more likely than other territories to be defined as a state, subject to the same rules as the 50 states and the District of Columbia. However, while some formula grants apply the same general policies to Puerto Rico that apply to states, they sometimes use different criteria to determine its funding level. Formula grants often set aside a percentage or specific amount of funds to be made available to specified territories, subject to their meeting program-related criteria, while discretionary or competitive grants often include the territories among the various other entities and organizations that are eligible to apply. This report generally does not discuss the value of benefits and services received under programs targeted toward low-income people. For many of the programs included here, the process of quantifying their value is complex. Moreover, there may be different ways to look at the value of a particular benefit. For example, the value of Medicaid could be considered its \"market value\" (what a family would have to pay in the private insurance market to purchase comparable coverage), or it could be considered the amount of a family's resources that are \"freed up\" as a result of Medicaid coverage and therefore available to purchase other goods and services.  Estimating the value of benefits provided under the range of education, housing, food assistance, and service programs included in this report raises similarly difficult questions. For many programs, benefit computations depend on factors that vary for each individual case. For example, rental assistance is a function of both family income and the fair market rent of a particular housing unit. Pell Grants and certain other higher education benefits are calculated based on a family's available resources and the cost of attendance at the student's particular college or university. In other words, both housing programs and student aid consider the cost of goods and services (i.e., the rent for a particular apartment or the cost at a particular school) as a component in the benefit calculation, in addition to an individual's income and/or assets. Calculating the value of cash and near-cash benefits (such as SNAP) is somewhat more straightforward. However, even with cash and near-cash benefits, the amount an individual or family receives depends on their specific circumstances, and the benefit computation can be complicated. Under certain programs, benefits are larger for larger family sizes, reflecting greater need. Benefits are generally reduced when a family has other sources of cash income, such as earnings or Social Security benefits.  Table 6 shows the maximum benefit, under each program's specific rules, for certain individuals and family types from cash assistance programs, specifically SSI, EITC, ACTC, veterans' pensions, and TANF. It also shows the maximum benefit amounts under the \"near-cash\" SNAP program. Benefit amounts are shown for FY2008 and FY2009 (the years covered by this report) and, for comparison, FY2011. The table shows either maximum monthly benefits or maximum annual benefits, depending on the program, with annual benefits also shown as per month equivalents, to allow comparison. Benefits are shown for different family sizes; however, for the ACTC, the maximum benefit shown is per child . There is no limit on the number of eligible children for whom the credit may be claimed in an individual family. For TANF, the benefit levels shown are for families and households with no other source of family income, who also are in compliance with behavioral rules (notably, work requirements).  SSI, EITC, veterans' pensions, and SNAP are generally adjusted each year for price inflation. However, SNAP benefits were raised by ARRA, which effectively suspended benefit adjustments in 2010 and 2011. SSI and veterans' benefit adjustments are tied to Social Security cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs); there were no such COLAs for 2010 and 2011 because of the low rate of price inflation accompanying the economic downturn that began in 2007. EITC benefits are also adjusted for price changes through indexing to the Consumer Price Index; ACTC benefits are not\u00a0indexed. SSI, EITC, ACTC, veterans' pensions, and SNAP benefits are determined in federal law. It should be noted that states can also supplement SSI benefits with their own funds and many states also have their own EITCs that can increase benefits for families above the amounts shown in the\u00a0table.  TANF benefits are set by the states, and vary greatly from one state to another. States typically do not make regular adjustments for price inflation. Rather, states make ad-hoc adjustments to TANF cash benefits. The table shows maximum TANF cash benefits for states with the highest benefits (Alaska) and with the lowest benefits (Tennessee for family size of two, Mississippi for family size of three). Benefit levels remained the same for cash assistance recipients in these states in 2008 and 2009. However, some states did increase benefit amounts, as illustrated by the slight increase in the median state maximum benefit for both a family of two and a family of three. Federal programs providing benefits and services to low-income people are extremely diverse and are rarely looked at collectively. These programs and their underlying policies evolved over many decades; they were created to achieve different policy goals in response to different perceived policy problems. Their common feature is an explicit focus on low-income populations. This report provides a snapshot of policies and spending in FY2008 and FY2009 on specified categories of benefits and services for low-income people. It looks at the broad purposes of these programs and then focuses primarily on concepts used to determine eligibility for individual participants and to distribute federal resources according to need. The report also briefly examines the units of government or other entities that receive and administer these federal funds. Numerous additional questions can be raised about this collection of benefits and services targeted toward low-income people. For example, the report does not address programs' effectiveness in meeting their policy goals, either individually or by category. A comprehensive review of program evaluations is beyond the scope of this report; moreover, a consistent body of evaluation literature on all programs for low-income populations is not available. Likewise, the report generally does not attempt to quantify the benefits provided under these programs, for reasons stated in the previous section.  Many programs included in this report rely on the federal poverty guidelines for determining income eligibility, or population statistics based on federal poverty thresholds to allocate funds. In addition to issues raised by use of different multiples of the poverty guidelines by different programs, the guidelines themselves\u2014and the thresholds on which they are based\u2014are the subject of considerable controversy.  Despite different eligibility rules, using various concepts in addition to the federal poverty guidelines, many federal programs for low-income people have overlapping target populations. However, these programs were not necessarily designed intentionally to be consistent with or complementary to one another. Thus, questions can be raised\u2014about potential duplication, the ease with which people can understand and access benefits or services, whether gaps exist among programs in terms of eligibility and available benefits, and the efficiency of service delivery mechanisms. The variety of targeting provisions raises questions about equity and whether \"need\" is addressed uniformly across the country. As for the level of participation in federal low-income programs, the fact sheets in Appendix C provide very limited data, primarily to give a sense of scope for each program. However, many questions can be asked about participation in these programs, both individually and collectively. For example, what percent of eligible beneficiaries are served or participate in each program? Assuming most programs do not serve everyone eligible, what are the characteristics of those who actually participate? Are programs targeting the lowest-income individuals, or do other criteria determine who gets served? For programs with overlapping target populations, to what extent are people served under multiple programs? Administrative data for some programs provide information about the number and characteristics of participants, but these data are inconsistent across programs, and cannot be used in combination to get a picture of multiple program participation. The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), administered by the Census Bureau, provides some insight. The most recent SIPP data, for the third quarter of 2008, indicate that about 28.4 million households\u201424% of total households in the United States\u2014received cash or noncash benefits under one or more means-tested program in an average month. Most often, these programs were Medicaid, free and reduced-price school meals, or SNAP; other programs included housing assistance, SSI, TANF, WIC, LIHEAP, and veterans' pensions. Notably, however, the SIPP data do not identify the extent to which households receive benefits under the EITC or ACTC, although these cash assistance programs are among the 10 largest federal benefits for low-income people.  Returning to the discussion of benefits and services by category, Figure 1 clearly demonstrates that certain categories\u2014most notably health\u2014have grown larger than others. The relative size of the programs, the budgetary classification of their spending (e.g., discretionary or mandatory, open-ended or capped), and the diversity of design elements have implications for the ability of lawmakers to enact new policies, change existing policies, or adjust spending priorities in a time of fiscal constraint. Finally, the report notes that many programs for low-income people operate through formula grants, typically to states. Many of these programs require states, or sometimes other entities within states, to spend a certain amount of nonfederal funds to access their full federal grant. Even in some programs that provide benefits directly to individuals, such as SNAP or SSI, states play a role in determining eligibility or conducting other administrative functions and, in some cases, in supplementing the federal benefits provided. In the current fiscal environment, with many state budgets in critical condition, the ability of states to fully access federal funding and to maintain their level of support for low-income benefits and services is an outstanding question. At the same time, continued federal spending on these benefits and services is at issue, in light of current concerns about the size of federal deficits and long-term debt. Appendix A. Methodology of Report Selection of Programs Programs were selected for inclusion in this report if they (1) have provisions that base an individual's eligibility or priority for service on a measure (or proxy) of low or limited income; or (2) target resources in some way (e.g., through allocation formulas, variable matching rates) using a measure (or proxy) of low or limited income.  A few programs without an explicit low-income provision were included because either their target population is disproportionately poor or their purpose clearly indicates a presumption that participants will be low-income. Such programs that serve disproportionately low-income people include the Indian Health Service, Homeless Assistance Grants, Indian Education, Title I Migrant Education Program, and Indian Human Services. Programs with purposes that presume a low-income target population include Adult Basic Education and Social Services Block Grants. Federal student loan programs were considered for inclusion because they determine benefit levels through the same need analysis system that is used for Pell Grants and several smaller postsecondary education programs. However, this system can result in students from relatively well-off families receiving assistance, as there is no absolute income ceiling on eligibility. Pell Grants are structured in such a way that the majority of recipients are low-income and the lowest-income students receive the largest benefits. Student loan programs are not as strongly targeted and therefore, are not included in the report.  On the other hand, deliberations about whether to include the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) reached a different conclusion. The regular Child Tax Credit (CTC) is a nonrefundable credit and phases out at relatively high income levels. The ACTC is a refundable credit that allows families with no or insufficient tax liability to get all or part of the benefit they would otherwise receive from the CTC. Because of the refundable nature and other design features of the ACTC, including certain recently enacted changes, it serves predominantly low-income families. For example, for tax year 2008, 87% of returns that claimed the ACTC were filed by families with adjusted gross incomes (AGI) below $40,000 and 83% of the credit went to such families; 94% of returns that claimed the ACTC were filed by families with AGI below $50,000 and 93% of the credit went to such families. Thus, ACTC is included in the report. Categorization of Programs Most programs are easily assigned to broad categories, such as health, cash aid, food assistance, or education. A few, however, have multiple purposes or allowable activities. For some of those programs, spending can be disaggregated into the relevant categories. For example, using state reporting of actual expenditures, it is possible to estimate the amount of TANF obligations attributable to cash aid, social services, and employment and training. Other programs cannot be disaggregated, however, and must be assigned to a single category. For example, Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees was categorized as health care, and Indian Human Services was categorized as social services although it also provides cash and housing assistance.  The social services category, in general, is not well-defined and some analysts might assign some programs differently. Head Start, for example, could be considered an education program, since its purpose is to promote school readiness; however, it supports a very broad range of activities\u2014including for children age 0-3 through its Early Head Start component\u2014that can best be characterized collectively as social services. Foster Care and Adoption Assistance both give cash to families or other care providers, but income support is not the programs' purpose or sole use of funding. Foster Care subsidizes maintenance payments and administrative activities on behalf of children who cannot remain safely at home, and Adoption Assistance makes payments to facilitate the adoption of children who would otherwise lack permanent homes. Thus, in this report, these programs were categorized as social services and not cash assistance.  Selection of Spending Measure New obligations incurred in the indicated fiscal year were chosen as the measure of spending for this report, although for many programs, readers may be more accustomed to seeing appropriations (budget authority) or outlays. These spending concepts are related. Congress and the President enact budget authority through appropriations measures or other authorizing laws. Budget authority in turn allows federal agencies to incur obligations , through actions such as entering into contracts, employing personnel, and submitting purchase orders. Outlays represent the actual payment of these obligations, usually in the form of electronic transfers or checks issued by the Treasury Department. Obligations are used in this report because they are the most consistent measure available at the necessary level of detail for the majority of programs. The source of obligations data is the U.S. Budget Appendix for FY2011 (for final FY2009 obligations) and FY2010 (for final FY2008 obligations). Obligations were either not available or not appropriate for a small number of programs. Because obligations were not available at the necessary program level, appropriations were used for the following: Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees, Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection, the Title I Migrant Education Program, Social Services and Targeted Assistance for Refugees, and Foster Grandparents. For veterans' medical care, the Budget Appendix shows obligations for the entire program, and not solely the income-tested component. Thus, for this report, estimated obligations for Priority Group 5 veterans (needy veterans without service-connected disabilities) were calculated from Department of Veterans Affairs data on obligations for Priority Groups 1-6 and 7-8 and number of patients receiving care by individual priority group.  The Budget Appendix also does not show obligations solely for the low-income subsidy portion of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. Therefore, the report uses aggregate reimbursements for the low-income subsidy for the calendar year (instead of fiscal year), available from the annual report of the Medicare trustees. Loan subsidy outlays were used as the more appropriate measure of spending for the Section 502 single-family rural housing loan program. Direct and guaranteed loan subsidy outlays, available from the Budget Appendix, were adjusted for re-estimates provided in the Federal Credit Supplement to the U.S. Budget for the relevant years. Finally, as noted above, TANF obligations provided in the Budget Appendix were disaggregated into the categories of cash aid, social services, and employment and training, based on states' reporting to the Department of Health and Human Services of their actual expenditures.  Spending Threshold Programs are included in this report if they had obligations in either FY2008 or FY2009 of at least $100 million. To simplify the analysis without significantly changing the overall picture, smaller programs were excluded, even if they met the low-income criteria. Only one program included in the report\u2014Education for Homeless Children and Youth\u2014had spending above the threshold in one year but below the threshold in the other. Therefore, spending totals for FY2009 include obligations for this program, but spending totals for FY2008 do not. Thus, each year's spending total is a snapshot of spending in that year for low-income programs which\u2014 in that year \u2014had obligations totaling at least $100 million.  Comparison with Predecessor CRS Report Series From 1979 to 2006, the Congressional Research Service issued a series of reports, typically every other year, called Cash and Noncash Benefits for Persons with Limited Income . The series was conceived and produced (except for the last edition in 2006) by [author name scrubbed], Specialist in Social Policy, who retired from CRS in 2004. The current report is meant to replace the Cash and Noncash series. However, this report uses different methodologies to select and categorize programs and measure spending; therefore, the current report cannot be considered an update of Cash and Noncash for various reasons. For example, the older series did not include certain programs that are included in this report, such as the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D, Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and Community Development Block Grants. At the same time, the older series had no minimum spending threshold, so it included several smaller programs that are not included here. In addition, the older series included student loans, which are not included in this report for reasons explained above. Several programs were also categorized differently in the previous series (e.g., Head Start was categorized as education; Foster Care and Adoption Assistance as cash aid; and Homeless Assistance Grants as social services). The older series used different measures of spending for different programs, while this report uses obligations where possible. The older series also provided estimates of state-local spending, which are not included in this report. Finally, the older series traced spending back to 1968, which is beyond the scope of the current report. Changes in programs and appropriations accounts over time make it virtually impossible to trace obligations backward with precision. Appendix B. Detailed Program Tables  The following three tables identify and provide specific information about programs included in this report. Programs are organized by category. Within categories, programs are listed in order of their Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number (see Appendix C ).  Table B -1 shows obligations (or another measure of spending, as noted) for each program for FY2008 and FY2009. ARRA amounts are included in the FY2009 amounts; they are also shown in a separate column. The table also indicates the federal administering agency for each program.  Table B -2 identifies, for each program, the general target population and the concept (or multiple concepts) used to determine individual income eligibility and (if relevant) the concept used to target federal resources broadly based on need. These concepts are discussed in detail earlier in the report. The table indicates the general concept used but not the specific application of the concept. For example, the table might indicate that federal poverty guidelines (FPG) are used as a concept in determining income eligibility for a particular program, but does not indicate what percent of FPG is used. Likewise, the table might show that a program uses formula allocation factors to direct federal resources toward areas with the greatest need, but does not identify the specific factors or their weighting or any mitigating factors, such as small-state minimums or hold-harmless provisions. Readers are referred to the fact sheets in Appendix C , relevant CRS reports, or the statutes themselves for these details.  Table B -3 shows the type of federal assistance provided (typically formula grants, competitive or discretionary grants, or direct benefits) and the immediate recipients of this assistance. As noted in the table, \"immediate\" recipient refers to the level of government or the organization that directly receives the federal grant or award. As discussed in the body of the report, many programs require that funds be further distributed (by formula or other criteria) to other units of government or organizations. For example, federal grants may be awarded by formula to states, but states are then required to subaward these funds to local governments or other entities. This table only shows the \"immediate\" grantee. The table also indicates whether a program has provisions for participation by U.S. territories or residents or organizations located within the territories. The specific details of these provisions are not provided in the table, however; readers are referred to statutory language or the federal agency that administers the program for this information. Appendix C. Program Fact Sheets The following fact sheets provide brief information about each program included in this report's analysis. Efforts were made to present the information in a relatively consistent manner; however, the programs are sufficiently different that the fact sheets vary in scope and level of detail.  For each program, the following information is provided: Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number(s); statutory and regulatory citations; the name of the federal administering agency and (where appropriate) the specific office within that agency; the program's purpose; the type of benefit or service provided; criteria used to determine individual eligibility; the form and recipient of federal assistance; the allocation formula used if relevant; any matching or related nonfederal spending requirements; the amount of new obligations in FY2008 and FY2009; the budgetary classification of the program's spending; some limited detail on program participation in FY2009 or the most recent year for which data are available; and citations to relevant CRS reports. Information was derived from statutes, regulations, agency websites, or other authoritative sources.  Only selected information is included in these fact sheets, relevant to the overall analysis in this report. Moreover, programs are generally described as they existed in FY2009, although references are provided in cases where significant changes have been enacted affecting years after FY2009. For complete information about a particular program of interest, readers are referred to the legal citations provided, the federal administering agency, or the identified CRS report.  The following table provides a list of programs and page numbers, for easier reference to individual program fact sheets.

CRS report: CRS Report RL33644, Title X (Public Health Service Act) Family Planning Program , by [author name scrubbed]. Consolidated Health Centers (CFDA #93.224) Note: The following describes this program as it operated in FY2009; see CRS report listed below for discussion of changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 ). Authority: Statute: Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, established by the Health Centers Consolidation Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-299 ) and most recently reauthorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 ); 42 USC 254b. Regulations: 42 CFR Subpart 51c and 42 CFR Parts 56.201-56.604. Federal administering agency: Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Bureau of Primary Health Care. Purpose of program: To provide health care services to groups that are determined to be medically underserved. Benefit/service: Primary and additional health care services defined in statute, delivered by community health centers, migrant health centers, health centers for the homeless, and health centers for residents of public housing.  Individual eligibility criteria: The statute defines \"medically underserved\" as \"the population of an urban or rural area designated by the Secretary as an area with a shortage of personal health services or a population group designated by the Secretary as having a shortage of such services.\" Regulations provide that, in designating these populations, the Secretary may consider economic factors, such as the percentage of the population with incomes below poverty. Grant funds may be used to pay the full cost of services to individuals and families with income at or below federal poverty guidelines; services are provided on a sliding fee scale basis for those with incomes between 100% and 200% of federal poverty guidelines and no discount is provided for those with incomes above 200% of poverty. Form and recipient of federal assistance: Competitive grants to public and private nonprofit entities. Allocation formula: Not applicable.  Matching or related requirements: None. Grantees are expected to collect fees from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance; centers may also collect fees from patients with family income above the federal poverty guidelines; and centers may also receive funding from state, local and other federal sources. For grants serving certain populations, federal funds must supplement and not supplant other funds used by the health center to serve the same population.  New obligations: FY2009: $3.665 billion (includes $1.519 billion under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). FY2008: $2.021 billion. Budgetary classification: Discretionary. Participation data: In FY2008, a total of 1.7 million patients were served.

State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (CFDA #93.767) Note: The following describes this program as it operated in FY2009; see CRS reports listed below for discussion of changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 ). Authority: Statute: Title XXI of the Social Security Act, established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ) and most recently reauthorized by the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA, P.L. 111-3 ); 42 USC 1397aa-mm. Regulations: 42 CFR Parts 431, 433, 435. Federal administering agency: Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Purpose of program: To provide health coverage to uninsured, low-income children in an effective and efficient manner that is coordinated with other sources of health benefits coverage for children. Benefit/service: Health care coverage is available through expansion of a state's existing Medicaid program, creation of a separate CHIP program, or a combination of both. In general, for separate CHIP programs under which the majority of children are enrolled, states may offer one of three \"benchmark\" benefit packages: (1) the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider plan offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), (2) the health coverage that is offered and generally available to state employees, and (3) the health coverage that is offered by a health maintenance organization (HMO) with the largest commercial (non-Medicaid) enrollment in the state. (States also have the option of providing \"Secretary-approved\" coverage for which benefits are suitable for the target population.) States that use the Medicaid expansion option can provide the full range of mandatory Medicaid benefits as well as all optional services specified in their state Medicaid plans. Alternatively, under a CHIP Medicaid expansion, states may offer benchmark benefit plans similar to those listed above. States may also waive many of the basic benefit rules described above to conduct demonstration projects under Section 1115 authority that test alternative methods of meeting the overall purpose of CHIP. Medicaid expansion programs must follow the nominal Medicaid cost-sharing rules or, for certain populations, may apply alternative higher premiums and service-related cost-sharing. States with separate CHIP programs may vary cost-sharing requirements by family income, but the total annual aggregate cost-sharing (including premiums, copayments, and similar charges) for a family may not exceed 5% of total income in a year, and certain services such as preventive care are exempt from cost-sharing. Individual eligibility criteria: Target populations are defined by states within federal parameters. Children must be under age 19, lack health insurance, and not be qualified for regular Medicaid. States may set the upper income limit for targeted children at up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines or 50 percentage points above the applicable pre-CHIP (1997) Medicaid income level. States may seek federal approval to serve higher-income children. States also may cover pregnant women who lack health insurance and meet specified income thresholds. Other groups (e.g., parents) may be covered under certain circumstances (e.g., through Section 1115 waivers or CHIP premium assistance payments). Form and recipient of federal assistance: Formula grants to states. Allows participation by territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Allocation formula: The allotment methodology was changed by CHIPRA, beginning with FY2009. Rather than dividing the entire national appropriation among states, the law now calculates allotment amounts for each state, which they will receive unless the national appropriation is inadequate. The new allotment formula is based primarily on states' past and/or projected federal CHIP spending (depending on the year) increased by a growth factor. For FY2009 onward, annual allotments are available for two years, with unspent funds available for redistribution first to shortfall states and then for bonus payments directed at states that exceed certain child enrollment levels and that implement certain outreach and enrollment initiatives. Prior to CHIPRA, funds were allocated among states according to a formula based on a combination of the number of low-income children and low-income uninsured children in the state, and including a cost factor that represented average health service industry wages in the state compared to the national average.  Matching or related requirements: State expenditures are matched at an \"enhanced\" federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP). The E-FMAP for CHIP lowers the state's share of CHIP expenditures by 30% compared to the regular Medicaid FMAP. The CHIP E-FMAP rate is subject to a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%.  New obligations: FY2009: $9.534 billion. FY2008: $6.360 billion. Budgetary classification: Mandatory (capped entitlement to states).

Medicaid (CFDA #93.778) Note: The following describes this program as it operated in FY2009; see CRS reports listed below for discussion of changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 ). Authority: Statute: Title XIX of the Social Security Act, established by the Social Security Amendments of 1965 (P.L. 89-97); 42 USC 1396. Regulations: 42 CFR Parts 430-456. Federal administering agency: Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Purpose of program: To provide medical assistance to families with dependent children and aged, blind or disabled individuals who have insufficient income and resources to afford necessary medical care, and to provide rehabilitation and other services to help such families and individuals achieve independence and self-care. Benefit/service: Federal law requires states to cover certain health benefits under Medicaid; other services may be offered at state option. Examples of mandatory services for most eligibility groups include inpatient hospital services, services provided by qualified federal health centers, laboratory and x-ray services, physician services, pregnancy-related services, nursing facility services for individuals 21 and older, and home health care for those entitled to nursing home care. Examples of optional services provided for most eligibility groups in many states include prescribed drugs, physician-directed clinic services, other licensed practitioners (e.g., optometrists, podiatrists, psychologists), inpatient psychiatric care for the elderly and individuals under age 21, nursing facility services for individuals under age 21, physical therapy, prosthetic devices, and transportation. Individual eligibility criteria: Individuals must meet financial (i.e., income and sometimes resource) and nonfinancial (i.e., categorical) requirements. Federal law defines more than 50 potentially eligible population groups; some groups are mandatory (all states must cover them) and others are optional (states may cover them at their discretion). In some cases, income eligibility standards are tied directly to specified percentages of the federal poverty guidelines. For example, Medicaid mandatory coverage groups include pregnant women and children under age 6 with family incomes at or below 133% of poverty; children ages 6-18 with family incomes at or below 100% of poverty; certain parents and children in working families who are entitled to Medicaid for at least 6 months and up to 12 months if their income does not exceed 185% of poverty (i.e., Transitional Medical Assistance, TMA)); individuals who qualify for Medicare Part A whose incomes do not exceed 100% of poverty (Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs)); and individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A with incomes between 100% and 120% of poverty (Specified Low-Income Beneficiaries (SLMs)). Mandatory groups also include families who qualify via rules applicable to the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program; also, families who lose Medicaid as a result of increased child/spousal support or earned income may receive TMA for four months. Medicaid optional groups with income eligibility standards tied directly to specified percentages of the federal poverty guidelines include pregnant women and infants with incomes between 133% and 185% of poverty; CHIP-financed targeted low-income children; disabled and elderly (age 65+) individuals with incomes up to 100% of poverty; disabled working individuals whose family income does not exceed 250% of poverty; and individuals who would be QMBs except that their incomes are between 120% and 135% of poverty (i.e., Qualifying Individuals (QI-1s)). Form and recipient of federal assistance: Partial reimbursement to states of eligible expenditures, with no cap on federal spending. Allows participation by territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Allocation formula: Payments to states are based on their eligible expenditures and the applicable FMAP (see below). Matching or related requirements: The federal share of expenditures on Medicaid services is called the federal medical assistance payment (FMAP) and is inversely related to a state's per capita income. The FMAP is higher for states with lower per capita income relative to the national average and vice versa for states with higher per capita income. The FMAP ranges from a statutory low of 50% to a statutory high of 83%. Medicaid administrative expenditures are generally matched at a 50% rate, with certain exceptions. For expenditures in FY2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act authorized a temporary increase in FMAPs for states. (Subsequent legislation extended this increase through June 2011.) New obligations: FY2009: $265.058 billion (includes $32.632 billion in estimated additional federal matching provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). FY2008: $214.015 billion. Budgetary classification: Mandatory (open-ended entitlement to states). Participation data: During FY2009, an average of 51.1 million individuals were enrolled in Medicaid each month (including 24.9 million children); and a total of 65.2 million individuals were enrolled during the year (including 31.3 million children).

No fees for services may be charged for women with incomes below 100% of federal poverty guidelines. (Under the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000, P.L. 106-354 , women who are screened through the CDC program are an optional Medicaid coverage group, which means that states may offer them medical services through their Medicaid programs.) Individual eligibility criteria: States must give priority to low-income women. CDC defines the eligible population as uninsured and underinsured women with income at or below 250% of federal poverty guidelines, aged 18-64 for cervical screening and 40-64 for breast screening.

TANF contingency funds are available to states that meet a test of economic \"need\" and increase spending from their own funds above what they spent in FY1994 on cash, emergency assistance, and job training in TANF's predecessor programs. For FY2009 (and FY2010), states could draw down additional funds from the TANF Emergency Contingency Fund, created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which reimbursed states for increased expenditures on basic assistance, nonrecurring short-term benefits, and subsidized employment. Matching or related requirements: None. The basic TANF block grant requires states to maintain spending from their own funds on TANF or TANF-related activities for needy families with children equal to 75% of what was spent from state funds in FY1994 under TANF's predecessor programs. This maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement increases to 80% of FY1994 spending for states that fail to meet TANF work participation requirements. For the TANF contingency fund, a higher state spending requirement applies (100% of the historic level).

Education for the Disadvantaged\u2014Grants to Local Educational Agencies (CFDA #84.010) Authority: Statute: Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (P.L. 89-10), most recently reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act ( P.L. 107-110 ); 20 USC 6301-6339, 6571-6578. Regulations: 34 CFR Part 200. Federal administering agency: Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Student Achievement and School Accountability Programs. Purpose of program: To ensure that all children have a fair, equal and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging state academic achievement standards and state academic assessments. Benefit/service: Additional academic support and learning opportunities for students in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 to help low-achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects. Individual eligibility criteria: Within local educational agencies (LEAs), funds are allocated to school attendance areas and schools in rank order based on their number of children from low-income families. Schools in which at least 40% of children are poor may operate schoolwide programs that serve all children. Otherwise, schools must focus services on children who are failing or most at risk of failing state academic standards. Form and recipient of federal assistance: Formula grants to local educational agencies (LEAs). Allows participation by territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands). Allocation formula: Portions of available annual funds are allocated under four different formulas\u2014Basic, Concentration, Targeted, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG)\u2014although funds are then combined and used for the same purposes by recipient LEAs. Although the allocation formulas have several distinctive elements, the primary factors used in all four formulas are an eligible child count and an expenditure factor. The eligible child count includes children aged 5-17: (a) in poor families; (b) in institutions for neglected or delinquent children or in foster homes; and (c) in families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families payments above the poverty level. Each element of the population factor is updated annually. The expenditure factor is the state average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education (subject to a minimum of 80% and maximum of 120% of the national average, further multiplied by 0.40), and is the same for all LEAs in the same state. Both the Targeted and EFIG formulas include weighting schemes to increase aid to LEAs with the highest numbers or concentrations of eligible children. The EFIG formula also includes an effort factor, based on average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education compared to personal income per capita for each state compared to the nation as a whole, and an equity factor, based on variations in average per pupil expenditures among the LEAs in each state. Each formula has a hold-harmless provision (no LEA may receive less than 85%-95% of its previous year grant, depending on the LEA's poverty level and whether the LEA continues to meet the formula's eligibility threshold). All four formulas have state minimum grant provisions. Matching or related requirements: Three requirements apply to total LEA grants under all four formulas: (1) maintenance of effort : recipient LEAs must provide, from state and local sources, a level of funding (either aggregate or per pupil) in the preceding year that is at least 90% as high as in the second preceding year; (2) funds must supplement and not supplant state and local funds that would otherwise be available for the education of disadvantaged pupils in participating schools; and (3) comparability: services provided with state and local funds in schools participating in Title I-A must be comparable to those in non-Title I-A schools of the same LEA. New obligations: FY2009: $21.495 billion (includes $9.936 billion under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). FY2008: $13.352 billion. Budgetary classification: Discretionary.
