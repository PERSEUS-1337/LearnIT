DECLARATIONS.\n\n    Congress declares as follows:\n            (1) The 26,000,000-acre Northern Forest region is an \n        extraordinary resource. The forests in the region are rich in \n        natural resources and values cherished by residents and \n        visitors: timber, fiber, and wood for forest products and \n        energy supporting successful businesses and providing stable \n        jobs for residents; lakes ponds, rivers, and streams unspoiled \n        by pollution or crowding human development; tracts of land for \n        wildlife habitat and recreational use, and protected areas to \n        help preserve the biological integrity of the region. This Act \n        is enacted to advance the goals of the Northern Forest Lands \n        Council and to reaffirm the Council's vision of the Northern \n        Forest as a landscape of interlocking parts and pieces, \n        reinforcing each other: local communities, industrial forest \n        land, family and individual ownerships, small woodlots, \n        recreation land, and public and private conservation land.\n            (2) This Act effectuates certain recommendations of the \n        Northern Forest Lands Council that were developed with broad \n        public input and the involvement of Federal, State, and local \n        governments. The actions described in this Act to implement \n        those recommendations are most appropriately directed by the \n        Northern Forest States, with assistance from the Federal \n        Government, as requested by the States. Implementation of the \n        recommendations should be guided by the fundamental principles \n        laid out by the Northern Forest Lands Council report. Those \n        principles provide the foundation for the intent of this Act: \n        to support the primary role of the Northern Forest States in \n        the management of their forests, to protect the traditions of \n        the region, to emphasize the rights and responsibilities of the \n        landowners, and to advance new mechanisms for cooperative \n        conservation of the Northern Forest lands and its resources for \n        future generations.\n\nSEC. 3. SUPPORT FOR SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--At the request of the Governor of the State of \nMaine, New Hampshire, New York, or Vermont, the Secretary of \nAgriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, may \nprovide technical assistance for a State-based initiative directed by \nthe State, to define the appropriate benchmarks of sustainable forest \nmanagement that address the principles of sustainability, as \nrecommended by the Northern Forest Lands Council.\n    (b) Principles of Sustainability.--It is the sense of Congress that \nfor the purposes of subsection (a), principles of sustainability should \nbe based on the principles developed by the Northern Forest Lands \nCouncil, including--\n            (1) maintenance of soil productivity;\n            (2) conservation of water quality, wetlands, and riparian \n        zones;\n            (3) maintenance or creation of a healthy balance of forest \n        age classes;\n            (4) continuous flow of timber, pulpwood, and other forest \n        products;\n            (5) improvement of the overall quality of the timber \n        resource as a foundation for more value-added opportunities;\n            (6) addressing scenic quality by limiting adverse aesthetic \n        impacts of forest harvesting, particularly in high-elevation \n        areas and vistas;\n            (7) conservation and enhancement of habitats that support a \n        full range of native flora and fauna;\n            (8) protection of unique or fragile natural areas; and\n            (9) continuation of opportunities for traditional \n        recreation.\n\nSEC. 4.

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING FEDERAL TAX POLICY.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) certain Federal tax policies work against the long-term \n        ownership, management, and conservation of forest land in the \n        Northern Forest region; and\n            (2) Congress and the President should enact additional \n        legislation to address those tax policies as soon as possible.\n\nSEC. 8. LANDOWNER LIABILITY EXEMPTION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) many landowners keep their land open and available for \n        responsible recreation; and\n            (2) private lands help provide important forest-based \n        recreation opportunities for the public in the Northern Forest \n        region.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that States and \nother interested persons should pursue initiatives that--\n            (1) strengthen relief-from-liability laws to protect \n        landowners that allow responsible public recreational use of \n        their lands;\n            (2) update relief-from-liability laws to establish hold-\n        harmless mechanisms for landowners that open their land to \n        public use, including provision for payment by the State of the \n        costs of a landowner's defense against personal injury suits \n        and of the costs of repairing property damage and removing \n        litter;\n            (3) provide additional reductions in property taxes for \n        landowners that allow responsible public recreational use of \n        their lands;\n            (4) provide for purchases by the State of land in fee and \n        of temporary and permanent recreation easements and leases, \n        including rights of access;\n            (5) foster State and private cooperative recreation \n        agreements;\n            (6) create recreation coordinator and landowner liaison and \n        remote ranger positions in State government to assist in the \n        management of public use of private lands and provide \n        recreation opportunities and other similar services;\n            (7) strengthen enforcement of trespass, antilittering, and \n        antidumping laws;\n            (8) improve recreation user education programs; and\n            (9) improve capacity in State park and recreation agencies \n        to measure recreational use (including types, amounts, \n        locations, and concentrations of use) and identify and address \n        trends in use before the trends create problems.\n\nSEC. 9. NONGAME CONSERVATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) private landowners often manage their lands in ways \n        that produce a variety of public benefits, including wildlife \n        habitat; and\n            (2) there should be more incentives for private landowners \n        to exceed current forest management standards and \n        responsibilities under Federal laws.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress \nshould make it a priority to consider legislation that creates a \nfunding mechanism to support the conservation of nongame fish and \nwildlife and associated recreation activities on public and private \nlands and does not replace, substitute, or duplicate existing laws that \nsupport game fish and wildlife.\n\nSEC. 10. WATER QUALITY.\n\n    At the request of the Governor of the State of Maine, New \nHampshire, New York, or Vermont, the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthe Secretary of the Interior, may provide technical and financial \nassistance to assess water quality trends within the Northern Forest \nregion.\n\nSEC. 11.
