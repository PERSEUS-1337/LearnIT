    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, \nand Remedies Act of 1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the manufacture, distribution, and importation of \n        firearms is inherently commercial in nature;\n            (2) firearms regularly move in interstate commerce;\n            (3) firearms trafficking is so prevalent and widespread in \n        and among the States that it is usually impossible to \n        distinguish between intrastate trafficking and interstate \n        trafficking;\n            (4) to the extent firearms trafficking is intrastate in \n        nature, it arises out of and is substantially connected with a \n        commercial transaction, which, when viewed in the aggregate, \n        substantially affects interstate commerce;\n            (5) gun violence results in great costs to society, \n        including the costs of law enforcement, medical care, lost \n        productivity, and loss of life;\n            (6) to the extent possible, the costs of gun violence \n        should be borne by those liable for them, including \n        manufacturers, dealers, and importers;\n            (7) in any action to recover the costs associated with gun \n        violence to a particular entity or to a given community, it is \n        usually impossible to trace the portion of costs attributable \n        to intrastate versus interstate commerce;\n            (8) the law governing the liability of manufacturers, \n        dealers, and importers for gun violence is evolving \n        inconsistently within and among the States, resulting in a \n        contradictory and uncertain regime that is inequitable and that \n        unduly burdens interstate commerce;\n            (9) the inability to obtain adequate compensation for the \n        costs of gun violence results in a serious commercial \n        distortion to a single national market and a stable national \n        economy, thereby creating a barrier to interstate commerce;\n            (10) it is an essential and appropriate role of the Federal \n        Government, under the Constitution of the United States, to \n        remove burdens and barriers to interstate commerce;\n            (11) because the intrastate and interstate trafficking of \n        firearms are so commingled, full regulation of interstate \n        commerce requires the incidental regulation of intrastate \n        commerce; and\n            (12) it is in the national interest and within the role of \n        the Federal Government to ensure that manufacturers, dealers, \n        and importers can be held liable under Federal law for gun \n        violence.\n    (b) Purpose.--Based on the power of Congress in clause 3 of section \n8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States, the purpose of \nthis Act is to regulate interstate commerce by--\n            (1) regulating the commercial activity of firearms \n        trafficking;\n            (2) protecting States, units of local government, \n        organizations, businesses, and other persons from the adverse \n        effects of interstate commerce in firearms;\n            (3) establishing a uniform legal principle that \n        manufacturers, dealers, and importers can be held liable for \n        gun violence; and\n            (4) creating greater fairness, rationality, and \n        predictability in the civil justice system.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Gun violence.--The term ``gun violence'' means any--\n                    (A) actual or threatened unlawful use of a firearm; \n                and\n                    (B) unintentional discharge of a firearm.\n            (2) Incorporated definitions.--The terms ``firearm'', \n        ``importer'', ``manufacturer'', and ``dealer'' have the \n        meanings given those terms in section 921 of title 18, United \n        States Code.\n            (3) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n        States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n        Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American \n        Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n            (4) Unit of local government.--The term ``unit of local \n        government'' means any city, town, township, county, parish, \n        village, or other general purpose political subdivision of a \n        State.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, \nState, or local law, a State, unit of local government, organization, \nbusiness, or other person that has been injured by or incurred costs as \na result of gun violence may bring a civil action in a Federal or State \ncourt of original jurisdiction against a manufacturer, dealer, or \nimporter who knew or reasonably should have known that its design, \nmanufacturing, marketing, importation, sales, or distribution practices \nwould likely result in gun violence.\n    (b) Remedies.--In an action under subsection (a), the court may \naward appropriate relief, including--\n            (1) actual damages;\n            (2) punitive damages;\n            (3) reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation costs \n        reasonably incurred, including the costs of expert witnesses; \n        and\n            (4) such other relief as the court determines to be \n        appropriate."
