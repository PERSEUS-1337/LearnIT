According to the Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention:\n                    (A) In 2002, diabetes contributed to 224,092 \n                deaths.\n                    (B) Diabetes is likely to be seriously \n                underreported as studies have found that only 35 \n                percent to 40 percent of decedents with diabetes had it \n                listed anywhere on the death certificate and only about \n                10 percent to 15 percent had it listed as the \n                underlying cause of death.\n            (5) Diabetes complications carry staggering economic and \n        human costs for our country and health system:\n                    (A) Diabetes contributes to over 224,000 deaths a \n                year.\n                    (B) The risk for stroke is 2 to 4 times higher \n                among people with diabetes.\n                    (C) Diabetes is the leading cause of new blindness \n                in America, causing approximately 18,000 new cases of \n                blindness each year.\n                    (D) Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure \n                in America, accounting for 44 percent of new cases in \n                2002.\n                    (E) In 2002, 44,400 Americans with diabetes began \n                treatment for end-stage kidney disease and a total of \n                153,730 were living on chronic dialysis or with a \n                kidney transplant as a result of their diabetes.\n                    (F) In 2002, approximately 82,000 amputations were \n                performed on Americans with diabetes.\n                    (G) Poorly controlled diabetes before conception \n                and during the first trimester of pregnancy can cause \n                major birth defects in 5 percent to 10 percent of \n                pregnancies and spontaneous abortions in 15 percent to \n                20 percent of pregnancies.\n            (6) Diabetes is unique because many of its complications \n        and tremendous costs are largely preventable through early \n        detection, better education on diabetes self-management, and \n        improved delivery of available medical treatment:\n                    (A) According to the Agency for Healthcare Research \n                and Quality, appropriate primary care for diabetes \n                complications could have saved the Medicare and \n                Medicaid programs $2,500,000,000 in hospital costs in \n                2001 alone.\n                    (B) According to the Diabetes Prevention Project \n                sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, \n                lifestyle interventions such as diet and moderate \n                physical activity for those with prediabetes reduced \n                the development of diabetes by 58 percent; among \n                Americans aged 60 and over, lifestyle interventions \n                reduced diabetes by 71 percent.\n                    (C) Research shows detecting and treating diabetic \n                eye disease can reduce the development of severe vision \n                loss by 50 percent to 60 percent.\n                    (D) Research shows comprehensive foot care programs \n                can reduce amputation rates by 45 percent to 85 \n                percent.\n                    (E) Detecting and treating early diabetic kidney \n                disease by lowering blood pressure can reduce the \n                decline in kidney function by 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 2.
