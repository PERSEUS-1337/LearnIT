    "title": "To amend title 31, United States Code, to save the American taxpayers money by immediately altering the metallic composition of the 1-cent coin, to require a prompt review and report, with recommendations, for cost-saving changes in the metallic content of other circulating United States coins, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be known as the ``Cents and Sensibility Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Mint, in its 2001 annual report, \n        announced that it was studying alternative metals for use in \n        circulating coins, but has never released the study publicly or \n        delivered it to Congress.\n            (2) In May, 2006, the United States Mint delivered \n        communications to the Congress indicating that the cost to \n        produce circulating coins had increased dramatically owing to \n        worldwide demand for commodity metals, to the point where--\n                    (A) the price to produce 1-cent and 5-cent coins \n                had or soon would surpass the face value of such coins; \n                and\n                    (B) the cost to produce the 10-cent and quarter-\n                dollar coins, while not exceeding their face value, had \n                increased dramatically.\n            (3) Such cost increases alone, while minimal per individual \n        coins, taken together could increase the cost to taxpayers \n        $1,000,000,000 or more over a decade.\n            (4) In spite of having communicated the information \n        concerning this costly dilemma, neither the Secretary of the \n        Treasury or the Director of the United States Mint has made any \n        recommendation for changing the metallic content of circulating \n        coins in order to reduce the cost to produce such coins and \n        thus control the effect on the general fund of the Treasury.\n            (5) Other countries, recognizing the effect of the increase \n        in commodity metal prices on the cost of producing circulating \n        coins, have adjusted the metal content of some or all of their \n        circulating coins in the period in which there has been no \n        change in the metal content of United States circulating coins.\n            (6) Canada has for several years produced a cent coin \n        similar in size and weight to the United States 1-cent coin \n        that is made of steel with a thin coating of copper, leading to \n        a unit cost to produce such coins considerably less than that \n        of the U.S. cent coin, and uses similar production techniques \n        to control the costs of all of its circulating coins.\n            (7) In 1943, owing to demands for copper due to the \n        prosecution of World War II, the Mint produced the so-called \n        ``steel pennies'' which were zinc-coated steel blanks.\n            (8) In view of the prior experience of the United States \n        Mint in producing the ``steel pennies'', there is no reason not \n        to change the metal content of the cent coin immediately, and \n        simply dropping the unit production cost of a 1-cent coin below \n        its face value would save the Treasury nearly $1,000,000,000 \n        over the next decade at current production levels.\n            (9) Any changes to the metallic content of the 5-cent, 10-\n        cent and quarter-dollar coins should be made simultaneously, to \n        minimize the cost of adjustments that would need to be made to \n        coin-accepting, coin-counting, and other coin-handling \n        equipment and thus control costs to consumers.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCING THE COST TO TAXPAYERS OF PRODUCING THE PENNY.\n\n    (a) Steel Pennies Required.--Subsection (c) of section 5112 of \ntitle 31, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(c) 1-Cent Coin.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The 1-cent coin shall--\n                    ``(A) be produced primarily of steel; and\n                    ``(B) meet such other specifications as the \n                Secretary may determine to be appropriate, including \n                any change in the weight from that specified in \n                subsection (a)(6).\n            ``(2) Treatment.--The 1-cent coin shall be treated to \n        impart a copper color to the appearance of the coins so that \n        the appearance is similar to 1-cent coins produced of a copper-\n        zinc alloy.\n            ``(3) Exception for lincoln bicentennial numismatic \n        pennies.--No provision of this subsection shall apply with \n        respect to 1-cent coins described in section 304 of the \n        Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 that are issued for numismatic \n        purposes.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \napply to all 1-cent coins issued after the end of the 90-day period \nbeginning on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. REDUCING THE COST TO TAXPAYERS OF PRODUCING OTHER CIRCULATING \n              COINS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE WAY SUCH COINS ARE \n              HANDLED BY BUSINESS, GOVERNMENT, AND CONSUMERS IN THE \n              COURSE OF ORDINARY COMMERCE.\n\n    (a) Report Required.--Before the end of the 60-day period beginning \nat the end of the 90-day period referred to in section 3(b), the \nSecretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Committee on \nFinancial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate describing a unified \nplan developed by the Secretary to change the metallic content of the \n5-cent, 10-cent, quarter-dollar and half-dollar circulating coins \nproduced by the Secretary in such a way as to return the ratios between \nthe unit cost to produce such coins and the face value of such coins to \na point where it is as close as possible to the historic production \ncost to face value ratios achieved in the 1980s.\n    (b) Detailed Recommendations and Model Legislation.--The reports \nrequired under this section shall contain detailed recommendations for \nthe metallic content of each coin in such a form that the \nrecommendations could be enacted into law within 30 days after the \nreceipt of such report and appropriate congressional hearings and the \nproduction of such coins with new metallic content could begin within \n90 days after the date of the enactment of such new specifications, \nshould the Congress so choose.\n    (c) Improved Production Efficiency.--The reports required under \nthis section shall include recommendations for changes in the methods \nof producing coins at the United States Mints that would further reduce \nthe costs to produce circulating coins.\n    (d) Minimizing Potential Conversion Costs.--The reports required \nunder this section shall--\n            (1) include no recommendation for new specifications for \n        producing a circulating coin that would require more than 1 \n        change to coin-accepting and coin-handling equipment to \n        accommodate changes to all circulating coins simultaneously; \n        and\n            (2) to the greatest extent possible, recommend \n        specifications that, while consistent with other portions of \n        this section and the amendments made by this Act, require no \n        changes to coin-accepting or coin-handling equipment whatsoever \n        to accommodate both coins produced with the new specifications \n        and coins produced as of July 31, 2007.\n    (e) Fraud Prevention.--The reports required under this section \nshall make no recommendation for a specification change that would \nfacilitate or allow the use of a coin with a lesser value produced by \nanother country, or the use of any token or other easily or regularly \nproduced metal device of minimal value, in the place of a circulating \ncoin produced by the Secretary.\n    (f) Further Recommendations for the 1-Cent Coin.--Notwithstanding \nthe amendment made by section 3, the reports required by this section \nmay contain any recommendation of the Secretary for any further changes \nto the metallic content of the 1-cent coin, other than the content of \n1-cent coins described in section 304 of the Presidential $1 Coin Act \nof 2005 that are issued for numismatic purposes, that the Secretary \ndetermines is more effective to reduce the unit production costs for \nsuch coins.\n    (g) Annual Review and Update.--At 1-year intervals following the \nsubmission of a report under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit \na report to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs of the Senate reviewing the metallic content of the 1-cent, 5-\ncent, 10-cent, quarter-dollar and half-dollar circulating coins \nproduced by the Secretary. Each such report shall comply with the \nrequirements of this section for reports submitted under subsection \n(a).\n\nSEC. 5. PROCUREMENT OF RESEARCH, TESTING, AND COMMODITIES.\n\n    The Secretary of the Treasury may, to accomplish the goals of this \nAct, and consistent with the Secretary's development of the metallic \ncontent of the currently produced 1-dollar coin and the currently \nproduced 5-cent, 10-cent, quarter-dollar and half-dollar coins, solicit \ninput from within or without the Federal Government, including research \nfacilities or the 2 current suppliers of the raw material for volume \nproduction of circulating coins with such new metallic content, and \nconduct any appropriate testing within or without the Department of the \nTreasury, consistent with all other applicable Federal laws on the \nprocurement, or potential procurement of materials necessary for the \nperformance of the duties of the Secretary."
