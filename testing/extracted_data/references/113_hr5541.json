FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Individuals with disabilities can maintain and improve \n        their health through appropriate physical activity.\n            (2) In the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans \n        (referred to as the ``Guidelines''), the Department of Health \n        and Human Services recommends that individuals with \n        disabilities, who are able, participate in regular aerobic \n        activity.\n            (3) The Guidelines also recommend that adults with \n        disabilities, who are able, do muscle-strengthening activities \n        of moderate or high intensity on 2 or more days a week, as \n        these activities provide additional health benefits.\n            (4) The Guidelines recommend that when adults with \n        disabilities are not able to meet the Guidelines, they should \n        engage in regular physical activity according to their \n        abilities and avoid inactivity.\n            (5) Unfortunately, many individuals with disabilities are \n        unable to engage in the recommended exercise or fitness \n        activities due to the inaccessibility of exercise or fitness \n        equipment.\n            (6) Physical inactivity by adults with disabilities can \n        lead to increased risk for functional limitations and secondary \n        health conditions.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to encourage exercise and fitness service providers to \n        provide accessible exercise and fitness equipment for \n        individuals with disabilities; and\n            (2) to provide guidance about the requirements necessary to \n        ensure that such exercise and fitness equipment is accessible \n        to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities.\n\nSEC. 3.
