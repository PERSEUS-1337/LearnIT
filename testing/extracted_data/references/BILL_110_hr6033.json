FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The ``baby boom'' generation will require health care \n        attention that will exceed the current supply of health care \n        providers.\n            (2) There is a shortage of training programs specializing \n        in health care services that focus on home care instead of \n        institutionalized care.\n            (3) Although the need for home-based health services \n        transcends all income levels, the availability of such services \n        is more limited for residents in public housing.\n            (4) Estimates indicate that there are 44,000,000 caregivers \n        in the United States providing unpaid care to at least one \n        adult, representing 22,900,000 households.\n            (5) Of working persons providing unpaid care, 62 percent \n        have had to make adjustments to work schedules or leave \n        employment.\n            (6) Many low-income families in the United States are \n        placed in an untenable position of choosing between work and \n        caregiving responsibilities at home.\n            (7) Residents in public housing in the United States are \n        also aging and in need of care.\n            (8) The Department of Housing and Urban Development \n        estimates the percentage of households assisted by the \n        Department that are elderly households is 35 percent in New \n        York, 33 percent in Boston, 35 percent in Chicago, 24 percent \n        in Cleveland, 40 percent in Los Angeles, and 20 percent in \n        Puerto Rico.\n            (9) New service programs are needed to provide home-based \n        health services to residents in public housing and to provide \n        job training and job placement for persons receiving assistance \n        from the Department of Housing and Urban Development needing \n        employment.\n            (10) The Department of Housing and Urban Development should \n        establish a home-based health services pilot program to meet \n        the challenges of an increasing number of elderly in public \n        housing, simultaneously creating an opportunity to train job \n        seekers in a trade that provides home-based health services.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to give flexibility to the Department of Housing and \n        Urban Development and other entities to promote training \n        programs and employment in home-based health services for \n        public housing residents; and\n            (2) to provide needed home care options to elderly and \n        disabled public housing residents to allow them to remain in \n        their homes and their communities.\n\nSEC. 3. PILOT GRANT PROGRAM TO PROMOTE HOME-BASED HEALTH SERVICES \n              TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT FOR PUBLIC HOUSING RESIDENTS AND \n              TO PROVIDE MEDICAID COVERED HOME-BASED HEALTH SERVICES TO \n              ELDERLY AND DISABLED PERSONS RECEIVING HUD PUBLIC HOUSING \n              ASSISTANCE.\n\n    Section 34 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. \n1437z-6) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(f) Grant Pilot Program To Promote Training and Employment in \nHome-Based Health Services and To Provide Such Services to Elderly and \nDisabled Public Housing Residents.--\n            ``(1) Establishment of grant pilot program.--The Secretary \n        shall establish a grant pilot program to make grants to \n        eligible entities under paragraph (2) for use only for \n        promoting the training and employment of public housing \n        residents as home health aides and as providers of home-based \n        health services in order for such residents to provide Medicaid \n        covered home-based health services to either elderly or \n        disabled public housing residents, or both.\n            ``(2) Eligible entities.--A grant under this subsection may \n        be made only to an entity that demonstrates--\n                    ``(A) it is a public housing agency, unit of State \n                or local government including an agency of such unit, \n                community health center, home care provider \n                organization, faith-based organization, labor \n                organization, or other organization determined to be \n                qualified by the Secretary;
