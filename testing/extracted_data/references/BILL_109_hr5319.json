FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) sexual predators approach minors on the Internet using \n        chat rooms and social networking websites, and, according to \n        the United States Attorney General, one in five children has \n        been approached sexually on the Internet;\n            (2) sexual predators can use these chat rooms and websites \n        to locate, learn about, befriend, and eventually prey on \n        children by engaging them in sexually explicit conversations, \n        asking for photographs, and attempting to lure children into a \n        face to face meeting; and\n            (3) with the explosive growth of trendy chat rooms and \n        social networking websites, it is becoming more and more \n        difficult to monitor and protect minors from those with devious \n        intentions, particularly when children are away from parental \n        supervision.\n\nSEC. 3.
