SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Building Bridges and Transforming \nResentment and Unfairness to Support and Trust for Municipal Law \nEnforcement Act of 2014'' or the ``Build TRUST Act of 2014''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The growing trend of local units of government using \n        traffic fines and traffic court fees and costs as revenue \n        generators promotes unfair, excessive targeting of citizens by \n        law enforcement agents, infringes on civil liberties, and \n        promotes reliance on unpredictable revenue sources.\n            (2) The growing trend of local units of government using \n        traffic fines and traffic court fees and costs as revenue \n        generators has the potential to breed public cynicism and \n        distrust of local law enforcement agencies, and to lessen \n        public confidence that the laws are being enforced impartially \n        and the criminal justice system is administered equally.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION IN GRANT FUNDING FOR UNITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.\n\n    (a) Collection of Fines for Violations of Traffic Laws.--Except as \nprovided in subsection (b) or section 4, a unit of local government \nwhich, during the previous 3 fiscal years, funded an amount that, on \naverage, was greater than 18 percent of its operating budget using \nrevenue generated from collecting fines and other fees related to \nviolations of traffic laws, shall, in the case of a unit of local \ngovernment receiving grant funds under subpart 1 of part E of title I \nof the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. \n3750 et seq.), receive only 25 percent of the grant award that would \nhave otherwise been awarded to that unit of local government under such \nsubpart.\n    (b) Disproportionate Racial Composition of Law Enforcement \nAgencies.--In the case of a unit of local government described in \nsubsection (a) for which, during the previous fiscal year, the \npercentage of individuals who identify as a race who were employees of \nthe law enforcement agency for that unit of local government, and the \npercentage of individuals who identify as that race who live in the \njurisdiction which that law enforcement agency serves, differs by \ngreater than 30 percent, the unit of local government shall receive \nonly 5 percent of the grant award that would have otherwise been \nawarded to that unit of local government under subpart 1 of part E of \ntitle I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 \nU.S.C. 3750 et seq.).\n    (c) Obligation of States.--A State that receives a grant award \nunder subpart 1 of part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et seq.), which does not \nreduce a subgrant award made under such grant to a unit of local \ngovernment in its jurisdiction in accordance with this section, shall, \nin the succeeding fiscal year, receive only 50 percent of the grant \naward that would have otherwise been awarded to that State under such \nsubpart.\n    (d) Reallocation.--Any funds withheld from a State or unit of local \ngovernment from a direct grant award by the Attorney General shall be \nreallocated in accordance with subpart 1 of part E of title I of the \nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et \nseq.).\n\nSEC. 4.

WAIVERS.\n\n    The Attorney General may, in his or her discretion, grant a waiver \nunder this section to any unit of local government for good cause \nshown, and shall consider the following factors:\n            (1) Whether, resulting from allegations of excessive uses \n        of force, false arrests, improper searches and seizures, \n        failures to discipline officers sufficiently, or failure to \n        supervise officers, the unit of local government is subject to \n        a consent decree or Memorandum of Understanding, or the subject \n        of an investigation by the Special Litigation Section of the \n        Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.\n            (2) Whether the unit of local government has taken \n        affirmative action to ensure that adequate practices and \n        procedures are in place to increase public trust and confidence \n        in the impartial and equitable administration of justice, \n        including--\n                    (A) whether incidents of officer involved shootings \n                and uses of excessive force are investigated by a \n                Special Prosecutor appointed by the Governor, State \n                Attorney General, or Presiding Judge of the local court \n                of jurisdiction;\n                    (B) whether incidents of officer involved shootings \n                and uses of excessive force are adjudicated in a public \n                proceeding rather than the grand jury process.\n            (3) Whether the minority community is equitably represented \n        in the municipality's legislative body and executive \n        departments."
