FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Adak Island is an isolated island located 1,200 miles \n        southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, between the Pacific Ocean and \n        the Bering Sea. The island, with its unique physical and \n        biological features, including a deepwater harbor and abundant \n        marine-associated wildlife, was recognized early for both its \n        natural and military values. In 1913, Adak Island was reserved \n        and set aside as a preserve because of its value to seabirds, \n        marine mammals, and fisheries. Withdrawals of portions of Adak \n        Island for various military purposes date back to 1901 and \n        culminated in the 1959 withdrawal of approximately half of the \n        island for use by the Department of the Navy for military \n        purposes.\n            (2) By 1990, military development on Adak Island supported \n        a community of 6,000 residents. Outside of the Adak Naval \n        Complex, there was no independent community on Adak Island.\n            (3) As a result of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment \n        Act of 1990 (104 Stat. 1808), the Adak Naval Complex has been \n        closed by the Department of Defense.\n            (4) The Aleut Corporation is an Alaskan Native Regional \n        Corporation incorporated in the State of Alaska pursuant to the \n        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). \n        The Aleut Corporation represents the indigenous people of the \n        Aleutian Islands who prior to the Russian exploration and \n        settlement of the Aleutian Islands were found throughout the \n        Aleutian Islands, which includes Adak Island.\n            (5) None of Adak Island was available for selection by The \n        Aleut Corporation under section 14(h)(8) of the Alaska Native \n        Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1613(h)(8)) because it was \n        part of a national wildlife refuge and because the portion \n        comprising the Adak Naval Complex was withdrawn for use by the \n        United States Navy for military purposes prior to the passage \n        of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in December 1971.\n            (6) The Aleut Corporation is attempting to establish a \n        community on Adak and has offered to exchange Alaska Native \n        Claims Settlement Act land selections and entitlements for \n        conveyance of certain lands and interests therein on a portion \n        of Adak formerly occupied by the Navy.\n            (7) Removal of a portion of the Adak Island land from \n        refuge status will be offset by the acquisition of high-quality \n        wildlife habitat in other Aleut Corporation selections within \n        the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, maintaining a \n        resident human population on Adak to control caribou, and \n        making possible a continued United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service presence in that remote location to protect the natural \n        resources of the Aleutian Islands Unit of the Alaska Maritime \n        National Wildlife Refuge.\n            (8) It is in the public interest to promote reuse of the \n        Adak Island lands by exchanging certain lands for lands \n        selected by The Aleut Corporation elsewhere in the Alaska \n        Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Experience with \n        environmental problems associated with formerly used defense \n        sites in the State of Alaska suggests that the most effective \n        and efficient way to avoid future environmental problems on \n        Adak is to support and encourage active reuse of Adak.\n\nSEC. 2. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT.\n\n    The document entitled the ``Agreement Concerning the Conveyance of \nProperty at the Adak Naval Complex'' (hereinafter referred to as the \n``Agreement''), and dated September 20, 2000, executed by The Aleut \nCorporation, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of the \nNavy, together with any technical amendments or modifications to the \nboundaries that may be agreed to by the parties, is hereby ratified, \nconfirmed, and approved and the terms, conditions, procedures, \ncovenants, reservations, indemnities and other provisions set forth in \nthe Agreement are declared to be obligations and commitments of the \nUnited States as a matter of Federal law.

ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT.\n\n    Lands and interests therein exchanged and conveyed by the United \nStates pursuant to this Act shall be considered and treated as \nconveyances of lands or interests therein under the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act, except that receipt of such lands and interests \ntherein shall not constitute a sale or disposition of land or interests \nreceived pursuant to such Act. The public easements for access to \npublic lands and waters reserved pursuant to the Agreement are deemed \nto satisfy the requirements and purposes of section 17(b) of the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act.\n\nSEC. 5.
