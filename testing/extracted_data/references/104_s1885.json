FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) over 10,000,000 people in the world are amputees, and \n        each year more than 250,000 people become amputees;\n            (2) thousands of citizens of the United States depend on \n        the availability of prosthetic devices in order to function \n        fully in contemporary society;\n            (3) a sizable number of amputees are unable to afford \n        adequate prosthetic care;\n            (4) used prosthetic devices could be recycled for reuse by \n        amputees in the United States, but, because of the potential \n        liability of providers of those prosthetic devices, the \n        prosthetic devices are shipped to Third World countries;\n            (5) making recycled prosthetic devices available to \n        economically disadvantaged amputees would enable those amputees \n        to live more comfortably and function fully;\n            (6) nonprofit organizations would be uniquely suited to \n        provided recycled prosthetic devices to amputees, if they could \n        be enabled to do so in a cost-efficient manner;\n            (7) in order to enable nonprofit organizations to provide \n        recycled prosthetic devices to amputees in a cost-efficient \n        manner, immediate action is needed to--\n                    (A) limit the liability of nonprofit organizations \n                in serving as providers of recycled prosthetic devices; \n                and\n                    (B) minimize the cost of litigation against those \n                providers by establishing expeditious procedures to \n                dispose of unwarranted actions.\n\nSEC. 3.
