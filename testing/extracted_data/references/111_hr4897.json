    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Drivers Accelerated Interest \nDeductibility Act of 2010'' or the ``Drivers AID Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The economic health and well-being of the United States \n        depends on a strong and resurgent automotive industry. Until \n        2008, automotive sales historically accounted for approximately \n        20 percent of all retail spending in the United States, and \n        provided the income and financial security for millions of \n        Americans.\n            (2) From June 2006 through May 2008, the seasonally \n        adjusted annual rate of automotive sales ranged from a high of \n        approximately 17,500,000 units in June 2006 to a low of \n        14,200,000 units in May 2008, substantially above the \n        13,000,000 unit seasonally adjusted annual rate generally \n        regarded to be the indicator of a robust automotive industry.\n            (3) Beginning in June 2008 and continuing through the \n        present, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of automotive \n        sales has averaged less than 10,000,000 units and has exceeded \n        that number in only three months and has not in any matched or \n        exceeded the 13,000,000 unit seasonally adjusted annual rate \n        threshold.\n            (4) The annual contributions of the automotive new vehicle \n        dealers industry to the national economy are substantial. In \n        2008, the average sales revenue for the approximately 20,000 \n        new automobile dealers in the United States was $28,800,000 and \n        the total sales of all new-vehicle dealerships in the United \n        States was $576,000,000,000 which constituted 14.6 percent of \n        total retail sales in the United States.\n            (5) In 2008, the 1,057,500 persons employed in new-vehicle \n        dealerships in the United States, an average of 53 employees \n        per dealership, earned on average $48,963 per year, generating \n        a national payroll of more than $52,000,000,000 and $2,660,000 \n        per dealership and millions more in tax revenue for State and \n        local governments.\n            (6) Because a well capitalized, financially sound dealer \n        network is essential to the success of every automobile \n        manufacturer, especially a manufacturer facing economic \n        challenges, preserving the viability of the new-vehicle dealer \n        industry further the national economic interest of the United \n        States.\n            (7) Because sales of new vehicles is highly dependent on \n        consumer confidence and the existence of incentives to motivate \n        consumers to purchase a new-vehicle, a reduction in the cost of \n        capital needed to finance the purchase of a new vehicle over a \n        period of years will have a positive effect on the viability of \n        the new-vehicle dealer industry, which in turn will strengthen \n        the automotive manufacturing industry and the national economy.\n            (8) Payment of nonmortgage interest payments, such as \n        automobile loan debt, was deductible for Federal income tax \n        purposes for 73 years, from the inception of the Internal \n        Revenue Code in 1913 until Congress ended the deduction in 1986 \n        when the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed.\n\nSEC. 3. DEDUCTION FOR INTEREST ON INDEBTEDNESS INCURRED TO ACQUIRE A \n              PASSENGER CAR OR LIGHT TRUCK.\n\n    (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 163(h) of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ``and'' at the end of \nsubparagraph (E), by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (F) \nand inserting ``, and'', and by adding at the end the following new
