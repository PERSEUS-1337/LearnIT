FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The greater Southern California metropolitan region is \n        the second largest urban concentration in the United States, \n        with almost one-tenth of the total population of the country, \n        yet it has one of the lowest ratios of park-and-recreation-\n        lands-per-thousand-population of any urban area in the country. \n        Unless action is taken soon, this situation will only become \n        worse as the region continues to be subjected to intense \n        growth.\n            (2) The lack of park, recreation, natural open space, and \n        habitat protection in close proximity to the greater Southern \n        California metropolitan region deprives the individuals who \n        reside there of--\n                    (A) the health and spiritual welfare benefits of \n                proximity to nature; and\n                    (B) the quantifiable benefits of reduced crime, \n                lower social tension, and increased educational \n                opportunities that are associated with the provision of \n                open space in geographic proximity to and accessible to \n                urban populations.\n            (3) The Rim of the Valley Corridor encircling the San \n        Fernando and La Crescenta valleys provides important scenic, \n        environmental, recreational, educational, scientific, and \n        economic assets to the greater Southern California metropolitan \n        region. These assets are deserving of increased protection so \n        that they can continue to provide public benefit in the 21st \n        century and beyond.\n            (4) The Rim of the Valley Corridor, consisting of parts of \n        the Santa Monica Mountains, Santa Susanna Mountains, San \n        Gabriel Mountains, Verdugo Mountains, San Rafael Hills, and \n        adjacent connector areas to the Los Padres and San Bernardino \n        National Forests, contains significant examples of--\n                    (A) the world's most endangered habitat area, the \n                Mediterranean chaparral ecosystem; and\n                    (B) significant examples of separate ecotones \n                indigenous to the area.\n            (5) A key element of the Rim of the Valley Corridor is the \n        escarpment of the San Gabriel Mountains that is largely \n        contained within the Angeles National Forest. That national \n        forest is primarily managed for watershed, recreational, and \n        habitat values and not for commercial exploitation of forest \n        resources.\n            (6) Privately owned lands within the Rim of the Valley \n        Corridor are critical to providing additional scenic, \n        environmental, recreational, and open space values. These lands \n        should be brought within public protection through the use of \n        voluntary incentives, respecting at all times the legitimate \n        private property values of existing property owners.\n            (7) The State of California has adopted the Rim of the \n        Valley Master Plan, and local governments within the Rim of the \n        Valley Corridor have made significant progress toward \n        protecting the unique natural and recreational resources of the \n        area. However, these efforts have been hampered by a lack of \n        financial resources, technical assistance, and resource \n        management expertise that can be provided by the Federal \n        Government.\n\nSEC. 3.
