FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Homicide is the leading cause of death for young black \n        males and females and is the second leading cause of juvenile \n        injury deaths for all youth age 15-24.\n            (2) Homicide rates for children and youth have more than \n        doubled since 1950.\n            (3) Teenagers are more than twice as likely as adults to be \n        victims of violent crime, such as rape, robbery or assault.\n            (4) Physical fighting severe enough to require medical \n        treatment for at least one participant occurs among high school \n        students in patterns similar to those of homicide. The \n        incidence rates are higher for males than females, higher for \n        minorities than for nonminorities, and more frequent between \n        acquaintances than among strangers.\n            (5) There is a need to supplement existing mental health \n        services with a wide and varied range of preventive programs \n        designed to reach those at greatest risk for development of \n        behavioral or social problems.\n            (6) The reach of professional mental health manpower can be \n        expanded through consultative techniques and by the \n        recruitment, selection and training of various nontraditional \n        helping resources.\n            (7) Community-based police, by their visibility at the \n        neighborhood level and their engagement in benign activities, \n        can provide role models and resources to promote the well-being \n        of children and families, as well as to identify and refer \n        those at risk for behavioral problems.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) identify children and families at high-risk for \n        developing behavioral or emotional problems resulting from \n        exposure to community violence and provide mental health \n        services to such children and families, including crisis \n        intervention for child witnesses and victims of violence;\n            (2) facilitate interaction between child and family service \n        organizations, law enforcement agencies, local educational \n        agencies, and other community members for the purpose of \n        building coalitions for the prevention of community violence;\n            (3) augment law enforcement services and community policing \n        efforts through the provision of training and support by child \n        and family service organizations, and supplement child and \n        family services through the training of law enforcement \n        officers in child, family and cultural issues; and\n            (4) provide role models for high-risk children and youth \n        and promote conflict resolution training for children and youth \n        in local educational agencies.\n\nSEC. 4.
