    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Chlorine Zero Discharge Act of \n1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. ZERO DISCHARGE OF TOXIC PERSISTENT AND BIOACCUMULATIVE \n              SUBSTANCES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) substances that persist and/or bioaccumulate in the \n        environment, build to higher and higher concentration over \n        time, reaching their greatest levels in the tissues of species \n        high on the food chain, including humans;\n            (2) toxic substances that persist and/or bioaccumulate in \n        the environment are biologically active in infinitesimal \n        quantities, causing reproductive failure, birth defects, \n        developmental impairment, hormonal disruption, behavioral \n        disorders, immune suppression, and cancer at low doses, and \n        mixtures of these substances may cause these effects at even \n        lower doses;\n            (3) regulatory approaches that permit even limited \n        production and discharge of toxic substances that persist and/\n        or bioaccumulate result in the accumulation of these substances \n        in the environment and food chain over time and subsequent \n        damage to the health of humans and other species;\n            (4) the most favored method of preventing the continued \n        contamination of the environment from persistent or \n        bioaccumulative toxic substances is to phaseout their \n        production and/or use over time and replace these substances or \n        the processes that produce them, or both, with safer \n        alternatives;\n            (5) among the persistent and/or bioaccumulative toxic \n        substances of greatest concern are organochlorines discharged \n        in the production of pulp and paper as a result of the use of \n        chlorine or any other chlorinated oxidizing agents in the pulp \n        and paper manufacturing process;\n            (6) the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the \n        United States and Canada concludes that ``the discharge of \n        toxic substances in toxic amounts be prohibited and the \n        discharge of any or all persistent toxic substances be \n        virtually eliminated''; and\n            (7) in the Sixth Biennial Report on Great Lakes Water \n        Quality, the International Joint Commission on Great Lakes \n        Water Quality concluded that ``the concepts of virtual \n        elimination and zero discharge are consistent and a clear \n        statement or direction to take to achieve the Agreement's \n        purpose. The overall strategy or aim regarding persistent toxic \n        substances is virtual elimination, and the tactic or method to \n        be used to achieve the aim is through zero input or discharge \n        of those substances created as a result of human activity.\n    (b) Zero Discharge of Organochlorine Compounds, Byproducts, or \nMetabolites.--Title III of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is \namended by redesignating section 519 as section 520 and by inserting \nthe following after section 518:\n\n``SEC. 519. DISCHARGE OF ORGANOCHLORINE COMPOUNDS, BYPRODUCTS, OR \n              METABOLITES.\n\n    ``(a) Zero Discharge.--(1) Effective 5 years after the enactment of \nthis section, each pulp and paper manufacturing facility shall achieve \nzero discharge into water of organochlorine compounds, byproducts, or \nmetabolites formulated as a result of the use of chlorine or any other \nchlorinated oxidizing agent in the pulp and paper manufacturing \nprocess.\n    ``(2) Effective 5 years after enactment of this section, all \nexisting and new permits under this Act for paper and pulp mills which \nuse chlorine or any other chlorinated oxidizing agent shall require \ncompliance with the zero discharge requirement set forth in paragraph \n(1).\n    ``(b) Safe Alternatives Assistance.--Within one year after the \nenactment of this section, the Administrator shall evaluate \nalternatives to the use of organochlorines in the manufacturing of pulp \nand paper, and shall publish a report on the transfer of technology in \nthe pulp and paper industry from organochlorine to chlorine-free \ntechnology as a model for pollution prevention. Within 18 months after \nthe enactment of this section, the Agency shall begin providing \ntechnical information and support to assist permit applicants in the \nuse of alternatives to organochlorine compounds in the production of \npulp and paper.\n    ``(c) Report to Congress on Organochlorine Zero Discharge \nCandidates.--Within 18 months after the enactment of this section, the \nAdministrator shall complete a report to Congress on nonpoint sources \nand industrial discharges of organochlorine compounds and their \nbyproducts and metabolites into water. The report shall include a \nlisting of all types or categories of nonpoint sources and industrial \norganochlorine discharges into water and their byproducts and \nmetabolites. The report shall also include a listing of the annual \nquantities of each organochlorine compound discharged into water \nnationally and by permitted facility, together with a list of each \npermitted facility's location and quantities of combined organochlorine \ncompound discharges into water. The report shall contain \nrecommendations for achieving a zero discharge policy for important \ncategories of organochlorine pollution sources. In order to develop \nsuch recommendations, the Administrator shall convene an advisory \npanel. The advisory panel shall conduct public hearings and solicit \npublic and expert comment. The panel shall consist of 15 members, \nincluding at least 1 independent expert in each of the fields of public \nhealth, occupational health, technology change, toxics use reduction, \nand ecology, 2 affected citizens, and technical and policy experts from \nindustry, labor, public interest groups, and State environmental \nagencies.\n    ``(d) Definition.--For the purposes of this section, the term `zero \ndischarge' means absolutely no output or release, including nonpoint \nsource output or release, into water. The term `zero discharge' does \nnot mean a less than detectable output or release.''."
