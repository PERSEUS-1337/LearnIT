FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Department of Energy grouped small-duct high-\n        velocity systems with all air conditioners and heat pumps in a \n        final rule published on January 22, 2001.\n            (2) The Department of Energy subsequently published and \n        established the minimum efficiency standard for small-duct \n        high-velocity systems and informed all manufacturers of these \n        products to request exception relief in order to legally sell \n        these products in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. STANDARDS FOR SMALL-DUCT HIGH-VELOCITY AIR CONDITIONING AND \n              HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) Standards.--Section 325(d) of the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(d)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(C) Small-duct high-velocity systems: 11.00 for \n                products manufactured on or after January 23, 2006.''; \n                and\n            (2) in paragraph (2), by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(C) Small-duct high-velocity systems: 6.8 for \n                products manufactured on or after January 23, 2006.''.\n    (b) Definition.--Section 321 of the Energy Policy and Conservation \nAct (42 U.S.C. 6291) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nparagraph:\n            ``(67) Small-duct, high velocity system.--The term `small-\n        duct, high-velocity system' means a heating and cooling product \n        that contains a blower and indoor coil combination that--\n                    ``(A) is designed for, and produces, at least 1.2 \n                inches of external static pressure when operated at the \n                certified air volume rate of 220-350 cubic feet per \n                minute per rated ton of cooling; and\n                    ``(B) when applied in the field, uses high velocity \n                room outlets generally greater than 1,000 feet per \n                minute that have less than 6.0 square inches of free \n                area.''.\n    (c) Amendment of Standards.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary may, by rule, amend the \n        standards established for small-duct high-velocity air \n        conditioning and heat pump systems under the amendments made by \n        this section.\n            (2) Effective date.--Standards as amended pursuant to \n        paragraph (1) shall not take effect less than 5 years after the \n        final rule making the amendment is published.\n            (3) Determination.--Not later than June 30, 2011, the \n        Secretary shall publish a final rule to determine whether \n        standards for small-duct, high-velocity systems should be \n        amended.\n\nSEC. 4. CREDIT FOR NONBUSINESS SMALL-DUCT, HIGH-VELOCITY AIR \n              CONDITIONING AND HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Paragraph (3) of section 25C(d) of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 (relating to energy-efficient building property) \nis amended by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (D), by \nstriking the period at the end of subparagraph (E) and inserting ``, \nand'', and by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n                    ``(F) a small-duct high-velocity central air \n                conditioning and heat pump system which has--\n                            ``(i) a seasonal energy efficiency ratio of \n                        no less than 11.00,\n                            ``(ii) a heating seasonal performance \n                        factor of no less than 6.80, and\n                            ``(iii) a duct system that has less than 5 \n                        percent air leakage.''.\n    (b) Small-Duct High-Velocity Central Air Conditioning and Heat Pump \nSystem.--Subsection (d) of section 25C of such Code is amended by \nadding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(7) Small-duct high-velocity central air conditioning and \n        heat pump system.--The term `small-duct high-velocity central \n        air conditioning and heat pump system' means a heating and \n        cooling product that contains a blower and indoor coil \n        combination that--\n                    ``(A) is designed for, and produces, at least 1.2 \n                inches of external static pressure when operated at the \n                certified air volume rate of 220-350 cubic feet per \n                minute per rated ton of cooling, and\n                    ``(B) when applied in the field, uses room \n                outlets--\n                            ``(i) having a velocity which is generally \n                        greater than 1,000 feet per minute, and\n                            ``(ii) having less than 6 square inches of \n                        free area.''.\n    (c) Termination.--Paragraph (2) of section 25C(g) of such Code \n(relating to termination) is amended by inserting ``(December 31, 2013, \nin the case of small-duct high-velocity central air conditioning and \nheat pump systems)'' after ``December 31, 2010''.\n    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \napply to property placed in service after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act in taxable years ending after such date."
