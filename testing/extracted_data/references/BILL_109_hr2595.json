FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) This Act is based on--\n                    (A) the findings of a report prepared by the \n                Government Accountability Office (referred to in this \n                section as the ``GAO'') in May 2003, that found that \n                the District of Columbia has a structural fiscal \n                imbalance caused by Federal mandates; and\n                    (B) a bill, the District of Columbia Fair Federal \n                Compensation Act of 2005, as introduced in this \n                Congress, that authorizes Federal compensation for this \n                structural imbalance.\n            (2) The GAO found that the District's structural imbalance \n        is the difference between the costs to the District of \n        providing an average level of services and the District's total \n        revenue capacity.\n            (3) In addition to the 2003 GAO study, two other studies \n        (McKinsey, March 2002, and Brookings, October 2002), also have \n        determined that the District of Columbia has a substantial \n        structural fiscal imbalance.\n            (4) The District's structural fiscal imbalance, is \n        exclusively Federal in origin and beyond the ability of the \n        District government to correct through improved management or \n        other means.\n            (5) The cost to the District of providing an average level \n        of services significantly exceeds--\n                    (A) the national average, as well as the average of \n                all 50 States for providing such services; and\n                    (B) the District's capacity to raise the necessary \n                revenue.\n            (6) The gap between the cost for average services and tax \n        revenue raised in the District is an annual structural \n        imbalance of between $470,000,000 and $1,100,000,000.\n            (7) The causes of the District's fiscal imbalance, in part, \n        are--\n                    (A) the costs to the District of providing services \n                to the Federal Government;\n                    (B) the tax exempt status of more than 40 percent \n                of real property in the District, which is either owned \n                or specifically exempted by the Federal Government; and\n                    (C) the District's responsibility for the cost of \n                several State functions such as special education, \n                although the District is a city without the broad tax \n                base of a State.\n            (8) The District, to cover the cost of the structural \n        fiscal imbalance, assumes unique burdens that inhibit economic \n        and population stability and growth, including--\n                    (A) a tax burden that ranks among the highest in \n                the country;\n                    (B) the highest debt service in the country among \n                all of the State and local jurisdictions; and\n                    (C) the inability to make major capital \n                improvements and investments in schools, roads, and \n                other necessary facilities.\n            (9) According to the GAO, the options available to address \n        the structural imbalance are--\n                    (A) to expand the District's tax base;\n                    (B) to provide additional Federal financial support \n                to the District; and\n                    (C) to increase the role of the Federal Government \n                in helping the District maintain fiscal balance.\n            (10) The land transfers authorized in this Act would create \n        a significantly new revenue stream that would be equivalent to \n        a partial payment to the District for the annual structural \n        imbalance provided for in the District of Columbia Fair Federal \n        Compensation Act of 2005, as introduced in this Congress.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide an efficient mechanism for \nthe conveyance of Federal property to the District of Columbia in order \nto decrease the structural imbalance by increasing the District's \ntaxable property base and opportunities by the District to pursue \neconomic development.\n\nSEC. 4.
