FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Holocaust, including the murder of 6,000,000 \n        European Jews, the systematic destruction of families and \n        communities, and the wholesale theft of their assets, was one \n        of the most tragic crimes in modern history.\n            (2) When Holocaust survivors or heirs of Holocaust victims \n        presented claims to insurance companies after World War II, \n        many were rejected because the claimants did not have death \n        certificates or physical possession of policy documents that \n        had been confiscated by the Nazis.\n            (3) In many instances, insurance company records are the \n        only proof of the existence of insurance policies belonging to \n        Holocaust victims.\n            (4) Holocaust survivors and their descendants have been \n        fighting for decades to persuade insurance companies to settle \n        unpaid insurance claims.\n            (5) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \n        Insurance Claims (in this section referred to as the \n        ``ICHEIC'') was established by the National Association of \n        Insurance Commissioners in cooperation with several European \n        insurance companies, European regulators, representatives of \n        international Jewish organizations, and the State of Israel, to \n        expeditiously address the issue of unpaid insurance policies \n        issued to Holocaust victims.\n            (6) On July 17, 2000, the United States and Germany signed \n        an Executive Agreement in support of the German Foundation \n        ``Remembrance, Responsibility, and the Future'', which \n        designated the ICHEIC to resolve all insurance claims that were \n        not paid or were nationalized during the Nazi era.\n            (7) The ICHEIC's deadline for receiving claims applications \n        is January 31, 2002.\n            (8) Three years into the process of addressing the issue of \n        unpaid insurance policies, companies continue to withhold \n        thousands of names on dormant accounts.\n            (9) As of June 15, 2001, more than 84 percent of the 72,675 \n        claims applications filed with the ICHEIC remained idle because \n        the claimants could not identify the company holding the \n        policy.\n            (10) Insurance companies doing business in the United \n        States have a responsibility to ensure the disclosure of \n        insurance policies of Holocaust victims that they or their \n        related companies may have issued, to facilitate the rapid \n        resolution of questions concerning these policies, and to \n        eliminate the further victimization of policyholders and their \n        families.\n            (11) State legislatures in California, Florida, New York, \n        Minnesota, Washington, and elsewhere have been challenged in \n        efforts to implement laws that restrict the ability of insurers \n        to engage in business transactions in those States until the \n        insurers publish the names of Holocaust-era policyholders.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide information \nabout Holocaust-era insurance policies to Holocaust victims and their \nheirs and beneficiaries to enable them to expeditiously file their \nrightful claims under the policies.\n\nSEC. 3. HOLOCAUST INSURANCE REGISTRY.\n\n    (a) Establishment and Maintenance.--Chapter 21 of title 44, United \nStates Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 2119. Holocaust Insurance Registry\n    ``(a) Establishment.--The Archivist shall establish and maintain a \ncollection of records that shall--\n            ``(1) be known as the Holocaust Insurance Registry; and\n            ``(2) consist of the information provided to the Archivist \n        under section 5 of the Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act \n        of 2001.\n    ``(b) Public Accessibility.--The Archivist shall make all such \ninformation publicly accessible and searchable by means of the Internet \nand by any other means the Archivist deems appropriate.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of \nchapter 21 of title 44, United States Code, is amended by adding at the \nend the following:\n\n``2119.

PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO ARCHIVIST.\n\n    The Secretary of Commerce shall provide to the Archivist of the \nUnited States any information filed with the Secretary under section \n4(a) promptly after the filing of such information.\n\nSEC. 6.

USE OF AMOUNTS RECEIVED AS CIVIL PENALTIES.\n\n    To the extent or in the amounts provided in advance in \nappropriation Acts, the Archivist of the United States may use amounts \nreceived by the Government as civil penalties under section 6 to \nmaintain the Holocaust Insurance Registry.\n\nSEC. 8. NOTIFICATION.\n\n    (a) Initial Notification.--Not later than 180 days after the date \nof the enactment of this Act and periodically afterward, the Secretary \nof Commerce shall notify each State's commissioner of insurance of the \nidentity of each insurer that has failed to comply with the \nrequirements of section 4 or has not satisfied any civil penalty for \nwhich the insurer is liable under section 6.\n    (b) Requests by States.--On request by the commissioner of \ninsurance of a State concerning an insurer operating in that State, the \nSecretary of Commerce shall inform the commissioner of insurance \nwhether the insurer has failed to comply with the requirements of \nsection 4 or has not satisfied any civil penalty for which the insurer \nis liable under section 6.\n\nSEC. 9. STATE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS REPORTING STATUTES.\n\n    (a) Preemption.--Nothing in this Act preempts the right of any \nState to adopt or enforce any State law requiring an insurer to \ndisclose information regarding insurance policies that may have been \nconfiscated or stolen from victims of Nazi persecution.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that if any \nlitigation challenging any State law described in subsection (a) is \ndismissed because the State's commissioner of insurance chooses to rely \non this Act and therefore no longer seeks to enforce the State law, \neach party should bear its own legal fees and costs.\n\nSEC. 10.
