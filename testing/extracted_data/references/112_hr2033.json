    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis \nResearch, Cure, and Care Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are autoimmune, \n        chronic, inflammatory, painful, and disabling diseases that \n        require lifelong timely and appropriate medical intervention \n        and care and have no cure.\n            (2) Current studies indicate that the prevalence of \n        psoriasis in the United States ranges between two and three \n        percent, affecting approximately 7.5 million men, women, and \n        children of all ages, approximately 17,000 individuals in each \n        congressional district, and has an adverse impact on the \n        quality of life for virtually all affected.\n            (3) Psoriasis often is overlooked or dismissed because it \n        is not typically a direct cause of death. Psoriasis is commonly \n        and incorrectly considered by insurers, employers, \n        policymakers, and the public as a mere annoyance--a superficial \n        problem, mistakenly thought to be contagious, due to poor \n        hygiene, or both. As such, treatment for psoriasis is often \n        incorrectly categorized as ``cosmetic'' and not ``medically \n        necessary''.\n            (4) Psoriasis is connected with an elevated risk for other \n        serious, chronic, and life-threatening comorbid conditions, \n        including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer. \n        A higher prevalence of stroke, atherosclerosis, chronic \n        obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Crohn's disease, \n        lymphoma, metabolic syndrome, and liver disease are also found \n        in people with psoriasis as compared to the general population. \n        Up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop \n        potentially disabling psoriatic arthritis.\n            (5) The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded a \n        study that found that psoriasis may cause as much physical and \n        mental disability as other major chronic diseases, including \n        cancer, arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and \n        depression.\n            (6) Psoriasis is associated with elevated rates of \n        depression, anxiety, and suicidality (suicidal thoughts, \n        suicide attempts, and completed suicides). Individuals with \n        psoriasis are twice as likely to have thoughts of suicide as \n        people without psoriasis or with other chronic conditions.\n            (7) The risk of premature death is 50 percent higher for \n        people with severe psoriasis. This translates to people with \n        severe psoriasis dying four years earlier, on average, than \n        people without psoriasis.\n            (8) The economic consequences of psoriasis, both for \n        individuals and the health care system, are significant. Total \n        direct and indirect health care costs of psoriasis are \n        calculated at $11,250,000,000 with work loss accounting for 40 \n        percent of the cost burden. People with psoriasis have \n        significantly higher health care resource utilization and costs \n        than the general population. Additionally, psoriasis patients \n        with comorbidities are more likely to experience urgent care, \n        have greater rates of hospitalization, more frequent outpatient \n        visits, and incur greater costs than psoriasis patients without \n        comorbidities.\n            (9) Early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis \n        may help prevent irreversible joint damage.\n            (10) Treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis presents a \n        challenge for patients and their health care providers. A wide \n        range of treatment options is available; however, adverse side \n        effects and success varies from patient to patient. The same \n        treatments do not work for every patient and a treatment that \n        may have been effective for a period of time can stop working.\n            (11) Despite a number of recent breakthroughs that have led \n        to some new treatments, too many people with psoriasis and \n        psoriatic arthritis still cannot live normal lives. For many of \n        these individuals, existing treatments are not effective or \n        appropriate or may not be accessible due to cost and insurance \n        barriers.\n            (12) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis constitute a \n        significant national health issue that deserves a comprehensive \n        and coordinated response by States and the Federal Government \n        with involvement of the health care provider, patient, and \n        public health communities.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS DATA COLLECTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting \nthrough the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nis authorized to undertake psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis data \ncollection efforts, including incorporating questions into public \nhealth surveys, questionnaires, and other databases in existence as of \nthe date of the enactment of this Act to collect information, with \nrespect to psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, regarding--\n            (1) the prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in \n        the United States;\n            (2) the age of onset;\n            (3) health-related quality of life;\n            (4) health care utilization;\n            (5) burden of such disease (such as with respect to \n        employment);\n            (6) direct and indirect costs;\n            (7) health disparities, including with respect to age, \n        gender, race, and ethnicity; and\n            (8) comorbidities and the natural history of such disease.\nSuch data collection efforts may include the consideration and \ndevelopment of a patient registry, which would include individuals of \nall ages.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out subsection (a), \nthere are authorized to be appropriated $1,500,000 for each of fiscal \nyears 2012 through 2017.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS FOR COLLABORATIVE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH \n              ON PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS AND COMORBID \n              CONDITIONS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the psoriasis research community has made significant \n        strides in proving the seriousness of psoriasis as an \n        autoimmune disease and in advancing the identification of \n        commonalities between psoriasis and other diseases;\n            (2) the nonprofit and private sector psoriasis research \n        communities are to be commended for planning a \n        multidisciplinary scientific meeting in 2012 to discuss future \n        directions of psoriasis and comorbid research, identify \n        initiatives necessary to fill any gaps, leverage public and \n        private investments in psoriasis research, and facilitate \n        progress in interdisciplinary research related to psoriasis and \n        its comorbid conditions;\n            (3) the National Institutes of Health is encouraged to \n        continue to work with the organizations and private sector \n        stakeholders who convene the multidisciplinary scientific \n        meeting to discuss future directions of psoriasis and comorbid \n        research;\n            (4) the nonprofit and private sector meeting conveners \n        should disseminate to the public, Congress, and other relevant \n        public and private policymaking and research entities a report \n        that includes findings from the scientific meeting and \n        suggestions regarding next steps, including recommendations \n        from the National Institutes of Health and other relevant \n        Federal agencies; and\n            (5) utilizing the information produced by the scientific \n        meeting regarding future directions of psoriasis and comorbid \n        research, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting \n        through the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and \n        in conjunction with the National Institute for Arthritis, \n        Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases and other institutes and \n        centers of the National Institutes of Health, is encouraged to \n        explore the development of a virtual Center of Excellence for \n        Collaborative Discovery in Psoriasis and Comorbid Research or \n        some other mechanism through which public and private sector \n        findings regarding psoriasis and its comorbid conditions can be \n        regularly shared and leveraged."
