This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Citizens Health \nInsurance Standards Act of 1993''.\n\n                          findings and purpose\n\n    Sec. 2. The Congress finds that--\n            (1) health care costs are a major expense and source of \n        concern for the elderly;\n            (2) Medicare covers less than half of the health care costs \n        for the elderly;\n            (3) because of their condition and needs, many elderly have \n        to purchase private health insurance;\n            (4) the paucity of consumer information in the field of \n        health insurance for the elderly makes it almost impossible for \n        those seeking such insurance to make reasoned choices;\n            (5) many of the policies sold to supplement Medicare \n        coverage provide inadequate coverage and low return to \n        consumers;\n            (6) the many instances of abuse and deception in the \n        marketing of health insurance for the elderly, which have been \n        documented by recent congressional hearings, constitute a \n        national disgrace; and\n            (7) these instances of abuse, deception, inadequate \n        coverage, and low return are now a national problem and the \n        Federal Government has a responsibility to assist in the \n        remedy.\n    (b) It is, therefore, the purpose of this Act to direct the \nSecretary to require Federal minimum standards for the sale of health \ninsurance for the elderly and to take other action designed to provide \nfuture benefits to the elderly who need assistance in meeting their \nhealth insurance needs.\n\n                           minimum standards\n\n    Sec. 3. (a) Each State shall, no later than two years after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, submit a plan to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services for the purpose of specifying the minimum standards \napplicable to health insurance for the elderly in such State. Such plan \nshall specify minimum standards which--\n            (1) provide that at least 75 per centum of the premiums \n        collected from the sale of such health insurance be returned in \n        the form of benefits provided under such health insurance, as \n        specified by the Secretary in regulations;\n            (2) limit the exclusions of preexisting conditions in \n        accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary;\n            (3) provide that policies of such health insurance be \n        written in simplified language which can be understood by \n        purchasers, as specified in regulations prescribed by the \n        Secretary;\n            (4) prohibit the sale of such health insurance if such \n        health insurance duplicates the coverage provided under the \n        Medicare Program, except that such a sale may be made if the \n        purchaser signs a written statement expressing his knowledge of \n        the duplicative coverage, as specified in regulations \n        prescribed by the Secretary; and\n            (5) are in accordance with disclosure provisions, specified \n        in regulations, which the Secretary determines necessary to \n        protect purchasers of such insurance, including, but not \n        limited to, provisions which require a simplified written \n        statement, to all prospective purchasers, of--\n                    (A) the percentage of premiums collected for such \n                health insurance which is returned in the form of \n                benefits;\n                    (B) the name and address of the agent who sold the \n                policy and a toll free telephone number of the \n                insurance company;\n                    (C) general information which briefly, simply, and \n                adequately explains the premiums, benefits, \n                renewability, coverage, deductibles, coinsurance \n                charges, and other matters; and\n                    (D) general information which briefly, simply, and \n                adequately explains the specific matters covered by the \n                insurance which are not covered under the Medicare \n                Program.\n    (b) The Secretary shall issue final regulations referred to in \nsubsection (a) no later than one hundred and eighty days after the date \nof enactment of this Act.\n    (c) The Secretary shall approve or disapprove any plan submitted \npursuant to subsection (a) no later than ninety days after such \nsubmission.\n    (d)(1) In the case of any State whose plan is disapproved under \nsubsection (c), the Secretary shall return such plan to the State with \na detailed explanation of the reasons for such disapproval.

Any such review shall be instituted only by the State involved \nand shall be commenced within sixty days after the date on which the \ndisapproval was issued. The provisions of subsection (f) shall apply \nand shall not be stayed pending any such review.\n    (e)(1) The Secretary shall conduct oversight activities in each \nState in which a plan is approved for the purpose of assuring that such \nplan is carried out in each such State. Each State shall submit an \nannual report to the Secretary containing a detailed account of the \noperation of the plan in the State during the previous year. Such \nreport shall be in such form and contain such information as is \nspecified by the Secretary in regulations.\n    (2) No change may be made in a plan by any State unless approved by \nthe Secretary before the effective date of such change.\n    (3) In any case in which the Secretary finds that a State, which \nhas an approved plan, is not carrying out such plan, the Secretary \nshall notify the State of such finding and provide the State with \ndetailed information about the basis of such finding.
