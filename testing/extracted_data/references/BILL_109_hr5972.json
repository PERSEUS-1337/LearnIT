PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND \n              CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OF THE UNITED STATES CAPTURED BY JAPAN \n              AND USED AS SLAVE LABOR BY JAPANESE CORPORATIONS DURING \n              WORLD WAR II.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) During World War II, members of the United States Armed \n        Forces fought valiantly against Japanese military forces in the \n        Pacific. In particular, from December 1941 until May 1942, \n        United States military personnel fought courageously against \n        overwhelming Japanese military forces on Wake Island, Guam, the \n        Philippine Islands, including the Bataan Peninsula and \n        Corregidor, and the Dutch East Indies, thereby preventing Japan \n        from accomplishing strategic objectives necessary for achieving \n        a decisive military victory in the Pacific during World War II.\n            (2) During initial military actions in the Philippines, \n        United States troops were ordered to surrender on April 9, \n        1942, and were forced to march 65 miles to prison camps at Camp \n        O'Donnell, Cabanatuan, and Bilibid. More than 10,000 Americans \n        died during the march, known as the ``Bataan Death March'', and \n        during subsequent imprisonment as a result of starvation, \n        disease, and executions.\n            (3) The treatment of members of the Armed Forces who were \n        held as prisoners of war in the Pacific Theater during World \n        War II was so egregious that more than 40 percent of the \n        prisoners of war died while imprisoned.\n            (4) Beginning in January 1942, the Japanese military began \n        transporting United States prisoners of war to Japan, Taiwan, \n        Manchuria, and Korea to perform slave labor to support Japanese \n        war industries. Many of the unmarked merchant vessels in which \n        the prisoners were transported, called ``Hell Ships'', were \n        attacked by American naval and air forces, which, according to \n        some estimates, resulted in more than 3,600 American \n        fatalities.\n            (5) Following the conclusion of World War II, the United \n        States Government agreed to pay compensation to United States \n        ex-prisoners of war amounting to $2.50 per day of imprisonment. \n        This compensation was to be paid from Japanese assets frozen by \n        the United States Government. However, the compensation could \n        never fully compensate those ex-prisoners of war for the \n        sacrifice they endured. Neither the Government of Japan nor any \n        Japanese corporation admits any liability requiring payment or \n        compensation.\n            (6) Other Allied nations, including Canada, the United \n        Kingdom, and the Netherlands, have authorized payment of \n        gratuities to their surviving veterans who were captured by the \n        Japanese during World War II and required to perform slave \n        labor.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to recognize, by the \nprovision of compensation, the heroic contributions of the members of \nthe Armed Forces and civilian employees of the United States who were \ncaptured by the Japanese military during World War II and denied their \nbasic human rights by being made to perform slave labor for Japanese \ncorporations during World War II.\n    (c) Definitions.--In this section\n            (1) Selected veteran or civilian internee.--The term \n        ``selected veteran or civilian internee'' means any individual \n        who--\n                    (A) was a member of the Armed Forces, a civilian \n                employee of the United States, or an employee of a \n                contractor of the United States during World War II;\n                    (B) served in or with United States combat forces \n                during World War II;\n                    (C) was captured and held as a prisoner of war or \n                prisoner by Japan in the course of such service; and\n                    (D) was forced to perform slave labor during World \n                War II for one or more Japanese corporations.\n            (2) Slave labor.--The term ``slave labor'' means forced \n        servitude under conditions of subjugation.\n    (d) Payment of Compensation.--As soon as practicable after the end \nof the period specified in subsection (e)(1), the Secretary of Defense \nshall pay compensation to each living selected veteran or civilian \ninternee whose application for compensation under this section is \napproved by the Secretary.\n    (e) Acceptance of Contributions for Compensation.--\n            (1) Authority to accept contributions.--During the period \n        beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act and ending \n        on December 31, 2007, the Secretary of Defense may accept, \n        hold, and administer any gift, devise, or bequest of money made \n        by any person on the condition that the gift, devise, or \n        bequest be used to provide compensation under this section to a \n        selected veteran or civilian internee.\n            (2) Deposit.--Amounts received as contributions under this \n        subsection shall be deposited in the Department of Defense \n        General Gift Fund established pursuant to section 2601 of title \n        10, United States Code. Such amounts shall be accounted for \n        separately from other amounts in that fund.\n            (3) Acceptance of certain contributions prohibited.--A gift \n        may not be accepted under this subsection--\n                    (A) if the gift is designated for a specific \n                selected veteran or civilian internee;\n                    (B) if the Secretary of Defense determines that the \n                acceptance of the gift would reflect unfavorably on the \n                ability of the Department of Defense, any employee of \n                the Department, or any member of the Armed Forces to \n                carry out any responsibility or duty in a fair and \n                objective manner; or\n                    (C) if the Secretary determines that the use of the \n                gift would compromise the integrity or appearance of \n                integrity of any program of the Department of Defense \n                or any individual involved in such a program.\n            (4) Treatment of contributions.--The making of a \n        contribution under this subsection by any person is wholly \n        voluntary and, in no way, may the existence of such a \n        contribution be used as a matter of proof in any civil \n        litigation.\n    (f) Amount of Compensation.--The amount of compensation paid to \neach living selected veteran or civilian internee whose application for \ncompensation is approved by the Secretary of Defense shall be equal to \nthe sum of the following:\n            (1) An equal share of the funds appropriated to the \n        Secretary to provide compensation under this section, but not \n        to exceed $20,000 per selected veteran or civilian internee.\n            (2) An equal share of the amounts received as contributions \n        under subsection (e).\n    (g) Rebuttable Presumption of Eligibility.--An application for \ncompensation submitted under this section by or on behalf of an \nindividual seeking recognition as a selected veteran or civilian \ninternee under this section is subject to a rebuttable presumption that \nthe individual is a selected veteran or civilian internee if the \napplication on its face provides information sufficient to establish \nthe individual as a selected veteran or civilian internee.\n    (h) Relationship to Other Payments.--Any amount paid a selected \nveteran or civilian internee as compensation under this section is in \naddition to any other amount paid to the selected veteran or civilian \ninternee under any other provision of law as compensation for the \nperformance of slave labor during World War II.\n    (i) Unavailability for Payment of Attorney Fees in Class Action \nSuits.--Amounts paid under this section may not be used for the payment \nof attorney fees incurred in any class action law suit seeking the \npayment of compensation for members of the Armed Forces and civilian \nemployees of the United States captured by Japan and used as slave \nlabor during World War II or a similar payment as a result of the \nperformance of slave labor during World War II.\n    (j) Sense of Congress Regarding Contributions by Certain Japanese \nCorporations.--\n            (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n        the Japanese corporations specified in paragraph (2) that \n        benefitted from the use of captured members of the Armed Forces \n        and civilian employees of the United States as slave labor \n        during World War II should make contributions under subsection \n        (e) for the provision of compensation to each living selected \n        veteran or civilian internee under this section.\n            (2) List of covered companies.--The Japanese corporations \n        known to have used captured members of the Armed Forces and \n        civilian employees of the United States as slave labor during \n        World War II are Asano Dockyard; Electric-Chemical Company; \n        Fujinagara Shipbuilding, Kobe; Furukawa Mining, Omine Machi; \n        Hitachi Shipbuilding; Hokkai Electric Chemical; Hokkaido Coal \n        (Sorachi Mining Co.); Imperial Special Copper Works, Noetsu; \n        Ishihara Industries, Narumi; Kajima Coal, Ohnoura; Kawaminami \n        Shipbuilding, Yahata; Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Kobe; \n        Kinkaseki Copper Mine, Formosa; Kobe Stevedore, Kobe; Kumagai \n        Enggr.
