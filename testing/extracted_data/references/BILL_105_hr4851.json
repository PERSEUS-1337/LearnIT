FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Iran remains the world's leading sponsor of \n        international terrorism and is on the Department of State's \n        list of countries that provide support for acts of \n        international terrorism.\n            (2) Iran has repeatedly called for the destruction of \n        Israel and Iran supports organizations, such as Hizballah, \n        Hamas, and the Palestine Islamic Jihad, which are responsible \n        for terrorist attacks against Israel.\n            (3) Iranian officials have stated their intent to complete \n        at least three nuclear power plants by 2015 and are currently \n        working to complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant located on \n        the Persian Gulf coast.\n            (4) The United States has publicly opposed the completion \n        of reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant because the \n        transfer of civilian nuclear technology and training could help \n        to advance Iran's nuclear weapons program.\n            (5) In an April 1997 hearing before the Subcommittee on \n        Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs of the Committee on \n        Foreign Relations of the Senate, the former Director of the \n        Central Intelligence Agency, James Woolsey, stated that through \n        the operation of the nuclear power reactor at the Bushehr \n        nuclear power plant, Iran will develop substantial expertise \n        relevant to the development of nuclear weapons.\n            (6) Construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant was \n        halted following the 1979 revolution in Iran because the former \n        West Germany refused to assist in the completion the plant due \n        to concerns that completion of the plant could provide Iran \n        with expertise and technology which could advance Iran's \n        nuclear weapons program.\n            (7) Iran is building up its offensive military capacity in \n        other areas as evidenced by its recent testing of engines for \n        ballistic missiles capable of carrying 2,200 pound warheads \n        more than 800 miles, within range of strategic targets in \n        Israel.\n            (8) In January 1995 Iran signed a $780,000,000 contract \n        with the Russian Federation for Atomic Energy (MINATOM) to \n        complete a VVER-1000 pressurized-light water reactor at the \n        Bushehr nuclear power plant.\n            (9) In March of 1998, Russia confirmed its intention to \n        complete work on the two reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power \n        plant and agreed in principle to the construction of two more \n        reactors at the Bushehr site.\n            (10) At least one reactor could be operational within a few \n        years and it would subsequently provide Iran with substantial \n        expertise to advance its nuclear weapons program.\n            (11) Iran ranks tenth among the 105 nations receiving \n        assistance from the technical cooperation program of the \n        International Atomic Energy Agency.\n            (12) Between 1995 and 1999, the International Atomic Energy \n        Agency has provided and is expected to provide a total of \n        $1,550,000 through its Technical Assistance and Cooperation \n        Fund for the Iranian nuclear power program, including reactors \n        at the Bushehr nuclear power plant.\n            (13) The United States provides annual contributions to the \n        International Atomic Energy Agency which total more than 25 \n        percent of the annual assessed budget of the Agency and the \n        United States also provides annual voluntary contributions to \n        the Technical Assistance and Cooperation Fund of the Agency \n        which total approximately 32 percent ($16,000,000 in 1996) of \n        the annual budget of the program.\n            (14) The United States should not voluntarily provide \n        funding for the completion of nuclear power reactors which \n        could provide Iran with substantial expertise to advance its \n        nuclear weapons program and potentially pose a threat to the \n        United States or its allies.\n            (15) Iran has no need for nuclear energy because of its \n        immense oil and natural gas reserves which are equivalent to \n        9.3 percent of the world's reserves and Iran has 73,000,000,000 \n        cubic feet of natural gas, an amount second only to the natural \n        gas reserves of Russia.\n\nSEC. 3. WITHHOLDING OF VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL \n              ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY FOR PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS IN IRAN.\n\n    Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2227) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Notwithstanding subsection (c), the limitations of subsection \n(a) shall apply to programs and projects of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency in Iran, unless the Secretary of State makes a \ndetermination in writing to the Committee on International Relations of \nthe House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of \nthe Senate pursuant to section 4(a)(1) of the Iran Nuclear \nProliferation Prevention Act of 1998, that such programs and projects \nare consistent with United States nuclear nonproliferation and safety \ngoals and will not provide Iran with training or expertise relevant to \nthe development of nuclear weapons.''.\n\nSEC. 4. ANNUAL REVIEW BY SECRETARY OF STATE OF PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS OF \n              THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY; UNITED STATES \n              OPPOSITION TO PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS OF THE AGENCY IN \n              IRAN.\n\n    (a) Annual Review.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of State shall undertake a \n        comprehensive annual review of all programs and projects of the \n        International Atomic Energy Agency in the countries described \n        in section 307(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n        U.S.C. 2227(a)) and shall determine if such programs and \n        projects are consistent with United States nuclear \n        nonproliferation and safety goals.\n            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act and on an annual basis thereafter for 5 \n        years, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the Congress a \n        report containing the results of the review under paragraph \n        (1).\n    (b) Opposition to Certain Programs and Projects of International \nAtomic Energy Agency.--The Secretary of State shall direct the United \nStates representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency to \noppose programs of the Agency that are determined by the Secretary \nunder the review conducted under subsection (a)(1) to be inconsistent \nwith nuclear nonproliferation and safety goals of the United States.\n\nSEC. 5.
