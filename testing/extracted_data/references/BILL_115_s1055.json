FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) On August 28, 2016, Archbishop of Manila Luis Antonio \n        Cardinal Tagle said, in response to the extrajudicial killings \n        in the Philippines, ``I know that the big issue nowadays is the \n        recent spate of killings--which, they say, afflicts even those \n        not guilty, the innocent--but whether a person is guilty or \n        not, life should be cared for and respected.''.\n            (2) The Department of State's 2017 Human Rights Report, \n        released on March 3, 2017--\n                    (A) states that ``police and unknown vigilantes \n                have killed more than 6,000 suspected drug dealers and \n                users'' in the Philippines between July and December \n                2016, a period during which extrajudicial killings \n                ``increased sharply''; and\n                    (B) chronicles the environment for extrajudicial \n                killings allegedly undertaken by vigilantes, security \n                forces, and insurgents and the ``apparent governmental \n                disregard for human rights and due process; and a weak \n                and overburdened criminal justice system''.\n            (3) On January 31, 2017, Amnesty International reported, \n        ``Since President Rodrigo Duterte took office in June 2016, \n        there has been a relentless campaign of violence against \n        alleged drug offenders, incited by the President and his \n        administration. More than 7,000 people have been killed, \n        roughly one-third during formal police operations and the rest \n        by unknown shooters who often arrive masked and on motorbike to \n        kill specific people.''.\n            (4) Human Rights Watch has reported that since President \n        Duterte took office, police and unidentified gunmen together \n        have killed more than 7,000 suspected drug users and dealers, \n        with police officials themselves claiming to have killed almost \n        3,000 in ``encounters'' with supposed drug sellers or users. \n        The police have attributed 3,271 other killings to \n        ``vigilantes'' and drug gangs, although Human Rights Watch \n        research suggests that many of these cases may also entail \n        police and police agent involvement in extrajudicial \n        executions.\n            (5) On February 14, 2017, national police chief Ronald Dela \n        Rosa announced that he was suspending anti-narcotics operations \n        after a South Korean businessman was killed at national police \n        headquarters.\n            (6) On February 23, 2017, an arrest warrant was issued \n        against Philippines Senator Leila de Lima for alleged \n        involvement in drug trafficking. The prosecution of de Lima \n        came following her repeated criticism of the Duterte \n        administration for its conduct of the drug war, her holding of \n        Senate hearings where alleged former members of a death squad \n        testified that Duterte participated in extrajudicial killings \n        in Davao City when he was mayor, and repeated threats against \n        her from Duterte and his allies.\n            (7) On December 16, 2016, Reuters reported, ``China isn't \n        only a source of meth expertise--it is also the biggest source \n        of the meth and of the precursor chemicals used to produce the \n        synthetic drug that are being smuggled into the Philippines, \n        according to local drug enforcement officials. `It's safe to \n        say that the majority of the meth we have comes from China,' \n        said Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency spokesman Derrick \n        Carreon.''.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY STATEMENTS.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to reaffirm its commitment and support for the \n        Philippines, including the longstanding United States policy \n        regarding Article V of the United States-Philippines Mutual \n        Defense Treaty, signed at Washington August 30, 1951 (3 UST \n        3947);\n            (2) to work with the Philippines to promote economic growth \n        and development through--\n                    (A) programs such as the Partnership for Growth, \n                which seeks to strengthen regulatory quality, fiscal \n                management, and human capacity development in the \n                Philippines; and\n                    (B) other appropriate bilateral and multilateral \n                economic development and trade initiatives;\n            (3) to work with the Philippines to support a public health \n        approach to substance abuse, drug addiction, and the illegal \n        use of narcotics utilizing comprehensive, voluntary, and \n        community-based treatment and rehabilitation programs in line \n        with international standards;\n            (4) to support the people of the Philippines in their \n        efforts--\n                    (A) to strengthen the rule of law and anti-\n                corruption measures;\n                    (B) to further effective judicial and legal \n                institutions; and\n                    (C) to promote human rights and civil society.\n            (5) to expand opportunities for more robust cooperative \n        security assistance programs, particularly programs involving \n        maritime security and maritime domain awareness;\n            (6) to pursue and coordinate robust cooperative security \n        assistance programs for capacity building of the Philippines to \n        establish a credible defense posture, and to support counter-\n        terrorism and maritime law enforcement;\n            (7) to coordinate closely on the implementation of the \n        Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, a mutually beneficial \n        agreement that will--\n                    (A) enhance the United States ability to provide \n                rapid humanitarian assistance; and\n                    (B) help build capacity for the modernization of \n                the Armed Forces of the Philippines;\n            (8) to enhance military-to-military cooperation and inter-\n        operability through joint exercises, capacity-building, and \n        intelligence sharing and support work to establish a robust \n        information security program, which will lead to achieving a \n        General Security of Military Information Agreement; and\n            (9) to enhance cybersecurity cooperation between the United \n        States and the Philippines.\n\nSEC. 4.
