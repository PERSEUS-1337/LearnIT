FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The development of uterine fibroids is a common and \n        significant health problem, affecting women of all ages, racial \n        backgrounds, and socioeconomic levels.\n            (2) It has been estimated that between 20 and 30 percent of \n        women of reproductive age have uterine fibroids, though not all \n        have been diagnosed. Studies indicate the prevalence could be \n        much higher.\n            (3) Symptomatic uterine fibroids can cause heavy bleeding, \n        pain, and reproductive problems, including infertility. There \n        is no known cause of uterine fibroids.\n            (4) Uterine fibroids are the most common indication for \n        hysterectomy, accounting for approximately one-third of \n        hysterectomies, or 200,000 procedures annually.\n            (5) African American women are 2 to 3 times more likely to \n        develop uterine fibroids than women of other racial groups.\n            (6) The estimated annual charges for inpatient care for \n        uterine fibroids totaled more than $2,000,000,000 in 1997.\n            (7) The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found a \n        ``remarkable lack of high quality evidence supporting the \n        effectiveness of most interventions for symptomatic fibroids''.\n\nSEC. 3.
