FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Canine detection teams, which consist of a canine and a \n        canine handler, are an important part of a layered homeland \n        security system to prepare for, respond to, mitigate against, \n        and prevent acts of terrorism.\n            (2) Canine detection teams can be deployed quickly and can \n        move easily throughout a variety of areas, including mass \n        transit systems, airports, cargo areas, sea ports, the Nation's \n        borders, ports of entry, office buildings, and stadiums.\n            (3) Canine detection teams can be trained to detect a \n        variety of items, such as explosives, narcotics, concealed \n        humans, cadavers, and chemical and biological materials.\n            (4) Canine detection teams can be utilized in situations \n        where detection technologies are unavailable, immobile, or not \n        cost-effective.\n            (5) There is a shortage of canine detection teams available \n        to assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel \n        as they put their lives at risk daily to protect the Nation.\n            (6) The Congress has authorized 2,000 new Border Patrol \n        agents for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2010 without a \n        corresponding increase in the number of detection canines \n        deployed with these Border Patrol agents.\n            (7) Canine detection teams have been deployed to the \n        Nation's busiest airports. However, the Transportation Security \n        Administration must increase the capacity of its canine \n        training program in order to train and deploy canines to the \n        Nation's mass transit systems.\n            (8) Urban search and rescue canines and cadaver detection \n        canines were used effectively in the Gulf Coast region to \n        respond to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n            (9) The Bureau of United States Customs and Border \n        Protection, the United States Secret Service, the Coast Guard, \n        and the Federal Protective Service regularly use canine \n        detection teams to secure National Special Security Events, \n        protect Federal buildings and their occupants, and protect the \n        Nation's sea ports.\n            (10) State, local, and tribal agencies and the private \n        sector rely on canine detection teams for security purposes, \n        like the Federal Government. In the absence of national \n        training and certification standards, there have been a number \n        of fraudulent operations and the use of inadequately trained \n        canines and canine handlers. In one documented case, in 2003, a \n        Virginia man, Russell Lee Ebersole, supplied explosive \n        detection canine teams to several government agencies, \n        including the Federal Reserve Board, that failed explosives \n        detection tests on five different occasions.\n            (11) The Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and \n        Oversight of the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n        Representatives held a hearing on September 28, 2005, regarding \n        the use of canine detection teams in support of homeland \n        security activities. At the hearing, Subcommittee Members were \n        informed by several Federal agencies, a local transit police \n        department, a private canine security company, and a \n        university-based canine training center that--\n                    (A) there is a shortage of trained canine detection \n                teams;\n                    (B) there is a need for a national canine detection \n                team training standard, or multiple standards, in order \n                to strengthen the quality of canine detection teams and \n                their interchangeability among Federal, State, and \n                local agencies and the private sector; and\n                    (C) there is a demonstrated need for Federal \n                leadership to ensure that certifying entities are \n                qualified and that they do not inappropriately certify \n                canine detection teams that may put homeland security \n                and public safety at risk.\n\nSEC. 3. CANINE DETECTION TEAM AUGMENTATION AND CERTIFICATION.\n\n    (a) Increasing the Number of Trained Canine Detection Teams.--\n            (1) Increase.--In each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011, \n        the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, subject to the \n        availability of appropriations for such purpose, increase the \n        number of trained canine detection teams of the Department over \n        the number of such teams deployed or available on the last day \n        of the preceding fiscal year as follows:\n                    (A) Customs and border protection.--An increase of \n                not less than 25 percent the number of trained canine \n                detection teams deployed at and between the Nation's \n                ports of entry.\n                    (B) Transportation security administration.--\n                Increase by not less than 25 percent the number of \n                trained detection canines deployed at the Nation's \n                airports and mass transit systems.\n                    (C) Coast guard, united states secret service, \n                federal protective service, and federal emergency \n                management agency.--Increase by not less than 25 \n                percent the number of trained canine detection teams \n                available to Coast Guard stations, Secret Service \n                operations, and Federal Protective Service operations \n                across the country, and to the Federal Emergency \n                Management Agency to ensure their availability as \n                needed in emergencies.\n            (2) Notification of congress.--If the Secretary determines \n        that an agency referred to in subsection (a) is unable to \n        achieve the increase required under subsection (a) for such \n        reasons as cost or availability, the Secretary shall notify the \n        Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives \n        and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n        of the Senate, describing the reasons why the agency is unable \n        to achieve the increase.\n    (b) Coordination, Enhancement, and Improvement of Canine Detection \nTeams.--\n            (1) In general.--The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is \n        amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                 ``TITLE XIX--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n                  ``Subtitle A--Canine Detection Teams\n\n``SEC. 1901.
