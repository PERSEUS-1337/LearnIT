FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Colonias are found in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and \n        California and are composed of families with very low incomes \n        and usually lack basic services such as clean and abundant \n        water, roads, sewer systems, schools, and law enforcement.\n            (2) Across the Southwest there are approximately 3,000 \n        Colonias with nearly three quarters of a million people living \n        in these communities.\n            (3) Improving the living situation within Colonias is not \n        limited to fixing basic infrastructure but must also include \n        spurring economic growth.\n            (4) Studies have found that the unemployment rate in \n        Colonias was upwards of 60 percent.\n            (5) The average yearly salary of people living in these \n        communities is less than $10,000, well below the Nation's \n        poverty line.\n            (6) Many Colonias residents cannot find year-round work due \n        to the seasonal nature of their primary occupations--fieldwork \n        represents 29.5 percent of their jobs, construction work 24.4 \n        percent, and factory work, 14.9 percent.\n            (7) The Small Business Development Center program has been \n        proven to be a cost effective solution to providing the \n        resources and technical assistance needed to grow existing \n        businesses and to start new enterprises.\n            (8) Business counseling and technical assistance is \n        critical in Colonias where similar services are in short supply \n        and are costly.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To stimulate economic development in Colonias.\n            (2) To assist in the creation of new small businesses \n        located in Colonias and expand existing ones.\n            (3) To provide management, technical, and research \n        assistance to entrepreneurs located in Colonias.\n            (4) To ensure that residents of Colonias have full access \n        to existing business counseling and technical assistance \n        available through the Small Business Development Center \n        program.\n\nSEC. 3.
