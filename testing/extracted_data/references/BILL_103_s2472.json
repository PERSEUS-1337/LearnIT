FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) as of the date of enactment of this Act, approximately \n        $140,000,000,000 per year, over 2 percent of the annual gross \n        national product of the United States, is being spent on \n        environmental compliance, and the amount being spent is \n        expected to rise substantially;\n            (2) unfunded Federal environmental mandates are straining \n        the budgets of State and local governments and may diminish the \n        financial resources available for other important public \n        programs and services;\n            (3) an environmental risk assessment developed by the \n        Environmental Protection Agency is often perceived as not \n        containing sufficient scientific objectivity, absence of bias, \n        clarity, or consistency to serve as a sound and credible basis \n        for protecting public health and safety, determining \n        environmental protection needs and priorities, making \n        regulatory decisions, or allocating limited financial \n        resources; and\n            (4) Executive Order No. 12866 (5 U.S.C. 601 note; relating \n        to regulatory planning and review) requires a decision by a \n        Federal agency to be based on the best reasonably obtainable \n        scientific and technical information, and embodies the \n        principle of openness in government.\n\nSEC. 3. RISK ASSESSMENT PRINCIPLES.\n\n    In accordance with this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency (referred to in this Act as the ``Administrator'') \nshall develop rules, proposed rules, and review procedures that provide \nthat--\n            (1) risk assessments shall be--\n                    (A) consistent;\n                    (B) of high technical quality;\n                    (C) scientifically objective; and\n                    (D) unbiased; and\n            (2) significant uncertainties regarding facts, scientific \n        knowledge, the validity of analytical techniques, or numerical \n        risk estimates are clearly disclosed in terms readily \n        understandable to the public.\n\nSEC. 4. PROPOSED RULES.\n\n    (a) Proposed General Rules.--Not later than 180 days after the date \nof enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall issue, in accordance \nwith section 3, proposed rules that--\n            (1) set forth uniform general procedures governing risk \n        assessments conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency; \n        and\n            (2) incorporate, to the extent the Administrator considers \n        advisable, relevant guidelines existing prior to the issuance \n        of the proposed rules.\n    (b) Distinctive Approaches, Techniques, or Methodologies.--\n            (1) Proposed distinctive rules.--Not later than 1 year \n        after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator \n        shall issue, in accordance with section 3, proposed rules to \n        govern use of a distinctive type of risk assessment approach, \n        technique, or methodology. The rules shall specify the minimum \n        standard for a risk assessment approach that is appropriate for \n        the scale of the problem to be assessed, the level of \n        scientific understanding, and the available data.\n            (2) Use of distinctive approaches, techniques, or \n        methodologies.--In accordance with section 3, the Administrator \n        shall determine the distinctive types of risk assessment \n        approaches, techniques, or methodologies for which a proposed \n        rule will be issued pursuant to paragraph (1). The \n        Administrator shall include risk assessment approaches, \n        techniques, or methodologies that utilize epidemiological data. \n        In the case of an approach, a technique, or a methodology not \n        in use prior to the date of enactment of this Act, the \n        Administrator shall develop rules to govern the distinctive use \n        of the approach, technique, or methodology before using the \n        approach, technique, or methodology in a risk assessment.\n\nSEC. 5.
