FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Leading legal scholars concur that conflicts between \n        same-sex marriage and religious liberty are real and should be \n        legislatively addressed.\n            (2) As the President stated in response to the decision of \n        the Supreme Court on the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013, \n        ``Americans hold a wide range of views'' on the issue of same-\n        sex marriage, and ``maintaining our Nation's commitment to \n        religious freedom'' is ``vital''.\n            (3) Nevertheless, in 2015, when asked whether a religious \n        school could lose its tax-exempt status for opposing same-sex \n        marriage, the Solicitor General of the United States \n        represented to the United States Supreme Court that ``[i]t's \n        certainly going to be an issue''.\n            (4) Protecting religious freedom from Government intrusion \n        is a Government interest of the highest order. Legislatively \n        enacted measures advance this interest by remedying, deterring, \n        and preventing Government interference with religious exercise \n        in a way that complements the protections mandated by the First \n        Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n            (5) Laws that protect the free exercise of religious \n        beliefs and moral convictions about marriage will encourage \n        private citizens and institutions to demonstrate tolerance for \n        those beliefs and convictions and therefore contribute to a \n        more respectful, diverse, and peaceful society.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND MORAL \n              CONVICTIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nFederal Government shall not take any discriminatory action against a \nperson, wholly or partially on the basis that such person believes or \nacts in accordance with a religious belief or moral conviction that \nmarriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one \nwoman, or that sexual relations are properly reserved to such a \nmarriage.\n    (b) Discriminatory Action Defined.--As used in subsection (a), a \ndiscriminatory action means any action taken by the Federal Government \nto--\n            (1) alter in any way the Federal tax treatment of, or cause \n        any tax, penalty, or payment to be assessed against, or deny, \n        delay, or revoke an exemption from taxation under section \n        501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of, any person \n        referred to in subsection (a);\n            (2) disallow a deduction for Federal tax purposes of any \n        charitable contribution made to or by such person;\n            (3) withhold, reduce, exclude, terminate, or otherwise deny \n        any Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative \n        agreement, loan, license, certification, accreditation, \n        employment, or other similar position or status from or to such \n        person;\n            (4) withhold, reduce, exclude, terminate, or otherwise deny \n        any benefit under a Federal benefit program from or to such \n        person; or\n            (5) otherwise discriminate against such person.\n    (c) Accreditation; Licensure; Certification.--The Federal \nGovernment shall consider accredited, licensed, or certified for \npurposes of Federal law any person that would be accredited, licensed, \nor certified, respectively, for such purposes but for a determination \nagainst such person wholly or partially on the basis that the person \nbelieves or acts in accordance with a religious belief or moral \nconviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one \nman and one woman, or that sexual relations are properly reserved to \nsuch a marriage.\n\nSEC. 4.
