PURPOSE, DEFINITIONS AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create a mechanism for \nthe settlement of Spanish and Mexican land grant claims in New Mexico \nas claimed under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.\n    (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Treaty of guadalupe-hidalog.--The term ``Treaty of \n        Guadalupe-Hidalogo'' means the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, \n        Limits, and Settlement (Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo), between \n        the United States and the Republic of Mexico, signed February \n        2, 1848 (TS 207; 9 Bevans 791);\n            (2) Community land grant.--The term ``community land \n        grant'' means a village, town, settlement, or pueblo consisting \n        of land held in common (accompanied by lesser private \n        allotments) by three or more families under a grant from the \n        King of Spain (or his representative) before the effective date \n        of the Treaty of Cordova, August 24, 1821, or from the \n        authorities of the Republic of Mexico before May 30, 1848, in \n        what became the State of new Mexico, regardless of the original \n        character of the grant.\n            (3) Land grant claim.--The term ``land grant claim'' means \n        a claim of title to land by a community land grant under the \n        terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.\n            (4) Eligible descendants.--The term ``eligible descendant'' \n        means a descendant of a person who--\n                    (A) was a Mexican citizen before the Treaty of \n                Guadalupe-Hidalgo;\n                    (B) was a member of a community land grant; and\n                    (C) became a United States citizen within ten years \n                after the effective date of the Treaty of Guadalupe-\n                Hidalgo, May 30, 1848, pursuant to the terms of the \n                Treaty.\n            (5) Settlement committee.--The term ``settlement \n        committee'' refers to committee, or one of the county specific \n        subcommittees as appropriate, authorized in Section 3 of this \n        Act.\n            (6) Reconstituted.--The term ``reconstituted,'' with regard \n        to a valid community land grant, means restoration to full \n        status as a municipality with rights properly belonging to a \n        municipality under State law, including the nontaxability of \n        municipal property (common lands) and the right of local self-\n        government.\n    (c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) New Mexico has a unique and complex history regarding \n        land ownership due to the substantial number of Spanish and \n        Mexican land grants that were an integral part of the \n        colonization of New Mexico before the United States acquired \n        the area in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.\n            (2) Under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, \n        these land grant claims were recognized as valid property \n        claims under United States law.\n            (3) Several studies, including the New Mexico Land Grant \n        Series published by the University of New Mexico, have \n        documented that the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in regards to \n        these land grant claims in New Mexico was never well \n        implemented. Whether because of a lack of knowledge of Spanish \n        land law on the part of the judicial system in the then new \n        Territory of New Mexico, whether because of inadequate or \n        conflicting documentation of these claims, or whether it was \n        due to sharp legal practices, many of the former citizens of \n        Mexico, and then new citizens of the United States, lost title \n        to lands that had been guaranteed to them by treaty.\n            (4) Following the United States war with Mexico, the \n        economy of the Territory of New Mexico was dependent on the use \n        of land resources, and that held true for much of this century \n        as well. When the land grant claimants lost title to their \n        land, the predominantly Hispanic communities in northern New \n        Mexico lost a keystone to their economy. The effects of this \n        loss have had long lasting economic consequences and are in \n        part the cause that these communities remain some of the \n        poorest in the United States.\n            (5) The history of the implementation of the Treaty of \n        Guadalupe-Hidalgo has been a source of continuing controversy \n        for generations and has left a lingering sense of injustice in \n        the communities in northern New Mexico, which has periodically \n        led to armed conflicts.\n            (6) The Government of the United States has an obligation \n        to try to find an equitable remedy for the inadequate \n        implementation of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo and the \n        consequences that has had on the communities and people of New \n        Mexico. This should be done as expeditiously as possible. \n        However, reconstructing the one hundred and fifty year history \n        of land title claims and transfers in these communities is \n        likely to prove lengthy and costly. In some cases it may never \n        be possible to adequately reconstruct the title history.\n            (7) The Secretary of the Interior has had an experience in \n        administratively developing settlement packages to resolve \n        large and complex Tribal water rights claims as an alternative \n        to lengthy and expensive litigation. This experience may be \n        invaluable in resolving the large, complex, and sometimes \n        conflicting Spanish and Mexican land grant claims in northern \n        New Mexico.\n            (8) The history of colonial Spanish America, the system of \n        land distribution under Spanish and Mexican law, and the \n        subsequent impacts to that system following the transfer of \n        territory from Mexico to the United States under the Treaty of \n        Guadalupe-Hidalgo is a requisite body of knowledge in \n        determining an appropriate settlement of land grant claims. It \n        is also an integral part of the national history and culture of \n        the United States of America and, as such, deserves formal \nrecognition and interpretation by our institutions of historical \npreservation.\n\nSEC. 3. CREATION OF SETTLEMENT COMMITTEES.\n\n    (a) Within one hundred and eighty (180) days of enactment of this \nAct, the Secretary of the Interior working through the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Secretary of \nAgriculture working through the Forest Service are hereby authorized \nand directed to establish a ``Settlement Committee'' to develop \ncomprehensive settlements for land grant claims on a county by county \nbasis.\n    (b) The Settlement Committee will be comprised of separate \nsubcommittees for each county in which there are land grant claims in \nNew Mexico.\n    (c) Each county subcommittee shall by comprised of seven members \nincluding:\n            (1) a representative of the Secretary of the Interior;\n            (2) a representative of the Secretary of Agriculture;\n            (3) a representative of the State Commissioner of Public \n        Lands; and\n            (4) four residents of the particular county in question. \n        The four county representatives are to be appointed their \n        county commissions: Provided, That in counties with federally \n        recognized Native American Indian Tribes that at least one \n        county representative shall be an enrolled member of a tribe \n        whose reservation pueblo boundaries come within that county: \n        Provided further, That at least one county representative shall \n        be an eligible descendent who is not an enrolled member of a \n        Native American Indian Tribe.\n    (d) Each member shall be appointed for the life of the Settlement \nCommittee. A vacancy in the Settlement Committee shall be filled in the \nmanner in which the original appointment was made.\n\nSEC. 4.

REVIEW AND SETTLEMENT PACKAGE.\n\n    (a) The settlement committee for each county shall review all of \nthe submitted claims in the county and, based on the documentation at \nits disposal, make an initial determination concerning their potential \nvalidity including: possible past conveyances, the accuracy of the \nboundaries of the land claimed, and the number of eligible heirs \naffected.\n    (b) Upon completing this review, the settlement committee shall \ndevelop a proposed settlement package in satisfaction of land grant \nclaims within that county. In creating the settlement package, the \nsettlement committee shall take into account: the degree of certainty \nwith which it has determined that various claims are valid, the \nimpacts, including economic and social impacts, that any unfulfilled \nland grant claims may have had on the communities within that county, \nthe relative benefits of various settlement options on those \ncommunities, and whether there is a legal entity that can accept \nsettlement. The elements of a proposed settlement package may include, \nbut are not limited to:\n            (1) restoration of lands to a given land grant community or \n        communities;\n            (2) reconstitution of a given land grant community or \n        communities;\n            (3) the setting aside of certain lands for communal use for \n        fuel wood, building materials, hunting, recreation, etc. These \n        lands could be set aside as special managerial units within \n        existing Federal land management agencies or transferred to \n        local county, tribal, or municipal, governments;\n            (4) trust funds for scholarships or home and business \n        loans; or\n            (5) land for commercial use with the proceeds to be \n        deposited into the trust funds.\n    (c) The settlement committee shall complete its review and proposed \nsettlement package within three years of the deadline for submission of \nland grant claims under this Act, and submit them in a report to the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, and to the House Resources Committee.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE SETTLEMENT COMMITTEE.\n\n    (a) To complete its tasks the settlement committee may use a \nvariety of methods to gather information and to build community \nconsensus on the form of a proposed settlement package, including: the \nuse of town meetings, holding formal hearings, the solicitation of \nwritten comments, and the use of mediators trained in alternative \ndispute resolution methods. The settlement committee is also authorized \nto hire consultants as it may choose for historical, economic, and \nlegal analysis. In its efforts to develop a consensus on a settlement \npackage, the Settlement Committee is not subject to the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act (Public Law 92-462; 5 U.S.C. Ap. 2 Sec. 1).\n    (b) Gifts, Bequests, and Devises.--The Settlement Committee may \naccept, use, and dispose of gifts, bequests, or devises of services or \nproperty, both real and personal, for the purpose of aiding or \nfacilitating the work of the Settlement Committee.
