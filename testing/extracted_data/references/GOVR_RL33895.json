    "content": "Researching current federal legislation includes identifying action on pending or passed legislation and locating the relevant documents or text. Analysis, discussion, or media coverage of pending or passed legislation also has a role in the legislative research process. Such research may be accomplished by using governmental, congressional, or commercial services. Congress.g ov http://www.congress.gov Congress.gov provides Members of Congress, their staff, and the general public access to a wide variety of information, including bill summary and status, bill text, committee referrals and committee reports, sponsors and cosponsors, and Congressional Record text. A version of a bill or resolution will typically appear in Congress.gov a day or two after it is introduced or has had action on the floor of the House or Senate. The text of bills is published by the Government Publishing Office (GPO) and sent to the Library of Congress at various times throughout the day. For an estimate as to when GPO will publish a bill, contact the GPO Congressional Desk for House bill versions at 202-512-0224 or Senate Bill Clerk for Senate bill versions at 202-224-2118. Note that the bill number may not determine the chamber for the most recent version\u2014for example, \"H.R. 1792 RS\" is a Senate version (RS=Reported in Senate) of a House bill. Guidance in the use of Congress.gov is available at http://www.congress.gov/help . The Congress.gov Alert Service is available to anyone who wants to obtain email alerts regarding action on bills and amendments for subjects that they identify. Once established, alerts run automatically and generate emails Monday through Friday when there is new information. To learn more about alerts and how to create them, a brief video is available at https://www.congress.gov/help/tips/managing-alerts . Congressional Record https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CREC and available via Congress.gov at http://www.congress.gov . Action on legislation passed or pending in the current Congress, and its status in the legislative process, is reported in the Congressional Record. The Record also contains the edited transcript of activities on the floor of the House and Senate. It is the primary source for the text of floor debates and the official source for recorded votes. The Record is published each day that one or both chambers are in session, except in instances when two or more consecutive issues are printed together.  The Record 's Daily Digest section summarizes action in each chamber and identifies committee hearings, new public laws, official foreign travel reports, procedural agreements, Senate unanimous consent agreements, treaties and nominations actions, and committee meetings scheduled for the next legislative day.  Indexes for the Record are issued twice a month. The Subject Index section can be used to identify bills by topic, and the History of Bills and Resolutions section tracks action on all legislation. Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CPD Published by the Office of the Federal Register, the Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents (and its predecessor, the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents ) provides the dates on which the President signed or vetoed legislation.

Regulations are issued by federal departments and agencies under the authority delegated to them by federal law. Final rules are printed in the Federal Register (FR) and later codified by subject in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) . Code of Federal Regulations http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR The CFR codifies final rules having general applicability and legal effect that first appeared in the F ederal R egister . CFR titles are arranged by subject, and the entire CFR is revised annually (one-quarter of the titles at a time) in January, April, July, and October. Because the annual revision incorporates new regulations and drops superseded ones, the CFR reflects regulations in effect at the time of printing. An index volume that includes tables accompanies the set. By using the FR and CFR sources, with their many finding aids, it is possible to identify existing regulations in a subject area or those that pertain to a specific title and section of the United States Code , identify regulations issued pursuant to a specific public law, and find proposed regulations that are not yet final. The Electronic Code of Federal Regulations, https://www.ecfr.gov (e-CFR), is the current, updated version of the CFR . However, it is not an official legal edition of the CFR , but an unofficial editorial compilation of CFR material and FR amendments produced by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register (OFR) and GPO. The OFR updates the e-CFR daily. Federal Register http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=FR The FR contains the official announcement of regulations and legal notices issued by federal departments and agencies. It includes proposed and final federal regulations having general applicability and legal effect; executive orders and presidential proclamations; documents required to be published by an act of Congress; and other federal documents of public interest. Daily and monthly indexes and an accompanying publication, \"List of CFR Sections Affected,\" aid in its use. The FR also publishes the \"Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions\" twice yearly (usually in April and October). This document provides advance notice of proposed rulemaking by listing all rules and proposed rules that more than 60 federal departments, agencies, and commissions expect to issue during the next six months. Regulations that concern the military or foreign affairs, or that deal with agency personnel, organization, or management matters, are excluded. The agenda is available online from 1994 through the present. govinfo.gov https://govinfo.gov See entry under \"Researching Current Federal Legislation\u2014 Governmental Sources \" above.
