FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The fishes and other marine species that are associated \n        with 3-dimensional structurally complex seafloor habitats \n        within the exclusive economic zone of the United States--\n                    (A) constitute valuable and renewable natural \n                resources;\n                    (B) are an essential component of marine \n                biodiversity;\n                    (C) contribute to the food supply, economy, and \n                health of the United States;\n                    (D) support the economies of coastal communities; \n                and\n                    (E) provide recreational opportunities.\n            (2) Commercial and recreational fishing constitute major \n        sources of employment and contribute significantly to the \n        economy of the United States.\n            (3) The United States is dependent upon healthy and diverse \n        ocean ecosystems for income, nutrition, medicines, raw \n        materials, and valuable natural processes.\n            (4) Diverse types of sponges, deep-sea corals, and other \n        species are found in marine habitats, many of which have not \n        been adequately studied for their potential benefit to society \n        or their ecological importance to fish species and other forms \n        of marine life.\n            (5) Habitat complexity and marine biodiversity created by \n        geologic structures and structure-forming organisms on the \n        seabed are essential to numerous fish species, including \n        commercially and recreationally harvested species, that rely on \n        them for food and shelter from predation.\n            (6) Bottom trawling reduces habitat complexity and \n        biological diversity by smoothing geologic bedforms and by \n        removing, crushing, burying, and exposing benthic organisms to \n        predators and scavengers.\n            (7) The reduction of biodiversity caused by bottom trawling \n        is detrimental to many commercially and recreationally \n        important species and to the industries and people that depend \n        on them.\n            (8) In the past, the practice of bottom trawling was \n        conducted mainly on soft bottom areas, and was rarely used in \n        three-dimensional, structurally complex habitats.\n            (9) Technological modifications to bottom trawls, including \n        the creation of large rockhopper and roller gear and chafing \n        gear, facilitate the use of bottom trawls in rocky and other \n        complex marine habitats that were once refuges for fishes and \n        other marine life.\n            (10) The expansion in the use of bottom trawls from soft \n        bottom areas to three-dimensional, structurally complex \n        habitats over the past 20 years has had and continues to have \n        significant, adverse effects on the diversity and habitat \n        complexity of these areas.\n            (11) Numerous scientific studies show that bottom trawling \n        is especially damaging to three-dimensional, structurally \n        complex habitats such as corals, boulder fields, sponge beds, \n        and gravel bottoms.\n            (12) Bottom trawling in these habitats significantly \n        reduces their value for economically and ecologically important \n        fishes and other marine life. Reductions in structural \n        complexity may be long-term and irreversible. Recovery of some \n        of these areas to their natural state after a single pass of a \n        trawl may take decades or centuries. With repeated trawling in \n        the same area, the damage may be irreversible.\n            (13) Prohibiting the use of large rockhopper, roller, and \n        other groundgear is a practical, precautionary, and enforceable \n        measure to protect structurally complex, benthic marine \n        habitats from the damaging effects of bottom trawling.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF LARGE ROCKHOPPER AND ROLLER GEAR ON \n              BOTTOM TRAWL NETS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to prevent bottom \ntrawls from accessing and damaging three-dimensional, structurally \ncomplex marine habitats that are needed by commercially and \nrecreationally important fishes and other marine life for food and \nshelter from predation.\n    (b) Prohibition.--Section 307 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``or'' after the semicolon at the end of \n        paragraph (1);\n            (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (1)(P) \n        and inserting ``; or''; and\n            (3) by inserting after paragraph (1)(P) the following:\n                    ``(Q) to use a bottom trawl with rollers, bobbins, \n                tires, rockhoppers, or any other devices attached to \n                the foot rope of the trawl net that are in excess of 8 \n                inches in diameter for fishing that is subject to the \n                jurisdiction of the United States, including fishing by \n                a vessel of the United States beyond the equivalent of \n                the exclusive economic zone of all countries.''.\n    (c) Rebuttable Presumption.--Section 310(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(4) For purposes of this Act, it shall be a rebuttable \npresumption that any vessel that is shoreward of the outer boundary of \nthe exclusive economic zone or beyond the equivalent zone of all \ncountries, and that has on board gear comprised of a trawl net with \nrollers, bobbins, tires, rockhoppers, or any other devices attached to \nthe foot rope of the trawl net that are in excess of 8 inches in \ndiameter, is engaged in fishing using such gear.''."
