    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Consequences in Sentencing for Young \nOffenders Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The juvenile justice system in this country is built \n        around an outdated philosophy that places the goal of \n        rehabilitation above community safety concerns.\n            (2) Violent juvenile crime is increasing at a rate that is \n        double that for adults, and few juveniles are held accountable \n        for their offenses.\n            (3) Many juvenile justice programs do not collect data or \n        analyze whether sanctions or treatment programs now in use are \n        effective in reducing recidivism.\n            (4) The Federal Government should encourage the States to \n        pursue new juvenile justice policies that emphasize community \n        safety, individual accountability, work, restitution to \n        victims, parental involvement, and zero-tolerance for repeated \n        criminal acts.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Act are as follows:\n            (1) To provide States with an incentive to establish a \n        system of graduated sanctions for juvenile delinquents with \n        sentencing options ranging from restitution and community \n        service to youth correctional facilities to remand to adult \n        court for older violent juvenile offenders. If a juvenile \n        continues to commit offenses, he or she will move up a ladder \n        of increasing consequences.\n            (2) To promote parental involvement and responsibility in \n        the juvenile justice system.\n            (3) To provide incentives for States to develop periodic \n        evaluations of the effectiveness of their juvenile justice \n        systems in keeping communities safe and working to reduce rates \n        of juvenile recidivism.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS FOR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES.\n\n    The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is \namended--\n            (1) in section 20101(a), by inserting ``adult and \n        juvenile'' before ``correctional facilities'' each place it \n        appears;\n            (2) in section 20103(b)(2), by adding at the end: ``In \n        making allocations under this paragraph, the Attorney General \n        shall give a preference to States that provide assurances to \n        the Attorney General that such States have in effect graduated \n        sanctions for the State's juvenile justice system.''; and\n            (3) in section 20102(b)(2), by striking ``shall transfer'' \n        and all that follows through ``paragraph (1).'' and inserting \n        ``shall--\n                    ``(A) make grants from a portion, determined by the \n                Attorney General, of any funds made available to carry \n                out this section that are not allocated to an eligible \n                State under paragraph (1), to a State or States that \n                provide assurances to the Attorney General that such \n                State or States have in effect graduated sanctions, for \n                the construction, development, expansion, modification, \n                operation, or improvement of juvenile facilities; and\n                    ``(B) transfer to the funds to be allocated under \n                section 20103(b)(1) any remainder of the funds so made \n                available but not allocated under paragraph (1) or used \n                for grants under subparagraph (A).''\n\nSEC. 4. OPTIONAL USE OF GRANTS FOR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) Use of Grant Money.--A State, or States organized as multi-\nState compact, may opt to use any Federal grant money allocated to such \nState or States for adult correctional facilities to construct, \ndevelop, expand, modify, operate, or improve youth correctional \nfacilities, such as secure youth correctional facilities, youth \nacademies, juvenile boot camps, and restitution centers, which provide \nthe State with a range of dispositional options and promote reduced \nrecidivism.\n    (b) Eligibility.--To be eligible to opt to use grant money in the \nmanner provided in subsection (a), the State or States shall submit an \napplication to the Attorney General which includes, at a minimum--\n            (1) assurances that--\n                    (A) the State or States has established or is in \n                the process of establishing a system of graduated \n                sanctions for the State's juvenile justice system in \n                which the State bases dispositions for juveniles on a \n                scale of increasingly severe sanctions for the \n                commission of a repeat offense, particularly if the \n                subsequent offense committed by such juvenile is of \n                similar or greater seriousness or if a court \n                dispositional order for a delinquent act is violated;\n                    (B) such dispositions should, to the extent \n                practicable, require the juvenile delinquent to \n                compensate victims for losses and compensates the \n                juvenile justice authorities for supervision costs;\n            (2) assurances that the State or States imposes a sanction \n        on each juvenile adjudicated delinquent;\n            (3) assurances that the State or States requires that a \n        State court concur in allowing a juvenile to be sent to a \n        diversionary program in lieu of juvenile court proceedings;\n            (4) assurances that the State or States has programs that \n        address the need for effective bindover systems or for the \n        prosecution as adults of juveniles, 15 years of age or older, \n        who are charged with a crime of violence as defined in section \n        16 of title 18, United States Code;\n            (5) assurances that where practicable and appropriate, the \n        State or States requires parents to participate in meeting the \n        dispositional requirements imposed on the juvenile by the \n        court;\n            (6) assurances that the State or States has consulted with \n        any units of local government responsible for youth secure \n        facilities in setting priorities for construction, development, \n        expansion and modification, operation or improvement of \n        juvenile facilities, and to the extent practicable, ensures \n        that the needs of entities currently administering juvenile \n        facilities are addressed; and\n            (7) assurances that the State or States have in place or \n        are putting in place systems to provide objective evaluations \n        of State and local juvenile justice systems to determine such \n        systems' effectiveness in protecting the community, reducing \n        recidivism, and ensuring compliance with dispositions.\n\nSEC. 5.
