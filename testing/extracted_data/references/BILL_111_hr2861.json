The rule shall further \n        require that issuers shall not agree to indemnify or limit the \n        liability of compensation advisers or advisory firms.\n            ``(2) Determination.--In determining the extent to which an \n        adviser or advisory firm is independent of an issuer within the \n        meaning of this section, the Commission shall consider such \n        matters as--\n                    ``(A) the extent (as measured by annual fees and \n                other relevant metrics) to which an individual adviser \n                or advisory firm provides services in conjunction with \n                negotiating employment contracts or compensation \n                agreements with the issuer's executives, as compared to \n                other services that the adviser or advisory firm \n                provides to the issuer or executives;\n                    ``(B) whether individual advisers are permitted to \n                hold equity and do hold equity in the issuer; and\n                    ``(C) whether an advisory firm's incentive \n                compensation plan links the compensation of individual \n                advisers to the advisory firm's provision of other \n                services to the issuer.\n    ``(c) Clawbacks of Unearned Performance-Based Pay.--\n            ``(1) Commission rules.--Not later than 270 days after the \n        date of enactment of this section, the Commission shall, by \n        rule, direct the national securities exchanges and national \n        securities associations to prohibit the listing of any security \n        of an issuer that is not in compliance with the requirements of \n        any portion of paragraph (2). Such rules shall provide for \n        appropriate procedures for an issuer to have an opportunity to \n        cure any defects that would be the basis for such a prohibition \n        before the imposition of such prohibition.\n            ``(2) Recoupment of unearned compensation.--An issuer's \n        board of directors or a committee thereof shall develop and \n        disclose a policy for reviewing unearned bonus payments, \n        incentive payments, or equity payments that were awarded to \n        executive officers owing to fraud, financial results that \n        require restatement, or some other cause. The policy should \n        require recovery or cancellation of any unearned payments to \n        the extent that it is feasible and practical to do so.\n            ``(3) Exception.--This provision shall not apply to any \n        issuer who is subject to a similar recoupment requirement under \n        another provision of Federal law.\n    ``(d) Severance Agreements Tied to Performance.--\n            ``(1) Commission rules.--Not later than 270 days after the \n        date of enactment of this section, the Commission shall, by \n        rule, direct the national securities exchanges and national \n        securities associations to prohibit the listing of any security \n        of an issuer that is not in compliance with the requirements of \n        any portion of paragraph (2).

To the extent that an issuer is able to terminate a \n        senior executive officer for cause, poor performance by the \n        executive, as determined by the board of directors, shall be \n        considered as one such cause. The rule shall be implemented \n        with due regard for contracts in existence on the date of \n        enactment of this section.\n    ``(e) Improved Disclosure of Compensation Targets.--Not later than \n1 year after the date of enactment of this section, the Commission \nshall, by rule, require additional disclosure of specific performance \ntargets that are used by issuers to determine a senior executive \nofficer's eligibility for bonuses, equity and incentive compensation. \nThe Commission shall consider methods to improve disclosure in \nsituations when it is claimed that disclosure would result in \ncompetitive harm to the issuer, including, requirements that the issuer \ndescribe its past experience with similar target levels, disclose any \ninconsistencies between compensation targets and targets set in other \ncontexts, submit a request for confidential treatment of the \nperformance targets under Commission rules, or disclose the data after \ndisclosure would no longer be considered competitively harmful.''."
