FINDINGS AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Fragmentation of property rights on certain lands \n        within and adjacent to the Superior National Forest in \n        Minnesota hampers the ability of private mineral owners to \n        utilize their mineral rights and the ability of the Forest \n        Service to manage associated forested areas.\n            (2) The United States primarily owns the surface rights in \n        the lands described in section 3, subject to reserved and \n        outstanding mineral rights.\n            (3) The public interest in selling the federally owned \n        lands described in section 3 outweighs the interest served by \n        maintaining such lands under Federal ownership.\n            (4) The sale of some Federal surface and subsurface rights \n        in lands under this Act will facilitate mining in the areas \n        described in section 3, improving the economy of the United \n        States by providing employment and needed mineral resources.\n            (5) Minnesota and the Army Corps of Engineers, in \n        cooperation with the Forest Service, are preparing an \n        environmental impact statement for proposed mining operations \n        by Poly Met Mining, Inc., on and adjacent to the lands \n        authorized for conveyance by this Act, and the scope of the \n        environmental impact statement is more fully described in a \n        Federal Register notice dated July 1, 2005 (70 Fed. Reg. \n        38122).\n            (6) Proceeds from the sale of lands authorized by this Act \n        will be used by the Forest Service to purchase desirable \n        private inholdings within and adjacent to the Superior National \n        Forest.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``lands'' includes interests in lands.\n            (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture.\n            (3) The term ``surface mining'' means the excavation of \n        lands for the purposes of obtaining minerals, including \n        excavation methods such as contour, strip, auger, open pit, and \n        area mining.\n\nSEC. 3.
