FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On January 24, 2013, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta \n        and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey \n        rescinded the 1994 Direct Ground Combat Definition and \n        Assignment Rule and directed the Armed Forces to open closed \n        occupations, positions, and units to female members of the \n        Armed Forces no later than January 1, 2016.\n            (2) The rescission of the 1994 policy was based on the \n        knowledge that success in the Armed Forces results solely from \n        a member's ability, qualifications, and performance, and the \n        decision to rescind the policy is consistent with America's \n        values and enhances military readiness.\n            (3) The change in policy is reflective of the ``on the \n        ground'' reality that female members of the Armed Forces, \n        particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, have been serving in \n        combat.\n            (4) A directive from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n        Staff requires the development, review, and validation of \n        gender-neutral occupational standards ``reflecting the \n        knowledge, skills and abilities necessary for each occupation'' \n        to be used to assess and assign members not later than \n        September 2015.\n            (5) There are concerns in regards to the lack of \n        transparency and the type of research the Armed Forces are \n        planning and pursuing in opening closed occupations, positions, \n        and units to female members of the Armed Forces.\n            (6) The largest number of closed occupations, positions, \n        and units are in the Army and Marine Corps. The Department of \n        Defense announced its intention, pursuant to the January 2013 \n        Directives, to open for assignment of female members of the \n        Armed Forces thousands of previously closed positions and \n        units, but thousands of positions and units remain closed \n        female members of the Armed Forces.\n\nSEC. 3.
