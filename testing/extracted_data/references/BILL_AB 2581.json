    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Corinthian Colleges, Inc., was the target of consumer and taxpayer protection enforcement efforts by the federal government, the Attorney General, and other state and federal authorities.\n(b) Based on findings of harm to students enrolled at Corinthian Colleges campuses, the United States Department of Education announced debt relief programs to assist students, including all of the following:\n(1) A student who attended a Corinthian Colleges campus that closed on April 27, 2015, and withdrew any time after June 20, 2014, is eligible to apply for a closed school loan discharge, so long as the student does not transfer earned credit and subsequently\ncomplete\ncompletes\na comparable program at another institution.\n(2) A student who believes he or she was a victim of fraud or other violations of state law by Corinthian Colleges can apply for debt relief under borrower defense to repayment. The United States Department of Education has determined that Corinthian Colleges misrepresented job placement rates for a majority of programs at its Heald College campuses between 2010 and 2014, and California Everest College and WyoTech campuses between 2010 and 2013, and is in the process of establishing a specific process for federal loan discharge for these students.\n(3) A Corinthian Colleges student who intends to submit a borrower defense claim may request loan forbearance while a claims review process is established and his or her claim is reviewed.\n(c) On March 25, 2016, the United States Department of Education announced the approval of 6,838 of the 11,740 closed school loan discharge claims and approval of 2,048 of the approximately 11,000 borrower defense to repayment loan forgiveness claims received. Rough estimates place the number of students with eligibility to file a closed school loan discharge or defense to repayment claim at over 350,000 students.\n(d) According to testimony provided at the November 10, 2015, advisory committee meeting, the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education staff indicated that Corinthian Colleges students have largely needed assistance in working with loan servicers to secure a closed school loan discharge and in applying to the United States Department of Education for loan forgiveness based on borrower defense to repayment. According to that testimony, the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education at that time had one employee responsible for assisting the hundreds of thousands of California students eligible for loan forgiveness and tuition recovery.\n(e) Without assistance, evidence shows that only a small fraction of students eligible for tuition recovery or federal loan discharge will file a claim.\n(f) Pursuant to Section 94923, the Student Tuition Recovery Fund exists to relieve or mitigate a student\u2019s economic loss caused by a documented violation of certain laws or by institutional closure, as specified.\n(g) It is consistent with the purpose of the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to provide assistance to Corinthian Colleges students to obtain federal and private loan discharge and other financial aid relief.\n(h) It is the intent of the Legislature that unencumbered restitution funds awarded to the state from a lawsuit involving Corinthian Colleges and its affiliate institutions, including Heald College, be used to repay any funds provided to students pursuant to this act.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 69433.61 is added to the Education Code, to read:\n69433.61.\n(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a student who was enrolled and received a Cal Grant award in the 2013\u201314 or 2014\u201315 academic year at a California campus of Heald College, and was unable to complete an educational program offered by the campus due to the campus\u2019 closure on April 27, 2015, shall not have the award years used at a Heald College campus considered for purposes of the limitation on the number of years of Cal Grant award eligibility. This restoration of award years for Cal Grant eligibility shall not exceed two years.\n(b) A student shall be eligible for the restoration of award years if the student was enrolled at a campus of Heald College on April 27, 2015, or withdrew from enrollment between July 1, 2014, and April 27, 2015. The Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education shall provide the commission with information, if available, to confirm student enrollment for purposes of this section.\n(c) An eligible student shall, before July 1, 2018, notify the commission of his or her intent to use the restoration of award years provided under this section and to enroll in an institution eligible for initial and renewal Cal Grant awards to be eligible for that restoration.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 69999.19 is added to the Education Code, to read:\n69999.19.\n(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a student who was enrolled and received a California National Guard Education Assistance Award in the 2013\u201314 or 2014\u201315 academic year at a California campus of Heald College, and was unable to complete an educational program offered by the campus due to the campus\u2019 closure on April 27, 2015, shall not have the award years used at a Heald College campus considered for purposes of the limitation on the number of years of California National Guard Education Assistance Award eligibility. This restoration of award years for California National Guard Education Assistance Award eligibility shall not exceed two years.\n(b) A student shall be eligible for the restoration of award years if the student was enrolled at a campus of Heald College on April 27, 2015, or withdrew from enrollment between July 1, 2014, and April 27, 2015.

This consideration shall be provided at the discretion of the state agency in accordance with its public protection mandate and applicable criteria established by the agency for consumer safety.\n(b) A state agency, as specified in subdivision (a), may require coursework or passage of a California law and ethics examination, if not already required, to ensure that the potential licensee is versed in the most recent and relevant state laws applicable to the license.\nSEC. 5.\nSection 94926.5 is added to the Education Code, to read:\n94926.5.\n(a) Upon appropriation by the Legislature from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund, in response to the student harm caused by the practices and unlawful closure of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., grant funds shall be timely provided in accordance with this section to eligible nonprofit community service organizations to assist the eligible students of that closed institution by relieving or mitigating the economic and educational opportunity loss incurred by those students.\n(b) (1) \u2002 The terms and conditions of the grant agreements shall ensure that grant funds are used for the exclusive purpose of assisting eligible students with federal and private loan discharge and other financial aid relief, and that students eligible to claim recovery through the Student Tuition Recovery Fund are referred to the bureau for assistance with claim processing.\n(2) This subdivision is not intended to prohibit a nonprofit community service organization from using grant funds to screen student requests for assistance in order to determine if a student meets assistance eligibility requirements.\n(c) Services provided by eligible nonprofit community service organizations may include, but are not to be limited to, outreach and education, screening requests for assistance, referring students for additional legal assistance through pro bono referral programs, and legal services.\n(d) For purposes of this section, an \u201celigible nonprofit community service organization\u201d is an organization that satisfies all of the following conditions:\n(1) The organization is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization in good standing with the Internal Revenue Service and in compliance with all applicable laws and requirements.\n(2) The organization demonstrates expertise in assisting students with, and currently provides free direct legal services to students for, or will work in partnership\nwith\nwith,\nor under the supervision\nof\nof,\nan attorney or a nonprofit legal services organization that has demonstrated expertise in assisting students with, student loan and tuition recovery-related matters.\n(3) The organization does not charge students for services, including services provided pursuant to this section.\n(e) For purposes of this section, an \u201celigible student\u201d is a student who was enrolled at a California campus of, or a California student who was enrolled in an online campus of, a Corinthian Colleges institution, and who has been screened by the nonprofit community service organization and determined to be eligible for debt relief from the United States Department of Education or other student financial aid relief.\n(f) (1) \u2002 The bureau shall notify the Attorney General of all unlawful Corinthian Colleges closures within 15 days of the effective date of this section.\n(2) The notification shall include the name and location of the school, the programs, and the number of students affected at each site of the school, as appropriate.

Any unused funds shall be returned to the Attorney General for return to the Student Tuition Recovery Fund, except that, upon the approval of the Attorney General, an eligible nonprofit community service organization may expend those unused funds to provide assistance to students who were enrolled at an institution approved to operate by the bureau and who were harmed by the unlawful closure of that institution. The Attorney General, or a contracted qualified entity, may terminate the grant agreement for material breach, and may require repayment of funds provided to the nonprofit community service organization during the time that the agreement was being materially breached. However, the Attorney General, or a qualified entity, shall provide the grantee with written notice of the breach and a reasonable opportunity of not less than 30 days to resolve the breach.\n(h) An eligible nonprofit community service organization that receives a grant may give priority to low-income students if demand exceeds available grant funds.
