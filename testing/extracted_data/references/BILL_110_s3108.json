FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Hunger and undernutrition are political conditions that \n        can be solved.\n            (2) Access to healthy food and good nutrition should be a \n        fundamental right of all Americans.\n            (3) Nearly 40 years have passed since the United States \n        convened a White House conference to comprehensively address \n        the issues of food, hunger, health, and nutrition in America.\n            (4) More than 35,500,000 Americans live in households that \n        face a constant struggle against hunger, 12,600,000 of whom are \n        children and 5,000,000 of whom are seniors, the disabled, and \n        the critically ill.\n            (5) The Government spends more than $55,000,000,000 every \n        year responding to the concurrent epidemics of hunger and \n        undernutrition, yet the number of Americans facing hunger \n        continues to grow and our Nation's nutritional health is \n        declining.\n            (6) Conservative cost estimates show that the true cost of \n        hunger and illness related to undernutrition in America is at \n        least $90,000,000,000 a year, more than half of which is paid \n        by Medicare and Medicaid.\n            (7) Appropriate food and nutrition can save the United \n        States billions of dollars in health care costs by preventing \n        or delaying the progression to late-stage disease for tens of \n        millions of Americans who live with chronic diseases, such as \n        diabetes, HIV, AIDS, and heart disease. The costs of the \n        effects and treatments of those diseases are significantly \n        exacerbated by hunger, food insecurity, and undernutrition.\n            (8) A national discussion of the root causes of hunger, \n        food insecurity, and undernutrition, as well as identification \n        of solutions to these epidemics, can lead to action to \n        implement such solutions and to end hunger in America.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF THE CONFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Authority To Call Conference.--Not later than December 31, \n2010, the President shall call the White House Conference on Food and \nNutrition (in this Act referred to as the ``Conference'') to be \nconvened not later than 18 months after the selection of the Policy \nCommittee established in section 4, in order to make fundamental policy \nrecommendations on ways to end hunger and to improve nutrition in the \nUnited States and to implement the purposes set forth in subsection \n(c).\n    (b) Planning and Direction.--The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of the \nTreasury (in this Act referred to as the ``Cochairs'') shall plan, \nconduct, and convene the Conference, in consultation with the Surgeon \nGeneral.\n    (c) Purposes of the Conference.--The purposes of the Conference are \nto--\n            (1) identify viable solutions for ending hunger in the \n        United States;\n            (2) review the current structure, scope, and effectiveness \n        of existing legislation and programs at the Federal, State, and \n        local levels that provide for the nutritional needs of food-\n        insecure people living in the United States;\n            (3) determine the extent to which current Federal, State, \n        and local programs that provide for the nutritional health of \n        Americans can better use available resources and ensure greater \n        coordination among such programs;\n            (4) identify new ways to utilize the abundant agricultural \n        resources of the United States to meet the nutritional needs of \n        all Americans;\n            (5) highlight emerging and innovative programs from the \n        public and private sectors, including community-based and \n        faith-based organizations that effectively address the \n        nutrition needs of vulnerable Americans and recommend such \n        programs as can be reasonably and cost-effectively replicated;\n            (6) identify opportunities for effective partnerships \n        between the Government, industry, labor, healthcare, and the \n        nonprofit sectors to fight hunger in the United States;\n            (7) explore the possibility of creating a Federal office \n        within the Department of Agriculture to oversee the Nation's \n        response to persistent and widespread hunger and food \n        insecurity, to include the oversight and coordination of all \n        Federal, State, and local antihunger programs;\n            (8) bring public attention to the more than 35,500,000 \n        people living in the United States that face a constant \n        struggle against hunger, food insecurity, and inadequate \n        nutrition;\n            (9) illustrate the medical, developmental, and educational \n        impact of hunger, food insecurity, and inadequate nutrition, \n        and the potential savings to the United States health care \n        system, educational system, and other sectors when appropriate \n        food is available to the critically and chronically ill;\n            (10) build understanding of the true cost of hunger in the \n        United States, to include lost wages, diminished stamina, \n        reduced capacity to learn, and the impact of despair; and\n            (11) build understanding that the ever-burgeoning dual \n        epidemic of hunger and undernutrition is a matter of national \n        security.\n\nSEC. 4.
