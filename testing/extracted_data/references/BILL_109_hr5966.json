FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the September 7, 2005, report to the \n        United Nations General Assembly by the Special Representative \n        of the Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflict, ``In \n        the last decade, two million children have been killed in \n        situations of armed conflict, while six million children have \n        been permanently disabled or injured. Over 250,000 children \n        continue to be exploited as child soldiers and tens of \n        thousands of girls are being subjected to rape and other forms \n        of sexual violence.''.\n            (2) According to the Center for Emerging Threats and \n        Opportunities (CETO), Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, \n        ``The Child Soldier Phenomenon has become a post-Cold War \n        epidemic that has proliferated to every continent with the \n        exception of Antarctica and Australia.''.\n            (3) Many of the children currently serving in armed forces \n        or paramilitaries were forcibly conscripted through kidnapping \n        or coercion, while others joined military units due to economic \n        necessity, to avenge the loss of a family member, or for their \n        own personal safety.\n            (4) Some military and militia commanders force child \n        soldiers to commit gruesome acts of ritual killings or torture, \n        including acts of violence, against other children.\n            (5) Many female child soldiers face the additional \n        psychological and physical horrors of rape and sexual abuse, \n        enslavement for sexual purposes by militia commanders, and \n        severe social stigma should they return home.\n            (6) Some military and militia commanders target children \n        for recruitment because of their psychological immaturity and \n        vulnerability to manipulation and indoctrination. Children are \n        often separated from their families in order to foster \n        dependence on military units and leaders. Consequently, many of \n        these children suffer from deep trauma and are in need of \n        psychological counseling and rehabilitation.\n            (7) Child soldiers are exposed to hazardous conditions and \n        are at risk of physical injury and disability, psychological \n        trauma, sexually transmitted diseases, respiratory and skin \n        infections, and often death.\n            (8) On May 25, 2000, the United Nations adopted and opened \n        for signature, ratification, and accession the Optional \n        Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the \n        Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, which establishes 18 \n        as the minimum age for conscription, forced recruitment, or \n        direct participation in hostilities.\n            (9) On June 18, 2002, the Senate unanimously approved the \n        resolution advising and consenting to the ratification of the \n        Optional Protocol.\n            (10) On December 23, 2002, the United States presented the \n        ratified optional protocol to the United Nations.\n            (11) One hundred and six governments worldwide have \n        ratified the optional protocol, establishing a clear \n        international norm prohibiting the use of children in combat.\n            (12) It is in the national and security interests of the \n        United States to reduce the chances that members of the United \n        States Armed Forces will be forced to encounter children in \n        combat situations.\n            (13) Section 502B(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n        1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304(a)(3)) provides that ``the President is \n        directed to formulate and conduct international security \n        assistance programs of the United States in a manner which will \n        promote and advance human rights and avoid identification of \n        the United States, through such programs, with governments \n        which deny to their people internationally recognized human \n        rights and fundamental freedoms, in violation of international \n        law or in contravention of the policy of the United States as \n        expressed in this section or otherwise.''.\n\nSEC. 3. CHILD SOLDIER DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``child soldier'' means--\n            (1) any person under the age of 18 years old who is--\n                    (A) forcibly recruited or conscripted--\n                            (i) to serve in any type of regular or \n                        irregular armed force or armed group in any \n                        capacity, including in a support role such as \n                        cook, porter, or messenger; or\n                            (ii) to accompany such a force or group, \n                        other than as a direct family member; or\n                    (B) serving in hostilities as part of a regular \n                armed force or armed group; and\n            (2) any person under the age of 16 years old serving in any \n        capacity as part of a regular or irregular armed force or armed \n        group.\n\nSEC. 4.
