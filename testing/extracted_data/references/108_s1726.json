    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Prematurity Research Expansion and \nEducation for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act'' or the ``PREEMIE \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Premature birth is a serious and growing problem. The \n        rate of preterm birth increased 27 percent between 1981 and \n        2001 (from 9.4 percent to 11.9 percent). In 2001, more than \n        476,000 babies were born prematurely in the United States.\n            (2) Preterm birth accounts for 23 percent of deaths in the \n        first month of life.\n            (3) Premature infants are 14 times more likely to die in \n        the first year of life.\n            (4) Premature babies who survive may suffer lifelong \n        consequences, including cerebral palsy, mental retardation, \n        chronic lung disease, and vision and hearing loss.\n            (5) Preterm and low birthweight birth is a significant \n        financial burden in health care. The estimated charges for \n        hospital stays for infants with any diagnosis of prematurity/\n        low birthweight were $11,900,000,000 in 2000. The average \n        lifetime medical costs of a premature baby are conservatively \n        estimated at $500,000.\n            (6) The proportion of preterm infants born to African-\n        American mothers (17.3 percent) was significantly higher \n        compared to the rate of infants born to white mothers (10.6 \n        percent). Prematurity or low birthweight is the leading cause \n        of death for African-American infants.\n            (7) The cause of approximately half of all premature births \n        is unknown.\n            (8) Women who smoke during pregnancy are twice as likely as \n        nonsmokers to give birth to a low birthweight baby. Babies born \n        to smokers weigh, on average, 200 grams less than nonsmokers' \n        babies.\n            (9) To reduce the rates of preterm labor and delivery more \n        research is needed on the underlying causes of preterm \n        delivery, the development of treatments for prevention of \n        preterm birth, and treatments improving outcomes for infants \n        born preterm.\n    (b) Purposes.--It the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) reduce rates of preterm labor and delivery;\n            (2) work toward an evidence-based standard of care for \n        pregnant women at risk of preterm labor or other serious \n        complications, and for infants born preterm and at a low \n        birthweight; and\n            (3) reduce infant mortality and disabilities caused by \n        prematurity.\n\nSEC. 3.
