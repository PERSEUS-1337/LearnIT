GRANTS AUTHORIZED.\n\n    The Attorney General is authorized to award grants to rural police \ndepartments to--\n            (1) enable those departments to gain access to the various \n        crime-fighting, investigatory, and information sharing \n        resources available on the Internet; and\n            (2) reimburse rural police department officials and members \n        for the cost of computer equipment or Internet access.\n\nSEC. 4. USE OF FUNDS.\n\n    Grants awarded under this Act may be used--\n            (1) for the purchase of new or upgraded computer hardware \n        or software;\n            (2) to pay for Internet access; and\n            (3) to reimburse rural police departments that have paid \n        for computer equipment or Internet access out of the funds of \n        the department or department official or members, for some or \n        all of the costs associated with those purchases, as determined \n        by the Attorney General.\n\nSEC. 5. APPLICATION.\n\n    Each eligible rural police department that desires a grant under \nthis Act shall submit an application to the Attorney General at such \ntime, in such manner, and accompanied by such information as the \nAttorney General may reasonably require.\n\nSEC. 6. GRANT PROGRAM CRITERIA.\n\n    (a) In General.--In awarding a grant under this Act, the Attorney \nGeneral shall--\n            (1) set criteria for determining which police departments \n        are currently underserved by crime-fighting, investigatory, or \n        information-sharing technologies available on the Internet, by \n        differentiating between police departments that do not have \n        Internet access, and those departments that have access but are \n        using outmoded, obsolete, or otherwise inadequate technology; \n        and\n            (2) determine what would constitute the minimum feasible \n        package of technologies required to enable those police \n        departments to use existing crime-fighting, investigatory, and \n        information-sharing technologies.\n    (b) Grant Limitations.--The Attorney General shall set limits for \nmaximum annual grants, based on determinations made under subsection \n(a), for rural police departments that do not have Internet access, and \nfor those that do have access but are using inadequate technology.\n\nSEC. 7. POLICE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE DESK.\n\n    The Attorney General shall establish a Police Department Technology \nAssistance Desk to offer advice to chiefs of police in rural police \ndepartments regarding--\n            (1) the types of products to buy in order to achieve not \n        less than a minimum level of Internet service to access \n        existing crime-fighting, investigatory, and information-sharing \n        technologies; and\n            (2) technology upgrades for those police departments in \n        possession of outmoded or obsolete technology;\n            (3) preferred vendors; and\n            (4) any other information the Attorney General determines \n        to be necessary.\n\nSEC. 8. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    The General Accounting Office, in consultation with the Attorney \nGeneral, shall annually report to Congress on the concentration of \npolice departments in the country that have Internet access, with \nparticular emphasis on the number and percentage of rural police \ndepartments that lack Internet access, especially high-speed Internet \naccess.\n\nSEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There is authorized to be appropriated $500,000,000 for each of \nfiscal years 2002 through 2007 to carry out this Act."
