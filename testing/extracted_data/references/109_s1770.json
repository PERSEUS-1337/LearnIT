    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Hurricane Katrina Fast-Track Refunds \nfor Working Families Act of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) An estimated 1.3 million households were affected by \n        Hurricane Katrina, many of which were working families left \n        with no material belongings and minimal assets following the \n        storm.\n            (2) It will be difficult for these working families to \n        immediately find new employment opportunities and to restore \n        lost wages, thus depleting their resources for food, housing, \n        clothing, and other necessities.\n            (3) These working families can be expected to spend their \n        fast-tracked tax refunds on immediate necessities which will \n        stimulate local economic activity.\n            (4) These families have worked hard, earned their Child Tax \n        Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit refunds and should receive \n        them now rather than later.\n\nSEC. 3.
