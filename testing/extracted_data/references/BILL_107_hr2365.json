FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity \n        will continue to power the growing United States economy;\n            (2) an increasing use of electrotechnologies, the desire \n        for continuous environmental improvement, a more competitive \n        electricity market, and concerns about rising energy prices add \n        importance to the need for reliable, affordable, increasingly \n        clean electricity;\n            (3) coal, which, as of the date of enactment of this Act, \n        accounts for more than \\1/2\\ of all electricity generated in \n        the United States, is the most abundant fossil energy resource \n        of the United States;\n            (4) coal comprises more than 85 percent of all fossil \n        resources in the United States and exists in quantities \n        sufficient to supply the United States for 250 years at current \n        usage rates;\n            (5) investments in electricity generating facility \n        emissions control technology over the past 30 years have \n        reduced the aggregate emissions of pollutants from coal-based \n        generating facilities by 21 percent, even as coal use for \n        electricity generation has nearly tripled;\n            (6) continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental \n        performance from electricity generating facilities would allow \n        continued use of coal and preserve less abundant energy \n        resources for other energy uses;\n            (7) new technologies for converting coal into electricity \n        can effectively eliminate health-threatening emissions and \n        improve efficiency by as much as 50 percent, but initial \n        commercial deployment of new coal generation technologies \n        entails significant risk that generators may be unable to \n        accept in a newly competitive electricity market; and\n            (8) continued environmental improvement in coal-based \n        generation through continued research, development, and \n        demonstration toward an ultimate goal of near-zero emissions is \n        important and desirable.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Cost and performance goals.--The term ``cost and \n        performance goals'' means the cost and performance goals \n        established under section 4.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n\nSEC. 4.
