    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``State Infrastructure Banks for \nSchools Act of 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to a 1996 study conducted by the American \n        School & University, $10.42 billion was spent to address the \n        Nation's education infrastructure needs in 1995, with the \n        average total cost of a new high school at $15.4 million.\n            (2) According to a 1995 report to Congress by the General \n        Accounting Office, an estimated $112 billion in school repair, \n        modernization, expansion, and construction is needed.\n            (3) Approximately 14 million American students attend \n        schools which report the need for extensive repair or \n        replacement of one or more buildings.\n            (4) Academic research has proven a direct correlation \n        between the condition of school facilities and student \n        achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers found that \n        students assigned to schools in poor conditions can be expected \n        to fall 10.9 percentage points behind those in buildings in \n        excellent condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a \n        20 percent improvement in test scores when students were moved \n        from a poor facility to a new facility.\n            (5) The Director of Education and Employment Issues at the \n        Government Accounting Office testified that nearly 52 percent \n        of schools, affecting 21.3 million students, reported \n        insufficient technology elements for 6 or more areas.\n            (6) Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n        difficulties securing financing for school facility \n        improvement.\n            (7) The challenges facing our Nation's public elementary \n        and secondary schools require the concerted efforts of all \n        levels of government and all sectors of the community.\n            (8) The United States's competitive position within the \n        world economy is vulnerable if America's future workforce \n        continues to be educated in schools not equipped for the 21st \n        century.\n\nSEC. 3. STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) Cooperative agreements.--Subject to the provisions of \n        this section, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n        with the Secretary of Education, may enter into cooperative \n        agreements with States for the establishment of State \n        infrastructure banks and multistate infrastructure banks for \n        making loans to local educational agencies for building or \n        repairing elementary or secondary schools which provide free \n        public education (as such terms are defined in section 14101 of \n        the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n        8801)).\n            (2) Interstate compacts.--Congress grants consent to 2 or \n        more of the States, entering into a cooperative agreement under \n        paragraph (1) with the Secretary of the Treasury for the \n        establishment of a multistate infrastructure bank, to enter \n        into an interstate compact establishing such bank in accordance \n        with this section.\n    (b) Funding.--The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Education, shall make grants to State infrastructure \nbanks and multistate infrastructure banks in a State in a cooperative \nagreement under subsection (a)(1) to provide initial capital for loans \nprovided under this section to local educational agencies.
