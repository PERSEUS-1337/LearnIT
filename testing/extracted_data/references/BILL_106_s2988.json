PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to establish a National Commission on \nSpace that will assist the United States--\n            (1) to define the long-range needs of the Nation that may \n        be fulfilled through the peaceful uses of space;\n            (2) to maintain the Nation's preeminence in space science, \n        technology, and applications;\n            (3) to promote the peaceful exploration and utilization of \n        the space environment; and\n            (4) to articulate goals and develop options for the future \n        direction of the Nation's civilian space program in \n        coordination with commercial space activities.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the \n        lead civilian space agency, as established in the National \n        Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.), has \n        conducted a space program that has been an unparalleled \n        success, providing significant economic, social, scientific, \n        and national security benefits, and helping to maintain \n        international stability and good will;\n            (2) the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (42 \n        U.S.C. 2451 et seq.) has provided the policy framework for \n        achieving this success, and continues to be a sound statutory \n        basis for national efforts in space;\n            (3) the United States has entered an era of international \n        competition and cooperation in space, and therefore this Nation \n        must strengthen the commitment of its public and private \n        technical, financial, and institutional resources, so that the \n        United States will not lose its leadership position during the \n        coming decade;\n            (4) the private sector is a major participant in the \n        utilization of the space environment;\n            (5) the Nation continues its commitment to a permanently \n        manned space station in low Earth orbit, and future national \n        efforts in space will benefit from the presence of such a \n        station;\n            (6) the separation of the civilian and military space \n        programs is essential to ensure the continued health and \n        vitality of both; and\n            (7) the identification of long range goals and policy \n        options for the United States civilian space program through a \n        high level, representational public forum will assist the \n        President and Congress in formulating future policies for the \n        United States civilian space program.\n\nSEC. 4.
