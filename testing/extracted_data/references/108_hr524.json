FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) New Jersey was of critical importance during the \n        American Revolution due to its strategic location between the \n        British armies headquartered in New York City and the \n        Continental Congress sitting in the City of Philadelphia.\n            (2) General George Washington spent almost half of the \n        period of the American Revolution personally commanding troops \n        of the Continental Army in New Jersey including 2 severe winter \n        encampments at what is now Morristown National Historical Park, \n        a unit of the National Park System.\n            (3) It was during the 10 crucial days of the American \n        Revolution between December 25, 1776, and January 3, 1777, when \n        General Washington, after retreating across New Jersey from New \n        York City to Pennsylvania in the face of total defeat for the \n        Nation``s cause, recrossed the Delaware River on Christmas \n        night, 1776, and won crucial battles at Trenton and Princeton. \n        Thomas Paine, who accompanied the troops during the retreat, \n        described the events as, `the times that try men's souls''.\n            (4) There are situated in the State of New Jersey the sites \n        of 296 engagements including several important battles of the \n        American Revolution, which collectively are of significant \n        importance to the outcome of the overall conflict and the \n        history of the United States. Among these are National Historic \n        Landmarks including Washington's Crossing, the Old Trenton \n        Barracks, and Princeton, Monmouth and Red Bank Battlefields.\n            (5) Additional national Historic Landmarks include the \n        homes of Richard Stockton, Joseph Hewes, John Witherspoon, and \n        Francis Hopkinson, all signers of the Declaration of \n        Independence, Elias Boudinout, President of the Continental \n        Congress and William Livingston, patriot and Governor of New \n        Jersey from 1776 to 1790.\n            (6) Portions of the landscapes important to the strategies \n        of both armies including waterways, mountains, farms, wetlands, \n        villages and roadways retain integrity of the period of the \n        American Revolution and offer outstanding opportunities for \n        conservation, education, and recreation.\n            (7) The National Register of Historic Places lists 251 \n        buildings and sites in the National Park Service study area for \n        Crossroads of the American Revolution associated with the \n        period of the American Revolution.\n            (8) Civilian populations residing in New Jersey suffered \n        extreme hardships during the American Revolution due to the \n        continuous conflict within its borders, foraging armies, and \n        marauding contingents of loyalist Tories and rebel \n        sympathizers.\n            (9) Because of the important role that New Jersey played in \n        the successful outcome of the American Revolution there is a \n        Federal interest for the development of a regional framework to \n        assist the State of New Jersey, other local organizations and \n        governments, and private citizens to preserve and protect \n        natural, cultural, and historic resources of the period and to \n        bring recognition to this important heritage for the \n        educational and recreational benefit of this and future \n        generations of Americans.\n            (10) The National Park Service has conducted a National \n        Heritage Feasibility Study in the State of New Jersey that \n        demonstrates the sufficient assemblage of nationally \n        distinctive natural, cultural, and historic resources necessary \n        to establish the Crossroads of the American Revolution National \n        Heritage Area.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To build the capacity of communities, organizations, \n        and citizens in New Jersey to preserve the special historic \n        identity of the region and its importance to the Nation.\n            (2) To foster a close working relationship with all levels \n        of government, the private sector, and the local communities in \n        New Jersey.\n            (3) To provide for the management, preservation, \n        protection, and interpretation of the natural, historic, and \n        cultural resources of the region for the educational and \n        inspirational benefit of future generations.\n            (4) To strengthen the value of Morristown National \n        Historical Park as an asset to the region by establishing a \n        network of related historic resources, protected landscapes, \n        educational opportunities, and events depicting the \n        revolutionary landscape of New Jersey.\n            (5) To strengthen partnerships among Morristown National \n        Historical Park and other public and privately owned resources \n        in the heritage area, that together represent the strategic \n        fulcrum of the American Revolution, as assets in the quality of \n        life in the region.\n            (6) To authorize Federal financial and technical assistance \n        to serve these purposes.\n\nSEC. 3.
