FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that, as of the date of enactment of \nthis Act--\n            (1) fossil fuels provide more than 85 percent of all energy \n        consumed in the United States, with energy consumption \n        projected to increase for at least the next 2 decades;\n            (2) United States oil production is at a 50-year low and \n        continues to decline;\n            (3) there has not been a new oil refinery built in the \n        United States since 1976;\n            (4) oil has reached prices of over $70 per barrel and is \n        likely to remain high;\n            (5) the United States relies on foreign sources of oil for \n        approximately 60 percent of oil consumed in the United States;\n            (6) recent world events and natural disasters have shown \n        the vulnerability of the energy supply chain in the United \n        States;\n            (7) the Fischer-Tropsch technology can produce synthetic \n        fuels that burn cleaner than traditionally-produced fuels, by \n        using abundant domestic coal resources;\n            (8) the coal reserves of the United States are estimated to \n        be capable of producing more than 800,000,000,000 barrels of \n        oil;\n            (9) the demand of the United States military for fuel \n        products makes up 2 percent of total consumption in the United \n        States;\n            (10) increases in oil costs disproportionately impact the \n        military;\n            (11) as a matter of national security, agencies of the \n        Federal Government are eager to form partnerships with the \n        energy industry and academia to create more sources of domestic \n        energy and lessen the dependence of the United States on \n        foreign sources of oil;\n            (12) private industry is ready to commercialize the \n        Fischer-Tropsch coal-to-fuel process, but is unable to generate \n        necessary initial capital investment; and\n            (13) it is in the best public interest of the United States \n        that industry in the United States begin transformation from \n        largely foreign petroleum-based energy resources to domestic \n        coal-based resources, which are abundant.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish a Federal pilot program that will \n        encourage private investment and a commitment by businesses in \n        the United States to begin the transition to a coal-to-fuel \n        based industry relying upon Fischer-Tropsch technology; and\n            (2) at the conclusion of the pilot program, to achieve the \n        transition in a manner that is cost-neutral to the Treasury.\n\nSEC. 3.
