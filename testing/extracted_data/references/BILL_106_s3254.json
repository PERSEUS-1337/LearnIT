Anti-\n        independence militias, with the support of the Indonesian \n        military, attempted to prevent then retaliated against this \n        vote by launching a campaign of terror and violence, displacing \n        500,000 people and murdering hundreds.\n            (2) The violent campaign devastated East Timor's \n        infrastructure, destroyed or severely damaged 60 to 80 percent \n        of public and private property, and resulted in the collapse of \n        virtually all vestiges of government, public services and \n        public security.\n            (3) The Australian-led International Force for East Timor \n        (INTERFET) entered East Timor in September 1999 and \n        successfully restored order. On October 25, 1999, the United \n        Nations Transitional Administration for East Timor (UNTAET) \n        began providing overall administration of East Timor, guide the \n        people of East Timor in the establishment of a new democratic \n        government, and maintain security and order.\n            (4) UNTAET and the East Timorese leadership currently \n        anticipate that East Timor will become an independent nation as \n        early as late 2001.\n            (5) East Timor is one of the poorest places in Asia. A \n        large percentage of the population live below the poverty line, \n        only 20 percent of East Timor's population is literate, most of \n        East Timor's people remain unemployed, the annual per capita \n        Gross National Product is $340, and life expectancy is only 56 \n        years.\n            (6) The World Bank and the United Nations have estimated \n        that it will require $300,000,000 in development assistance \n        over the next three years to meet East Timor's basic \n        development needs.\n\nSEC. 3.
