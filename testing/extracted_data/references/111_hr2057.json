FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Motor vehicle owners are entitled to choose which \n        service provider will diagnose, service, maintain, or repair \n        their motor vehicles.\n            (2) Promoting competition in price and quality for the \n        diagnosis of problems, service, maintenance, and repair of \n        motor vehicles will benefit consumers.\n            (3) Regular diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair of \n        motor vehicles, motor vehicle equipment, and motor vehicle \n        systems such as pollution control, transmission, antilock \n        brakes, electronic and mechanical systems, heating and air-\n        conditioning, and steering are essential to America's mobility, \n        minimizing fuel consumption, protecting the environment, and \n        enabling the highest levels of safety possible in modern motor \n        vehicles.\n            (4) Computers of various kinds are now used by \n        manufacturers in motor vehicle equipment and motor vehicle \n        systems. On-board computer technology controls virtually all of \n        the vehicle's systems, and only service technicians with the \n        necessary tools and information can access the computers to \n        perform diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair of the \n        vehicle.\n            (5) Manufacturers have made available to their authorized \n        dealers and service providers the information, tools, codes, \n        and replacement equipment necessary to diagnose problems and to \n        service, maintain, and repair motor vehicles that incorporate \n        computers in their motor vehicle systems.\n            (6) Consumers in the United States have benefited from the \n        availability of a wide choice of service providers for their \n        motor vehicles. The American economy has also benefited from \n        the availability of an aftermarket tools and parts supply that \n        provides jobs to over 5 million workers in 495,000 businesses, \n        and generates $200 billion in annual sales.\n            (7) Vehicles are now being equipped with systems that \n        permit vehicles to communicate repair and diagnostic \n        information wirelessly with the vehicle manufacturer and repair \n        facilities. Car owners have the right to choose where and to \n        whom information generated by their vehicle and vehicle \n        computers is sent.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect motor vehicle owners' right to choose a \n        service provider for the diagnosis, service, maintenance, and \n        repair of their motor vehicles;\n            (2) to promote competition in price and quality among \n        service providers; and\n            (3) to promote safety and fuel efficiency by allowing \n        consumers to choose among competing service providers.\n\nSEC. 3.
