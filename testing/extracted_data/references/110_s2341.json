FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Research has shown that foster youths face a unique set \n        of challenges, including a lack of financial and emotional \n        support systems throughout their early adult years, as well as \n        limited educational, employment, housing, and permanency \n        options.\n            (2) When foster youths exit or age out of the foster care \n        system, foster youths often lack emotional, social, \n        professional, and financial guidance to guide foster youths \n        through the transition to adulthood.\n            (3) While Congress has passed legislation to increase \n        support for foster youths, research shows that foster youths \n        still need greater assistance supporting their transition to \n        adulthood.\n            (4) A 2005 study found that foster youths fare poorly \n        relative to their counterparts in the general population on the \n        following outcome measures:\n                    (A) Employment.\n                    (B) Education.\n                    (C) Homelessness.\n                    (D) Mental health.\n                    (E) Medical insurance coverage.\n                    (F) Criminal activity.\n                    (G) Early pregnancy.\n            (5) Nationwide, over 20,000 youth age out of foster care \n        each year.\n\nSEC. 3. INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTS FOR FOSTER YOUTH.\n\n    Section 105 of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (42 \nU.S.C. 5106) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a), by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(6) Opportunity grants to create individual development \n        accounts for foster youths.--\n                    ``(A) Grants authorized.--The Secretary may make \n                grants and enter into contracts, on a competitive \n                basis, to States to enable the States (or State \n                partners) to establish Individual Development Accounts \n                for foster youths, to be accessed by the youths when \n                the youths meet the requirements of subparagraph \n                (D)(iii).\n                    ``(B) Application and plan.--The Governor of each \n                State desiring a grant or contract under this paragraph \n                shall submit an application to the Secretary at such \n                time, in such manner, and containing such information \n                as the Secretary may require.
