    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Temporary Mortgage Assistance Loan \nAct of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) as the economy worsens and unemployment rates continue \n        to rise, a growing number of long-time homeowners are finding \n        themselves in need of emergency short-term mortgage help in the \n        event of a job loss or other crisis;\n            (2) these homeowners may not need or want a permanent \n        modification of their home loans or they may not qualify for \n        government initiatives aimed principally at subprime borrowers \n        or homeowners with exotic mortgage products; and\n            (3) low-interest emergency mortgage loans can fill this gap \n        in options for responsible homeowners in need of help and stem \n        the rising tide of foreclosures that has depressed housing \n        values across the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. TEMPORARY MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE LOANS.\n\n    (a) Authority.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (in \nthis Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall, to the extent amounts \nare made available in advance for loans under this section, make loans \nunder this section in the form of mortgage assistance payments to \nmortgagees of all or part of the monthly payments due under the \nqualified mortgages of qualified homeowners who are in default on their \nmortgages.\n    (b) Qualified Homeowners.--For purposes of this section, the term \n``qualified homeowner'' means the mortgagor under a qualified mortgage \nor mortgages--\n            (1) who is 60 days or more delinquent with respect to any \n        payment due under the qualified mortgage or mortgages;\n            (2) who, or a member of whose household who before \n        unemployment contributed significantly to the household \n        income--\n                    (A) is unemployed, which unemployment renders the \n                mortgagor temporarily unable to correct the delinquency \n                and resume full payments under the qualified mortgage \n                or mortgages;\n                    (B) has a reasonable prospect, in the determination \n                of the Secretary based on payment history prior to such \n                unemployment, education, or participation in worker \n                retraining during the period of such unemployment, for \n                obtaining employment; and\n                    (C) who has registered for and is receiving State \n                unemployment benefits;\n    (c) Qualified Mortgage and Mortgages.--\n            (1) Qualified mortgage.--For purposes of this section, the \n        term ``qualified mortgage'' means, with respect to a qualified \n        homeowner, a first mortgage that--\n                    (A) is secured by an interest on a one- to four-\n                unit residence that is the principal residence of the \n                qualified homeowner that is not subject to more than \n                one other subordinate mortgage; and\n                    (B) has an aggregate outstanding obligation that, \n                at the time of application for assistance under this \n                section, exceeds the appraised value of the residence \n                that is subject to the mortgages.\n            (2) Qualified mortgages.--The term ``qualified mortgages'' \n        means, with respect to a qualified homeowner, a qualified \n        mortgage and another subordinate mortgage secured by an \n        interest in the same residence, which mortgages have an \n        aggregate outstanding obligation that, at the time of \n        application for assistance under this section, exceeds the \n        appraised value of the residence that is subject to the \n        mortgages.\n    (d) Loans.--A loan under this section for a qualified mortgage or \nmortgages of a qualified homeowner shall--\n            (1) be in the form of monthly payments to the mortgagee or \n        servicer of the mortgage or mortgages on account of such \n        mortgage or mortgages--\n                    (A) during a period that ends upon the earlier of--\n                            (i) a determination by the Secretary, \n                        pursuant to regular periodic reviews of the \n                        financial circumstances of the household of the \n                        mortgagor, that because of changes in such \n                        financial circumstances payments are no longer \n                        necessary;
