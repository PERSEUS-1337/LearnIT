Appropriate remedies with respect to prison conditions\n    ``(a) Requirements for Relief.--\n            ``(1) Prospective relief.--Prospective relief in any civil \n        action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no \n        further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal \n        right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall \n        not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court \n        finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further \n        than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, \n        and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the \n        violation. In determining the intrusiveness of the relief, the \n        court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on \n        public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system \n        caused by the relief.\n            ``(2) Preliminary injunctive relief.--In any civil action \n        with respect to prison conditions, to the extent otherwise \n        authorized by law, the court may enter a temporary restraining \n        order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief. \n        Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the \n        date that is 90 days after its entry, unless the court makes \n        the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period.\n            ``(3) Prisoner release order.--(A) In any civil action with \n        respect to prison conditions, no prisoner release order shall \n        be entered unless--\n                    ``(i) a court has previously entered an order for \n                less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the \n                deprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied \n                through the prisoner release order; and\n                    ``(ii) the defendant has had a reasonable amount of \n                time to comply with the previous court orders.\n            ``(B) In any civil action in Federal court with respect to \n        prison conditions, a prisoner release order shall be entered \n        only by a three-judge court in accordance with section 2284 of \n        title 28, if the requirements of subparagraph (E) have been \n        met.\n            ``(C) A party seeking a prisoner release order in Federal \n        court shall file with any request for such relief, a request \n        for a three-judge court and materials sufficient to demonstrate \n        that the requirements of subparagraph (A) have been met.\n            ``(D) If the requirements under subparagraph (A) have been \n        met, a Federal judge before whom a civil action with respect to \n        prison conditions is pending who believes that a prison release \n        order should be considered may sua sponte request the convening \n        of a three-judge court to determine whether a prisoner release \n        order should be entered.\n            ``(E) The court shall enter a prisoner release order only \n        if the court finds--\n                    ``(i) by clear and convincing evidence--\n                            ``(I) that crowding is the primary cause of \n                        the violation of a Federal right;
