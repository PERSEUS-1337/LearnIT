    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``America's Commitment to Clean Water \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To reaffirm the original objective of Congress in \n        enacting the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of \n        1972 (86 Stat. 816) to restore and maintain the chemical, \n        physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.\n            (2) To reaffirm the definition of the waters of the United \n        States that are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control \n        Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) consistent with the interpretation \n        of such Act prior to the decisions of the United States Supreme \n        Court in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. United \n        States Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159 (2001), and the \n        consolidated cases of Rapanos v. United States and Carabell v. \n        United States Army Corps of Engineers, 547 U.S. 715 (2006), by \n        legislatively overturning the effect of those decisions.\n            (3) To define the term ``waters of the United States'' and \n        to protect such waters as authorized by the powers granted \n        under section 8 of article I, section 2 of article II, and \n        section 3 of article IV of the Constitution of the United \n        States and in a manner consistent with the Federal Water \n        Pollution Control Act and subsequent amendments thereto.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The decisions of the United States Supreme Court in \n        Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. United States \n        Army Corps of Engineers and the consolidated cases of Rapanos \n        v. United States and Carabell v. United States Army Corps of \n        Engineers unduly restricted the scope of the Federal Water \n        Pollution Control Act and impair the statutory protections for \n        waters of the United States contrary to the intent of Congress.\n            (2) Water is a unique and precious resource that is \n        necessary to sustain human life and the life of animals and \n        plants.\n            (3) Water is important for agriculture, transportation, \n        energy production, recreation, fishing and shellfishing, and \n        municipal and commercial uses.\n            (4) Water moves through interconnected hydrologic cycles, \n        and the pollution, degradation, or destruction of a part of an \n        aquatic system, including geographically isolated or intrastate \n        waters, can affect the chemical, physical, and biological \n        integrity of other parts of the aquatic system.\n            (5) Small and intermittent streams, including seasonal \n        streams, and their headwaters comprise the majority of all \n        stream and river miles in the conterminous United States. These \n        waters affect the introduction of pollutants to larger rivers \n        and streams, the life cycles of aquatic organisms and other \n        wildlife, and the flow of higher order streams during floods.\n            (6) The pollution, degradation, and destruction of waters \n        of the United States, individually and in the aggregate, have a \n        substantial relation to and effect on interstate commerce. \n        Discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States are \n        the result of, relate to, and are a necessary part of \n        commercial or economic activity.\n            (7) Millions of people in the United States depend on the \n        waters of the United States, including wetlands, to improve \n        water quality, recharge surface and subsurface drinking water \n        supplies, protect human health, and create commercial or \n        economic opportunity. Source water protection areas containing \n        one or more small or intermittent streams provide water to \n        public drinking water supplies that serve more than 117,000,000 \n        people in the United States.\n            (8) Millions of people in the United States enjoy \n        recreational activities that depend on the waters of the United \n        States, including wetlands, and those activities and associated \n        travel generate billions of dollars of income each year for the \n        travel, tourism, recreation, and sporting sectors of the \n        economy of the United States.\n            (9) Protecting the waters of the United States from \n        discharges of pollutants, degradation, and destruction is a \n        necessary and proper means of implementing treaties to which \n        the United States is a party, including treaties protecting \n        fish, birds, and wildlife.\n            (10) Protecting the waters of the United States from \n        discharges of pollutants, degradation, and destruction is a \n        necessary and proper means of protecting the territory or other \n        property belonging to the United States, including parkland, \n        refuge land, and other land under Federal ownership and the \n        waters encompassed by that land.\n            (11) Administrative and judicial interpretations of the \n        Federal Water Pollution Control Act have treated ground water \n        separately from ``waters of the United States'' as that term is \n        used in such Act, and ground water has not been considered to \n        be ``waters of the United States'' under such Act. This Act and \n        the amendments made by this Act do not affect those \n        administrative and judicial interpretations.\n            (12) This Act and the amendments made by this Act do not \n        affect the authority of the Secretary of the Army or the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the \n        provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as \n        interpreted or applied by the Secretary or Administrator as of \n        January 8, 2001.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \n1362) is amended--\n            (1) by repealing paragraph (7); and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(26) Waters of the united states.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The term `waters of the United \n                States' includes--\n                            ``(i) all waters that are currently used, \n                        were used in the past, or may be susceptible to \n                        use in interstate or foreign commerce, \n                        including all waters that are subject to the \n                        ebb and flow of the tide;\n                            ``(ii) all interstate and international \n                        waters, including interstate and international \n                        wetlands;\n                            ``(iii) all other waters, including \n                        intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including \n                        intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, \n                        wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet \n                        meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds, the \n                        use, degradation, or destruction of which does \n                        or would affect interstate or foreign commerce, \n                        the obligations of the United States under a \n                        treaty, or the territory or other property \n                        belonging to the United States;\n                            ``(iv) all impoundments of waters otherwise \n                        defined as waters of the United States under \n                        this paragraph;\n                            ``(v) tributaries of waters identified in \n                        clauses (i) through (iv);\n                            ``(vi) the territorial seas;
