and\n            (3) it is in the vital national security interest of the \n        United States to safeguard, to the greatest extent possible \n        consistent with their mission, United States diplomats and all \n        embassy and consulate personnel, and to use the full power of \n        the United States to bring to justice any individual or entity \n        that threatens, jeopardizes, or harms them.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment \nof this Act, and every 120 days thereafter, the Secretary of State \nshall submit a report, on a classified basis if necessary, to the \nappropriate congressional committees describing--\n            (1) efforts by the United States to bring to justice the \n        Palestinian terrorists who killed John Branchizio, Mark Parson, \n        and John Marin Linde;\n            (2) a detailed assessment of efforts by the Palestinian \n        Authority to bring to justice the Palestinian terrorists who \n        killed John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde, \n        including--\n                    (A) the number of arrests, interrogations, and \n                interviews by Palestinian Authority officials related \n                to the case;\n                    (B) the number of Palestinian security personnel \n                and man-hours assigned to the case;\n                    (C) the extent of personal supervision or \n                involvement by the President and Ministers of the \n                Palestinian Authority;

MILLER,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
