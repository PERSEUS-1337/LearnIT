FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As the international border between the United States \n        and Mexico becomes more secure, trafficking and smuggling \n        organizations intensify their efforts to enter the United \n        States by increasing the number of tunnels and other \n        subterranean passages between Mexico and the United States.\n            (2) Border tunnels are most often used to transport \n        narcotics from Mexico to the United States, but can also be \n        used to transport people and other contraband.\n            (3) Between May 1990 and May 2011, law enforcement \n        authorities discovered 137 tunnels, 125 of which have been \n        discovered since September 2001. While law enforcement \n        authorities discovered only 2 tunnels in California between \n        1990 and 2001, there has been a dramatic increase in the number \n        of border tunnels discovered in California since 2001.\n            (4) Section 551 of the Department of Homeland Security \n        Appropriations Act, 2007 (Public Law 109-295) added a new \n        section to title 18, United States Code (18 U.S.C. 555), \n        which--\n                    (A) criminalizes the construction or financing of \n                an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across \n                an international border into the United States; and\n                    (B) prohibits any person from recklessly permitting \n                others to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel or \n                subterranean passage on the person's land.\n            (5) Any person convicted of using a tunnel or subterranean \n        passage to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or \n        illegal goods is subject to an enhanced sentence for the \n        underlying offense. Additional sentence enhancements would \n        further deter tunnel activities and increase prosecutorial \n        options.\n\nSEC. 3.
