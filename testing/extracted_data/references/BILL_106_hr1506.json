FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) Federal holdings in the State of Nevada constitute over \n        87 percent of the area of the State, and in 10 of the 17 \n        counties the Federal Government controls at least 80 percent of \n        the land;\n            (2) the large amount of federally controlled land in Nevada \n        and the lack of an adequate private land ownership base has had \n        a negative impact on the overall economic development of rural \n        counties and communities and severely degraded the ability of \n        local governments to provide necessary services;\n            (3) under general land laws less than 3 percent of the \n        Federal land in Nevada has moved from Federal control to \n        private ownership in the last 130 years;\n            (4) in resource management plans, the Bureau of Land \n        Management has identified for disposal land that is difficult \n        and costly to manage and that would more appropriately be in \n        non-Federal ownership;\n            (5) implementation of Federal land management plans has \n        been impaired by the lack of necessary funding to provide the \n        needed improvements and the lack of land management programs to \n        accomplish the goals and standards set out in the plans; and\n            (6) the lack of a private land tax base prevents most local \n        governments from providing the appropriate infrastructure to \n        allow timely development of land that is disposed of by the \n        Federal Government for community expansion and economic growth.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide for--\n            (1) the orderly disposal and use of certain Federal land in \n        the State of Nevada that was not included in the Southern \n        Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-263; \n        112 Stat. 2343);\n            (2) the acquisition of environmentally sensitive land in \n        the State; and\n            (3) the implementation of projects and activities in the \n        State to protect or restore important environmental and \n        cultural resources.\n\nSEC. 3.
