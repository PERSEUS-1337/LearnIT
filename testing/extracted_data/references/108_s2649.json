    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Workforce Investment for Next-\nGeneration Technologies Act'' or the ``WING Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Science- and technology-based industries have been and \n        will continue to be engines of United States economic growth \n        and national security.\n            (2) The United States faces great challenges in the global \n        economy from nations with highly trained technical workforces.\n            (3) Occupations requiring technical and scientific training \n        are projected to grow rapidly over the next decade, at 3 times \n        the rate of all occupations (according to Science & Engineering \n        Indicators, 2002).\n            (4) The need for trained technology workers in national \n        security fields has increased as a result of the events of \n        September 11, 2001.\n            (5) National certification systems are well established and \n        accepted in fields such as health and information technology \n        and have succeeded in attracting more workers into those \n        fields.\n            (6) Business and workers could both be well served by \n        expanding the certification concept to other high technology \n        industries.\n            (7) National certification systems allow workers to develop \n        skills transportable to other States in response to layoffs and \n        other economic changes.\n            (8) National certification systems facilitate interstate \n        comparisons of education and training programs and help \n        identify best practices and reduce cost and development \n        redundancies.\n            (9) National certification systems promote quality and \n        encourage educational institutions to modernize programs to \n        ensure graduates pass industry-required exams.\n            (10) National certification based on industry-validated \n        skill standards introduces stricter accountability for \n        technical and vocational education programs.\n            (11) Certification signals value to employers and increases \n        applicants' employability.\n            (12) Certification offers a planned skill development route \n        into employment or professional advancement for working adults \n        and displaced workers.\n            (13) The National Science Foundation's Advanced \n        Technological Education Program, authorized by Congress in \n        1992, has created national centers of excellence at community \n        colleges that have established unique linkages with industry to \n        prepare individuals for the technical workforce under the \n        program.\n            (14) The Advanced Technological Education Program should be \n        expanded to all institutions of higher education, as the Nation \n        should invest more resources in training and education programs \n        that are responsive to marketplace needs.\n            (15) The one-stop delivery systems authorized under the \n        Workforce Investment Act of 1998 have proved to be effective \n        providers of information and resources for job seekers.\n            (16) The one-stop delivery systems offer special \n        opportunities for directing displaced workers to certification \n        programs that build skills for technical fields where rewarding \n        jobs are plentiful.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To increase the numbers of workers educated for \n        employment in high technology industries.\n            (2) To align the technical and vocational programs of \n        educational institutions with the workforce needs of high-\n        growth, next generation industries.\n            (3) To offer individuals expanded opportunities for rapid \n        training and retraining in portable skills needed to keep and \n        change jobs in a volatile economy.\n            (4) To provide United States businesses with adequate \n        numbers of skilled technical workers.\n            (5) To encourage a student's or worker's progress toward an \n        advanced degree while providing training, education, and useful \n        credentials for workforce entry or reentry.\n\nSEC. 4. SKILL CERTIFICATION PILOT PROJECTS.\n\n    Section 171 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. \n2916) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(e) Skill Certification Pilot Projects.--\n            ``(1) Pilot projects.--In accordance with subsection (b), \n        the Secretary of Labor shall establish and carry out not more \n        than 20 pilot projects to establish a system of industry-\n        validated national certifications of skills, including--\n                    ``(A) not more than 16 national certifications of \n                skills in high-technology industries, including \n                biotechnology, telecommunications, highly automated \n                manufacturing (including semiconductors), advanced \n                materials technology, nanotechnology, and energy \n                technology (including technology relating to next-\n                generation lighting); and\n                    ``(B) not more than 4 cross-disciplinary national \n                certifications of skills in homeland security \n                technology.\n            ``(2) Grants to eligible entities.--In carrying out the \n        pilot projects, the Secretary of Labor shall make grants to \n        eligible entities, for periods of not less than 36 months and \n        not more than 48 months, to carry out the authorized activities \n        described in paragraph (7) with respect to the certifications \n        described in paragraph (1).\n            ``(3) Eligible entities.--\n                    ``(A) Definition of eligible entity.--In this \n                subsection, the term `eligible entity' means an entity \n                that shall include as a principal participant one or \n                more of the following:\n                            ``(i) An institution of higher education \n                        (as defined in section 101 or 102 of the Higher \n                        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001, 1002)).\n                            ``(ii) An advanced technology education \n                        center.\n                            ``(iii) A local workforce investment board.\n                            ``(iv) A representative of a business in a \n                        target industry for the certification involved.\n                            ``(v) A representative of an industry \n                        association, labor organization, or community \n                        development organization.\n                    ``(B) History of demonstrated capability \n                required.--To be eligible to receive a grant under this \n                subsection, an eligible entity shall have a history of \n                demonstrated capability for effective collaboration \n                with industry on workforce development activities that \n                is consistent with the goals of this Act.\n            ``(4) Applications.--To be eligible to receive a grant \n        under this subsection, an eligible entity shall submit an \n        application to the Secretary of Labor at such time, in such \n        manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may \n        require.\n            ``(5) -Criteria.--The Secretary of Labor shall establish \n        criteria, consistent with paragraph (6), for awarding grants \n        under this subsection.\n            ``(6) Priority.--In selecting eligible entities to receive \n        grants under this subsection, the Secretary of Labor shall give \n        priority to eligible entities that demonstrate the availability \n        of and ability to provide matching funds from industry or \n        nonprofit sources.
