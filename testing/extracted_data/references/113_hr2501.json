FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n        mandates that no security assistance may be provided to any \n        country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern \n        of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\n            (2) Section 523 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n        states that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n        available pursuant to this Act shall be obligated to finance \n        indirectly any assistance or reparations to Cuba, Iraq, Libya, \n        Iran, Syria, North Korea, or Sudan, unless the President of the \n        United States certifies that the withholding of these funds is \n        contrary to the national interest of the United States.\n            (3) Under the terms of Resolution 2043 of April 21, 2012, \n        the United Nations Security Council established a United \n        Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS), for an initial \n        period of 90 days, under the command of a Chief Military \n        Observer, comprising an initial deployment of up to 300 unarmed \n        military observers as well as an appropriate civilian component \n        to fulfill the following mandate: To monitor a cessation of \n        armed violence in all its forms by all parties and to monitor \n        and support the full implementation of the UNSMIS' six-point \n        plan.\n            (4) On June 15, 2012, UNSMIS suspended its activities owing \n        to an intensification of armed violence across the country.\n            (5) On July 20, 2012, the Security Council extended UNSMIS \n        for a final period of 30 days. According to Resolution 2059, \n        the Council would only consider further extensions to the \n        mission ``in the event that the Secretary-General reports and \n        the Security Council confirms the cessation of the use of heavy \n        weapons and a reduction in the level of violence sufficient by \n        all sides'' to allow UNSMIS to implement its mandate.\n            (6) As the conditions set by the Security Council had not \n        been met, UNSMIS mandate ended at midnight on August 19, 2012.\n            (7) The al-Nusrah Front is designated by the Department of \n        State as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n\nSEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE TO CONDUCT MILITARY OR PARAMILITARY \n              OPERATIONS IN SYRIA.\n\n    (a) Authorization.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \nassistance of any kind may be provided by any United States Government \nagency for the purpose, or which would have the effect, of promoting, \naugmenting, directly or indirectly, the capacity of any nation, group, \norganization, movement, or individual to conduct military or \nparamilitary operations in Syria, unless and until Congress expressly \nauthorizes such assistance by law enacted after the date of enactment \nof this section.\n    (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply to assistance that is \nsolely provided for humanitarian purposes."
