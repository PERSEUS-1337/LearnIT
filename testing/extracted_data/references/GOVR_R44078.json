    "content": "The first section of this report provides an overview of the consideration of FY2016 judiciary appropriations, with subsections covering each major action, including the initial submission of the request on February 2, 2015; hearings held by the House and Senate Financial Services Subcommittees; the House subcommittee markup on June 10, 2015; the House Appropriations Committee markup on June 17, 2015; the Senate subcommittee markup on July 22, 2015; the Senate Appropriations Committee markup on July 23, 2015; and the continuing resolutions and the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, on December 18, 2015. The status is summarized in Table 1 . This overview is followed by a section on prior-year actions and funding. The report then provides an overview of judiciary accounts.  The Budget for Fiscal Year 2016 was submitted on February 2, 2015. It contains a request for $7.519 billion in new budget authority for judicial branch activities. By law, the judicial branch request is submitted to the President and included in the budget submission without change.   Table 2 lists the dates of judiciary-related hearings of the financial services subcommittees in 2015. Prepared statements of witnesses were posted on the subcommittee websites. The House subcommittee announced that it would accept programmatic and language submissions from Members through March 26, 2015.  On June 10, 2015, the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government held a markup of the FY2016 bill. The subcommittee recommended a total of $7.48 billion for the judiciary. On June 17, 2015, the House Appropriations Committee held a markup of the FY2016 Financial Services bill. The committee recommended a total of $7.47 billion for the judiciary. The bill was ordered reported by a vote of 30-20 ( H.R. 2995 , H.Rept. 114-194 ). No amendments were offered related to the judiciary. On July 22, 2015, the Senate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government held a markup of the FY2016 bill. The subcommittee recommended a total of $7.42 billion for the judiciary. On July 23, 2015, the Senate Appropriations Committee held a markup of the FY2016 Financial Services bill. The committee recommended a total of $7.42 billion for the judiciary. The bill was ordered reported by a vote of 16-14 ( S. 1910 , S.Rept. 114-97 ). No amendments were offered related to the judiciary. No further action was taken on H.R. 2995 or S. 1910 prior to the start of FY2016 on October 1, 2015. Judicial branch activities were funded through continuing appropriations resolutions ( P.L. 114-53 , P.L. 114-96 , and P.L. 114-100 ) until the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 , enacted December 18, 2015). Division E of this act provides $7.3 billion for the judiciary, an increase of $73.9 million (1.0%) from FY2015 and $184.1 million (-2.5%) less than the request. FY2015 judiciary funding was provided in Division E, Title 3, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ), which was enacted on December 16, 2014. The $7.261 billion provided by the act represented an increase of $221.9 million (3.2%) from FY2014 and was $37.9 million (-0.5%) less than the judiciary's request.  Neither a Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill, nor a continuing appropriations resolution (CR), containing FY2014 funding was enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013. A funding gap, which resulted in a partial government shutdown, ensued for 16 days. The funding gap was terminated by the enactment of a CR ( P.L. 113-46 ) on October 17, 2013. The CR provided funding through January 15, 2014. Following enactment of a temporary continuing resolution on January 15, 2014 ( P.L. 113-73 ), a consolidated appropriations bill was enacted on January 17 ( P.L. 113-76 ), providing $7.039 billion for the judiciary for FY2014. Appropriations for the judiciary comprise approximately 0.2% of total budget authority.  Two accounts that fund the Supreme Court (the salaries and expenses of the Court and the expenditures for the care of its building and grounds, which are the responsibility of the Architect of the Capitol) together total approximately 1% of the total judiciary budget. The rest of the judiciary's budget provides funding for the lower federal courts and related judicial services.  The largest account, approximately 73% of the total FY2016 enacted level, is the Salaries and Expenses account for the U.S. Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services. This covers the \"salaries of circuit and district judges (including judges of the territorial courts of the United States), justices and judges retired from office or from regular active service, judges of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, bankruptcy judges, magistrate judges, and all other officers and employees of the federal judiciary not otherwise specifically provided for,\" and \"necessary expenses of the courts.\" Two other large accounts provide funds for Defender Services (13.7%) and Court Security (7.4%). The remaining judiciary budget is divided among the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (0.5% of FY2016 enacted), U.S. Court of International Trade (0.3%), Fees of Jurors and Commissioners (0.6%), Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (1.2%), Federal Judicial Center (0.4%), U.S. Sentencing Commission (0.2%), and Judicial Retirement Funds (1.8%).  Three specialized courts within the federal court system are not funded under the judiciary budget: the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (funded in the Department of Defense appropriations bill), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (funded in the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill), and the U.S. Tax Court (funded under Independent Agencies, Title V, of the Financial Services and General Government [FSGG] bill). Federal courthouse construction is funded within the General Services account under Independent Agencies, Title V, of the FSGG bill. The judiciary uses non-appropriated funds to help offset its funding requirements. The majority of these non-appropriated funds are from fee collections, primarily court filing fees. These monies are used to offset expenses within the Salaries and Expenses account of Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services. Some of these funds may be carried forward from one year to the next. These funds are considered \"unencumbered\" because they result from savings from the judiciary's financial plan in areas where budgeted costs did not materialize. According to the judiciary, such savings are usually not under its control (e.g., the judiciary has no control over the confirmation rate of Article III judges and must make its best estimate on the needed funds to budget for judgeships, rent costs, and technology funding for certain programs). The budget request and appropriations figures presented here reflect the net resources for the judiciary, and do not include these offsetting non-appropriated funds.  The judiciary also has \"encumbered\" funds\u2014no-year authority funds appropriated for specific purposes. These are used when planned expenses are delayed, from one year to the next (e.g., costs associated with space delivery, and certain technology needs and projects). In her written testimony submitted to the House Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee on the judiciary's FY2016 budget request, Judge Julia S. Gibbons, chair of the Budget Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, discussed the results and ongoing efforts of the judiciary's formal cost-containment initiatives, which began in 2004. According to Judge Gibbons, the judiciary has achieved a cost avoidance of \"nearly $1.5 billion relative to [the] projected requirements\" over the past 10 years. Current efforts focus on implementation of shared administrative services among various courts, as well as reducing the judiciary's space footprint. In 2013, the Judicial Conference set a goal of a 3% reduction in total space. According to Judge Gibbons, as of March 2015, 30% of that goal has been reached, resulting in $5.8 million in rent cost avoidance, and the judiciary \"is on track to accomplish the full three percent reduction by the end of fiscal year 2018.\" The safe conduct of court proceedings and the security of judges in courtrooms and off-site has been a concern in recent years. Efforts to improve judicial security have been spurred by the double homicide of family members of a federal judge in Chicago in 2005; the Atlanta killings, in 2005, of a state judge, a court reporter, and a sheriff's deputy at a courthouse; the sniper shooting of a state judge in his Reno office in 2006; and the wounding of a deputy U.S. marshal and killing of a court security officer at the Lloyd D. George U.S. Courthouse and Federal Building in Las Vegas in 2010. An FY2005 supplemental appropriations act included a provision that provided intrusion detection systems for judges in their homes, and the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 aimed to enhance security for judges and court personnel, as well as courtroom safety for the public.  The judiciary has been working closely with the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to ensure that adequate protective policies, procedures, and practices are in place. The FY2015 appropriation continues a pilot program for the USMS to assume responsibility for perimeter security at selected courthouses that were previously the responsibility of the Federal Protective Service (FPS). This pilot was first authorized in FY2009 as a result of the judiciary's stated concerns that FPS was not providing adequate perimeter security. After the initial planning phase, USMS implemented the pilot program on January 5, 2009, and assumed primary responsibility for security functions at seven courthouses located in Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, New York, Tucson, and Baton Rouge (location of two of the seven courthouses). The judiciary and USMS have been evaluating the program and identifying areas for improvement. The judiciary reimburses USMS for the protective services. Following its biennial evaluation and review of judgeship needs, the Judicial Conference of the United States, in March 2015, recommended Congress create 73 new federal judgeships: 5 in the courts of appeals and 68 in the district courts. The Conference made a similar request in the 113 th Congress, recommending a total of 91 new judgeships. Subsequent legislation was introduced in both the House and Senate to address this request, but no final action was taken before the 113 th Congress adjourned.\u00a0 Since the enactment of an omnibus judgeship bill in 1990 ( P.L. 101-650 ), according to the Judicial Conference, the number of appellate judgeships has remained at 179 while appellate court case filings have increased by 28%. During this same time period, Congress enacted legislation that increased the number of district judgeships by 5% (from 645 to 677) while district court case filings increased by 41%. The FY2016 judiciary budget request totals $7.53 billion. Table 3 lists the amounts enacted for FY2015, the President's FY2016 request, committee-reported levels in the House and Senate, and P.L. 114-113 as enacted.  The total FY2016 request for the Supreme Court, $88.2 million, was contained in two accounts: (1) Salaries and Expenses of $78.2 million and (2) Care of the Building and Grounds of $10.0 million. The House committee-reported level totaled $88.0 million and the Senate committee-reported level totaled $88.4 million. P.L. 114-113 provides a total of $88.4 million. This court, consisting of 12 judges, has jurisdiction over and reviews, among other things, certain lower court rulings on patents and trademarks, international trade, and federal claims cases. The FY2016 budget request was $33.8 million. The House committee-reported bill would have provided $33.2 million. The Senate committee-reported provided $33.8 million, which was the total provided by P.L. 114-113 . This court has exclusive jurisdiction nationwide over civil actions against the United States and its agencies and officers, certain civil actions brought by the United States arising out of import transactions, as well as the administration and enforcement of federal customs and international trade laws. The FY2016 request was $20.2 million. The House committee-reported bill would have provided $20.0 million. The Senate committee-reported level and P.L. 114-113 provided $20.2 million, the full amount of the request. The total FY2016 funding request of $7,103.0 million covers 12 of the 13 courts of appeals and 94 district judicial courts located in the 50 states, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the territories of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The House committee-reported level would have provided $7,064.0 million and the Senate committee-reported level would have provided $7,012.9 million. P.L. 114-113 provides $6,929.4 million. The account is divided among salaries and expenses, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund, court security, defender services, and fees of jurors and commissioners. The FY2016 request for this account was $5,459.4 million. The House committee-reported level would have provided $5,415.0 million and the Senate committee-reported level would have provided $5,377.0 million. P.L. 114-113 provides $5,336.0 million. Established to address a perceived crisis in vaccine tort liability claims, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program funds a federal no-fault program that protects the availability of vaccines in the nation by diverting a substantial number of claims from the tort arena. The FY2016 request was $6.0 million. P.L. 114-113 provides $6.1 million.  This account provides for protective services, security systems, and equipment needs in courthouses and other federal facilities to ensure the safety of judicial officers, employees, and visitors. Under this account, the majority of funding for court security is transferred to the U.S. Marshals Service to pay for court security officers under the Judicial Facility Security Program. The FY2016 request was $542.4 million. The House committee-reported level would have provided $537.0 million and the Senate committee-reported level would have provided $538.8 million. P.L. 114-113 provides $538.2 million. This account funds the operations of the federal public defender and community defender organizations, and compensation, reimbursements, and expenses of private practice panel attorneys appointed by federal courts to serve as defense counsel to indigent individuals. The cost for this account is driven by the number and type of prosecutions brought by U.S. attorneys. The FY2016 request was $1,057.6 million. The House committee-reported level would have provided $1,057.6 million and the Senate committee-reported level would have provided $1,042.6 million. P.L. 114-113 provides $1,004.9 million. This account funds the fees and allowances provided to grand and petit jurors, and compensation for jury and land commissioners. The FY2016 request was $52.4 million. The House committee-reported level and the Senate committee-reported level would have both provided $48.4 million. P.L. 114-113 provides $44.2 million. As the central support entity for the judiciary, the AOUSC provides a wide range of administrative, management, program, and information technology services to the U.S. courts. AOUSC also provides support to the Judicial Conference of the United States, and implements conference policies and applicable federal statutes and regulations. The FY2016 request for AOUSC was $87.6 million. The House committee-reported level would have provided $85.0 million and the Senate committee-reported level would have provided $86.0 million. P.L. 114-113 provides $85.7 million. As the judiciary's research and education entity, the Federal Judicial Center undertakes research and evaluation of judicial operations for the Judicial Conference committees and the courts. In addition, the center provides judges, court staff, and others with orientation and continuing education and training. The center's FY2016 request was $27.7 million. The House committee-reported level would have provided $27.3 million and the Senate committee-reported level would have provided $27.0 million. P.L. 114-113 provides $27.7 million. The commission promulgates sentencing policies, practices, and guidelines for the federal criminal justice system. The FY2016 request was $17.5 million. The House committee-reported level would have provided $17.2 million and the Senate committee-reported level would have provided $17.0 million. P.L. 114-113 provides $17.6 million. This mandatory account provides for three trust funds that finance payments to retired bankruptcy and magistrate judges, retired Court of Federal Claims judges, and the spouses and dependent children of deceased judicial officers. The FY2016 request was for $132.0 million. Both the House committee-reported and Senate committee-reported bills would have provided funding at the requested level, as does P.L. 114-113 . These funds are provided in Title VI (General Provisions) of the FSGG bill, rather than in Title III (the Judiciary).  P.L. 114-113 contained provisions related to (1) salaries and expenses for employment of experts and consultant services; (2) transfers between judiciary appropriations accounts of up to 5%; (3) a limitation of $11,000 for official reception and representation expenses incurred by the Judicial Conference of the United States; (4) language enabling the judiciary to contract for repairs under $100,000; (5) the continuation of a court security pilot program; (6) a one-year extension of the authorization of temporary judgeships in the eastern District of Missouri, Kansas, Arizona, the central District of California, the northern district of Alabama, the southern district of Florida, New Mexico, the western district of North Carolina, and the eastern district of Texas; and (7) the authority of U.S. probation officers appointed in one district to provide supervision services in another district."
