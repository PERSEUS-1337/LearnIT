FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n        (1) International terrorism is a serious and deadly problem \n    that threatens the vital interests of the United States.\n        (2) International terrorism affects the interstate and foreign \n    commerce of the United States by harming international trade and \n    market stability, and limiting international travel by United \n    States citizens as well as foreign visitors to the United States.\n        (3) Some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through \n    affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds outside \n    of the United States for conduct directed and targeted at the \n    United States.\n        (4) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of \n    action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under \n    chapter 113B of title 18, United States Code.\n        (5) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n    District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. \n    Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the leading case \n    regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and conspiracy \n    liability, including by the Supreme Court of the United States, \n    provides the proper legal framework for how such liability should \n    function in the context of chapter 113B of title 18, United States \n    Code.\n        (6) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or \n    recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly or \n    indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a significant \n    risk of committing acts of terrorism that threaten the security of \n    nationals of the United States or the national security, foreign \n    policy, or economy of the United States, necessarily direct their \n    conduct at the United States, and should reasonably anticipate \n    being brought to court in the United States to answer for such \n    activities.\n        (7) The United States has a vital interest in providing persons \n    and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks committed \n    within the United States with full access to the court system in \n    order to pursue civil claims against persons, entities, or \n    countries that have knowingly or recklessly provided material \n    support or resources, directly or indirectly, to the persons or \n    organizations responsible for their injuries.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil litigants \nwith the broadest possible basis, consistent with the Constitution of \nthe United States, to seek relief against persons, entities, and \nforeign countries, wherever acting and wherever they may be found, that \nhave provided material support, directly or indirectly, to foreign \norganizations or persons that engage in terrorist activities against \nthe United States.\nSEC. 3.
