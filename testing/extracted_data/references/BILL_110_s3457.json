FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Despite progress and an estimated annual growth rate of \n        nearly 10 percent, Ethiopia remains one of the poorest and most \n        famine-prone countries in the world, with more than half of the \n        population of 78,000,000 living on less than $1 per day.\n            (2) Since the collapse of the Derg and overthrow of the \n        Mengistu regime in 1991, the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary \n        Democratic Front (EPRDF)-led government has overseen the \n        introduction of a multiparty system and the drafting of a new \n        constitution that guarantees economic, social, and cultural \n        rights and states that ``human and democratic rights of peoples \n        and citizens shall be protected.''\n            (3) Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a bloody border war between \n        1998 and 2000, and, despite the Algiers Accord ending the \n        conflict and the agreement to abide by the final and biding \n        Ethiopia-Eritrea Border Commission (EEBC) arbitration, the \n        Government of Ethiopia has refused to comply with the final \n        physical demarcation of the border and the Government of \n        Eritrea has virtually expelled the United Nations peacekeeping \n        force, resulting in a high risk of renewed fighting and \n        regional instability.\n            (4) Following high turnout and marked improvement in pre-\n        election campaigning and voting in the third general elections \n        of the Government of Ethiopia held on May 15, 2005, widespread \n        charges of violations in the finally tallying and inadequate \n        response to opposition complaints resulted in observer findings \n        that the elections failed to satisfy international standards.\n            (5) Subsequent opposition progress led to a crackdown by \n        EPRDF security forces in which 763 civilians were injured and \n        193 killed, and thousands more opposition party leaders and \n        their followers were detained, 112 of whom were not released \n        until the summer of 2007.\n            (6) In its 2007 ``Countries at a Crossroads'' report, \n        Freedom House noted that ``[i]ncreased threats to and \n        violations of civil liberties were a consequence of the \n        political tensions that sprang from the flawed 2005 \n        elections.''\n            (7) In December 2006, military forces of the Government of \n        Ethiopia came to the aid of Somalia's Transitional Federal \n        Government against the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) and continue \n        to serve as the primary security force for the United Nations-\n        backed transitional government in Mogadishu.\n            (8) Credible nongovernmental organizations report \n        widespread violations of human rights and international law by \n        the Ethiopian military in Mogadishu and other areas of Somalia, \n        as well as in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia.\n            (9) According to the Department of State's 2007 Country \n        Reports on Human Rights Practices, ``human rights abuses [in \n        Ethiopia] . . . include: limitation on citizens' right to \n        change their government during the most recent elections; \n        unlawful killings, and beating, abuse, and mistreatment of \n        detainees and opposition supporters by security forces; poor \n        prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention . . . use of \n        excessive force by security services in an internal conflict \n        and counter-insurgency operations; restrictions on freedom of \n        the press; etc.''\n            (10) The Department of State's 2007 Country Reports on \n        Human Rights Practices also stated that ``[Ogaden National \n        Liberation Front] ONLF forces . . . were responsible for \n        widespread human rights abuses, including killings and the \n        diversion of food supplies resulting in the displacement of \n        thousands of persons.''\n            (11) In June 2007, in response to this violence, including \n        the deadly April 2007 attacks on a Chinese oil exploration site \n        in the Ogaden and at a May 2007 political rally, the Prime \n        Minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi, announced that the \n        Government of Ethiopia was launching a ``political and military \n        operation to contain the activities of the ONLF,'' which, \n        according to credible reports, has resulted in the displacement \n        of thousands of civilians to government-designated ``protection \n        zones,'' while thousands more have fled across Ethiopia's \n        borders.\n            (12) Although the Government of Ethiopia has legitimate \n        security concerns in the Ogaden, and, according to the \n        Department of State's 2007 Country Report on Terrorism, \n        ``Ethiopian forces [also] countered Somali-based extremists who \n        attempted to conduct attacks inside Ethiopia,'' a number of \n        credible media accounts, human rights organizations, and \n        humanitarian agencies have documented the ENDF's unjustifiably \n        brutal tactics against its own citizens there, as has been \n        previously been reported in other regions of the country \n        including Oromiya, Amhara, and Gambella.\n            (13) In May 2008, the Government of Ethiopia circulated a \n        draft law that claims to be a tool to enhance the transparency \n        and accountability of civil society organizations, but if \n        enacted, is instead likely to create a complex web of onerous \n        bureaucratic hurdles, draconian criminal penalties, and \n        intrusive powers of surveillance that would further decrease \n        the political space available for civil society activities.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to support the efforts by the people and Government of \n        Ethiopia--\n                    (A) to achieve a participatory multiparty \n                democracy, an active and unhindered civil society, rule \n                of law and accountability, judicial capacity and \n                independence, freedom of the press, respect for human \n                rights, and economic development; and\n                    (B) to combat extremism and terrorism in their \n                country and the region;\n            (2) to promote stability, democracy, accountability, social \n        and economic development, human and political rights, \n        humanitarian assistance, the rule of law and accountability, \n        and counterterrorism efforts in Ethiopia and the wider Horn of \n        Africa;\n            (3) to seek the unconditional release of all political \n        prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Ethiopia;\n            (4) to prohibit United States funding to any unit of the \n        Ethiopian security forces if there is credible evidence that a \n        unit of the security forces has committed gross violations of \n        human rights, unless the Secretary of State has determined and \n        reports to the appropriate congressional committees that the \n        Ethiopian government is taking effective measures to bring the \n        responsible members of the security forces unit to justice; and\n            (5) to contribute to regional peace and stability by urging \n        the Government of Ethiopia to comply with the EEBC arbitration \n        decisions on border demarcation, urging the Government of \n        Eritrea to permit a United Nations peacekeeping presence, and \n        pressing both Governments to ensure that they are playing a \n        productive role in helping to bring about stability along the \n        border and throughout the Horn of Africa, including in Somalia.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the United States Government \nshould--\n            (1) build on successful diplomatic efforts that contributed \n        to the October 2007 release of political prisoners in Addis;\n            (2) urge the Government of Ethiopia to protect the \n        constitutional rights and freedoms of all Ethiopian citizens;\n            (3) encourage the Government of Ethiopia to enter into \n        discussions with political groups interested in reconciliation \n        in order to bring such groups into full participation in the \n        political and economic affairs of Ethiopia;\n            (4) call on the Government of Ethiopia to allow human \n        rights and humanitarian groups and the media to undertake their \n        work in all regions of Ethiopia without intimidation or \n        harassment while ensuring they are protected from any threats \n        regardless of their political affiliations;\n            (5) encourage and assist the United Nations and other \n        independent organizations and the media in investigating \n        credible reports of grave violations of human rights or \n        international humanitarian law, publishing any evidence of \n        serious abuse, and sending strong and consistent messages to \n        the Government of Ethiopia that the continuation of such \n        violations or impunity for the perpetrators of crimes in the \n        Ogaden region, Ethiopia more generally, or in Somalia carry \n        consequences; and\n            (6) encourage the Governments of both Ethiopia and Eritrea \n        to take steps to lessen tensions, physically demarcate the \n        border in accord with the EEBC decision, and promote \n        normalization of relations between the two countries.\n\nSEC. 5.
