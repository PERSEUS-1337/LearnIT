CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings and declarations:\n            (1) It is the sense of Congress that the State Department \n        should designate within the appropriate bureau a special \n        assistant to the Assistant Secretary to promote international \n        women's human rights within the overall human rights policy of \n        the United States Government.\n            (2) The purpose of assigning a special assistant on women's \n        human rights issues is not to segregate such issues, but rather \n        to assure that they are considered along with other human \n        rights issues in the development of United States foreign \n        policy.\n            (3) A specifically designated special assistant is \n        necessary because within the human rights field and the foreign \n        policy establishment, the issues of gender-based discrimination \n        and violence against women have long been ignored or made \n        invisible.\n            (4) The Congress believes that abuses against women would \n        have greater visibility and protection of women's human rights \n        would improve if the advocate were responsible for integrating \n        women's human rights issues into United States human rights \n        policy in ways including, but not limited to, the following:\n                    (A) The designated women's human rights advocate \n                would seek to assure that the issue of abuses against \n                women, along with human rights issues generally, are a \n                factor in determining appropriate recipients for United \n                States bilateral assistance as well as United States \n                votes at the multilateral development banks.\n                    (B) The advocate would work with the regional \n                bureaus of the Department of State to devise strategies \n                for the executive branch to bring pressure to bear on \n                governments that engage in violence or systematic \n                discrimination against women or fail to afford equal \n                treatment of women before the law.\n                    (C) The advocate would, in consultation with the \n                bureau responsible for international organizations, \n                pursue strategies to increase the visibility and \n                integration of gender-based persecution and violence in \n                multilateral fora including, but not limited to, the \n                United States Commission on Human Rights and the \n                Working Group on Torture.\n                    (D) The advocate would seek to assure that the \n                United States Trade Representative conduct inquiries \n                and take steps to prevent countries from receiving \n                trade benefits under the Generalized System of \n                Preferences and most favored nation status where \n                governments fail to address violence, systematic \n                discrimination, and exploitation of women workers.\n                    (E) The advocate would seek to assure that the \n                protection of women's human rights, including womens' \n                participation in the political process, women's right \n                to freedom of association and expression, and freedom \n                from discrimination, would be addressed in the context \n                of United States funded programs in the area of \n                democracy including, but not limited to, democracy \n                programs at the Agency for International Development \n                (AID), democracy programs for Eastern Europe funded by \n                the Support Eastern European Democracy (SEED) \n                legislation, and new programs that may be contemplated.\n                    (F) The advocate would seek to assure that United \n                States assistance programs in the area of \n                administration of justice include efforts to redress \n                violations of women's rights.\n                    (G) The advocate would work with AID and the \n                appropriate office at the Department of State to secure \n                funding for programs to meet the needs of women victims \n                of human rights abuses including, but not limited to, \n                medical and psychological assistance for rape victims.\n                    (H) The advocate would work to assure United States \n                ratification of the United Nations Convention on the \n                Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \n                Women (CEDAW) and oversee the preparation of reports \n                pursuant to that Convention.\n                    (I) The advocate would seek to upgrade the quality \n                and quantity of information about abuses of women's \n                human rights in the reporting from United States \n                embassies overseas, incorporate that information not \n                only in the State Department Country Reports on Human \n                Rights, but also in other public statements and \n                documents including, but not limited to, congressional \n                testimony and private demarches.\n\nSEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Congress \non the steps taken to create the position described in section 2 or to \notherwise fulfill the objectives detailed in that section.\n    (b) United States Ratification of CEDAW.--If the United Nations \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \nWomen (CEDAW) has not been submitted to the Senate for ratification, \nnot more than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary of State shall submit a report to the Congress on the \nadministration's position on the ratification of CEDAW and timetable \nfor submission of CEDAW for congressional consideration and approval."
