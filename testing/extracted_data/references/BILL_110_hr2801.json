FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) King Cove, Alaska, is--\n                    (A) located 625 air miles from Anchorage, Alaska, \n                on the south side of the Alaska Peninsula, on a sand \n                spit fronting Deer Passage and Deer Island;\n                    (B) accessible only by air and water; and\n                    (C) one of the most geographically isolated areas \n                of the State of Alaska;\n            (2) constant adverse weather and limiting physical \n        topography make traveling in and out of King Cove directly by \n        air dangerous and impractical much of the time;\n            (3) King Cove is the homeland of Aleut people who--\n                    (A) are federally recognized as indigenous peoples \n                of the United States;\n                    (B) have fished, hunted, and subsisted in King Cove \n                for over 4,000 years; and\n                    (C) refer to the King Cove community as \n                ``Agdaagux'';\n            (4) the Agdaagux Tribal Council, which is the federally \n        recognized tribal government for King Cove, recognizes that \n        most of residents of King Cove are direct descendants of the \n        original Aleut inhabitants;\n            (5) in the 1940s, an airport capable of access by jets was \n        constructed by the United States Army at Cold Bay, which is \n        approximately 25 surface miles north of King Cove, to support \n        World War II related national security needs;\n            (6) while the Cold Bay Airport, which is now a civilian \n        airport operated by the State of Alaska, is the lifeline for \n        the King Cove people to the outside world, particularly for the \n        life, safety, and health needs of the indigenous residents, \n        there is no surface access between King Cove and the airport;\n            (7) nearly all of the land between King Cove and Cold Bay \n        is--\n                    (A) owned by the Federal Government as part of the \n                Izembek National Wildlife Refuge; and\n                    (B) managed as wilderness; and\n            (8) the Agdaagux Tribal Council--\n                    (A) maintains that the Council and the indigenous \n                Aleut people of King Cove were not consulted before the \n                land that separates residents from the nearest all-\n                weather airport was designated as wilderness, even \n                though approximately 1,292 people across the United \n                States, Canada, and Europe--\n                            (i) received notice of the potential \n                        designation; and\n                            (ii) during 1969 and 1970, were expressly \n                        invited by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and \n                        Wildlife, the predecessor of the United States \n                        Fish and Wildlife Service, to participate in \n                        the process of considering whether the land \n                        should be managed as wilderness;\n                    (B) regards the failure of the Federal Government \n                to consult with the Council and the indigenous Aleut \n                people of King Cove as a ``wrong and troubling action \n                taken by the federal government'';\n                    (C) submits that dozens of King Cove residents have \n                died or suffered grave health consequences in the past \n                30 years because the residents could not reach timely \n                medical assistance in Anchorage, Alaska, that can only \n                be accessed via the all-weather Cold Bay Airport; and\n                    (D) has expressed the full endorsement and support \n                of the Council for the construction of a road between \n                King Cove and the Cold Bay Airport as an expression of, \n                and commitment to, self-determination for the Aleut \n                people of King Cove who were not consulted before the \n                land vital to the survival of the Aleut people of King \n                Cove was designated as wilderness.\n\nSEC. 3.
