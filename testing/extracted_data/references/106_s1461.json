SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Domain Name Piracy \nPrevention Act of 1999''.\n    (b) References to the Trademark Act of 1946.--Any reference in this \nAct to the Trademark Act of 1946 shall be a reference to the Act \nentitled ``An Act to provide for the registration and protection of \ntrade-marks used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain \ninternational conventions, and for other purposes'', approved July 5, \n1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The registration, trafficking in, or use of a domain \n        name that is identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive \n        of a trademark or service mark of another that is distinctive \n        at the time of registration of the domain name, without regard \n        to the goods or services of the parties, with the bad-faith \n        intent to profit from the goodwill of another's mark (commonly \n        referred to as ``cyberpiracy'' and ``cybersquatting'')--\n                    (A) results in consumer fraud and public confusion \n                as to the true source or sponsorship of goods and \n                services;\n                    (B) impairs electronic commerce, which is important \n                to interstate commerce and the United States economy;\n                    (C) deprives legitimate trademark owners of \n                substantial revenues and consumer goodwill; and\n                    (D) places unreasonable, intolerable, and \n                overwhelming burdens on trademark owners in protecting \n                their valuable trademarks.\n            (2) Amendments to the Trademark Act of 1946 would clarify \n        the rights of a trademark owner to provide for adequate \n        remedies and to deter cyberpiracy and cybersquatting.\n\nSEC. 3. CYBERPIRACY PREVENTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 43 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \n1125) is amended by inserting at the end the following:\n    ``(d)(1)(A) Any person who, with bad-faith intent to profit from \nthe goodwill of a trademark or service mark of another, registers, \ntraffics in, or uses a domain name that is identical to, confusingly \nsimilar to, or dilutive of such trademark or service mark, without \nregard to the goods or services of the parties, shall be liable in a \ncivil action by the owner of the mark, if the mark is distinctive at \nthe time of the registration of the domain name.\n    ``(B) In determining whether there is a bad-faith intent described \nunder subparagraph (A), a court may consider factors such as, but not \nlimited to--\n            ``(i) the trademark or other intellectual property rights \n        of the person, if any, in the domain name;\n            ``(ii) the extent to which the domain name consists of the \n        legal name of the person or a name that is otherwise commonly \n        used to identify that person;\n            ``(iii) the person's prior use, if any, of the domain name \n        in connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or \n        services;\n            ``(iv) the person's legitimate noncommercial or fair use of \n        the mark in a site accessible under the domain name;\n            ``(v) the person's intent to divert consumers from the mark \n        owner's online location to a site accessible under the domain \n        name that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark, \n        either for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or \n        disparage the mark, by creating a likelihood of confusion as to \n        the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the \n        site;\n            ``(vi) the person's offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise \n        assign the domain name to the mark owner or any third party for \n        substantial consideration without having used, or having an \n        intent to use, the domain name in the bona fide offering of any \n        goods or services;\n            ``(vii) the person's intentional provision of material and \n        misleading false contact information when applying for the \nregistration of the domain name; and\n            ``(viii) the person's registration or acquisition of \n        multiple domain names which are identical to, confusingly \n        similar to, or dilutive of trademarks or service marks of \n        others that are distinctive at the time of registration of such \n        domain names, without regard to the goods or services of such \n        persons.\n    ``(C) In any civil action involving the registration, trafficking, \nor use of a domain name under this paragraph, a court may order the \nforfeiture or cancellation of the domain name or the transfer of the \ndomain name to the owner of the mark.\n    ``(2)(A) The owner of a mark may file an in rem civil action \nagainst a domain name if--\n            ``(i) the domain name violates any right of the registrant \n        of a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, or \n        section 43 (a) or (c); and\n            ``(ii) the court finds that the owner has demonstrated due \n        diligence and was not able to find a person who would have been \n        a defendant in a civil action under paragraph (1).\n    ``(B) The remedies of an in rem action under this paragraph shall \nbe limited to a court order for the forfeiture or cancellation of the \ndomain name or the transfer of the domain name to the owner of the \nmark.''.\n    (b) Additional Civil Action and Remedy.--The civil action \nestablished under section 43(d)(1) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (as \nadded by this section) and any remedy available under such action shall \nbe in addition to any other civil action or remedy otherwise \napplicable.\n\nSEC. 4.
