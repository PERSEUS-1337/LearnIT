FINDINGS, SENSE OF CONGRESS, AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Gulf of Mexico is a valuable resource of national \n        and international importance, continuously serving the people \n        of the United States and other countries as an important source \n        of food, economic productivity, recreation, beauty, and \n        enjoyment.\n            (2) Over many years, the resource productivity and water \n        quality of the Gulf of Mexico and its watershed have been \n        diminished by point and nonpoint source pollution, increasing \n        population demands, economic development, and natural and man-\n        made hazard events.\n            (3) The protection of the Gulf of Mexico regional ecosystem \n        has been traditionally underserved and overlooked compared to \n        other great water bodies of the United States, even though the \n        region accounts for 17 percent of United States gross domestic \n        product and would rank as the 7th largest economy in the world.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \nStates should seek to attain coordination of the protection and \nrestoration efforts of the Gulf of Mexico in order to reduce \nduplication of efforts and maximize efficiencies through a \ncollaborative regional effort by the Gulf of Mexico Alliance, in \nconsultation with Federal agencies and State and local authorities.\n    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To expand and strengthen cooperative voluntary efforts \n        to protect and restore the Gulf of Mexico.\n            (2) To expand Federal support for monitoring, management, \n        and restoration activities in the Gulf of Mexico and its \n        watershed.\n            (3) To commit the United States to a comprehensive \n        cooperative program to achieve improved water quality in, and \n        improvements in the productivity of living resources of, the \n        Gulf of Mexico.\n            (4) To establish a Gulf of Mexico Alliance to coordinate \n        Federal and State authorities with other voluntary efforts for \n        the collaborative management of the large marine ecosystem, \n        thereby reducing duplication of efforts and maximizing \n        opportunities to leverage restoration support in the Gulf of \n        Mexico region.\n\nSEC. 3.
