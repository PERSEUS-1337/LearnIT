FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Adolescence is an ideal time to promote good physical \n        health. Positive and negative behaviors in adolescence tend to \n        carry over into adulthood.\n            (2) Unfortunately, many American teenagers exhibit \n        behaviors that compromise their present and future health.\n            (3) Many adolescents are not very active and many do not \n        have a healthy diet. Insufficient physical activity and poor \n        nutrition play roles in obesity, coronary heart disease, \n        stroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.\n            (4) Other health risk factors for teens include tobacco \n        use, drug and alcohol use, mental health problems, and \n        dangerous behaviors that lead to injury and violence.\n            (5) It is clear that the health of our youth is in danger.\n            (6) The YMCA movement--in its history, strengths and \n        commitments--is in a unique position to tackle this public \n        health problem.\n            (7) Research has shown that YMCA programs have a powerful \n        influence on adolescent behavior, both protecting young people \n        from many different problem behaviors and promoting positive \n        attitudes and behaviors.\n            (8) Recognizing the unique obstacles faced by teenagers, \n        the YMCA has launched the Teen Action Agenda, a nationwide \n        campaign to dramatically expand programs that serve teens.\n            (9) In more than 1,900 YMCAs across the United States in \n        cities large and small, in neighborhoods rich and poor, teen \n        groups meet regularly and engage one another in safe, \n        wholesome, educational, recreational and creative activities.\n            (10) YMCAs serve people of all faiths, races, abilities, \n        ages, and incomes.\n            (11) Approximately 400 YMCAs partner with juvenile courts, \n        300 partner with public housing developments, 1,550 partner \n        with elementary schools, and 1,033 partner with high schools.\n            (12) The YMCA is especially committed to reaching teens \n        that are most at-risk for exhibiting health-compromising \n        behaviors.\n\nSEC. 3.
