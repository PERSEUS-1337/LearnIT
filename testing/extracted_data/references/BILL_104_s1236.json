FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the preparation and consideration of the multitude of \n        bills proposing particular days, weeks, months, or years for \n        recognition through Presidential proclamation unduly burdens \n        the Congress and consumes an inordinate amount of time;\n            (2) such proposals could be more efficiently considered by \n        a commission whose sole function would be to review proposals \n        for national commemorative events and to make positive or \n        negative recommendations thereon to the President;\n            (3) such a commission would streamline the process by which \n        such proposals are currently considered and save the Congress \n        considerable time and resources which could be devoted to \n        matters of more pressing national concern; and\n            (4) such a commission would better ensure the impartial \n        review of proposals for national commemorative events generated \n        by a wide variety of constituent groups.\n\nSEC. 3.
