FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) When Congress enacted the fiscal year 2002 budget \n        resolution, it did so based on the assurance that the \n        Government would balance the budget without relying on social \n        security surpluses for the remainder of the decade and beyond. \n        Congress was also assured that it would not have to act to \n        increase the statutory debt limit until 2008.\n            (2) The Government is projected to run on-budget deficits \n        that will require it to spend the social security and medicare \n        trust fund surpluses for the rest of the decade, even before \n        additional spending for defense and homeland security is \n        counted, and after the economy recovers and returns to strong \n        growth.\n            (3) The total debt is increasing because we have not kept \n        the commitment to save the social security and medicare trust \n        fund surpluses. The Secretary of the Treasury has formally \n        requested that Congress increase the statutory limit on the \n        public debt by $750 billion, from the current level of $5.95 \n        trillion to $6.70 trillion. Congress will have to vote to raise \n        the debt limit because we have been borrowing those trust fund \n        surpluses to cover a deficit in the rest of the budget instead \n        of saving them.\n            (4) A $750 billion increase in the debt limit would be the \n        second largest increase in history and is irresponsible in the \n        absence of a framework to protect taxpayers from even further \n        increases in the national debt.\n            (5) Congress should authorize a limited increase in the \n        debt limit to prevent a financial default, but should also work \n        together with the President to develop a plan to restore fiscal \n        discipline before further increasing our debt.\n            (6) Current law provides for enforcement of budget \n        resolutions:\n                    (A) Legislation violating discretionary spending \n                totals set in a budget resolution or the suballocations \n                set by the Committee on Appropriations is subject to a \n                point of order under section 302(f) of the \n                Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n                    (B) Legislation reducing receipts below a budget \n                resolution's total is subject to a point of order under \n                section 311(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is--\n            (1) to provide a responsible, measured increase in the debt \n        limit to ensure that the Government meets its current legal \n        obligations;\n            (2) effective immediately thereafter, to limit strictly the \n        size of further increases in the debt limit until the enactment \n        of a plan to bring the budget into balance in five years \n        without reliance on the social security trust fund surplus, \n        such that any larger increase in the debt limit this fall would \n        require a plan to balance the budget in fiscal year 2007, but \n        if this deficit reduction should prove insufficient, the \n        restrictions are automatically reestablished by the next \n        regular semi-annual report of the Congressional Budget Office;\n            (3) to require that the President submit a budget plan \n        before the end of this fiscal year to achieve balance, without \n        reliance on the social security trust fund surplus, by fiscal \n        year 2007;\n            (4) as a backup and discipline for these debt limit \n        provisions, to establish points of order against any budget \n        resolution that does not within five years and in all \n        subsequent years eliminate any deficits projected by the \n        Congressional Budget Office, without reliance on the social \n        security trust fund surplus, using the enforcement provisions \n        in current law to require that all subsequent spending and tax \nlegislation conform to the budget resolution's deficit-reduction plan; \nand\n            (5) thereby to restore fiscal discipline and to preserve \n        social security for future retirees.\n\n                    TITLE I--INCREASE IN DEBT LIMIT\n\nSEC. 101. INCREASE IN DEBT LIMIT.\n\n    (a) Increase in Statutory Debt Limit.--Section 3101(b) of title 31, \nUnited States Code, is amended by striking ``$5,950,000,000,000'' and \ninserting ``$6,100,000,000,000''.\n    (b) Point of Order.--(1) Effective immediately, except as provided \nby paragraph (2) or (3), it shall not be in order in the House of \nRepresentatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, \namendment, or conference report that includes any provision that \nincreases the limit on the public debt above the limit set forth in \nsection 3101(b) of title 31, United States Code, as in effect \nimmediately before the date of consideration of that measure by more \nthan $100,000,000,000.\n    (2) Except as provided by paragraph (3), any bill or joint \nresolution may carry an increase in such limit of more than \n$100,000,000,000 only if the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nthe budget year has been adopted and--\n            (A) sets forth or assumes a budget that is in on-budget \n        balance or surplus within 4 fiscal years after the budget year \n        and is in on-budget balance or surplus for every subsequent \n        fiscal year covered by that resolution; and\n            (B) does not contain any reduction in social security \n        benefits.\n    (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply in the House of \nRepresentatives or the Senate if the chairman of the Committee on the \nBudget of the House or of the Senate, as applicable, certifies, based \non the report of the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section \n202(e)(1) or (2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, whichever \nreport is the most recent, that the budget will be in on-budget balance \nor surplus within 4 fiscal years after the budget year and is in on-\nbudget balance or surplus for every subsequent fiscal year covered by \nthat report. If legislation to extend the discretionary spending limits \nbeyond fiscal year 2002 is enacted before the date of release of such \nreport, the Congressional Budget Office shall assume such discretionary \nspending levels. Any such certification shall only have force and \neffect until the date of submission of the next report under either \nsuch section.\n\nSEC. 102. PRESIDENTIAL PLAN TO BALANCE THE BUDGET.\n\n    (a) Presidential Plan.--The President shall submit to the Congress \nby September 30, 2002, a proposal to bring the budget of the Government \n(excluding the receipts and disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and \nSurvivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \nTrust Fund) into balance or surplus by fiscal year 2007.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the plan \ndescribed in subsection (a) should be based on the most recent economic \nand technical assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n          TITLE II--CIRCUIT BREAKER TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY\n\nSEC. 201.
