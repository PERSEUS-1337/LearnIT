FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the ``National Survey of Veterans, Active \n        Duty Service Members, Demobilized National Guard and Reserve \n        Members, Family Members, and Surviving Spouses Final Report'', \n        commissioned by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in 2010, 20.6 \n        percent of eligible veterans--approximately 2,621,753 \n        veterans--were unable to use their GI bill educational benefits \n        because their period of eligibility expired.\n            (2) The time limitations for using GI bill educational \n        benefits do not reflect the realities of the modern economy of \n        the United States. After leaving the service, many veterans \n        postpone further education to join the workforce and support \n        their families or are faced with lengthy rehabilitations from \n        service-related injuries.\n            (3) Access to education and job retraining has proved the \n        arbiter of success in today's economy, and if the United States \n        is to lower the unemployment rate among the veteran population, \n        the United States must provide veterans unfettered access to \n        educational benefits.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to remove the delimiting \ndates and retroactively restore the Department of Veterans Affairs \nEducational benefits within the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational \nAssistance Program (VEAP), Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD), \nand Post-9/11 GI Bill.\n\nSEC. 3.
