SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Health Equity and Access under the \nLaw for Immigrant Women and Families Act of 2014'' or as the ``HEAL \nImmigrant Women and Families Act of 2014''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Insurance coverage reduces harmful health disparities \n        by alleviating cost barriers to and increasing utilization of \n        basic preventive health services, especially among low-income \n        and underserved populations, and especially among women.\n            (2) Based solely on their immigration status, many \n        immigrants and their families face legal restrictions on their \n        ability to obtain health insurance coverage through Medicaid, \n        CHIP, and Health Insurance Exchanges.\n            (3) Lack of health insurance contributes to persistent \n        disparities in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of \n        negative health outcomes borne by immigrants and their \n        families.\n            (4) Immigrant women are disproportionately of reproductive \n        age, low-income, and lacking health insurance coverage. Legal \n        barriers to affordable health insurance coverage therefore \n        particularly exacerbate their risk of negative sexual, \n        reproductive, and maternal health outcomes, with lasting health \n        and economic consequences for immigrant women, their families, \n        and society as a whole.\n            (5) Denying coverage or imposing waiting periods for \n        coverage unfairly hinders the ability of immigrants to take \n        responsibility for their own health and economic well-being and \n        that of their families. To fully and productively participate \n        in society, access to health care is fundamental, which for \n        women includes access to the services necessary to plan whether \n        and when to have a child.\n            (6) The population of immigrant families in the United \n        States is expected to continue to grow. Indeed one in five \n        children in the United States is part of an immigrant family. \n        It is therefore in the nation's shared public health and \n        economic interest to remove legal barriers to affordable health \n        insurance coverage based on immigration status.\n\nSEC. 3. REMOVING BARRIERS TO HEALTH COVERAGE FOR LAWFULLY PRESENT \n              INDIVIDUALS.\n\n    (a) Medicaid.--Section 1903(v)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1396b(v)(4)) is amended--\n            (1) by amending subparagraph (A) to read as follows:\n    ``(A) Notwithstanding sections 401(a), 402(b), 403, and 421 of the \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n1996, payment shall be made under this section for care and services \nthat are furnished to aliens, including those described in paragraph \n(1), if they otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for medical \nassistance under the State plan approved under this title (other than \nthe requirement of the receipt of aid or assistance under title IV, \nsupplemental security income benefits under title XVI, or a State \nsupplementary payment), and are lawfully present in the United \nStates.'';\n            (2) in subparagraph (B)--\n                    (A) by striking ``a State that has elected to \n                provide medical assistance to a category of aliens \n                under subparagraph (A)'' and inserting ``aliens \n                provided medical assistance pursuant to subparagraph \n                (A)''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``to such category'' and inserting \n                ``to such alien''; and\n            (3) in subparagraph (C)--\n                    (A) by striking ``an election by the State under \n                subparagraph (A)'' and inserting ``the application of \n                subparagraph (A)'';\n                    (B) by inserting ``or be lawfully present'' after \n                ``lawfully reside''; and\n                    (C) by inserting ``or present'' after ``lawfully \n                residing'' each place it appears.\n    (b) CHIP.--Subparagraph (J) of section 2107(e)(1) of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1397gg(e)(1)) is amended to read as follows:\n                    ``(J) Paragraph (4) of section 1903(v) (relating to \n                lawfully present individuals).''.\n    (c) Effective Date.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n        amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date \n        of the enactment of this Act and shall apply to services \n        furnished on or after the date that is 90 days after such date \n        of the enactment.\n            (2) Exception if state legislation required.--In the case \n        of a State plan for medical assistance under title XIX, or a \n        State child health plan under title XXI, of the Social Security \n        Act which the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines \n        requires State legislation (other than legislation \n        appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet the \n        additional requirements imposed by the amendments made by this \n        section, the respective State plan shall not be regarded as \n        failing to comply with the requirements of such title solely on \n        the basis of its failure to meet these additional requirements \n        before the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning \n        after the close of the first regular session of the State \n        legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of this \n        Act. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a \n        State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such \n        session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the \n        State legislature.\n\nSEC. 4.
