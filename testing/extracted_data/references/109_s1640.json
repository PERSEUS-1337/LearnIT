FINDINGS AND GOALS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States experiences tremendous generosity and \n        goodwill in the wake of natural disasters;\n            (2) unfortunately, some unscrupulous individuals take \n        advantage of those disasters in an attempt to gain financially;\n            (3) the Federal Trade Commission is charged with preventing \n        unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or \n        practices under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act \n        (15 U.S.C. 45);\n            (4) the Federal Trade Commission has extensive experience \n        analyzing markets and competitive issues in order to determine \n        whether market participants are engaging in actions that may \n        have anticompetitive effects; and\n            (5) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n        of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the \n        House of Representatives are charged by their respective Houses \n        with consumer protection.\n    (b) Goals.--The goals of this Act are--\n            (1) to decrease the occurrence of persons charging \n        unconscionably excessive prices for consumer goods and services \n        following natural disasters;\n            (2) to require the Federal Trade Commission to conduct \n        ongoing investigations of actions intended to disadvantage \n        consumers following natural disasters; and\n            (3) to ensure that sufficient enforcement authority is \n        available to the Commission to carry out the responsibilities \n        of the Commission under this Act and the amendments made by \n        this Act.\n\nSEC. 3. PRICE GOUGING PROHIBITION FOLLOWING MAJOR DISASTERS.\n\n    The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) is \namended--\n            (1) by redesignating sections 25 and 26 as sections 26 and \n        27, respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 24 the following:\n\n``SEC. 25.
