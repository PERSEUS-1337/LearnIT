FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is no reliable information on the amount of \n        ammunition available;\n            (2) importers and manufacturers of ammunition are not \n        required to keep records to report to the Federal Government on \n        ammunition imported, produced, or shipped;\n            (3) the rate of bullet-related deaths in the United States \n        is unacceptably high and growing;\n            (4) three calibers of bullets are used disproportionately \n        in crime: 9 millimeter, .25 caliber, and .32 caliber bullets;\n            (5) injury and death are greatest in young males, and \n        particularly young black males;\n            (6) epidemiology can be used to study bullet-related death \n        and injury to evaluate control options;\n            (7) bullet-related death and injury has placed increased \n        stress on the American family resulting in increased welfare \n        expenditures under title IV of the Social Security Act;\n            (8) bullet-related death and injury have contributed to the \n        increase in Medicaid expenditures under title XIX of the Social \n        Security Act;\n            (9) bullet-related death and injury have contributed to \n        increased supplemental security income benefits under title XVI \n        of the Social Security Act;\n            (10) a tax on the sale of bullets will help control bullet-\n        related death and injury;\n            (11) there is no central responsible agency for trauma, \n        there is relatively little funding available for the study of \n        bullet-related death and injury, and there are large gaps in \n        research programs to reduce injury;\n            (12) current laws and programs relevant to the loss of life \n        and productivity from bullet-related trauma are inadequate to \n        protect the citizens of the United States; and\n            (13) increased research in bullet-related violence is \n        needed to better understand the causes of such violence, to \n        develop options for controlling such violence, and to identify \n        and overcome barriers to implementing effective controls.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to increase the tax on the sale of 9 millimeter, .25 \n        caliber, and .32 caliber bullets (except with respect to any \n        sale to law enforcement agencies) as a means of reducing the \n        epidemic of bullet-related death and injury;\n            (2) to undertake a nationally coordinated effort to survey, \n        collect, inventory, synthesize, and disseminate adequate data \n        and information for--\n                    (A) understanding the full range of bullet-related \n                death and injury, including impacts on the family \n                structure and increased demands for benefit payments \n                under provisions of the Social Security Act;\n                    (B) assessing the rate and magnitude of change in \n                bullet-related death and injury over time;\n                    (C) educating the public about the extent of \n                bullet-related death and injury; and\n                    (D) expanding the epidemiologic approach to \n                evaluate efforts to control bullet-related death and \n                injury and other forms of violence;\n            (3) to develop options for controlling bullet-related death \n        and injury;\n            (4) to build the capacity and encourage responsibility at \n        the individual, group, community, State and Federal levels for \n        control and elimination of bullet-related death and injury; and\n            (5) to promote a better understanding of the utility of the \n        epidemiologic approach for evaluating options to control or \n        reduce death and injury from nonbullet-related violence.\n\n            TITLE I--BULLET DEATH AND INJURY CONTROL PROGRAM\n\nSEC. 101.
