SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Jobs, On-the-Job `Earn While You \nLearn' Training, and Apprenticeships for African-American Young Men \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) African-American young men ages 18 to 39 are the \n        hardest hit in unemployment, with an unemployment rate of 41 \n        percent nationally, and in some States and cities, especially \n        inner cities, higher than 50 percent;\n            (2) this extraordinarily high unemployment rate has a \n        terrible rippling impact on the breakdown of the family \n        structure, as men in this age group are in the primary child-\n        producing ages; and\n            (3) an unemployment rate of 40 to 50 percent among African-\n        American young men, many of who are fathers who, without jobs, \n        and are unable to provide for their families, is not only a \n        national crisis but a national tragedy.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to secure jobs, on-the-job \ntraining, and apprenticeships for African-American young men ages 18 to \n39 with the labor unions, general contractors, and businesses who will \nrebuild the Nation's crumbling infrastructure in cities and communities \nthroughout the Nation.\n\nSEC. 3. URGING EMPLOYMENT, ON-THE-JOB TRAINING, AND APPRENTICESHIPS FOR \n              UNEMPLOYED AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUNG MEN IN REBUILDING THE \n              NATION'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Labor shall strongly and urgently \nrequest those labor unions, general contractors, and businesses, who \nwill rebuild the Nation's crumbling infrastructure, transportation \nsystems, technology and computer networks, and energy distribution \nsystems, to actively recruit, hire, and provide on-the-job training to \nAfrican-American young men ages 18 to 39 through their existing jobs, \napprenticeships, and ``earn while you learn'' programs. The Secretary \nshall provide assistance to such labor unions, general contractors, and \nbusinesses through every means available to help coordinate the \nrecruitment of such individuals for such jobs, on-the-job training, and \napprenticeships.\n    (b) Coordination.--The jobs, on-the-job training, and \napprenticeships made available by labor unions, general contractors, \nand businesses described in subsection (a) shall be conducted in \nconjunction with the Secretary of Labor and the labor unions and other \nassociations which have been identified as those primarily involved in \nthe infrastructure rebuilding described in such subsection, including \nthe International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the United \nAssociation of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe \nFitting Industry of the United States and Canada, the International \nAssociation of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron \nWorkers Union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the National \nElectrical Contractors Association, the International Association of \nSheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART), the \nLaborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA), the \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE), and the United \nSteelworkers (USW). Such coordination shall also be done in conjunction \nwith the National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee, which \nallows apprentices to earn while they learn.\n    (c) Recruitment.--The labor unions, general contractors, and \nbusinesses described in subsections (a) and (b) shall recruit African-\nAmerican young men for the jobs, on-the-job training, and \napprenticeships described in subsection (a) by reaching out and seeking \nassistance from within the African-American community, churches, the \nNational Urban League, the NAACP, 100 Black Men of America, high school \nand college job placement offices, media outlets, and other African-\nAmerican organizations that can offer valuable assistance to the \nSecretary of Labor, the labor unions, general contractors, and \nbusinesses with identifying, locating, and contacting unemployed \nAfrican-American young men who want jobs, on-the-job training, and \napprenticeships. These African-American organizations have a long and \nrich history of working to improve the lives of African-Americans, and \ncan be very helpful in successfully reaching, contacting, and \nrecruiting unemployed African-American young men.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that this Act--\n            (1) while rebuilding the crumbling infrastructure of this \n        great Nation, will simultaneously help create good paying jobs \n        and job training that will provide African-American young men \n        ages 18 to 39 with the technical skills, computer capabilities, \n        and other skills necessary in this high technology-driven job \n        market, thus providing African-American young men with highly \n        developed skills that will make them very competitive and \n        attractive to many employers; and\n            (2) greatly exemplifies and strengthens the high nobility \n        of purpose that is the founding grace of this great Nation."
