FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) California's Russian River and its tributaries contain \n        anadromous fish resources that are an important component of \n        the local, regional, and State commercial and sport \n        recreational fisheries. The commercial and recreational harvest \n        of Russian River salmon and steelhead has historically made an \n        important contribution to local economies.\n            (2) The Russian River supported one of the most productive \n        steelhead fisheries in North America as recently as 1940.\n            (3) In the recent past, the Russian River supported an \n        abundant population of coho salmon and still contains a remnant \n        population of this species, which has been proposed for listing \n        under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n        seq.).\n            (4) The Russian River provides numerous other beneficial \n        uses to the many people who inhabit its basin. The River is a \n        source of drinking and irrigation water, a popular destination \n        for recreational water sports enthusiasts, the soil source for \n        prime agricultural bottom lands, the primary local source of \n        aggregate resources, and the source of hydroelectric power \n        generated by 2 major dams.\n            (5) Development of the Russian River for beneficial uses \n        has resulted in the degradation of the river system's riparian \n        areas, streambed, water quality and stream flows. The net \n        result of construction and operation of dams and agricultural \n        water diversions, water conveyance from the Eel River, past \n        gravel mining, timber harvest practices, road building \n        activities, and residential and agricultural development of \n        flood plains has been a substantial degradation of fish habitat \n        in the River. These environmental alterations have caused a \n        major decline in salmon and steelhead fish populations in the \n        River, and have also had a negative impact on several other \n        beneficial uses.\n            (6) The Federal Government, through the construction of \n        Coyote Dam in Mendocino County and Warm Springs Dam in Sonoma \n        County and the Russian River Flood Control Project, is \n        substantially responsible for the loss and degradation of fish \n        habitat in the River.\n            (7) Overlapping Federal, State, and local jurisdictions \n        have historically hampered fishery conservation efforts and \n        prevented the Federal Government and the State of California \n        from fulfilling their responsibilities to protect the River's \n        anadromous fishery resources.\n            (8) The California Department of Fish and Game has \n        authority under State law to direct the restoration of the \n        State's anadromous fishery resources in accordance with \n        comprehensive river basin anadromous fisheries restoration \n        plans. The department is in the process of developing a basin \n        plan for the Russian River.\n            (9) The California State Coastal Conservancy is in the \n        process of producing a resource enhancement and restoration \n        plan for the main stem of the Russian River.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To protect and restore the River's anadromous fish \n        habitat for the purpose of optimizing production of salmon and \n        steelhead.\n            (2) To foster cooperation between Federal, State, and local \n        agencies in protecting, restoring, and enhancing the River's \n        anadromous fishery resources.\n            (3) To construct a pilot project for the purpose of testing \n        and demonstrating the benefits of large scale main stem river \n        channel restoration and stream corridor management.\n            (4) To review the operation of Federal dam and flood \n        control projects and assess the environmental impacts of their \n        operation on the River.\n            (5) To provide matching funds, if necessary, for the \n        development of the Program Plan, and to provide funds to begin \n        implementation of the Program Plan and for monitoring and \n        evaluating implementation of the program.\n\nSEC. 4. PILOT PROJECT TO REESTABLISH RIVER CHANNEL AND FLOODWAY; FISH \n              HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS.\n\n    (a) River Channel and Floodway Project.--The Administrator shall \nconduct 1 or more pilot projects on the main channel of the River which \nmay be identified in the Resource Plan, to demonstrate measures to \nreestablish a channel and floodway in dynamic equilibrium with the \nRiver and to prevent the down cutting of the River bed. The goals of \nthe pilot projects shall be to create in-stream fish and wildlife \nhabitat, reduce bank erosion and loss of riparian vegetation, and \naccommodate high flows without accompanying damage to land or property. \nTo the extent practicable, activities on the main river channel under \nthe pilot project shall be integrated with projects on tributaries and \nbasin-wide water management, and shall account for the physical and \necological interdependency within the watershed. This project will only \nbe completed with willing landowners. The Administrator may contract \nwith the California State Coastal Conservancy to carry out the pilot \nprojects.\n    (b) Fish Habitat Restoration Project.--The Chief, working through \nthe Resource Conservation Districts and with the California Department \nof Fish and Game, shall carry out high priority fish habitat \nrestoration projects on the River's tributaries or watershed \nrestoration projects that are identified in and are consistent with the \nobjectives of the Program Plan.\n    (c) Cooperation With Other Agencies.--The Administrator and the \nChief shall work with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, \nNational Marine Fisheries Service, Army Corps of Engineers, and the \nState of California in carrying out activities under this section.\n    (d) Grants to States.--The Administrator and the Chief shall use \ntheir existing authorities to award grants or contracts (or both) to \nState or local agencies (or both) to carry out this section and for \nmonitoring activities under this section.\n    (e) Report.--Not later than September 30, 1996, the Administrator \nand the Chief shall each report to the Congress on progress made toward \nimplementing this section.\n    (f) Review of Coyote Dam and Warm Springs Dam.--\n            (1) Review.--The Secretary in consultation with the \n        Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service shall \n        review the effects of the operation and water release schedule \n        of the Coyote Dam in Mendocino County on bank erosion problems, \n        river channel down cutting, decreases in ground water supplies \n        and scour of riparian habitat. The Secretary shall identify \n        alternative release schedules which will reduce adverse impacts \n        along the River and provide fisheries habitat benefits. The \n        Secretary shall also review channel clearing and maintenance \n        measures currently required along the Alexander Valley reach of \n        the River channel as part of the Russian River Flood Control \n        project for their adverse environmental effects on fisheries \n        habitat in the River. The Secretary shall identify alternative \n        measures which reduce bank erosion problems and promote \n        riparian and fisheries habitat restoration while providing the \n        same or higher level of flood water channel capacity as the \n        original 1955 Federal project. Further, the Secretary shall \n        review the effects that operation of Warm Springs dam will have \n        on fish habitat in Dry Creek and downstream reaches of the \n        River, including potential effects that the project will have \n        on the middle reach of the River when fully operational.\n            (2) Report.--Not later than September 30, 1996, the \n        Secretary shall report to the Congress the results of the \n        reviews under this subsection.\n\nSEC. 5.
