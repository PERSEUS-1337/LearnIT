Such \n        authority shall commence beginning no earlier than the first \n        day of the calendar quarter that is at least 6 months after the \n        date that the State enacts legislation to implement each of the \n        following minimum simplification requirements:\n                    (A) Provide--\n                            (i) a single State-level agency to \n                        administer all sales and use tax laws, \n                        including the collection and administration of \n                        all State and applicable locality sales and use \n                        taxes for all sales sourced to the State made \n                        by remote sellers,\n                            (ii) a single audit for all State and local \n                        taxing jurisdictions within that State, and\n                            (iii) a single sales and use tax return to \n                        be used by remote sellers and single and \n                        consolidated providers and to be filed with the \n                        State-level agency.\n                    (B) Provide a uniform sales and use tax base among \n                the State and the local taxing jurisdictions within the \n                State.\n                    (C) Require remote sellers and single and \n                consolidated providers to collect sales and use taxes \n                pursuant to the applicable destination rate, which is \n                the sum of the applicable State rate and any applicable \n                rate for the local jurisdiction into which the sale is \n                made.\n                    (D) Provide--\n                            (i) adequate software and services to \n                        remote sellers and single and consolidated \n                        providers that identifies the applicable \n                        destination rate, including the State and local \n                        sales tax rate (if any), to be applied on sales \n                        sourced to the State, and\n                            (ii) certification procedures for both \n                        single providers and consolidated providers to \n                        make software and services available to remote \n                        sellers, and hold such providers harmless for \n                        any errors or omissions as a result of relying \n                        on information provided by the State.\n                    (E) Hold remote sellers using a single or \n                consolidated provider harmless for any errors and \n                omissions by that provider.\n                    (F) Relieve remote sellers from liability to the \n                State or locality for collection of the incorrect \n                amount of sales or use tax, including any penalties or \n                interest, if collection of the improper amount is the \n                result of relying on information provided by the State.\n                    (G) Provide remote sellers and single and \n                consolidated providers with 30 days notice of a rate \n                change by any locality in the State.\n            (2) Treatment of local rate changes.--For purposes of this \n        subsection, local rate changes may only be effective on the \n        first day of a calendar quarter.
