    "content": "FOIA does not require requests for agency information to be submitted in a particular format, only that the request reasonably describes the records sought and complies with agency regulations. Most agencies accept requests via mail, email, web form, or fax. The statute also requires the affirmative disclosure of certain categories of agency information, such as \"substantive rules of general applicability,\" \"rules of procedure,\" and, since 2016, records requested three or more times. While the text of FOIA does not specifically dictate the method in which the public must request information from an agency, FOIA does prescribe how an agency is to respond to the request. From an administrative perspective, FOIA directs the amount of time an agency has to respond to a request, defines whether and how an agency may recoup costs for providing services in response to a request, and provides nine instances where an agency may exempt information from public disclosure.  After an agency receives a request, the agency is to inform the requester of its receipt. Generally, an agency is to respond to a correctly routed, simple request within 20 days with a determination of the scope of the documents the agency will produce and any exemptions it will apply to withhold records or information. Complex or incorrectly routed requests may be subject to additional days of processing, per the statute (5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7552(a)(6)). Also, agencies managing backlog s of FOIA requests do not always process requests within the statutory period. When completed, a written response may provide the information requested or some of the information requested with redactions per one of FOIA's nine exemptions, inform the requester that the agency does not have responsive records, or deny a request entirely due to one of the nine exemptions. Requesters may administratively appeal an agency's adverse decision. Government information requests through FOIA may be impacted by COVID-19 in two ways: (1) certain types of information related to the outbreak may be eligible for expedited consideration; and (2) processes for locating information may change due to employees working remotely or on administrative leave. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7552(a)(6)(E), processing of FOIA requests is to be expedited as soon as practicable in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need. Statute defines a \"compelling need\" as a case where  the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to someone's life or physical safety; or there is an urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, but only if the request is made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.  Agencies may also establish additional standards for granting expedited processing. Whereas agencies are to initially respond to most FOIA requests within 20 days, they must determine whether to grant expedited processing within 10 days.  Locating information responsive to a FOIA request requires employees and systems to search and review the information . Additionally, not all agency information is created or available in a digital format. Per the Department of Justice's FOIA.gov portal,  There is no central office in the government that handles FOIA requests for all federal departments and agencies.... There are many different officials at these agencies who work hard every day to make sure that the FOIA works. There are the FOIA professionals who search for and process records in response to FOIA requests, FOIA Contacts and FOIA Public Liaisons who work with FOIA requesters to answer questions and resolve concerns, and Chief FOIA Officers who oversee their agency's compliance with the FOIA. Because of the decentralized FOIA process at federal agencies, multiple physical and digital systems and many people may be involved in processing a single request. However, given the work flexibilities at many agencies due to COVID-19, some or all of the members of an agency's FOIA team may currently be working offsite. If a record responsive to a request is only available on-site in a paper format, that record's practical availability may be limited by these conditions. While challenges in locating responsive information may occur at any agency, responses to requests for information during the COVID-19 outbreak have varied. CRS performed a search of federal department websites and their components. As of March 26, 2020, CRS identified statements by 13 agencies regarding COVID-19's impact on FOIA request processing.   Table 1 presents these recent statements regarding the impact of COVID-19 or simply changes in agencies' abilities to process FOIA requests, provides Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) citations to each agency's policy regarding expedited FOIA requests, and notes whether the agency has made additional allowances for expediting requests. The table should be considered a snapshot in time, as agencies may update or change their statements. Of the 13 agencies identified, 8 altered the transmission method by which a FOIA request should be submitted. Some statements also discuss current operating status, and mention anticipated delays due to COVID-19. Six of the identified agencies have additional allowances for expediting requests: U.S. Air Force, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Labor, Department of Veterans Affairs, National Archives and Records Administration, and Office of Government Information Services. Of the six agencies that established additional allowances for expediting requests, five permit expediting cases where due process rights would be impacted, four permit expediting cases where there exist possible questions affecting public confidence in the federal government's integrity, one permits expediting due to humanitarian needs, and one permits expediting at the discretion of the agency's FOIA Officer. The exact language from the C.F.R. is provided in Table 1 below."
