Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE) http://www.dsireusa.org/ DSIRE's website is sponsored by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). IREC is a nonprofit organization focused on standards, guidelines, and other activities to support renewable energy. This site contains information about various types of energy efficiency and renewable energy financial incentives provided by state and local governments and utility companies. Summary data is accessed through a national map\u2014and several additional special topic maps\u2014that are linked to data on each state. Alternatively, the data can be searched by technology (solar, wind, geothermal), sector (residential, commercial/industrial, government, utility), and incentive type (tax credits, bonds, grants, loans), and eligible and implementing sectors. The site is updated weekly. Also, the homepage includes a map-link to a list of federal incentives.

Check the \"applicant eligibility\" section in the CFDA program description to see who may apply. Individuals may be eligible to apply for funds after they have been distributed at the state and local level, through their state energy offices or other contact listed in the CFDA program description.
