FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 109th Congress passed the National Aeronautics and \n        Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 overwhelmingly, \n        establishing as the National Aeronautics and Space \n        Administration's priority human space flight goal: ``To develop \n        a sustained human presence on the Moon . . . to promote \n        exploration, commerce, science, and United States preeminence \n        in space as a stepping stone for the future exploration of Mars \n        and other destinations.''.\n            (2) The 110th Congress overwhelmingly reaffirmed the vision \n        of returning to the Moon as an integral part of exploring \n        further into our solar system through the passage of the \n        National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act \n        of 2008, expressing support for ``the broad goals of the space \n        exploration policy of the United States, including the eventual \n        return to and exploration of the Moon and other destinations in \n        the solar system and the important national imperative of \n        independent access to space''.\n            (3) The 111th Congress, in the National Aeronautics and \n        Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010, called for the \n        development of a heavy lift capability of greater than 130 \n        metric tons consisting of the Space Launch System (SLS) and \n        Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) to pursue exploration, yet \n        fell short on explicitly stating a clear destination.\n            (4) The 112th Congress has reaffirmed this commitment to \n        the development of a heavy lift capability.\n            (5) A sustained human presence on the Moon will allow \n        astronauts and researchers the opportunity to leverage new \n        technologies in addressing the challenges of sustaining life on \n        another celestial body, lessons which are necessary and \n        applicable as we explore further into our solar system, to Mars \n        and beyond.\n            (6) A sustained human presence on the Moon would once again \n        inspire and engage public interest in our space program, \n        motivating young people to excel in the vital subjects of math \n        and science, subjects in which American students lag behind our \n        international competitors.\n            (7) A sustained human presence on the Moon would challenge \n        American industry to continue to develop technologies that not \n        only enhance our exploration programs but can be applied across \n        all disciplines of science.\n            (8) The commercial applications of space technologies have \n        had tens of billions of dollars in economic impact, including \n        products from semiconductors and aircraft controls to scratch-\n        resistant lenses and water purification systems.\n            (9) The healthcare technologies derived from our space \n        program, such as the portable x-ray machine, the MRI, advanced \n        life-saving diagnostics, and the implantable heart aid, have \n        saved and improved countless lives.\n            (10) Space is the world's ultimate high ground, returning \n        to the Moon and reinvigorating our human space flight program \n        is a matter of national security.\n            (11) Technologies developed and sustained by the National \n        Aeronautics and Space Administration's human space flight \n        program, such as liquid and solid rocket propulsion, \n        environmental and life support systems, and communications, \n        navigation, and control systems are important to our military.\n            (12) China and Russia, understanding the economic and \n        strategic importance of human space flight, have declared their \n        intentions of colonizing the Moon and are advancing their lunar \n        exploration plans.\n            (13) It is strategically important that the United States \n        possess and maintain the capabilities of unfettered operation \n        in the space domain, and not cede the space domain to other \n        nations.\n\nSEC. 3. MISSION.\n\n    In accordance with the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration Authorization Act of 2005, which established as the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration's priority goal: ``To \ndevelop a sustained human presence on the Moon . . . to promote \nexploration, commerce, science, and United States preeminence in space \nas a stepping stone for the future exploration of Mars and other \ndestinations.'', and in accordance with the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration Authorization Act of 2008, which endorsed ``the \nbroad goals of the space exploration policy of the United States, \nincluding the eventual return to and exploration of the Moon and other \ndestinations in the solar system and the important national imperative \nof independent access to space'', the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration shall plan to return to the Moon by 2022 and develop a \nsustained human presence on the Moon, in order to promote exploration, \ncommerce, science, and United States preeminence in space as a stepping \nstone for the future exploration of Mars and other destinations. The \nbudget requests and expenditures of the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration shall be consistent with achieving this goal."
