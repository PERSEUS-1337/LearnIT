FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are systems of public school finance within \n        States which subject American children to educations of \n        radically varying and grossly unequal quality solely on the \n        basis of where they live.\n            (2) Agreement with the unanimous Supreme Court decision of \n        Brown v. Board of Education which stated: ``In these days, it \n        is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to \n        succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an \n        education. Such an opportunity, where the State has undertaken \n        to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all \n        on equal terms.''.\n            (3) Education is a fundamental right under the equal \n        protection clause of the United States Constitution.\n            (4) The provision of education to all children within a \n        State on an equal basis, including equality of financial \n        resources, is fundamental to the equal protection of laws.\n\nSEC. 3. EQUALIZATION SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) In General.--No State shall be eligible for Federal funds \nadministered by the Department of Education to support elementary and \nsecondary education unless the coefficient of variation (referred to in \nthis Act as ``COV'') of per pupil expenditures in local educational \nagencies statewide for elementary and secondary education in such State \nis less than 10 percent.\n    (b) Calculation.--The COV shall be calculated based on intrastate \nexpenditures for current operations, as determined by the State, \nwithout regard to Federal contributions.\n    (c) Additional Exclusions.--\n            (1) Special purpose.--Also excluded from the COV \n        calculation shall be capital expenditures and special purpose \n        funds without regard to source. Special purpose funds are funds \n        which are targeted to address a specific need, such as the \n        educationally disadvantaged, handicapped, gifted, or language \n        deficient students.\n            (2) Resources.--Nothing in this Act shall preclude the \n        State or the Federal Government from providing additional \n        resources to local educational agencies to address such special \n        needs.\n    (d) Waiver.--The Secretary may provide funding for elementary and \nsecondary education to a State which has not complied with the \nrequirements of this section if the State submits a plan for compliance \nwhich the Secretary determines will bring the State into compliance not \nlater than 5 years after the date of submission of such plan.\n\nSEC. 4. COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Annual report.--To be eligible to receive Federal \n        education funds, a State shall submit an annual report to the \n        Secretary which certifies that the State has complied with the \n        provisions of this Act.\n            (2) Certifications.--Such certifications are due not later \n        than January 1 of each fiscal year and shall be accepted by the \n        Secretary unless challenged by 1 or more local educational \n        agencies.\n    (b) Certification Challenge.--To challenge the validity of a \nState's compliance certification, local educational agencies that \nrepresent not less than 10 percent of the students in such State must \nfile a complaint with the Secretary, not later than 90 days after the \ndate on which the certification is due.\n    (c) Compliance.--\n            (1) In general.--The failure of a State to comply with the \n        provisions of this Act shall result in the loss of eligibility \n        for Federal education funds identified in section 3(a) \n        beginning in the first fiscal year after a finding of \n        noncompliance by the Secretary. Eligibility for such funds \n        shall be restored at the beginning of the next fiscal year in \n        which the Secretary finds the State to be in compliance.\n            (2) Federal funds.--The failure of a State to comply with \n        the provisions of this Act for a period that exceeds 5 years \n        from the date of the enactment of this Act or the submission of \n        a plan under section 3(d), whichever is longer, shall lose all \n        forms of Federal assistance beginning in the first fiscal year \n        after such 5-year period until the State complies with the \n        provisions of this Act.\n    (d) Redistribution of Funds.--Funds for elementary and secondary \neducation that are not distributed to a State as a result of applying \nsubsection (c) shall be reallocated by the Secretary to other States \nthat have complied with the requirements of section 3, that are \nimplementing compliance plans, or are developing compliance plans \npursuant to section 3(d).\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act the following terms have the following \nmeanings:\n            (1) The term ``coefficient of variation'' means the \n        standard deviation of local educational agency expenditures \n        divided by the mean per student expenditure, in which local \n        educational agencies with fewer than 250 students have been \n        excluded.\n            (2) The term ``local educational agency'' has the same \n        meaning given such term in section 14101(18) of the Elementary \n        and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801(18)).\n            (3) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Education."
