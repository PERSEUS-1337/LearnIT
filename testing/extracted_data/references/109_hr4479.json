    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Consumer Relief Act of \n2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) During 2005, the price of crude oil reached a record \n        $70 a barrel, the price of gas at the pump reached a record \n        price of $3 per gallon, and the price of natural gas reached a \n        record of $14.75 per million BTUs on October 5, 2005.\n            (2) Record highs in oil and natural gas prices have \n        resulted in record profits for oil and natural gas producers \n        and refiners. In October 2005, the five largest oil companies \n        reported a total of $32.7 billion in the third quarter profits, \n        a record increase of 52 percent over last year. Exxon Mobil \n        recorded $9.9 billion, a 75 percent increase in profits; \n        ChevronTexaco recorded $3.6 billion, a 13 percent increase in \n        profits; Conoco Phillips recorded $3.8 billion, an 89 percent \n        increase in profits; BP recorded $6.5 billion, a 34 percent \n        increase in profits; and Royal Dutch Shell recorded $9.03 \n        billion, a 68 percent increase in profits. Over the first three \n        quarters of the year, the top five oil companies recorded a \n        combined total of $81 billion in profits.\n            (3) Higher oil company profits have been accompanied by a \n        dramatic increase in pay and compensation for the senior \n        executives at major oil companies. The total 2004 direct \n        compensation for the top five oil and gas company executives, \n        as reported in a Wall Street Journal survey, averaged $16.5 \n        million, double the prior year.\n            (4) The CEO's of the top five oil companies stated at a \n        November 9, 2005, joint hearing of the Senate Energy and \n        Natural Resource Committee and the Senate Environment and \n        Public Works Committee that their respective companies did not \n        need the Federal tax incentives provided in the Energy Policy \n        Act of 2005.\n            (5) The effective tax rates of the top five oil companies \n        averaged 13.3 percent over the three-year period 2001-2003, \n        well below the 35 percent rate, and in contrast to those in the \n        health care industry, the financial industry, the \n        pharmaceutical industry, the computer industry and the chemical \n        industry.\n            (6) Oil prices are projected to remain high for the \n        foreseeable future, translating into continued high oil company \n        profits. According to the Administrator of the Energy \n        Information Administration, the Administration's 2006 Annual \n        Energy Outlook will forecast an oil price in 2025 that is \n        nearly $20 a barrel higher than the 2005 Outlook.\n            (7) The Federal budget deficit this year was $319 billion, \n        the third largest in history, and the national debt is \n        currently above $8 trillion.\n            (8) In light of the size of the Federal budget deficit and \n        the national debt, the record price of oil and natural gas, and \n        the historic profits earned by oil and natural gas producers, \n        there is no justification for granting such companies special \n        tax breaks and exemptions from paying royalties for drilling \n        for oil and natural gas on public lands, as was authorized in \n        the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n            (9) Home heating costs are expected to jump dramatically \n        this winter, even after consumers have paid hundred of dollars \n        more this year in gasoline costs. This is squeezing the \n        pocketbooks of millions of hard-working families. Americans who \n        heat their homes with natural gas could see their fuel costs \n        increase as much as 50 percent in some parts of the country. On \n        average, the more than half of all American households heating \n        with natural gas are expected to spend 38 percent more this \n        winter on fuel. Households heating with heating oil can expect \n        to pay 21 percent more this winter. The National Energy \n        Assistance Directors' Association reports that the average \n        family using heating oil will pay nearly three times the amount \n        families paid in 2001 to 2002.\n\nSEC. 3.
