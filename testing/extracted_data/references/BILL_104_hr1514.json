For purposes of indexing \nchanges in consumer grade propane, residential electricity, residential \nnatural gas, and end user No. 2 fuel oil prices, the Secretary of \nCommerce shall use a 5-year rolling average price beginning with the \nyear 4 years prior to the establishment of the Council.\n    (b) Authority To Restrict Activities.--If in any year the 5-year \naverage rolling price index of consumer grade propane exceeds the 5-\nyear rolling average price composite index of residential electricity, \nresidential natural gas, and refiner price to end users of No. 2 fuel \noil in an amount greater than 10.1 percent, the activities of the \nCouncil shall be restricted to research and development, training, and \nsafety matters. The Council shall inform the Secretary of Energy and \nthe Congress of any restriction of activities under this subsection. \nUpon expiration of 180 days after the beginning of any such restriction \nof activities, the Secretary of Commerce shall again conduct the \npropane price analysis described in subsection (a).

RELATION TO OTHER PROGRAMS.\n\n    Nothing in this Act may be construed to preempt or supersede any \nother program relating to propane education and research organized and \noperated under the laws of the United States or any State.\n\nSEC. 12. REPORTS.\n\n    Within 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and at \nleast once every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary of Commerce shall \nprepare and submit to the Congress and the Secretary a report examining \nwhether operation of the Council, in conjunction with the cumulative \neffects of market changes and Federal programs, has had an effect on \npropane consumers, including residential, agriculture, process, and \nnonfuel users of propane. The Secretary of Commerce shall consider and, \nto the extent practicable, shall include in the report submissions by \npropane consumers, and shall consider whether there have been long-term \nand short-term effects on propane prices as a result of Council \nactivities and Federal programs, and whether there have been changes in \nthe proportion of propane demand attributable to various market \nsegments. To the extent that the report demonstrates that there has \nbeen an adverse effect, the Secretary of Commerce shall include \nrecommendations for correcting the situation. Upon petition by affected \nparties or upon request by the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of \nCommerce may prepare and submit the report required by this section at \nless than 2-year intervals.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
