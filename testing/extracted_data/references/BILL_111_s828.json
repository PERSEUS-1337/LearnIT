FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) creating the appropriate infrastructure to move \n        renewable fuels is a necessary energy and transportation \n        objective for the United States;\n            (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, more than 70 \n        percent of the gasoline supply of the United States is \n        delivered to local terminals through pipelines;\n            (3) pipelines are the most cost-effective, efficient, and \n        safe transportation mode in use in 2009 to deliver large \n        volumes of liquid fuels;\n            (4) as of the date of enactment of this Act, renewable \n        fuels are transported by truck, barge, and rail, and the volume \n        requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n        2007 (42 U.S.C. 17001 et seq.), and the amendments made by that \n        Act, will require an expansion of the renewable fuels \n        infrastructure;\n            (5) the transportation of renewable fuels through a \n        pipeline will facilitate the meeting of the volume requirements \n        of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. \n        17001 et seq.) and the amendments made by that Act; and\n            (6) the production and use of renewable fuels is supported \n        by Federal policy and a corresponding Federal policy is \n        necessary to support the construction of an appropriate \n        infrastructure to transport those fuels.\n\nSEC. 3. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR PROJECTS TO CONSTRUCT RENEWABLE FUEL \n              PIPELINES.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--Section 1701 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 \nU.S.C. 16511) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(6) Renewable fuel.--The term `renewable fuel' has the \n        meaning given the term in section 211(o)(1) of the Clean Air \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)), as in effect on January 1, 2009, \n        except that the term includes ethanol and biodiesel.\n            ``(7) Renewable fuel pipeline.--The term `renewable fuel \n        pipeline' means a common carrier pipeline for transporting \n        renewable fuel in accordance with this title.''.\n    (b) Specific Appropriation or Contribution.--Section 1702(b) of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16512(b)) is amended by striking \n``No'' and inserting ``Except with respect to a project described in \nsection 1703(f), no''.\n    (c) Amount.--Section 1702(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 \nU.S.C. 16512(c)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``(c) Amount.--Unless'' and inserting the \n        following:\n    ``(c) Amount.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Unless'';
