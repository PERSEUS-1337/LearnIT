Each standard shall be the maximum feasible average \n        fuel economy level that the Secretary decides the manufacturers \n        can achieve in that model year. The Secretary may prescribe \n        separate standards for different classes of passenger \n        automobiles.\n            ``(2) Minimum standard.--Except as provided in paragraph \n        (3), in prescribing a standard under paragraph (1), the \n        Secretary shall ensure that no manufacturer's standard for a \n        particular model year is less than the greater of--\n                    ``(A) the standard in effect on the date of \n                enactment of the Improved Passenger Automobile Fuel \n                Economy Act of 2007; or\n                    ``(B) a standard established in accordance with the \n                requirement of section 104(c)(2) of that Act.\n            ``(3) 40 miles per gallon standard for model year 2017.--\n        The Secretary shall prescribe an average fuel economy standard \n        for passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in \n        model year 2017 of 40 miles per gallon. If the Secretary \n        determines that more than 1 manufacturer is not reasonably \n        expected to achieve that standard, the Secretary shall notify \n        the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n        and the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and \n        Commerce of that determination.\n    ``(c) Flexibility of Authority.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The authority of the Secretary to \n        prescribe by regulation average fuel economy standards for \n        automobiles under this section includes the authority to \n        prescribe standards based on one or more vehicle attributes \n        that relate to fuel economy, and to express the standards in \n        the form of a mathematical function.

MARKET-BASED INITIATIVES.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Registry for Voluntary Trading Systems.--The \nSecretary of Commerce shall establish a national registry system for \ngreenhouse gas trading among industry under which emission reductions \nfrom the applicable baseline are assigned unique identifying numerical \ncodes by the registry. Participation in the registry is voluntary. Any \nentity conducting business in the United States may register its \nemission results, including emissions generated outside of the United \nStates, on an entity-wide basis with the registry, and may utilize the \nservices of the registry.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the national registry are--\n            (1) to encourage voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gas \n        emissions and increase energy efficiency, including increasing \n        the fuel economy of passenger automobiles and light trucks and \n        reducing the reliance by United States markets on petroleum \n        produced outside the United States used to provide vehicular \n        fuel;\n            (2) to enable participating entities to record voluntary \n        greenhouse gas emissions reductions; in a consistent format \n        that is supported by third party verification;\n            (3) to encourage participants involved in existing \n        partnerships to be able to trade emissions reductions among \n        partnerships;\n            (4) to further recognize, publicize, and promote \n        registrants making voluntary and mandatory reductions;\n            (5) to recruit more participants in the program; and\n            (6) to help various entities in the nation establish \n        emissions baselines.\n    (c) Functions.--The national registry shall carry out the following \nfunctions:\n            (1) Referrals.--Provide referrals to approved providers for \n        advice on--\n                    (A) designing programs to establish emissions \n                baselines and to monitor and track greenhouse gas \n                emissions; and\n                    (B) establishing emissions reduction goals based on \n                international best practices for specific industries \n                and economic sectors.\n            (2) Uniform reporting format.--Adopt a uniform format for \n        reporting emissions baselines and reductions established \n        through--\n                    (A) the Director of the National Institute of \n                Standards and Technology for greenhouse gas baselines \n                and reductions generally; and\n                    (B) the Secretary of Transportation for credits \n                under section 32903 of title 49, United States Code.\n            (3) Record maintenance.--Maintain a record of all emission \n        baselines and reductions verified by qualified independent \n        auditors.\n            (4) Encourage participation.--Encourage organizations from \n        various sectors to monitor emissions, establish baselines and \n        reduction targets, and implement efficiency improvement and \n        renewable energy programs to achieve those targets.\n            (5) Public awareness.--Recognize, publicize, and promote \n        participants that--\n                    (A) commit to monitor their emissions and set \n                reduction targets;\n                    (B) establish emission baselines; and\n                    (C) report on the amount of progress made on their \n                annual emissions.\n    (d) Transfer of Reductions.--The registry shall--\n            (1) allow for the transfer of ownership of any reductions \n        realized in accordance with the program; and\n            (2) require that the registry be notified of any such \n        transfer within 30 days after the transfer is effected.\n    (e) Future Considerations.--Any reductions achieved under this \nprogram shall be credited against any future mandatory greenhouse gas \nreductions required by the government. Final approval of the amount and \nvalue of credits shall be determined by the agency responsible for the \nimplementation of the mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction \nprogram, except that credits under section 32903 of title 49, United \nStates Code, shall be determined by the Secretary of Transportation. \nThe Secretary of Commerce shall by rule establish an appeals process, \nthat may incorporate an arbitration option, for resolving any dispute \narising out of such a determination made by that agency.\n    (f) CAFE Standards Credits.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \nwork with the Secretary of Commerce and the implementing panel \nestablished by section 202 to determine the equivalency of credits \nearned under section 32903 of title 49, United States Code, for \ninclusion in the registry. The Secretary shall by rule establish an \nappeals process, that may incorporate an arbitration option, for \nresolving any dispute arising out of such a determination.\n\nSEC. 202.
