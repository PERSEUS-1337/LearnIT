FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the evidence for human-induced climate change is \n        overwhelming and undeniable;\n            (2) the United States is the second highest emitter of \n        carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the world;\n            (3) atmospheric carbon can be significantly reduced through \n        conservation, by shifting to renewable energy sources such as \n        solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal, and by increasing the \n        efficiency of buildings, including domiciles, and \n        transportation;\n            (4) providing clear information about climate change, in a \n        variety of forms, can remove the fear and the sense of \n        helplessness, and encourage individuals and communities to take \n        action;\n            (5) implementation of measures that promote energy \n        efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy will greatly \n        reduce human impact on the environment; and\n            (6) informing people of new technologies and programs as \n        they become available will ensure maximum understanding and \n        maximum impact of those measures.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``climate change education'' means informal \nand formal interdisciplinary learning at all age levels about climate \nchange and its effects on environmental, energy, social, and economic \nsystems.\n\nSEC. 4. CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION PROGRAM.\n\n    The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall establish \na Climate Change Education Program to--\n            (1) broaden the understanding of human induced climate \n        change, possible long-term and short-term consequences, and \n        potential solutions;\n            (2) apply the latest scientific and technological \n        discoveries to provide formal and informal learning \n        opportunities to people of all ages, including those of diverse \n        cultural and linguistic backgrounds;\n            (3) emphasize actionable information to help people \n        understand and to promote implementation of new technologies, \n        programs, and incentives related to energy conservation, \n        renewable energy, and greenhouse gas reduction; and\n            (4) inform the public of impacts to human health and safety \n        as a result of climate change.\n\nSEC. 5. PROGRAM ELEMENTS.\n\n    The Climate Change Education Program shall include--\n            (1) a national information campaign to disseminate \n        information on and promote implementation of the new \n        technologies, programs, and incentives described in section \n        4(3); and\n            (2) the grant program described in section 6.\n\nSEC. 6. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall establish \na program to make grants--\n            (1) to support national public education, outreach, and \n        communication programs to engage substantial numbers of the \n        public in understanding climate change while developing \n        educated and empowered consumers, investors, and citizens;\n            (2) to encourage and support statewide plans and programs \n        for climate change education, including relevant teacher \n        training and professional development, STEM (science, \n        technology, engineering, and mathematics) education, and \n        multidisciplinary studies to ensure that students graduate from \n        high school climate literate, with a particular focus on \n        programs that advance widespread State and local educational \n        agency adoption of climate change education, including funding \n        for State education agencies to--\n                    (A) integrate key principles of climate change \n                education into existing K-12 State academic content \n                standards, student academic achievement standards, or \n                State curriculum frameworks;\n                    (B) create model State climate change curricula; or\n                    (C) create State green school building standards or \n                policies;\n            (3) to improve the quality of and access to higher \n        education in green collar industries and green economy-related \n        fields such as green business, technology, engineering, policy \n        studies, and sustainability science, with a particular focus on \n        programs that address restructuring institutional incentives \n        and reducing institutional barriers to widespread faculty \n        adoption of interdisciplinary teaching of climate change \n        education;\n            (4) for institutions of higher education to engage teams of \n        faculty and students to develop applied climate research and \n        deliver to local communities direct services on climate \n        mitigation and adaptation issues impacting such communities, \n        with a priority on distressed communities; and\n            (5) for projects that build capacity for climate adaptation \n        at the State and national level including--\n                    (A) career education;\n                    (B) expanding green collar workforce training;\n                    (C) secondary school preparation or work-based \n                experiences in green collar fields; and\n                    (D) continuing education needed for practicing \n                professionals for green economy-related fields.\n\nSEC. 7. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, and \nannually thereafter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration shall transmit to Congress a report that evaluates the \nscientific merits, educational effectiveness, and broader impacts of \nactivities under this Act.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration $20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 \nthrough 2019 for carrying out this Act."
