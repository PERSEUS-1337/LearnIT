Where such provisions exist in such \n        existing contract, such contract shall govern. Where written \n        consents exist on the date of enactment of this Act between an \n        off-track betting system and the host racing association \n        providing for interstate off-track wagers, or such written \n        consents are executed by these parties prior to the expiration \n        of such then-existing contract, upon the expiration of such \n        then-existing contract the written agreement of such greyhound \n        owners' group shall thereafter be required as such condition \n        precedent and as a part of the regular contractual process, and \n        may not be withdrawn or varied except in the regular \n        contractual process. Where no such written consent exists, and \n        where such written agreement occurs at a racing association \n        which has a regular contractual process with such greyhound \n        owners' group, such agreement by the greyhound owners' group \n        may not be withdrawn or varied except in the regular \n        contractual process;\n            (2) the host racing commission; and\n            (3) the off-track racing commission.\n    (b) Additional Requirements.--\n            (1) Approval.--In addition to the requirement of subsection \n        (a), any off-track betting office shall obtain the approval \n        of--\n                    (A) all concurrently operating tracks within 60 \n                miles of such off-track betting office; and\n                    (B) if there are no concurrently operating tracks \n                within 60 miles, then the closest currently operating \n                track in an adjoining State.\n            (2) Exception.--Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph \n        (1), any off-track betting office in a State with at least 250 \n        days of on-track parimutuel greyhound racing a year may accept \n        interstate off-track wagers for a total of 60 racing days and \n        25 special events a year without the approval required by \n        paragraph (1) if with respect to such 60 racing days there is \n        no racing of the same type at the same time of day being \n        conducted within the off-track betting State within 60 miles of \n        the off-track betting office accepting the wager or such racing \n        program cannot be completed. Excluded from such 60 days and \n        from the consent required by paragraph (1) may be dark days \n        which occur during a regularly scheduled race meeting in such \n        off-track betting State. In order to accept any interstate off-\n        track wager under the terms of the preceding sentence the off-\n        track betting office shall make identical offers to any racing \n        association described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1). \n        Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to reduce or \n        eliminate the necessity of obtaining all the approvals required \n        by subsection (a).\n    (c) Take Out.--No parimutuel off-track betting system may employ a \ntakeout for an interstate wager which is greater than the takeout for \ncorresponding wagering pools of off-track wagers on races run within \nthe off-track State unless such greater takeout is authorized by State \nlaw in the off-track State.\n\nSEC. 6. LIABILITY AND DAMAGES.\n\n    Any person accepting any interstate off-track wager in violation of \nsection 5 shall be civilly liable for damages to the host State, the \nhost racing association, and the greyhound owners' group. Damages for \neach violation shall be based on the total of off-track wagers as \nfollows:\n            (1) If the interstate off-track wager was of a type \n        accepted at the host racing association, damages shall be in an \n        amount equal to that portion of the takeout which would have \n        been distributed to the host State, host racing association, \n        and the greyhound owners' group as if each such interstate off-\n        track wager had been placed at the host racing association.\n            (2) If such interstate off-track wager was of a type not \n        accepted at the host racing association, the amount of damages \n        shall be determined at the rate of takeout prevailing at the \n        off-track betting system for that type of wager and shall be \n        distributed according to the same formula as in paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 7. CIVIL ACTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The host State, the host racing association, or \nthe greyhound owners' group may commence a civil action against any \nperson alleged to be in violation of section 5, for injunctive relief \nto restrain violations and for damages in accordance with section 6.\n    (b) Parties.--In any civil action under subsection (a), the host \nState, the host racing association, and greyhound owners' group, if not \na party, shall be permitted to intervene as a matter of right.\n    (c) Time.--A civil action may not be commenced pursuant to \nsubsection (a) more than 3 years after the discovery of the alleged \nviolation upon which such civil action is based.\n    (d) Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to permit \na State to be sued under subsection (a) other than in accordance with \nits applicable laws.\n\nSEC. 8.
