FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The history of the United States is in large measure \n        the history of how the United States was populated.\n            (2) The evolution of the American population is broadly \n        termed the ``peopling of America'' and is characterized by the \n        movement of groups of people across external and internal \n        boundaries of the United States as well as by the interactions \n        of the groups with each other.\n            (3) Each of the groups has made unique, important \n        contributions to American history, culture, art, and life.\n            (4) The spiritual, intellectual, cultural, political, and \n        economic vitality of the United States is a result of the \n        pluralism and diversity of the population.\n            (5) The Smithsonian Institution operates 16 museums and \n        galleries, a zoological park, and 5 major research facilities. \n        None of these public entities is a national institution \n        dedicated to presenting the history of the peopling of the \n        United States, as described in paragraph (2).\n            (6) The respective missions of the National Museum of \n        American History of the Smithsonian Institution and the Ellis \n        Island Immigration Museum of the National Park Service limit \n        the ability of those museums to present fully and adequately \n        the history of the diverse population and rich cultures of the \n        United States.\n            (7) The absence of a national facility dedicated solely to \n        presenting the history of the peopling of the United States \n        restricts the ability of the citizens of the United States to \n        fully understand the rich and varied heritage of the United \n        States derived from the unique histories of many peoples from \n        many lands.\n            (8) The establishment of a Peopling of America Museum to \n        conduct educational and interpretive programs on the \n        multiethnic and multiracial character of the history of the \n        United States will assist in inspiring and better informing the \n        citizens of the United States concerning the rich and diverse \n        cultural heritage of the citizens.\n\nSEC. 3.
