FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n        of 1996 (``HIPAA''), through certain of its implementing \n        regulations known as the Privacy Rule, protects the health \n        information of enrollees of health plans and other individuals \n        (in this section referred to as ``protected health \n        information'').\n            (2) The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to protected health \n        information held by health care providers, plans, and \n        clearinghouses, which are known as ``covered entities''. Such \n        Rule also applies to vendors that perform certain functions for \n        covered entities and thereby come into possession of protected \n        health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule refers to these \n        vendors as ``business associates''.\n            (3) The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies both to the internal use \n        of protected health information by covered entities and their \n        business associates and to the disclosure of such information \n        to other parties.\n            (4) Covered entities and their business associates are \n        subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties if they use \n        or disclose protected health information in violation of the \n        HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n            (5) Clearinghouses play a unique, central role in the \n        health care system, interacting with both health care providers \n        and plans. Clearinghouses convert information from providers \n        into claims-processing standard electronic formats and then \n        submit the claims to the plans and finally send providers the \n        plan payments.\n            (6) Claims and other data held by clearinghouses could be \n        analyzed longitudinally and geographically, providing powerful \n        analytical tools that could benefit the overall health care \n        system and facilitate medical innovation in the 21st Century.\n            (7) Clearinghouses are unable to unlock the benefits of \n        such claims and other data because the HIPAA Privacy Rule \n        assigns clearinghouses a dual role. Such clearinghouses are not \n        only covered entities, but are also business associates. The \n        latter role substantially restricts the ability of \n        clearinghouses to analyze claims data.\n            (8) Clearinghouses should not be considered business \n        associates and should instead have the same ability to use and \n        disclose health-related data as other types of covered \n        entities.\n            (9) Eliminating the business-associate role of \n        clearinghouses would not affect the applicability of the civil \n        and criminal penalties that enforce the HIPAA Privacy Rule. \n        Clearinghouses would continue to be subject to such penalties \n        in their role as covered entities.\n            (10) In addition to the uses of health-related information \n        that the HIPAA Privacy Rule currently authorizes for covered \n        entities, there are several particular analytical uses that \n        should be authorized specifically for clearinghouses because of \n        the unique benefits that would result from authorizing those \n        uses. Although these particular new analytical uses should be \n        authorized for clearinghouses, the disclosure of health \n        information pursuant to these uses should be subject to the \n        protection principles currently underlying the HIPAA Privacy \n        Rule, including enforcement principles.\n\nSEC. 3. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN HIPAA-RELATED ACTIVITIES OF HEALTH CARE \n              CLEARINGHOUSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology \nfor Economic and Clinical Health Act (42 U.S.C. 17921 et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n\n   ``PART 5--HEALTH CARE CLEARINGHOUSES; ANALYTICAL FUNCTIONS TOWARD \n                    IMPROVING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM\n\n``SEC. 13451.
