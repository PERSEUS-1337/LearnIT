A contract \n        may be awarded to a certificated air carrier to transport mail \n        by air between any of the points in foreign air transportation \n        that the Secretary of Transportation has authorized the carrier \n        to serve either directly or through a code-share relationship \n        with one or more foreign air carriers.\n            ``(B) If the Postal Service has sought offers or proposals \n        from certificated air carriers to transport mail in foreign air \n        transportation between points, or pairs of points within a \n        geographic region or regions, and has not received offers or \n        proposals that meet Postal Service requirements at a fair and \n        reasonable price from at least 2 such carriers, the Postal \n        Service may seek offers or proposals from foreign air carriers. \n        Where service in foreign air transportation meeting the Postal \n        Service's requirements is unavailable at a fair and reasonable \n        price from at least 2 certificated air carriers, either \n        directly or through a code-share relationship with one or more \n        foreign air carriers, the Postal Service may contract with \n        foreign air carriers to provide the service sought if, when the \n        Postal Service seeks offers or proposals from foreign air \n        carriers, it also seeks an offer or proposal to provide that \n        service from any certificated air carrier providing service \n        between those points, or pairs of points within a geographic \n        region or regions, on the same terms and conditions that are \n        being sought from foreign air carriers.\n            ``(C) For purposes of this subsection, the Postal Service \n        shall use a methodology for determining fair and reasonable \n        prices for the Postal Service designated region or regions \n        developed in consultation with, and with the concurrence of, \n        certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of \n        available ton miles in the markets of interest.\n            ``(D) For purposes of this subsection, ceiling prices \n        determined pursuant to the methodology used under subparagraph \n        (C) shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable if they do not \n        exceed the ceiling prices derived from--\n                ``(i) a weighted average based on market rate data \n            furnished by the International Air Transport Association or \n            a subsidiary unit thereof;
