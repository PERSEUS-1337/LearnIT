FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Good vision is essential for proper physical \n        development and educational progress in growing children.\n            (2) Many serious ocular conditions are treatable if \n        identified in the preschool and early school-aged years.\n            (3) Early detection of ocular conditions provides the best \n        opportunity for effective, inexpensive treatment and can have \n        far reaching implications for vision.\n            (4) Widespread use of identification methods, whether \n        vision screening programs, or comprehensive eye exams required \n        by State law, will identify children needing services. A child \n        identified through vision screening should receive a \n        comprehensive eye exam followed by subsequent treatment as \n        needed. A child identified through a comprehensive eye exam \n        should receive subsequent treatment as needed. All children \n        identified as needing services should have access to subsequent \n        treatment as needed.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE EYE EXAMINATIONS FOR CHILDREN.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n(referred to in this section as the ``Secretary''), acting through the \nDirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may make \ngrants to States on the basis of an established review process for the \npurpose of--\n            (1) providing comprehensive eye examinations for children \n        who have been identified by a licensed health care provider or \n        vision screener as needing such services, with priority given \n        to children who are under the age of 9;\n            (2) providing for children subsequent treatment or services \n        necessary to correct vision problems; and\n            (3) developing and disseminating, to parents, teachers, and \n        health care practitioners, educational materials on recognizing \n        signs of visual impairment in children.\n    (b) Criteria and Coordination.--\n            (1) Criteria.--The Secretary, in consultation with \n        appropriate professional and consumer organizations including \n        individuals with knowledge of age appropriate vision services, \n        shall develop criteria--\n                    (A) governing the operation of the grant program; \n                and\n                    (B) for the collection of data related to vision \n                assessment and the utilization of followup services.\n            (2) Coordination.--The Secretary shall, as appropriate, \n        coordinate the program under subsection (a) with the program \n        under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (relating to \n        health centers), the program under title XIX of the Social \n        Security Act (relating to the Medicaid program), the program \n        under title XXI of such Act (relating to the State children's \n        health insurance program), and with other Federal or State \n        program that provide services to children.\n    (c) Application.--A grant may be made under subsection (a) only if \nan application for the grant is submitted to the Secretary and the \napplication is in such form, is made in such manner, and contains such \ninformation as the Secretary may require, including--\n            (1) information on existing Federal, Federal-State, or \n        State-funded children's vision screening programs;\n            (2) a plan for the use of grant funds, including how funds \n        will be used to complement existing State efforts;\n            (3) a plan to determine if a grant eligible child has \n        received an age appropriate vision screening; and\n            (4) a description of how funds will be used to provide \n        items or services only as a secondary payer to--\n                    (A) any State compensation program, under an \n                insurance policy, or under any Federal or State health \n                benefits program; or\n                    (B) by any entity that provides health services on \n                a prepaid basis.\n    (d) Evaluations.--A grant may be made under subsection (a) only if \nthe State involved agrees that, not later than 1 year after the date on \nwhich amounts under the grant are first received by the State, and \nannually thereafter while receiving amounts under the grant, the State \nwill submit to the Secretary an evaluation of the operations and \nactivities carried out under the grant, including--\n            (1) an assessment of the utilization of vision services and \n        the status of children receiving these services as a result of \n        the activities carried out under the grant;\n            (2) the collection, analysis, and reporting of children's \n        vision data according to guidelines prescribed by the \n        Secretary; and\n            (3) such other information as the Secretary may require.\n    (e) Certain Provisions Regarding Expenditure of Grant.--\n            (1) Uses other than comprehensive eye examinations.--A \n        grant under subsection (a) may be expended for the purposes \n        described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of such subsection without \n        regard to whether under paragraph (1) of such subsection the \n        State involved expends the grant to provide comprehensive eye \n        examinations.
