CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is an increasing awareness by the business \n        community and the country as a whole regarding the serious \n        problem of workplace violence against women;\n            (2) there is an increased recognition that workplace \n        violence against women has severe implications for the health, \n        safety, and economic well-being of women, as well as the \n        efficiency and profitability of American companies;\n            (3) recent crime statistics clearly show the serious threat \n        of workplace violence against women;\n            (4) homicide is the leading cause of death for women on the \n        job, and husbands, boyfriends, and ex-partners commit 15 \n        percent of all workplace homicides against women;\n            (5) an estimated 8 percent of all rapes occur while victims \n        are working or on duty, at an average annual number of 13,000 \n        workplace rapes each year;\n            (6) husbands and boyfriends commit 13,000 acts of violence \n        against women in the workplace every year;\n            (7) women are more likely than men to be attacked at work \n        by someone known to them, and 5 percent of women victimized at \n        work are attacked by a husband, boyfriend, or ex-partner;\n            (8) surveys of business executives and corporate security \n        directors also underscore the heavy toll that workplace \n        violence takes on American women and American businesses;\n            (9) 49 percent of senior executives recently surveyed said \n        domestic violence has a harmful effect on their company's \n        productivity, 47 percent said spousal abuse negatively impacts \n        attendance, and 44 percent said domestic violence increases \n        health care costs;\n            (10) 94 percent of corporate security and safety directors \n        at companies nationwide rank domestic violence as a high-risk \n        security problem;\n            (11) the public and private sectors--including the legal, \n        medical, social services, business, and religious communities--\n        must come together to combat violence against women in the \n        workplace; and\n            (12) the Congress, too, must play a role in encouraging \n        companies to promulgate workplace education and safety programs \n        to combat violence against women.\n\nSEC. 3.
