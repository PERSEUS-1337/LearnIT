RURAL EDUCATION.\n\n    Part J of title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 (20 U.S.C. 8271 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                  ``PART J--RURAL EDUCATION INITIATIVE\n\n``SEC. 10951. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    ``This part may be cited as the `Rural Education Initiative Act of \n2001'.\n\n``SEC. 10952. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) The National Center for Educational Statistics \n        reports that 46 percent of our Nation's public schools serve \n        rural areas.\n            ``(2) While there are rural education initiatives \n        identified at the State and local level, no Federal education \n        policy focuses on the specific and unique needs of rural school \n        districts and schools.\n            ``(3) Small school districts often cannot use Federal grant \n        funds distributed by formula because the formula allocation \n        does not provide enough revenue to carry out the program the \n        grant is intended to fund.\n            ``(4) Rural schools often cannot compete for Federal \n        funding distributed by competitive grants because the schools \n        lack the personnel needed to prepare grant applications and the \n        resources to hire specialists in the writing of Federal grant \n        proposals.\n            ``(5) A critical problem for rural school districts \n        involves the hiring and retention of qualified administrators \n        and certified teachers (especially in reading, science, and \n        mathematics). As a result, teachers in rural schools are almost \n        twice as likely to provide instruction in three or more subject \n        areas than teachers in urban schools. Rural schools also face \n        other tough challenges, such as shrinking local tax bases, high \n        transportation costs, aging buildings, limited course \n        offerings, and limited resources.\n\n              ``Subpart 1--Small and Rural School Program\n\n``SEC. 10961.
