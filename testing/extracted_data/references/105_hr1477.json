    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n             (1) the 50-mile Handford Reach is the last free-flowing \n        nontidal segment of the Columbia River in the United States and \n        has been preserved in a relatively natural condition because of \n        its location within the Hanford Nuclear Reservation;\n            (2) in 1988, Congress, in Public Law 100-605 (102 Stat. \n        3043), called for an analysis of protection alternatives for \n        the Hanford Reach and a report to Congress by the Secretary of \n        the Interior, who concluded in the Hanford Reach Final \n        Environmental Impact Statement dated June 1994 that the Hanford \n        Reach should be designated as a recreational river under the \n        Wild and Scenic Rivers Act;\n            (3) the Hanford Reach is a vital migration corridor for \n        anadromous fish and contains some of the most productive \n        spawning areas in the Northwest United States, producing an \n        estimated 80 percent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook \n        salmon and healthy runs of naturally spawning steelhead trout, \n        sturgeon, and other highly valued fish species;\n            (4) the Hanford Reach provides important habitat for \n        wintering and migrating waterfowl, bald eagles, deer, elk, and \n        a diversity of other wildlife, including numerous Federal and \n        State-listed threatened and endangered plant and animal \n        species, some of which are found nowhere else;\n            (5) the White Bluffs and pristine conditions of the Hanford \n        Reach offer scenic beauty, opportunities for solitude, and \n        recreation, including hunting, fishing, boating, hiking, \n        swimming, and wildlife observation, in close proximity to the \n        Tri-Cities area of the State of Washington;\n            (6) the Hanford Reach and its salmon runs have been \n        important to mid-Columbia Native Americans for subsistence, \n        cultural, and religious purposes for more than 10,000 years, \n        and there are 150 registered archaeological sites in the area;\n            (7) the southern shore of the Hanford Reach chronicles the \n        history of the Manhattan Project, defense nuclear production \n        during the cold war, and early Euro-American settlement of the \n        area;\n            (8) the White Bluffs and adjacent shoreline areas are a \n        significant paleontological resource and are rich with fossils \n        remains from the Pliocene period;\n            (9) protection of the Hanford Reach as a national wild and \n        scenic river can enhance local revenues from outdoor recreation \n        and increase economic investment in the Tri-Cities area by \n        highlighting the quality of life and natural amenities of the \n        area;\n            (10) economic activities along the river corridor in \n        existence on the date of enactment of this Act, such as \n        agriculture, power production and transmission, and water \n        withdrawal, are compatible with the recreational classification \n        of the river, and the classification made by this Act cannot be \nchanged except by a subsequent Act of Congress;\n            (11) designation of the Hanford Reach as a wild and scenic \n        river can facilitate, and make less costly, the remediation of \n        contaminated areas of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation by \n        determining future land use within the river corridor and \n        helping to ensure the Federal commitment to the cleanup of the \n        Hanford Site;\n            (12) the Hanford Reach has special significance as an \n        outdoor laboratory and classroom and offers a singular \n        opportunity for government agencies, tribes, and community \n        organizations to develop a partnership around an education and \n        interpretation program focused on the area's unique natural and \n        human history;\n            (13) the Columbia River shore immediately downstream of the \n        Hanford Reach in the Tri-Cities area currently contains miles \n        of high, steep levees which create a sterile gauntlet through \n        which migrating anadromous fish must pass, and that flow \n        controls on the Columbia River have reduced the need for levees \n        of this height;\n            (14) modifying levees in the Tri-Cities area could \n        significantly improve the habitat value of this transition area \n        to the Hanford Reach for fish and wildlife, decrease mortality \n        of migratory fish and waterfowl, and have the additional \n        benefits of improving rivershore access, recreation, and \n        aesthetics; and\n            (15) local jurisdictions in the Tri-Cities area have \n        expressed interest in a partnership with the Army Corps of \n        Engineers and other agencies to study rivershore restoration in \n        the Tri-Cities area and develop a plan of action.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect the natural, cultural, scenic, and \n        recreational resources of the Hanford Reach of the Columbia \n        River;\n            (2) to encourage education and interpretation of the \n        Hanford Reach; and\n            (3) to restore and enhance the natural habitat of the \n        rivershore immediately downstream of the Hanford Reach in the \n        vicinity of the Tri-Cities area of the State of Washington.\n\nSEC. 3.
