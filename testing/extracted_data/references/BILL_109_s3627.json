FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to \n        humans, ecosystems, and wildlife;\n            (2) as many as 10 percent of women in the United States of \n        childbearing age have mercury in the blood at a level that \n        could put a baby at risk;\n            (3) as many as 630,000 children born annually in the United \n        States are at risk of neurological problems related to mercury;\n            (4) the most significant source of mercury exposure to \n        people in the United States is ingestion of mercury-\n        contaminated fish;\n            (5) the Environmental Protection Agency reports that, as of \n        2004--\n                    (A) 44 States have fish advisories covering over \n                13,000,000 lake acres and over 750,000 river miles;\n                    (B) in 21 States the freshwater advisories are \n                statewide; and\n                    (C) in 12 States the coastal advisories are \n                statewide;\n            (6) the long-term solution to mercury pollution is to \n        minimize global mercury use and releases to eventually achieve \n        reduced contamination levels in the environment, rather than \n        reducing fish consumption since uncontaminated fish represents \n        a critical and healthy source of nutrition worldwide;\n            (7) mercury pollution is a transboundary pollutant, \n        depositing locally, regionally, and globally, and affecting \n        water bodies near industrial sources (including the Great \n        Lakes) and remote areas (including the Arctic Circle);\n            (8) the free trade of mercury and mercury compounds on the \n        world market, at relatively low prices and in ready supply, \n        encourages the continued use of mercury outside of the United \n        States, often involving highly dispersive activities such as \n        artisinal gold mining;\n            (9) the intentional use of mercury is declining in the \n        United States as a consequence of process changes to \n        manufactured products (including batteries, paints, switches, \n        and measuring devices), but those uses remain substantial in \n        the developing world where releases from the products are \n        extremely likely due to the limited pollution control and waste \n        management infrastructures in those countries;\n            (10) the member countries of the European Union \n        collectively are the largest source of mercury exports \n        globally;\n            (11) the European Union is in the process of enacting \n        legislation that will prohibit mercury exports by not later \n        than 2011;\n            (12) the United States is a net exporter of mercury and, \n        according to the United States Geologic Survey, exported 506 \n        metric tons of mercury more than the United States imported \n        during the period of 2000 through 2004; and\n            (13) banning exports of mercury from the United States will \n        have a notable affect on the market availability of mercury and \n        switching to affordable mercury alternatives in the developing \n        world.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON SALE, DISTRIBUTION, OR TRANSFER OF MERCURY BY \n              DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OR DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.\n\n    Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2605) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(f) Mercury.--\n            ``(1) Prohibition on sale, distribution, and transfer by \n        department of defense.--Effective as of the date of enactment \n        of this subsection, the Secretary of Defense may not convey, \n        sell, distribute, or otherwise transfer to any other department \n        or agency of the Federal Government, any State or local \n        government, or any private person or entity any elemental \n        mercury under the control or jurisdiction of the Department of \n        Defense.\n            ``(2) Prohibition on sale, distribution, and transfer by \n        department of energy.--Effective as of the date of enactment of \n        this subsection, the Secretary of Energy may not convey, sell, \n        distribute, or otherwise transfer to any other department or \n        agency of the Federal Government, any State or local \n        government, or any private person or entity any elemental \n        mercury under the control or jurisdiction of the Department of \n        Energy.\n            ``(3) Exception.--The prohibitions in paragraphs (1) and \n        (2) shall not apply to the transfer of elemental mercury to any \n        storage or other facility established under section \n        12(c)(3).''.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON EXPORT OF MERCURY.\n\n    Section 12 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2611) is \namended--\n            (1) in subsection (a) by striking ``subsection (b)'' and \n        inserting ``subsections (b) and (c)''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) Prohibition on Export of Mercury.--\n            ``(1) Elemental mercury.--Effective January 1, 2010, the \n        export of elemental mercury from the United States is \n        prohibited.\n            ``(2) Extension of prohibition to mercury compounds.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Beginning on January 1, 2010, \n                the President may prohibit the export of any mercury \n                compound from the United States as necessary--\n                            ``(i) to avoid subversion of the mercury \n                        ban; and\n                            ``(ii) to achieve the full force and effect \n                        of the prohibition under paragraph (1).\n                    ``(B) Notice to congress.--\n                            ``(i) In general.--If the President \n                        exercises the authority in subparagraph (A), \n                        the President shall notify Congress.\n                            ``(ii) Requirements.--A notification under \n                        clause (i) shall describe--\n                                    ``(I) each mercury compound the \n                                export of which from the United States \n                                will be prohibited; and\n                                    ``(II) a justification of the \n                                prohibition of export of each compound.\n            ``(3) Storage of excess mercury.--\n                    ``(A) Establishment of storage capacity.--In order \n                to implement the prohibition on the export of elemental \n                mercury under paragraph (1) and the prohibition, if \n                any, on the export of mercury compounds under paragraph \n                (2), the President shall establish the capacity \n                (including 1 or more storage facilities) to store \n                safely such elemental mercury and mercury compounds \n                covered by the prohibitions as are in excess of \n                quantities necessary for domestic consumption.\n                    ``(B) Regulations.--The establishment and operation \n                of facilities to provide the capacity required by \n                subparagraph (A) shall be governed by such regulations \n                as the President may prescribe for purposes of this \n                paragraph.\n            ``(4) Inapplicability of unreasonable risk requirement.--\n        Subsection (a) shall not apply to this subsection.''."
