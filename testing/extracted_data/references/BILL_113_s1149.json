FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) according to data from the Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation, 8,583 of the 12,664 murders in the United States \n        in 2011 were committed using a firearm, and more than 57 \n        percent of the murders that occurred in New York State were \n        perpetrated with a firearm;\n            (2) the ability to produce a receiver for a firearm in the \n        home would circumvent a number of laws, because the receiver is \n        the component of the firearm that bears its serial number, as \n        required by regulations;\n            (3) digital manufacturing technologies, including but not \n        limited to computer numerical control mills (``CNC mills''), 3-\n        dimensional printers (``3D printers''), and laser cutting \n        machines, are quickly advancing to a point where it will soon \n        be possible to fabricate fully operational firearm components; \n        and\n            (4) some commercially available products that utilize \n        digital manufacturing technologies to manufacture objects are \n        able to manufacture these objects using materials that are \n        unable to be detected by traditional metal detectors, and may \n        not present an accurate image on an x-ray.\n\nSEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF BAN ON UNDETECTABLE FIREARMS.\n\n    Section 2(f)(2) of the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C. \n922 note) is amended by striking ``25'' and inserting ``35''.\n\nSEC. 4. BAN EXTENDED TO UNDETECTABLE FIREARM RECEIVERS MADE BY \n              INDIVIDUALS.\n\n    Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)--\n                    (A) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by \n                striking ``It shall be unlawful'' and all that follows \n                and inserting ``It shall be unlawful--''; and\n                    (B) by striking subparagraphs (A) and (B) and \n                inserting the following:\n            ``(A) for any person to manufacture, import, sell, ship, \n        deliver, possess, transfer, or receive any firearm--\n                    ``(i) that, after removal of grips, stocks, and \n                magazines, is not as detectable as the Security \n                Exemplar, by walk-through metal detectors calibrated \n                and operated to detect the Security Exemplar; or\n                    ``(ii) any major component of which, when subjected \n                to inspection by the types of x-ray machines commonly \n                used at airports, does not generate an image that \n                accurately depicts the shape of the component, except \n                that barium sulfate or other compounds may be used in \n                the fabrication of the component;
