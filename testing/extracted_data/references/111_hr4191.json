    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Let Wall Street Pay for the \nRestoration of Main Street Act of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Our Nation continues to be hamstrung by a recession \n        that led to the current jobless recovery and record deficits.\n            (2) The unemployment rate is now 10.2 percent and most \n        economists expect it to climb higher.\n            (3) The Federal deficit has reached $1,400,000,000,000 for \n        2009.\n            (4) The jobless recovery suggests that the Federal \n        Government must continue to prime the economy, but the record \n        deficit is a real obstacle.\n            (5) Following their $700,000,000,000 bailout, Wall Street \n        is now enjoying a resurgence in profits and bonuses.\n            (6) A robust economy needs more than Wall Street profits. \n        Main Street America is strengthened by good paying jobs for all \n        Americans, not just Wall Street bankers.\n            (7) To restore Main Street America, a small securities \n        transaction tax on Wall Street should be invested in job \n        creation for Main Street America.\n            (8) A securities transaction tax on Wall Street has a \n        negligible impact on the average investor and pension funds.\n            (9) This transfer tax would be assessed on the sale and \n        purchase of financial instruments such as stocks, options, and \n        futures. A quarter percent (0.25 percent) tax on financial \n        transactions could raise approximately $150,000,000,000 a year.\n            (10) The United States had a transfer tax from 1914 to \n        1966. The Revenue Act of 1914 (Act of Oct. 22, 1914 (ch. 331, \n        38 Stat. 745)) levied a 0.2 percent tax on all sales or \n        transfers of stock. In 1932, Congress more than doubled the tax \n        to help financial recovery and job creation during the Great \n        Depression.\n            (11) Half the revenue generated by this transaction tax \n        will be used to directly reduce the deficit.\n            (12) Half of the revenue generated by this transaction tax \n        will deposited in a Job Creation Reserve to fund the creation \n        of good paying jobs and put Americans back to work rebuilding \n        our Nation.\n\nSEC. 3. JOB CREATION RESERVE FOR INVESTMENTS IN MIDDLE CLASS JOBS.\n\n    (a) In General.--For budgetary purposes, half the additional \nFederal receipts by reason of the enactment of this Act shall be held \nin a separate account to be known as the ``Job Creation Reserve''. The \nJob Creation Reserve shall be available to offset the additional costs \nfrom the Surface Transportation Authorization Act of 2009 and \nsubsequent legislation to fund job creation in the United States \nprovided that the subsequent legislation--\n            (1) promotes jobs that pay at least the median wage of the \n        United States;\n            (2) promotes manufacturing and other jobs we are losing to \n        unfair overseas competition; and\n            (3) prohibits any recipient of the Troubled Asset Relief \n        Program from directly benefitting from any funds in this \n        reserve.\n    (b) Procedure for Adjustments.--\n            (1) Budget committee chairman.--After the reporting of a \n        bill or joint resolution, or the offering of an amendment \n        thereto or the submission of a conference report thereon, \n        providing funding for the purposes set forth in subsection (a) \n        in excess of the amounts provided for those purposes for fiscal \n        year 2010, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the \n        applicable House of Congress shall make the adjustments set \n        forth in paragraph (2) for the amount of new budget authority \n        and outlays in that measure and the outlays flowing from that \n        budget authority.\n            (2) Matters to be adjusted.--The adjustments referred to in \n        paragraph (1) are to be made to--\n                    (A) the discretionary spending limits, if any, set \n                forth in the appropriate concurrent resolution on the \n                budget;\n                    (B) the allocations made pursuant to the \n                appropriate concurrent resolution on the budget \n                pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget \n                Act of 1974; and\n                    (C) the budget aggregates contained in the \n                appropriate concurrent resolution on the budget as \n                required by section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget \n                Act of 1974.\n            (3) Amounts of adjustments.--The adjustments referred to in \n        paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not exceed half the receipts \n        estimated by the Congressional Budget Office that are \n        attributable to this Act for the fiscal year in which the \n        adjustments are made.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFICIT REDUCTION.\n\n    It is the Sense of Congress that half the additional Federal \nreceipts by reason of the enactment of this Act shall not be expended \nand therefore reduce the Federal deficit. The Committee on the Budget \nshall clearly report this deficit reduction in the committee report for \nthe budget resolution.\n\nSEC. 5. RECOUPMENT OF WALL STREET BAILOUT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 36 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \namended by inserting after subchapter B the following new subchapter:\n\n             ``Subchapter C--Tax on Securities Transactions\n\n``Sec. 4475.
