FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Research and development are critical to developing and \n        maintaining a transportation system that meets the goals of \n        safety, mobility, economic vitality, efficiency, equity, and \n        environmental protection.\n            (2) Federal investment in transportation research and \n        development represents approximately 1 percent of overall \n        Government spending on transportation programs.\n            (3) While Congress increased funding for overall \n        transportation programs by about 40 percent in the \n        Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (Public Law 105-\n        178), funding for transportation research and development \n        remained relatively flat.\n            (4) Inadequate resources are devoted to research aimed at \n        long-term transportation goals.\n            (5) The competitive, peer-reviewed award of research \n        funding is best suited to address long-term, strategic research \n        needs.\n            (6) The diversity of transportation research programs that \n        address the needs of different customers poses challenges to \n        effective regional-based and university-based transportation \n        research centers, and short-term applied research and \n        development and long-term fundamental research and development.\n            (7) The wide-ranging subject matter of transportation \n        research makes effective priority setting difficult.\n            (8) In order to ensure that the United States \n        transportation system meets the goals of safety, mobility, \n        economic vitality, equity, and environmental protection, it is \n        in the interest of the United States to--\n                    (A) increase Federal investment in long-range \n                transportation planning;\n                    (B) initiate and support competitive, peer-reviewed \n                research into systemic transportation issues;\n                    (C) better coordinate the research and development \n                programs of the Department of Transportation;\n                    (D) foster the interchange of transportation \n                research and development data among interested parties; \n                and\n                    (E) establish nationwide priorities in Federal \n                transportation research and development.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS.\n\n    There is hereby established as an independent agency in the \nexecutive branch of government the National Center for Transportation \nSolutions (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Center'').
