SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``College Fire \nPrevention Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On November 9, 2003, an early morning fire at the \n        University of Connecticut destroyed a fraternity. Five \n        residents were in the building at the time of the fire. There \n        were no working fire alarms in the building.\n            (2) On September 26, 2003, a fraternity fire at the \n        University of Wisconsin-Madison occurred in a secret room. The \n        entrance to the room was made to look like a wall. Fire \n        fighters were unable to locate the source of the fire despite \n        an extensive search of the house. The fire was caused by a \n        candle that ignited some fabric and then spread to a chair. \n        There were no fire sprinklers present.\n            (3) On February 22, 2003, a fatal off-campus house fire at \n        Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, occurred in a 3-\n        story, wood frame house that had been converted into \n        apartments. There were single-station, battery-operated smoke \n        detectors in the apartments. There were no sprinklers. The \n        victim, Raymond Tricomi, was 21.\n            (4) On January 1, 2003, a fire at Pennsylvania State \n        University displaced 11 Penn State students from their off-\n        campus rooming house. Activated smoke detectors awakened 2 \n        occupants who were able to escape the building. The other \n        occupants were away for the holiday break. Fire loss was \n        estimated at $40,000 damage, and the cause of the fire is under \n        investigation. The building was not equipped with an automatic \n        fire sprinkler system.\n            (5) On April 7, 2002, an early morning fire at DePauw \n        University in Greencastle, Indiana, caused over $1,000,000 in \n        damage. The fire, which started from an electrical appliance in \n        a fourth floor room, forced the evacuation of 116 students from \n        the building and more than 200 students from adjacent \n        buildings. The building was not equipped with an automatic fire \n        sprinkler system.\n            (6) On February 16, 2002, a halogen lamp at Amherst College \n        in Amherst, Massachusetts, started a fire in a residence that \n        had been converted into student housing. According to fire \n        officials, the fire started in a second-floor room that was \n        unoccupied at the time of the fire. A halogen lamp fell over \n        and ignited combustibles in the area. The building's fire alarm \n        system was activated, and an occupant from another room \n        discovered the fire. He unsuccessfully attempted to extinguish \n        the fire using a dry chemical fire extinguisher. Smoke and heat \n        damage were limited to the room of origin. Halogen lamps are \n        banned by Amherst College. The building is unsprinklered, \n        equipped with single-station smoke detectors in the individual \n        rooms and a building fire alarm system.\n            (7) On January 19, 2000, a fire occurred at a Seton Hall \n        University dormitory. Three male freshmen, all 18 years of age, \n        died. Fifty-four students, 2 South Orange firefighters, and 2 \n        South Orange police officers were injured. The dormitory was a \n        6-story, 350-room structure built in 1952, that housed \n        approximately 600 students. It was equipped with smoke alarms \n        but no fire sprinkler system.\n            (8) On Mother's Day in 1996 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, \n        a fire in the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity House killed 5 college \n        juniors and injured 3. The 3-story plus basement fraternity \n        house was 70 years old. The National Fire Protection \n        Association identified several factors that contributed to the \n        tragic fire, including the lack of fire sprinkler protection.\n            (9) It is estimated that between 1980 and 1998, an average \n        of 1,800 fires at dormitories, fraternities, and sororities, \n        involving 1 death, 70 injuries, and $8,000,000 in property \n        damage were reported to public fire departments.\n            (10) Within dormitories, fraternities, and sororities the \n        leading cause of fires is arson or suspected arson. The second \n        leading cause of college building fires is cooking. The third \n        leading cause is smoking.\n            (11) New dormitories are generally required to have \n        advanced safety systems such as fire sprinklers. But such \n        requirements are rarely imposed retroactively on existing \n        buildings.\n            (12) In 1998, 93 percent of the campus building fires \n        reported to fire departments occurred in buildings where there \n        were smoke alarms present. However, only 34 percent had fire \n        sprinklers present.\n\nSEC. 2.
