GEOGRAPHY EDUCATION.\n\n    Title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1021 et \nseq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating part C (20 U.S.C. 1041) as part D;\n            (2) by redesignating section 261 (20 U.S.C. 1041) as \n        section 291; and\n            (3) by inserting after part B (20 U.S.C. 1031 et seq.) the \n        following:\n\n                     ``PART C--GEOGRAPHY EDUCATION\n\n``SEC. 261. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress makes the following findings:\n            ``(1) The economic stature and competitiveness of the \n        United States requires increasingly sophisticated levels of \n        geographic knowledge and mastery of geographic tools.\n            ``(2) It is estimated that the United States geospatial \n        industry generated $73,000,000,000 in revenue last year, with \n        500,000 high-wage jobs and that the industry is growing at \n        between 25-30 percent per year. This burgeoning industry will \n        not be able to maximize its growth potential without a \n        sustained Federal investment in geography education.\n            ``(3) A 2012 report by a Council on Foreign Relations task \n        force, U.S. Education Reform and National Security, states that \n        the lack of global awareness among United States citizens \n        increasingly jeopardizes their ability to interact with local \n        and global peers, or participate meaningfully in business, \n        diplomatic, and military situations.\n            ``(4) Geographic literacy is essential to a well prepared \n        citizenry in the 21st century because geographic factors assume \n        greater importance as the world's economies, societies, and \n        political structures grow more global in scale.\n            ``(5) The 2010 National Assessment of Educational Progress \n        in geography shows that fewer than 30 percent of students \n        tested in grades 4, 8, and 12 scored at grade-level or above. \n        These scores have stayed the same or gotten worse, since the \n        last time the test was administered in 2001.\n            ``(6) The National Academy of Sciences urged creation of a \n        national program to improve the geographic competence of the \n        United States general population and the school age population.\n            ``(7) Geography is one of the `core academic subjects' \n        defined under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n        1965.\n            ``(8) A recent National Geographic Society survey found \n        that all 50 States and the District of Columbia recognize \n        geography in their curricula or content standards, and an \n        increasing number require geography for graduation and include \n        geography in mandated statewide assessments.\n            ``(9) Seven of 10 educators responding to a National \n        Geographic survey felt their professional development \n        opportunities in geography were inadequate and half believed \n        their schools had inadequate basic materials for teaching \n        geography.\n            ``(10) The National Geographic Society has spent more than \n        25 years pioneering an extraordinarily effective national \n        program for improving the teaching of geography by engaging \n        university faculty geographers and highly trained teachers in \n        State Geographic Alliances dedicated to providing high-quality \n        professional development opportunities for kindergarten through \n        grade 12 teachers.\n            ``(11) More than 80 colleges and universities in all 50 \n        States have received grants from the National Geographic \n        Society to support State Geographic Alliances and their \n        professional development programs. Alliance-trained \n        kindergarten through grade 12 teachers and their higher \n        education partners conduct workshops, develop localized \n        teaching materials, and facilitate communication among \n        thousands of teachers whose responsibilities include teaching \n        of geography in various formats and grade levels.\n            ``(12) A study by Mid-continent Research for Education and \n        Learning that assessed student academic achievement in \n        geography on the National Assessment of Educational Progress \n        showed that students taught by Alliance-trained teachers \n        outperformed other students by almost 10 percent.\n            ``(13) We live in a changing world with multiple and \n        evolving threats to national security, including terrorism, \n        asymmetrical warfare, and social unrest. As the nature of the \n        threat evolves, so do the tools, knowledge, and skills needed \n        to respond. A 2013 National Academies report states that it is \n        likely that qualified GIS (Geography Information Systems) and \n        remote sensing experts are already hard to find. Long before \n        2030, competition and a small number of graduates will likely \n        result in shortages in all emerging areas and in the core areas \n        of cartography, photogrammetry, and geodesy.\n\n``SEC. 262.
