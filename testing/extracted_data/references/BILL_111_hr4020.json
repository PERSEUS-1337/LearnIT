or\n                    (B) a qualifying State high risk pool described in \n                subsection (c)(1).\n            (2) Preference.--Beginning 3 years after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act, in the case of a competitive grant for \n        which the only eligible entities are States, the Secretary, in \n        awarding such grant to a State, shall give preference to any \n        State with a program that meets the requirements of paragraph \n        (1)(A).\n    (b) Qualified State Reinsurance Program.--\n            (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the term \n        ``qualified State reinsurance program'' means a program \n        operated by a State or a State authorized program that provides \n        reinsurance for health insurance coverage offered in the \n        individual, small group market, or in both markets.\n            (2) Form of program.--A qualified State reinsurance program \n        may provide reinsurance--\n                    (A) on a prospective or retrospective basis;\n                    (B) that protects health insurance issuers against \n                the annual aggregate spending of their enrollees; and\n                    (C) that provides purchase protection against \n                individual catastrophic costs.\n    (c) Qualifying State High Risk Pool.--\n            (1) In general.--A qualifying State high risk pool \n        described in this subsection means a section 2745 qualified \n        high risk pool that meets the following requirements:\n                    (A) The high risk pool does not have a lifetime \n                coverage cap.\n                    (B) The high risk pool incorporates applicable \n                Federal or State programs (such as coverage under title \n                XIX of the Social Security Act) for eligible low-income \n                individuals.\n                    (C) The high risk pool provides a variety of types \n                of coverage, including at least one high deductible \n                health plan that is combined with a health savings \n                account.\n                    (D) The high risk pool eliminates any waiting list \n                and pre-existing condition exclusionary periods so that \n                all eligible residents who are seeking coverage through \n                the pool can receive coverage through the pool.\n                    (E) The high risk pool allows for coverage of \n                individuals who, but for the 24-month disability \n                waiting period under section 226(b) of the Social \n                Security Act, would be eligible for Medicare during the \n                period of such waiting period.\n                    (F) The high risk pool must not charge participants \n                more than 150 percent of the average premium in the \n                individual market for health insurance coverage in that \n                State.\n                    (G) The high risk pool conducts education and \n                outreach initiatives so that residents and insurance \n                brokers understand that the pool is available to \n                eligible residents.\n            (2) Use of funds for the transition.--A State may use any \n        funding sources available to it as of the date of the enactment \n        of this Act to transition from operating a section 2745 high \n        risk pool, to operating a qualified State reinsurance program \n        described in paragraph (1).\n            (3) Funding source.--The high risk pool described in this \n        subsection is also encouraged to have stable funding source \n        that is not solely dependent on an appropriation from the State \n        legislature.\n    (d) Relation to Section 2745.--Section 2745 of the Public Health \nService Act is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(2)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (A), strike ``40'' and insert \n                ``30''; and\n                    (B) add at the end the following new subparagraph:\n                    ``(D) An amount equal to 10 percent of such \n                appropriated amount for the fiscal year shall be \n                allotted among qualifying States that apply for such a \n                grant so that the amount allotted to a State bears the \n                same ratio to such appropriated amount as the amount of \n                funds contributed to the operation of the qualified \n                high risk pool of the State by funding sources other \n                than grants under this subsection.'';
