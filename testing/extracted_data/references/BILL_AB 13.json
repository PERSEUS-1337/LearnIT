The same rate shall be uniformly charged nonresident students attending any terms or sessions maintained by the community college. The rate charged shall be the rate established for the fiscal year in which the term or session ends.\n(g) Any loss in district revenue generated by the nonresident tuition fee shall not be offset by additional state funding.\n(h) Any district that has fewer than 1,500 FTES and whose boundary is within 10 miles of another state that has a reciprocity agreement with California governing student attendance and fees may exempt students from that state from the mandatory fee requirement described in subdivision (a) for nonresident students.\n(i) Any district that has more than 1,500, but less than 3,001, FTES and whose boundary is within 10 miles of another state that has a reciprocity agreement with California governing student attendance and fees may, in any one fiscal year, exempt up to 100 FTES from that state from the mandatory fee requirement described in subdivision (a) for nonresident students.\n(j) The attendance of nonresident students who are exempted pursuant to subdivision (h) or (i), or pursuant to paragraph (3), (5), or (6) of subdivision (a), from the mandatory fee requirement described in subdivision (a) for nonresident students may be reported as resident FTES for state apportionment purposes.

That fee is to be included in the FTES adjustments described in Section 76300 for purposes of computing apportionments.\nSEC. 2.\nIf the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.\nSEC. 3.\nThis act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:\nIn order for the nonresident tuition exemption authorized by this act to be in effect for the 2015\u201316 academic year, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately."
