    "title": "A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, to end health insurance portability for Members of Congress and eliminate continued coverage for departing Members of Congress until health insurance portability for other United States citizens is enacted into law, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "SECTION 1. LIMITATIONS OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) an estimated 81,000,000 United States citizens suffer \n        from some type of preexisting medical condition that could make \n        it difficult to obtain health coverage, especially for that \n        condition;\n            (2) millions of citizens are at risk of being subjected to \n        preexisting condition exclusions under current law because they \n        change jobs, lose jobs, or work for employers who change \n        insurance policies;\n            (3) Members of Congress may--\n                    (A) choose to receive a health plan through the \n                Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; and\n                    (B) enroll in a plan without facing restrictions \n                because of health status or preexisting medical \n                conditions;\n            (4) health care coverage for Members of Congress under such \n        program--\n                    (A) is portable because Members can change plans \n                without worry of preexisting condition exclusions or \n                waiting periods; and\n                    (B) cannot be canceled and is required to be \n                renewed;\n            (5) Members of Congress are often eligible to continue to \n        receive health care through the Federal Employees Health \n        Benefits Program after they leave Congress; and\n            (6) Congress should pass legislation to ensure health \n        insurance portability for United States citizens.\n    (b) Ending Health Insurance Portability and Other Protections for \nMembers of Congress.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 8902 of title 5, United States \n        Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(o)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (f) or (h), or any other \nprovision of this chapter, a contract for a plan under this chapter \nshall provide that a carrier may--\n            ``(A) include in a plan offered to an individual described \n        under paragraph (2) preexisting condition exclusions and impose \n        a limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to treatment of \n        a preexisting condition based on the fact that the condition \n        existed prior to enrollment;\n            ``(B) exclude from enrollment an individual described under \n        paragraph (2) due to health status or preexisting condition; or\n            ``(C) refuse to renew the health plan of an individual \n        described under paragraph (2) due to health status or \n        preexisting condition.\n    ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to the health status \nor preexisting condition of a member of family of an individual \ndescribed under paragraph (3).\n    ``(3) An individual referred to under paragraphs (1) and (2) is--\n            ``(A) a Member of Congress; or\n            ``(B) an annuitant who on the date immediately preceding \n        the date of retirement described under section 8901(3)(A) was a \n        Member of Congress.\n    ``(4) This subsection shall cease to be effective on and after the \ndate on which the Director of the Office of Personnel Management has \nreceived certification from the Secretary of Labor that a statute has \nbeen enacted into law that--\n            ``(A) makes health coverage for United States citizens \n        portable by limiting exclusions for preexisting conditions;\n            ``(B) guarantees availability of health insurance to United \n        States citizens; and\n            ``(C) guarantees renewability of health coverage to \n        employers and individuals as long as premiums are paid.''.\n            (2) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect 30 \n        days after the date of the enactment of this section.\n    (c) Elimination of Coverage for Departing Members of Congress.--\nSection 8905 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (b) by striking ``An annuitant'' and \n        inserting ``Subject to subsection (g), an annuitant''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(g)(1) This section shall not apply to any annuitant who--\n            ``(A) on the date immediately preceding the date of \n        retirement described under section 8901(3)(A) was a Member of \n        Congress; and\n            ``(B) becomes an annuitant on or after the date which \n        occurs 30 days after the date of the enactment of this \n        subsection.\n    ``(2) This subsection shall cease to be effective on and after the \ndate on which the Director of the Office of Personnel Management has \nreceived certification from the Secretary of Labor that a statute has \nbeen enacted into law that--\n            ``(A) makes health coverage for United States citizens \n        portable by limiting exclusions for preexisting conditions;\n            ``(B) guarantees availability of health insurance to United \n        States citizens;
