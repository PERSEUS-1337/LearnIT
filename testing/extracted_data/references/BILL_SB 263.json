However, if the person is imprisoned in a county jail for at least 30 days, the court may, in the interest of justice and for reasons stated in the record, reduce or eliminate the six-month minimum imprisonment required by this subdivision. In determining whether to reduce or eliminate the minimum imprisonment pursuant to this subdivision, the court shall consider the seriousness of the facts before the court, whether there are additional allegations of a violation of the order during the pendency of the case before the court, the probability of future violations, the safety of the victim, and whether the defendant has successfully completed or is making progress with counseling.\n(f) The prosecuting agency of each county shall have the primary responsibility for the enforcement of orders described in subdivisions (a), (b), (d), and (e).\n(g) (1) Every person who owns, possesses, purchases, or receives a firearm knowing he or she is prohibited from doing so by the provisions of a protective order as defined in Section 136.2 of this code, Section 6218 of the Family Code, or Section 527.6, 527.8, or 527.85 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or Section 15657.03 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, shall be punished under Section 29825.\n(2) Every person subject to a protective order described in paragraph (1) shall not be prosecuted under this section for owning, possessing, purchasing, or receiving a firearm to the extent that firearm is granted an exemption pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 527.9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or subdivision (h) of Section 6389 of the Family Code.\n(h) If probation is granted upon conviction of a violation of subdivision (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e), the court shall impose probation consistent with Section 1203.097, and the conditions of probation may include, in lieu of a fine, one or both of the following requirements:\n(1) That the defendant make payments to a battered women\u2019s shelter or to a shelter for abused elder persons or dependent adults, up to a maximum of five thousand dollars ($5,000), pursuant to Section 1203.097.\n(2) That the defendant reimburse the victim for reasonable costs of counseling and other reasonable expenses that the court finds are the direct result of the defendant\u2019s offense.\n(i) For any order to pay a fine, make payments to a battered women\u2019s shelter, or pay restitution as a condition of probation under subdivision (e), the court shall make a determination of the defendant\u2019s ability to pay. In no event shall any order to make payments to a battered women\u2019s shelter be made if it would impair the ability of the defendant to pay direct restitution to the victim or court-ordered child support. Where the injury to a married person is caused in whole or in part by the criminal acts of his or her spouse in violation of this section, the community property may not be used to discharge the liability of the offending spouse for restitution to the injured spouse, required by Section 1203.04, as operative on or before August 2, 1995, or Section 1202.4, or to a shelter for costs with regard to the injured spouse and dependents, required by this section, until all separate property of the offending spouse is exhausted.\n(j) (1) This subdivision applies to a person who is both of the following:\n(A) The person is subject to a protective order, as defined in Section 6218 of the Family Code, or a protective order issued pursuant to this code, Section 527.6, 527.8, or 527.85 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or Section 15657.03 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n(B) The person is prohibited by the protective order described in subparagraph (A) from coming within a specified distance of another person.\n(2) A person described in paragraph (1) shall not do either of the following:\n(A) Operate an unmanned aircraft system in a way that causes an unmanned aircraft to fly within the prohibited distance of the other person.\n(B) Capture images of the other person by using an unmanned aircraft system.\n(3) A violation of paragraph (2) shall be a violation of the protective order.\n(4) For purposes of this subdivision, the following definitions apply:\n(A) \u201cUnmanned aircraft\u201d means an aircraft that is operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft.\n(B) \u201cUnmanned aircraft system\u201d means an unmanned aircraft and associated elements, including, but not limited to, communication links and the components that control the unmanned aircraft that are required for the pilot in command to operate safely and efficiently in the national airspace system.\nSEC. 2.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution.\nSECTION 1.\nSection 4210 of the\nPublic Resources Code\nis amended to read:\n4210.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a)Fire protection of the public trust resources on lands in the state responsibility areas remains a vital interest to California. Lands that are covered in whole or in part by a diverse plant community prevent excessive erosion, retard runoff, reduce sedimentation, and accelerate water percolation to assist in the maintenance of critical sources of water for environmental, irrigation, domestic, or industrial uses.\n(b)The presence of structures within state responsibility areas can pose an increased risk of fire ignition and an increased potential for fire damage within the state\u2019s wildlands and watersheds. The presence of structures within state responsibility areas can also impair wildland firefighting techniques and could result in greater damage to state lands caused by wildfires.\n(c)The costs of fire prevention activities aimed at reducing the effects of structures in state responsibility areas should be borne by the owners of the structures.\n(d)Individual owners of structures within state responsibility areas receive a disproportionately larger benefit from fire prevention activities than that realized by the state\u2019s citizens generally.\n(e)It is the intent of the Legislature that the economic burden of fire prevention activities that are associated with structures in state responsibility areas shall be equitably distributed among the citizens of the state who generally benefit from those activities and those owners of structures in the state responsibility areas who receive a specific benefit other than that general benefit.\n(f)It is necessary to impose a fire prevention fee to pay for fire prevention activities in the state responsibility areas that specifically benefit owners of structures in the state responsibility areas."
