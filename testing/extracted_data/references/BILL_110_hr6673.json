FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the best interest of the United States to \n        develop clean renewable geothermal energy.\n            (2) Development of such energy should be promoted on \n        appropriate Federal lands.\n            (3) Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Bureau of Land \n        Management is authorized to issue three different types of non-\n        competitive leases for production of geothermal energy on \n        Federal lands, including non-competitive geothermal leases to \n        mining claim holders that have a valid operating plan, direct \n        use leases, and leases on parcels that do not sell at a \n        competitive auction.\n            (4) Federal geothermal energy leasing activity should be \n        directed towards those seeking to develop the land as opposed \n        to those seeking to speculate on geothermal resources and \n        thereby artificially raising the cost of legitimate geothermal \n        energy development.\n            (5) Developers of geothermal energy on Federal lands that \n        have invested substantial capital and made high risk \n        investments should be allowed to secure a discovery of \n        geothermal energy resources.\n            (6) Successful geothermal development on Federal lands will \n        provide increased revenue to the Federal Government, with the \n        payment of production royalties over decades.\n\nSEC. 2. NONCOMPETITIVE LEASING OF ADJOINING AREAS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF \n              GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES.\n\n    The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended--\n            (1) in section 2 (30 U.S.C. 1001)--\n                    (A) by striking the period at the end of each of \n                paragraphs (e) and (f) and inserting a semicolon;\n                    (B) by striking ``, and'' at the end of paragraph \n                (g) and inserting a semicolon; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following new \n                paragraphs:\n            ``(h) `industry standards' means the standards by which a \n        qualified geothermal professional assesses whether downhole or \n        flowing temperature measurements with indications of \n        permeability are sufficient to produce geothermal steam or \n        geothermal resources as determined through flow or injection \n        testing or measurement of lost circulation while drilling;\n            ``(i) `qualified geothermal professional' means an \n        individual who is an engineer or geoscientist in good \n        professional standing with at least five years of experience in \n        geothermal exploration, development, project assessment, or any \n        combination of the forgoing; and\n            ``(j) `valid discovery' means a discovery of a geothermal \n        resource by a new or existing slim hole or production well, \n        that exhibits downhole or flowing temperature measurements with \n        indications of permeability sufficient to meet industry \n        standards.''; and\n            (2) in section 4(b) (30 U.S.C. 1003(b)), by adding at the \n        end the following:\n            ``(4) Adjoining lands.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Areas that adjoin Federal or \n                non-Federal lands for which a qualified company or \n                individual holds a legal right to develop geothermal \n                resources may be available for noncompetitive lease \n                under this section to the qualified company or \n                individual at the fair market value per acre, if--\n                            ``(i) the adjoining areas--\n                                    ``(I) consist of an area of not \n                                more than a total of 640 acres;\n                                    ``(II) each consist of not less \n                                than one acre;\n                                    ``(III) are not already leased \n                                under this Act or nominated to be \n                                leased under subsection (a);\n                            ``(ii) the qualified company or individual \n                        has not previously received a noncompetitive \n                        lease under this paragraph in connection with \n                        the valid discovery for which data has been \n                        submitted under subclause (I) of clause (iii);
