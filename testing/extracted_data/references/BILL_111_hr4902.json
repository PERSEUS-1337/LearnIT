and\n                    (C) what the implications for and effects on \n                military readiness, cohesion, morale, good order, and \n                discipline are entailed as a result of repeal or \n                amendment of section 654.\n            (3) Scope of evaluation.--The evaluation described in \n        paragraph (2) shall encompass the regular and reserve \n        components, military family members and dependents, and matters \n        of expanded eligibility of retirees and their families and \n        dependents for Federal benefits as a result of military service \n        before any repeal of such section.\n    (b) Expanded Objectives.--In addition to the requirements \nestablished by the terms of reference issued on March 2, 2010, the \nworking group shall examine and report to the Secretary of Defense on \nthe following matters:\n            (1) Whether the findings contained in subsection (a) of \n        section 654 remain valid.\n            (2) Whether section 654 has hindered, in a measurably \n        significant way, the ability of the Armed Forces to recruit and \n        retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to meet \n        service manpower requirements.\n            (3) Whether section 654 has hindered the ability of any \n        component, especially the Army, the Marine Corps, and the Army \n        National Guard, to increase manpower, especially during \n        wartime.\n            (4) Whether the discharge of personnel under section 654 \n        has had a measurably significant impact on military readiness \n        or on the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their \n        wartime missions since September 11, 2001.\n            (5) Given the numbers of personnel discharged under section \n        654 since enactment of the section on November 30, 1993, \n        compared to the total number of personnel separated from the \n        Armed Forces for all reasons since that date, whether \n        discharges under section 654 have been a significant source of \n        attrition for the Armed Forces.\n            (6) Whether repeal of section 654 is a military necessity \n        for sustaining future military readiness and effectiveness.\n            (7) The extent to which, and how, repeal of section 654 \n        would improve military readiness, cohesion, morale, good order, \n        and discipline.\n            (8) The extent to which repeal of section 654 would have \n        negative impacts on military readiness, cohesion, morale, good \n        order, and discipline;

1 U.S.C. 7) and the associated provision of \n                such H.R. 1283 would create a significant difference in \n                the pay, benefits, and other forms of support from the \n                Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans \n                Affairs, and other Federal departments that could be \n                provided to legally married heterosexual military \n                couples, families and dependents and the pay, benefits, \n                and other forms of support that could be provided to \n                legally married military gay couples, families and \n                dependents;\n                    (B) explain the nature and extent of those \n                differences;\n                    (C) explain the extent to which the limitations on \n                benefits resulting from the Defense of Marriage Act \n                would affect military readiness, cohesion, morale, and \n                good order and discipline; and\n                    (D) explain the extent to which this diversity of \n                benefits would affect military family readiness, \n                morale, welfare, and cohesion.\n            (16) To effectively implement a repeal of section 654, \n        whether the Defense of Marriage Act should be repealed or \n        amended, and explain the basis for the conclusion.\n            (17) The extent to which, and the nature and objectives of, \n        education and training measures and programs that would be \n        required, upon repeal of section 654, for members of the Armed \n        Forces, their families, and dependents.\n            (18) The projected costs of a repeal of section 654, \n        including costs attributable to changes in military barracks, \n        housing policies, and military construction considered \n        necessary to accommodate various sexual orientations.\n            (19) The extent to which, upon repeal of section 654, gay \n        and lesbian military retirees, their families, and dependents \n        should be made eligible retroactively for Federal benefits in \n        the same manner as the benefits received by heterosexual \n        military retirees, their families, and dependents as a result \n        of service in the Armed Forces, and if so, what benefits should \n        be provided and at what estimated cost.\n    (c) Methodology.--\n            (1) Use of in-house resources.--The surveys, polling, \n        studies, updates or revisions, and analysis conducted by or for \n        the working group, and instruments designed to conduct such \n        surveys, polling, studies, updates or revisions, and analysis, \n        shall primarily, if not exclusively, employ the in-house \n        capabilities of the Department of Defense.\n            (2) Restriction.--If the Secretary of Defense or the \n        working group determines that required surveys, polling, focus \n        groups, and analysis cannot be conducted solely using in-house \n        capabilities of the Department of Defense, the Secretary and \n        the working group may not for those purposes employ, or use the \n        survey instruments or data from, any organization that has \n        previously done any survey, polling, or analysis work on \n        matters related to a potential repeal of section 654 or the \n        Department of Defense policy that preceded enactment of section \n        654.\n    (d) Revised Reporting Requirement and Time Lines.--Not later than \nsix months after the working group provides its final report to the \nSecretary of Defense, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on \nArmed Services of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report \ncontaining--\n            (1) the report and recommendations of the working group, as \n        modified as required by subsections (a) and (b);\n            (2) the comments and recommendations of the Chief of Staff \n        of the Army, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Chief of Staff \n        of the Air Force, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps \n        regarding the conclusions and recommendations of the working \n        group;
