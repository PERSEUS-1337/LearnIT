FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1986, an interagency working group issued a report \n        assessing ``active measures'' by the former Soviet Union \n        against the United States.\n            (2) The working group concluded that ``there is a massive \n        and highly organized effort by the Soviet Union and its proxies \n        to influence world opinion''.\n            (3) The working group further observed that ``this effort \n        includes public diplomacy to enhance the Soviet image abroad \n        and . . . also includes a persistent, widespread program of \n        disinformation and deception designed to discredit the U.S. \n        image abroad and disrupt U.S. policy objectives.''.\n            (4) Active measures by the Russian Federation have shown no \n        diminution since the last report issued by the working group in \n        1987, including--\n                    (A) to influence world opinion;\n                    (B) to undercut democratic processes and \n                institutions in the United States and partner nations;\n                    (C) to challenge the international liberal order; \n                and\n                    (D) to establish an unfettered sphere of influence.\n            (5) The Director of National Intelligence concluded in \n        light of the Russian Federation's hacking of the 2016 \n        presidential election that ``Russian efforts to influence the \n        2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most recent \n        expression of Moscow's longstanding desire to undermine the \n        U.S.-led liberal democratic order.''.\n            (6) The Russian Federation is deploying an array of \n        military, cyber, intelligence, and economic tactics to weaken \n        United States democratic institutions, divide Europe from the \n        United States, divide Europe from within, undermine \n        organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        and the European Union, and coerce partners to cooperate with \n        Russia.\n            (7) Militarily, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered \n        the forcible and illegal occupation of Crimea in March 2014 and \n        the invasion of Georgia in 2008.\n            (8) The Russian military, in which President Putin has \n        invested heavily, continues to engage in acts of aggression and \n        intimidation against United States allies across Europe.\n            (9) The Russian Federation's subversive activities \n        undermine trust in democratic systems, giving rise to political \n        instability.\n\nSEC. 3.
