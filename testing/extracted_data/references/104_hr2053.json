FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The People's Republic of China comprises one-fifth of \n        the world's population, or 1,200,000,000 people, and its \n        policies have a profound effect on the world economy and global \n        security.\n            (2) The People's Republic of China is a permanent member of \n        the United Nations Security Council and plays an important role \n        in regional organizations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic \n        Cooperation Forum and the ASEAN Regional Forum.\n            (3) The People's Republic of China is a nuclear power with \n        the largest standing army in the world, and has been rapidly \n        modernizing and expanding its military capabilities.\n            (4) The People's Republic of China is currently undergoing \n        a change of leadership which will have dramatic implications \n        for the political and economic future of the Chinese people and \n        for China's relations with the United States.\n            (5) China's estimated $600,000,000,000 economy has enjoyed \n        unparalleled growth in recent years.\n            (6) Economic liberalization in China has hastened \n        development of an informed middle class which demands greater \n        political and civil freedom; therefore, the Chinese people, \n        including a number of dissidents, favor increased economic \n        contacts between the United States and China.\n            (7) Despite increased economic linkages between the United \n        States and China, bilateral relations have deteriorated \n        significantly because of fundamental policy differences over a \n        variety of important foreign policy issues.\n            (8) The People's Republic of China has violated \n        international standards regarding the nonproliferation of \n        weapons of mass destruction.\n            (9) According to the State Department Country Report on \n        Human Rights Practices for 1994, there continue to be \n        ``widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in China, \n        in violation of internationally accepted norms . . . \n        (including) arbitrary and lengthy incommunicado detention, \n        torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. . . . The regime \n        continued severe restrictions on freedom of speech, press, \n        assembly and association, and tightened control on the exercise \n        of these rights during 1994. Serious human rights abuses \n        persisted in Tibet and other areas populated by ethnic \n        minorities.''.\n            (10) The unjustified and arbitrary arrest, imprisonment, \n        and initiation of criminal proceedings against Harry Wu, a \n        citizen of the United States, has greatly exacerbated the \n        deterioration in relations between the United States and the \n        People's Republic of China, and all charges against him should \n        be dismissed.\n            (11) The United States currently has numerous sanctions on \n        the People's Republic of China with respect to government-to-\n        government assistance, arms sales, and other commercial \n        transactions.\n            (12) It is in the interest of the United States to foster \n        China's continued engagement in the broadest range of \n        international fora and increased respect for human rights, \n        democratic institutions, and the rule of law in China.\n\nSEC. 3.
