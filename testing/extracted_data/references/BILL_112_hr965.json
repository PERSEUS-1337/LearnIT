FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In January 2001, a Federal interagency task force--\n                    (A) released an action plan to address the \n                continuing decline in effectiveness of antibiotics \n                against common bacterial infections, referred to as \n                antibiotic resistance;\n                    (B) determined that antibiotic resistance is a \n                growing menace to all people and poses a serious threat \n                to public health; and\n                    (C) cautioned that if current trends continue, \n                treatments for common infections will become \n                increasingly limited and expensive, and, in some cases, \n                nonexistent.\n            (2) Antibiotic resistance, resulting in a reduced number of \n        effective antibiotics, may significantly impair the ability of \n        the United States to respond to terrorist attacks involving \n        bacterial infections or a large influx of hospitalized \n        patients.\n            (3)(A) Any overuse or misuse of antibiotics contributes to \n        the spread of antibiotic resistance, whether in human medicine \n        or in agriculture.\n            (B) Recognizing the public health threat caused by \n        antibiotic resistance, Congress took several steps to curb \n        antibiotic overuse in human medicine through amendments to the \n        Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) made by \n        section 102 of the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act \n        (Public Law 106-505, title I; 114 Stat. 2315), but has not yet \n        addressed antibiotic overuse in agriculture.\n            (4) In a March 2003 report, the National Academy of \n        Sciences stated that--\n                    (A) a decrease in antimicrobial use in human \n                medicine alone will have little effect on the current \n                situation; and\n                    (B) substantial efforts must be made to decrease \n                inappropriate overuse in animals and agriculture.\n            (5) In 2010, the FDA determined that--\n                    (A) 13.1 million kilograms of antibacterial drugs \n                were sold for use on food animals in the United States \n                in 2009;\n                    (B) 3.3 million kilograms of antibacterial drugs \n                were used for human health in 2009; and\n                    (C) therefore, 80 percent of antibacterial drugs \n                disseminated in the United States in 2009 were sold for \n                use on food animals, rather than being used for human \n                health.\n            (6)(A) Large-scale, voluntary surveys by the Department of \n        Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in \n        1999, 2001, and 2006 revealed that--\n                    (i) 84 percent of grower-finisher swine farms, 83 \n                percent of cattle feedlots, and 84 percent of sheep \n                farms administer antimicrobials in the feed or water \n                for health or growth promotion reasons; and\n                    (ii) many of the antimicrobials identified are \n                identical or closely related to drugs used in human \n                medicine, including tetracyclines, macrolides, \n                Bacitracin, penicillins, and sulfonamides; and\n            (B) these drugs are used in people to treat serious \n        diseases such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, \n        venereal disease, skin infections, and even pandemics like \n        malaria and plague, as well as bioterrorism agents like \n        smallpox and anthrax.\n            (7) Many scientific studies confirm that the nontherapeutic \n        use of antibiotics in agricultural animals contributes to the \n        development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in \n        people.\n            (8) The periodical entitled ``Clinical Infectious \n        Diseases'' published a report in June 2002, that--\n                    (A) was based on a 2-year review by experts in \n                human and veterinary medicine, public health, \n                microbiology, biostatistics, and risk analysis, of more \n                than 500 scientific studies on the human health impacts \n                of antimicrobial use in agriculture; and\n                    (B) recommended that antimicrobial agents should no \n                longer be used in agriculture in the absence of \n                disease, but should be limited to therapy for diseased \n                individual animals and prophylaxis when disease is \n                documented in a herd or flock.\n            (9) The United States Geological Survey reported in March \n        2002 that--\n                    (A) antibiotics were present in 48 percent of the \n                streams tested nationwide; and\n                    (B) almost half of the tested streams were \n                downstream from agricultural operations.\n            (10) An April 1999 study by the General Accounting Office \n        concluded that resistant strains of 3 microorganisms that cause \n        food-borne illness or disease in humans (Salmonella, \n        Campylobacter, and E. coli) are linked to the use of \n        antibiotics in animals.\n            (11) Epidemiological research has shown that resistant \n        Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are associated with \n        increased numbers of ill patients and bloodstream infections, \n        and increased death.\n            (12) In 2010, the peer-reviewed journal Molecular Cell \n        published a study demonstrating that low-dosage use of \n        antibiotics causes a dramatic increase in genetic mutation, \n        raising new concerns about the agricultural practice of using \n        low-dosage antibiotics in order to stimulate growth promotion \n        and routinely prevent disease in unhealthy conditions.\n            (13)(A) In January 2003, Consumer Reports published test \n        results on poultry products bought in grocery stores nationwide \n        showing disturbingly high levels of Campylobacter and \n        Salmonella bacteria that were resistant to the antibiotics used \n        to treat food-borne illnesses.\n            (B) The Food and Drug Administration's National \n        Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System routinely finds that \n        retail meat products are contaminated with bacteria (including \n        the foodborne pathogens Campylobacter and Salmonella) that are \n        resistant to antibiotics important in human medicine.\n            (C) In December 2007, the USDA issued a fact sheet on the \n        recently recognized link between antimicrobial drug use in \n        animals and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureas (MRSA) \n        infections in humans.\n            (14) In October 2001, the New England Journal of Medicine \n        published an editorial urging a ban on nontherapeutic use of \n        medically important antibiotics in animals.\n            (15)(A) In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences noted \n        that antibiotic-resistant bacteria generate a minimum of \n        $4,000,000,000 to $5,000,000,000 in costs to United States \n        society and individuals yearly.\n            (B) In 2009, Cook County Hospital and the Alliance for \n        Prudent Use of Antibiotics estimated that the total health care \n        cost of antibiotic resistant infections in the United States \n        was between $16,600,000,000 and $26,000,000,000 annually.\n            (16) The American Medical Association, the American Public \n        Health Association, the National Association of County and City \n        Health Officials, and the National Campaign for Sustainable \n        Agriculture are among the more than 300 organizations \n        representing health, consumer, agricultural, environmental, \n        humane, and other interests that have supported enactment of \n        legislation to phase out nontherapeutic use in farm animals of \n        medically important antibiotics.\n            (17) In 2010, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration \n        testified that the Danish ban of the non-therapeutic use of \n        antibiotics in food animal production resulted in a marked \n        reduction in antimicrobial resistance in multiple bacterial \n        species, including Campylobacter and Enterococci.\n            (18) In 2009, the Congressional Research Service concluded \n        that restrictions overseas on the use of antimicrobial drugs in \n        the production of livestock could impact U.S. export markets \n        for livestock and poultry.\n            (19) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n        301 et seq.)--\n                    (A) requires that all drugs be shown to be safe \n                before the drugs are approved; and\n                    (B) places the burden on manufacturers to account \n                for health consequences and prove safety.\n            (20)(A) The Food and Drug Administration recently modified \n        the drug approval process for antibiotics to recognize the \n        development of resistant bacteria as an important aspect of \n        safety, but most antibiotics currently used in animal \n        production systems for nontherapeutic purposes were approved \n        before the Food and Drug Administration began considering \n        resistance during the drug-approval process.\n            (B) The Food and Drug Administration has not established a \n        schedule for reviewing those existing approvals.\n            (21) Certain non-routine uses of antibiotics in animal \n        agriculture are legitimate to prevent animal disease.\n            (22) An April 2004 study by the General Accounting Office--\n                    (A) concluded that Federal agencies do not collect \n                the critical data on antibiotic use in animals that \n                they need to support research on human health risks; \n                and\n                    (B) recommends that the Department of Agriculture \n                and the Department of Health and Human Services develop \n                and implement a plan to collect data on antibiotic use \n                in animals.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to preserve the effectiveness of \nmedically important antibiotics used in the treatment of human and \nanimal diseases by reviewing the safety of certain antibiotics for \nnontherapeutic purposes in food-producing animals.\n\nSEC. 4. PROOF OF SAFETY OF CRITICAL ANTIMICROBIAL ANIMAL DRUGS.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(ss) Critical Antimicrobial Animal Drug.--The term `critical \nantimicrobial animal drug' means a drug that--\n            ``(1) is intended for use in food-producing animals; and\n            ``(2) is composed wholly or partly of--\n                    ``(A) any kind of penicillin, tetracycline, \n                macrolide, lincosamide, streptogramin, aminoglycoside, \n                or sulfonamide; or\n                    ``(B) any other drug or derivative of a drug that \n                is used in humans or intended for use in humans to \n                treat or prevent disease or infection caused by \n                microorganisms.\n    ``(tt) Nontherapeutic Use.--The term `nontherapeutic use', with \nrespect to a critical antimicrobial animal drug, means any use of the \ndrug as a feed or water additive for an animal in the absence of any \nclinical sign of disease in the animal for growth promotion, feed \nefficiency, weight gain, routine disease prevention, or other routine \npurpose.''.\n    (b) Applications Pending or Submitted After Enactment.--Section \n512(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n360b(d)(1)) is amended--\n            (1) in the first sentence--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (H), by striking ``or'' at the \n                end;\n                    (B) in subparagraph (I), by inserting ``or'' at the \n                end; and\n                    (C) by inserting after subparagraph (I) the \n                following:\n                    ``(J) with respect to a critical antimicrobial \n                animal drug or a drug of the same chemical class as a \n                critical antimicrobial animal drug, the applicant has \n                failed to demonstrate that there is a reasonable \n                certainty of no harm to human health due to the \n                development of antimicrobial resistance that is \n                attributable, in whole or in part, to the \n                nontherapeutic use of the drug; or''; and\n            (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``(A) through (I)'' \n        and inserting ``(A) through (J)''.\n    (c) Phased Elimination of Nontherapeutic Use in Animals of Critical \nAntimicrobial Animal Drugs Important for Human Health.--Section 512 of \nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(q) Phased Elimination of Nontherapeutic Use in Animals of \nCritical Antimicrobial Animal Drugs Important for Human Health.--\n            ``(1) Applicability.--This subsection applies to the \n        nontherapeutic use in a food-producing animal of a drug--\n                    ``(A)(i) that is a critical antimicrobial animal \n                drug;
