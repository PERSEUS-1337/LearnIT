FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Government of Haiti, more than 316,000 \n        people died as a result of the earthquake that struck 15 miles \n        southwest of Port-au-Prince on January 12, 2010, including 103 \n        United States citizens and more than 100 United Nations \n        personnel.\n            (2) According to the United Nations and the International \n        Organization for Migration, an estimated 3,000,000 people were \n        directly affected by the disaster, and more than 2,100,000 \n        people were displaced from their homes.\n            (3) The Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted by the \n        Government of Haiti, the United Nations, the World Bank, the \n        Inter-American Development Bank, and others estimated that \n        damage and economic losses totaled $7,804,000,000, \n        approximately 120 percent of Haiti's gross domestic product in \n        2009.\n            (4) The initial emergency response of the men and women of \n        the United States Government, led by the United States Agency \n        for International Development (USAID) and the United States \n        Southern Command, as well as of cities, towns, individuals, \n        businesses, and philanthropic organizations across the United \n        States, was swift and resolute.\n            (5) According to the Government of Haiti, numerous \n        multilateral agencies such as the United Nations, and \n        international NGOs, Haiti faces an ongoing food crisis as a \n        result of the earthquake and subsequent damage caused by \n        tropical storms and hurricanes, as well as long term neglect of \n        the agriculture sector.\n            (6) According to the International Organization for \n        Migration, approximately 350,000 people remain in spontaneous \n        and organized camps in Haiti, and reports by the General \n        Accountability Office, USAID Inspector General, and civil \n        society organizations indicate that the pace of recovery and \n        development has lagged significantly behind the emergency \n        relief phase.\n            (7) Haitian civil society organizations have noted a lack \n        of systematic and widespread consultations with Haitian \n        communities for their input in the recovery and development \n        process.\n            (8) On October 21, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was \n        detected and according to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health \n        and Population, as of February 17, 2013, more than 8,000 people \n        had died from cholera and more than 647,500 had been infected \n        with the disease.\n            (9) The United States has provided more than $95,000,000 in \n        aid to combat the cholera epidemic and care for the victims.\n            (10) The United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for \n        Haiti estimates that, including donor pledges and other \n        support, approximately $6,400,000,000 has been disbursed, with \n        an additional amount of $3,800,000,000 committed, to assist in \n        Haiti's recovery and development.\n            (11) The United States Government has obligated \n        approximately $3,600,000,000 for relief, recovery and \n        development in Haiti since the earthquake, of which \n        $1,300,000,000 had been disbursed as of April 2013.\n            (12) Significant challenges remain in Haiti which will \n        require continued recovery and development aid from the \n        international community for the foreseeable future.\n            (13) The Haitian Diaspora has also played an essential role \n        in Haiti's reconstruction and the United States Government \n        should take steps to increase outreach and encourage \n        participation by Haitian Americans in recovery and development \n        activities in Haiti.\n\nSEC. 3.
