PROHIBITION.\n\n    Section 922(q) of title 18, United States Code, is amended to read \nas follows:\n    ``(q)(1) The Congress finds and declares that--\n            ``(A) crime, particularly crime involving drugs and guns, \n        is a pervasive, nationwide problem;\n            ``(B) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the \n        interstate movement of drugs, guns, and criminal gangs;\n            ``(C) firearms and ammunition move easily in interstate \n        commerce and have been found in increasing numbers in and \n        around schools, as documented in numerous hearings in both the \n        Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives and the \n        Judiciary Committee of the Senate;\n            ``(D) in fact, even before the sale of a firearm, the gun, \n        its component parts, ammunition, and the raw materials from \n        which they are made have considerably moved in interstate \n        commerce;\n            ``(E) while criminals freely move from State to State, \n        ordinary citizens and foreign visitors may fear to travel to or \n        through certain parts of the country due to concern about \n        violent crime and gun violence, and parents may decline to send \n        their children to school for the same reason;\n            ``(F) the occurrence of violent crime in school zones has \n        resulted in a decline in the quality of education in our \n        country;\n            ``(G) this decline in the quality of education has an \n        adverse impact on interstate commerce and the foreign commerce \n        of the United States;\n            ``(H) States, localities, and school systems find it almost \n        impossible to handle gun-related crime by themselves; even \n        States, localities, and school systems that have made strong \n        efforts to prevent, detect, and punish gun-related crime find \n        their efforts unavailing due in part to the failure or \n        inability of other States or localities to take strong \n        measures; and\n            ``(I) Congress has power, under the interstate commerce \n        clause and other provisions of the Constitution, to enact \n        measures to ensure the integrity and safety of the Nation's \n        schools by enactment of this subsection.\n    ``(2)(A) It shall be unlawful for any individual knowingly to \npossess a firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects \ninterstate or foreign commerce at a place that the individual knows, or \nhas reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone.\n    ``(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the possession of a \nfirearm--\n            ``(i) on private property not part of school grounds;\n            ``(ii) if the individual possessing the firearm is licensed \n        to do so by the State in which the school zone is located or a \n        political subdivision of the State, and the law of the State or \n        political subdivision requires that, before an individual \n        obtains such a license, the law enforcement authorities of the \n        State or political subdivision verify that the individual is \n        qualified under law to receive the license;\n            ``(iii) which is--\n                    ``(I) not loaded; and\n                    ``(II) in a locked container, or a locked firearms \n                rack which is on a motor vehicle;\n            ``(iv) by an individual for use in a program approved by a \n        school in the school zone;\n            ``(v) by an individual in accordance with a contract \n        entered into between a school in the school zone and the \n        individual or an employer of the individual;\n            ``(vi) by a law enforcement officer acting in his or her \n        official capacity; or\n            ``(vii) that is unloaded and is possessed by an individual \n        while traversing school premises for the purpose of gaining \n        access to public or private lands open to hunting, if the entry \n        on school premises is authorized by school authorities.\n    ``(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), it shall be \nunlawful for any person, knowingly or with reckless disregard for the \nsafety of another, to discharge or attempt to discharge a firearm that \nhas moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce \nat a place that the person knows is a school zone.\n    ``(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the discharge of a \nfirearm--\n            ``(i) on private property not part of school grounds;\n            ``(ii) as part of a program approved by a school in the \n        school zone, by an individual who is participating in the \n        program;\n            ``(iii) by an individual in accordance with a contract \n        entered into between a school in a school zone and the \n        individual or an employer of the individual; or\n            ``(iv) by a law enforcement officer acting in his or her \n        official capacity.\n    ``(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preempting \nor preventing a State or local government from enacting a statute \nestablishing gun free school zones as provided in this subsection.''."
