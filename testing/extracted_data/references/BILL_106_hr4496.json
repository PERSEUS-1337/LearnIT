FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Throughout history, wolves have been misunderstood and \n        feared. Wolves have been subjected to widespread persecution \n        and targeted by large scale predator eradication programs \n        sponsored by private, State, and Federal entities. The \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 finally protected wolves as \n        endangered species, but by that time wolves had been almost \n        completely exterminated from the lower 48 States, except for a \n        few hundred wolves that inhabited extreme northeastern \n        Minnesota.\n            (2) The subspecies commonly known as the Eastern Timber \n        Wolf (Canis lupus lycaon) once had an extensive range covering \n        most of the Eastern United States, including the Catskill \n        Mountains of New York.\n            (3) Reintroduction of the Eastern Timber Wolf into the \n        State of New York would serve the public interest, by--\n                    (A) helping to ensure the survival of that \n                subspecies;\n                    (B) enhancing the biological diversity of the \n                ecosystems of the State of New York and bringing them \n                into a more natural balance;\n                    (C) beginning to redress some of the mistakes of \n                the past, such as the Government-sponsored \n                extermination of the Eastern Timber Wolf; and\n                    (D) enhancing our understanding of wolves and of \n                the environment.\n            (4) The public debate surrounding wolf reintroduction in \n        the Northeastern United States would foster a deeper \n        understanding within the general public about the complex \n        interactions among species in their natural environments.\n\n SEC. 3. EASTERN TIMBER WOLF REINTRODUCTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall prepare and \npublish a recovery plan for the Eastern Timber Wolf in the Northeastern \nUnited States under section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n(16 U.S.C. 1533(f)), including a plan for releasing Eastern Timber \nWolves in the Catskill Mountain area of New York under section 10(j) of \nthat Act (16 U.S.C. 1539(j)).\n    (b) Plan Contents.--The Plan shall include the following:\n            (1) Goals for the biological recovery of the Eastern Timber \n        Wolf, including wolf population goals that must be achieved as \n        a condition for removing that subspecies from lists under \n        section 4(c) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n        1533(c)).\n            (2) A process and method for obtaining Eastern Timber \n        Wolves from Canada for release under the plan.\n            (3) An outline of how releases under the Plan will proceed, \n        including proposals for cooperative agreements that may be \n        pursued with State and local government agencies to facilitate \n        those releases.\n            (4) A determination of the number of Eastern Timber Wolves \n        that should be released under the Plan to ensure a self-\n        sustaining population of that species in the Catskill Mountain \n        area of New York.\n            (5) A process for compensating New York residents for \n        depredation of livestock by Eastern Timber Wolves, including--\n                    (A) an estimate of the number and value of \n                livestock in New York expected to be lost to \n                depredation by that species;\n                    (B) criteria for determining in individual cases \n                whether livestock depredation by that species has \n                actually occurred;\n                    (C) procedures for providing compensation;\n                    (D) establishment of a separate account for the \n                receipt and disbursement of donations of money for use \n                to pay compensation, that shall be known as the \n                ``Protecting Eastern Timber Wolf Restoration Mitigation \n                Fund''; and\n                    (E) an estimate of the amount of money that would \n                be needed in that account to ensure in perpetuity the \n                availability of amounts for paying such compensation.\n            (6) A study of--\n                    (A) the feasibility of releasing Eastern Timber \n                Wolves in other parts of New York; and\n                    (B) the feasibility of reducing road densities in \n                certain areas of New York to provide for wolf dispersal \n                corridors.\n    (c) Acceptance and Use of Donations.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary may accept and use donations \n        of funds for compensating New York residents for depredation of \n        livestock by Eastern Timber Wolves under the Plan.\n            (2) Deposit into pet wolf fund.--Amounts received as \n        donations under this subsection--\n                    (A) shall be deposited into the PET Wolf Fund; and\n                    (B) shall be available, subject to appropriations, \n                for paying compensation in accordance with the Plan.\n\nSEC. 4.
