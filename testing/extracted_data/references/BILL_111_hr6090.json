SHORT TITLE: FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Court \nReauthorization Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Studies have concluded that drug courts significantly \n        reduce crime by as much as 35 percent more than other \n        sentencing options.\n            (2) Nationwide, 75 percent of participants who successfully \n        complete a drug court program remain arrest-free for at least 2 \n        years after leaving the program, and some studies demonstrate \n        that many graduates remain arrest-free for many more years.\n            (3) Drug courts are 6 times more likely than other \n        sentencing options to keep offenders in treatment long enough \n        to recover, and in programs with less supervision than drug \n        courts, 70 percent of participants drop out of treatment \n        permanently.\n            (4) Nationwide, for every $1 invested in drug courts, \n        taxpayers save as much as $3.36.\n            (5) In 2007, for every Federal dollar invested in drug \n        courts, $9 was leveraged in State funding.\n\nSEC. 2.
