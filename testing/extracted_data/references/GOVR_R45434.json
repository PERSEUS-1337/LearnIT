    "content": "Over the past two years, Congress has demonstrated significant interest in U.S. and international trade trends as part of its efforts to examine U.S. trade policy and key U.S. trading relationships. Congress's role in trade policy stems from a number of overlapping responsibilities, including its constitutional authority over regulating commerce with foreign countries and broad oversight responsibility over the performance of the economy. In some areas, particularly in negotiating trade agreements, Congress has opted to delegate certain authorities to the President. Interest in bilateral trade flows and balances has been heightened as the Trump Administration renegotiates existing U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) and pursues news ones, and takes a more forceful stance to reduce U.S. bilateral trade deficits, enforce U.S. trade laws and agreements, and promote what it considers to be \"free,\" \"fair,\" and \"reciprocal\" trade. Members of Congress have long recognized that international trade is an important engine not only of the U.S. economy, but also of the global economy. Total trade (exports plus imports) as a share of global gross domestic product (GDP) has risen from 25% in 1960 to 56% in 2017. Greater openness to trade and reforms worldwide have been linked to higher growth in productivity and real incomes, as well as to reduced poverty. \u00a0For decades since World War II, annual real global trade growth outpaced GDP growth, growing on average 1.5 times faster. This trend has not held in recent years as the global economy recovered from the global financial and economic crisis. Growth in the volume of world merchandise trade slowed to 2.0% in 2016\u2014the slowest pace of growth since 2009. Trade growth has seen some rebound, increasing to 5.4% in 2017\u2014the strongest growth rate since 2011, driven mainly by cyclical factors, particularly increased investment and consumption expenditure.  U.S. world trade has grown steadily over the past decade. In 2017, the United States exported $2.4 trillion in goods and services and imported $2.9 trillion. \u00a0Since 2009, when trade flows declined sharply in the midst of the financial crisis, U.S. exports have grown 48.5%, while U.S. imports have grown 47.6% in nominal terms. More broadly, since 1960, trade relative to GDP has risen markedly. U.S. exports as a share of GDP expanded from 5% in 1960 to over 12% of GDP in 2017, while U.S. imports expanded from 4% to over 15% of GDP ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ).  According to data from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, China was the top U.S. trading partner in 2017, with $711.7 billion in total goods and services trade, followed by Canada ($679.9 billion), Mexico ($622.1 billion), Japan ($286.1 billion), and Germany ($239.8 billion). China was the largest source of U.S. imports, while Canada was the largest destination for U.S. exports. However, considering the 28 member states of the European Union (EU) as a single trading partner, the EU is both the largest U.S. export destination ($528.2 billion) and the largest source of U.S. imports ($629.4 billion). The majority of U.S. global trade\u2014approximately 65%\u2014is with countries with which the United States does not have a free trade agreement (FTA). Moreover, while most of the United States' largest trading partners remain advanced economies, U.S. trade with emerging market and developing economies\u2014although comparatively low\u2014accounts for a growing share of total U.S. trade ( Figure 3 and Figure 4 ). The changes in U.S. trade patterns pose both opportunities and challenges for U.S. international trade relations. These developments have intensified congressional interest in U.S. trade policy and heightened its demand for information and comparative analysis of bilateral U.S. trade flows. In the coming months, Congress may face issues such as shaping U.S. trade policy to reflect this changing composition of trade; enhancing the competitive position of U.S. firms, workers, and industries; promoting access to new foreign market opportunities for U.S. businesses; and addressing tensions, trade barriers, and issues raised by the growing role of emerging economies in the global economy. In addition, questions affecting U.S. trade trends could also arise as the Trump Administration renegotiates FTAs and pursues new ones, and Congress debates and ratifies them. Congress is expected to closely monitor negotiations on other trade agreements and on developments at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The economic position of the United States is also an important factor to consider. The agreements and negotiations raise several important policy questions: Do the agreements and the ongoing negotiations serve U.S. interests? Is the Administration fulfilling its obligations under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)? Are bilateral and regional FTAs and negotiations, on the one hand, and the U.S. multilateral agenda at the WTO, on the other hand, mutually supportive or in conflict? In deciding whether to approve new bilateral FTAs, or debate more generally on U.S. trade policy, Members of Congress may weigh potential costs and benefits to their constituents and to the U.S. economy as a whole. This report provides a summary of the main economic developments in the trade activities of the United States with its major trading partners in 2017\u2014the most recent year for which yearly U.S. trade data are available. It is intended primarily as a reference, and it focuses on what has happened with U.S. bilateral trade relations in recent years\u2014not why or what the changes imply. The main objective of this report is to present the current data and statistics in a way that is accessible and understandable to help inform policy discussions. It is important to note that the growth in global production chains, intrafirm trade, and trade in intermediate goods means that traditional accounting methods may distort trade data and not fully reflect the source of resources that are used in producing goods and services (see \" Limitations of Trade Data \"). This makes it increasingly difficult to understand and interpret the implications of trade data for the U.S. economy. (A comprehensive overview of recent trends and developments in U.S. trade is provided in CRS Report R45420, U.S. Trade Trends and Developments , by Andres B. Schwarzenberg.) This report relies heavily on resources from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau, and from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)\u2014the main sources of U.S. trade data\u2014for information and statistics presented throughout the report. It is also based on primary and secondary source materials, including publications and news releases by the ITC, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Much of the trade data used in the report are revised throughout the year. The growth in global production chains, intrafirm trade, and trade in intermediate goods means that traditional accounting methods may distort trade data and not fully reflect the source of resources that are used in producing goods and services. This makes it increasingly difficult to understand and interpret the implications of trade data for the U.S. economy. Thus, it is important to note that the conventional trade data that may drive policy discussions, and that are used throughout this report, may underestimate trade in services, as the data are not measured on a value-added basis and do not attribute any portion of the traded value of manufactured and agricultural products to services inputs. Intermediate services embedded within a value chain as inputs include not only transportation and distribution to help move goods along, but also R&D, design and engineering, and business services.  China is a good example of this phenomenon. Since initiating economic reforms in 1979 and opening up its economy to global trade and investment, China has emerged as a major center for global supply chains. Because of China's large pool of low-cost labor, many export-oriented multinational corporations have moved production from other countries (primarily in Asia) to China. In many cases, products that are \"made in China\" are actually products that are \"assembled in China,\" using imported inputs (such as components) that are designed and produced globally. Currently, the value added that occurs in China is often quite small relative to the total value of the finished product when it is imported into the United States and elsewhere, and a significant level of the profits from the sale of the product is estimated to accrue to the multinational company that owns the brand. To illustrate, when the United States imports such products as iPhones and iPads, it attributes the full value of those imports as occurring in China, even though the value added that occurred there is quite small. Apple Inc., the U.S. firm that developed these products, is the largest beneficiary in terms of the profits generated by the sale of its products, and most of its product design, software development, product management, marketing, and other high-wage functions and employment occur in the United States. In other words, U.S. trade data may identify locations from which finished products come, but they often fail to reflect who ultimately benefits from that trade. In many instances, U.S. imports from China are really imports from many countries. Yet, the full value of the final imported product is attributed to China, which results in what one might consider to be an inflated trade deficit figure. A joint study by the OECD and the WTO estimated that the U.S trade deficit with China would have been reduced by 25% in 2009 if bilateral trade flows were measured according to the value added that occurred in each country before it was exported. Additionally, another study estimated that 24.7% of U.S. imports from Canada, and 39.8% of U.S. final merchandise imports from Mexico, consist of value added from the United States. U.S merchandise exports totaled $1.6 trillion in 2017, a 6.62% ($96.4 billion) increase from the 2016 level. The value of U.S. merchandise imports was $2.4 trillion over the same period, up 6.92% ($152.9 billion) from 2016. U.S. imports increased more than U.S. exports, leading to a $56.4 billion (7.52%) increase in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit to $807.5 billion in 2017.  In 2017, the EU was the United States' top trading partner in terms of two-way merchandise trade, followed by China, Canada, and Mexico ( Table 1 ). China's share in U.S. merchandise trade has increased dramatically over the past few decades, from 5.78% in 2000 to 16.27% in 2017 ( Table 2 ). Ranked by exports, the EU was the leading market for U.S. exports, which totaled $284.8 billion (18.33% of all U.S. exports) ( Figure 5 ). Canada was the second-largest export market ($282.9 billion worth of U.S. exports or 18.21% of all U.S. exports), followed by Mexico and China. In terms of imports, China was the leading source of U.S. imports ($506.3 billion or 21.44% of all U.S. imports), followed by the EU ($437.4 billion or 18.53% of all U.S. imports), Mexico, and Canada ( Figure 6 ). U.S. merchandise exports to all six top trading partners increased from 2016 to 2017. The largest increase in value was a $15.63 billion increase in U.S. exports to Canada, which totaled $282.9 billion in 2017, compared to $267.2 billion in 2016. It was followed by a $14.4 billion increase in exports to China, from $115.9 billion in 2016 to $130.4 billion in 2017. In percentage terms, the largest increase in U.S. exports in 2017 was to South Korea (14.65%), followed by China (12.45%). U.S. merchandise imports from all six top trading partners also increased in 2017. The largest rises in value were a $43.0 billion (9.30%) increase in imports from China, a $21.9 billion (7.73%) increase in imports from Canada, and a $19.7 billion (6.55%) increase in imports from Mexico. The United States negotiates trade-liberalizing agreements for numerous economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons. The United States has 14 free trade agreements (FTA) in force, covering 20 countries. The majority of U.S. FTA partners are small, emerging market, and developing economies. While U.S. FTAs cover some major U.S. trading partners, like Canada and Mexico, less than 39% of total U.S. merchandise trade is with FTA partners. U.S. two-way (exports plus imports) merchandise trade between the United States and its 20 FTA partners was $1.5 trillion in 2017, which accounted for 38.76% of total U.S. merchandise trade with the world. The value of U.S. exports to FTA partners totaled $720.3 billion, a 6.55% ($44.3 billion) increase from $676.0 billion in 2016. The value of U.S. exports to most FTA partners increased in 2017; the exceptions were exports to Bahrain and Israel, which declined 0.15% ($1.3 million) and 4.91% ($647 million), respectively ( Table 3 ). U.S. imports from FTA partners were valued at $796.8 billion, a 6.5% ($48.6 billion) increase from $748.2 billion in 2016. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit with all FTA partners increased 5.98% ($4.3 billion) to $76.5 billion in 2017.  U.S. trade with the two NAFTA countries (Canada and Mexico) contributed the most to overall U.S. trade with FTA partners. In 2017, these countries accounted for $1.1 trillion, or 75.09%, of total U.S. trade with FTA partners. From 2016 to 2017, the value of U.S. exports to NAFTA countries rose 5.8% ($28.8 billion) to $525.6 billion. U.S. imports from NAFTA countries rose 7.33% ($41.9 billion) to $613.6 billion in 2017. As a result, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit with its NAFTA partners increased by 17.47% ($13.1 billion) to $88.0 billion in 2017.  U.S. trade with its non-NAFTA FTA partners was valued at $378.0 billion in 2017, which represented a 6.24% ($22.2 billion) increase from 2016. U.S. exports to these FTA partners increased 8.64% ($15.5 billion), from $179.2 billion in 2016 to $194.7 billion in 2017. At the same time, U.S. imports from these trade partners increased 3.81% ($6.7 billion), from $176.5 billion in 2016 to $183.3 billion. U.S. exports increased more than imports, causing the U.S. merchandise trade surplus with its non-NAFTA FTA partners to increase 323.23% to $11.5 billion. The value of U.S. imports entering into the United States under the preferential terms of an FTA\u2014or subject to the FTA tariff scheme\u2014was $385.6 billion in 2017, a 2.83% ($10.6 billion) increase from the 2016 value of $375.0 billion ( Table 4 ). These imports accounted for nearly half (48.39%) of total imports from FTA partners in 2017 and for 16.47% of total U.S. imports from the world.  FTA imports from Chile grew 26.59% ($1.3 billion), which represented the largest percentage increase. Imports under FTAs from Peru and Bahrain increased 24.42% ($650 million) and 16.68% ($83.0 million), respectively, albeit from smaller baselines. Combined imports from the NAFTA partners (Canada and Mexico) rose 3.54% ($10.7 billion). U.S. imports under an FTA declined the most from Oman (down 13.81% or 113.0 million), followed by Colombia (down 7.01% or 377.0 million) and South Korea (down 5.62% or 2.0 billion). Jordan was the U.S. FTA partner with the highest ratio of imports entering under an FTA to total imports, at 88.10%. Other countries with notably high ratios include Oman (65.78%), Bahrain (58.43%), and Chile (56.41%). CAFTA-DR countries as a whole also had a high ratio, at 57.57%. The partners with the smallest shares of imports entered under an FTA are Singapore (9.36%), Israel (12.34%), and Panama (12.71%). The United States has four preference programs designed to encourage economic growth in developing countries. They offer access to the U.S. market in the form of preferential duty reduction or duty elimination for eligible imports. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is the broadest program covering most developing countries. Additional programs for specific regions include the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI)/Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Agreement (CBTPA), and the Nepal Trade Preference Program (NTPP). Individual countries may be covered by more than one program. In such countries, importers of eligible goods may choose among programs when purchasing these goods from beneficiary countries. In addition, the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 (HOPE Act), the HOPE II Act of 2008 (HOPE II Act), and the Haitian Economic Lift Program Act of 2010 (HELP Act) further expanded CBI benefits for Haiti, providing preferential treatment for its textile and apparel products. The value of U.S. imports entering under trade preference programs with developing countries increased 18.43%, from $29.3 billion in 2016 to $34.71 billion in 2017. Over the same period, total U.S. merchandise imports from the world increased 6.92%. The increase was largely due to a 32.39% increase ($3.1 billion) in the value of U.S. imports under AGOA (not including GSP) and an 11.93% ($2.3 billion) increase in imports under GSP ( Table 5 ). Imports from CBI/CBTPA also increased in 2017 ($90.0 billion or 10.33%). Overall, U.S. imports benefiting from duty-free access through U.S. preference programs accounted for 1.47% of total U.S. imports during 2017, up from 1.33% in 2016. Each program's respective share of total U.S. imports under preference programs in 2017 was as follows:  GSP, 61.10% ($21.2 billion); AGOA, 36.11% ($12.5 billion); CBI/CBTPA, 2.88% ($1.0 billion); Haiti initiatives, 1.66% ($0.6 billion); and Nepal Trade Preference Program, 0.01% ($0.002 billion). The United States remains highly competitive in the global services market. As the world's top exporter of services, the United States accounted for $780.9 billion, or 14.55%, of world services exports in 2017. Other top world exporters included the UK ($360.6 billion or 6.72% total world services exports), Germany ($308.7 billion or 5.75%), France ($265.7 billion or 4.95%), and China ($206.5 billion or 3.85%) ( Table 6 ). Most of the world's top 10 services exporters in 2017 were developed countries. However, China (currently the fifth-largest services exporter) and India (currently the seventh-largest services exporter) have been among the top 10 since the mid-2000s. Overall, the top 10 exporting countries together accounted for 52.14% of world services exports in 2017.  The United States also remains the world's largest importer of services ($538.1 billion or 10.57% of total world services imports), followed by China ($71.9 billion or 9.27%), Germany ($327.1 billion or 6.42%), France ($244.7 or 4.81%), and the UK ($222.6 billion or 4.37%). The top 10 importer countries together accounted for 52.04% of world services imports in 2017. U.S. two-way (exports and imports) trade in services increased 5.63% between 2016 and 2017. During that period, U.S. exports of services increased 5.11% ($38 billion), from $758.9 billion to $797.7 billion, while U.S. services imports grew 6.40% ($32.6 billion), from $509.8 billion to $542.5 billion. The U.S. surplus in services trade increased 2.45% ($6.1 billion) to $255.2 billion. U.S. exports in all nine services export categories grew in 2017. The services export categories with the highest growth rates in 2017 included financial services (10.32%), telecommunications, computers, and information services (9.52%), and insurance services (5.74%). U.S. imports of services grew in all but one of the services import categories (maintenance and repair services). In 2017, the EU\u2014as a single entity\u2014was the United States' top trading partner in terms of two-way (exports plus imports) trade in services, while the largest single-country trading partners were the UK, Canada, Japan, China, and Germany ( Table 7 ). Since 2000, the share of U.S. services trade with partners like the UK, Canada, and Japan has decreased, while that of China and India, for example, has grown dramatically ( Table 8 ). The EU was the largest export market for U.S. services in 2017, as well as the largest foreign supplier of U.S. services imports. The EU accounted for $243.4 billion (30.51%) of total U.S. services exports and for $192.0 billion (35.39%) of total U.S. services imports ( Figure 7 and Figure 8 ). After the EU, the top markets for U.S. services exports were the UK, Canada, China, and Japan, while the top sources of U.S. services imports were the UK, Germany, Japan, and Canada. In 2017, the United States maintained a services trade surplus with every major services trading partner except Hong Kong ($4.4 billion deficit), India ($3.1 billion deficit), and France ($2.7 billion deficit).  U.S. services exports to nearly all leading trading partners increased from 2016 to 2017. Exports declined to Taiwan (down $1.8 billion or 15.18%), France (down $552 million or 2.79%), and Saudi Arabia (down $155.0 billion or 1.66%). The largest increase in value was a $4.1 billion increase in U.S. services exports to Canada, followed by a $3.1 billion increase to India and a $2.8 billion increase to the UK. In percentage terms, the largest increases in U.S. services exports between 2016 and 2017 were to Hong Kong (19.15%), India (15.19%), South Korea (11.24%), and Brazil (10.57%). U.S. services imports from all but two of the major trading partners increased in 2017. Imports from both Brazil and South Korea fell last year, down 6.90% ($534 million) and 0.18% ($20 million), respectively. The largest increases in value were a $4.6 billion increase in U.S. services imports from the UK (up 8.77%), a $2.4 billion increase in imports from Canada (up 7.98%), and a $2.3 billion increase in imports from India (up 8.98%). In percentage terms, the largest increase in U.S. services imports between 2016 and 2017 was from Hong Kong (up 10.11%), followed by Singapore (up 9.31%) and Italy (up 9.22%). In 2017, exports of goods and services totaled $2.4 trillion and imports totaled $2.9 trillion, resulting in a deficit of $552.3 billion, up slightly from 2016, but down from the all-time high level registered in 2006 ($761.7 billion) ( Table 9 ). The deficit on goods increased to $807.5 billion in 2017, from $751.1 billion in 2016, though it remained well below the annual record deficit of $837.3 billion registered in 2006. In 2017, the EU was the United States' largest market for U.S. goods and services exports, accounting for $528.2 billion (22.47% of total U.S. exports, down from 24.97% in 2000), as well as the leading source of U.S. imports, which totaled $629.4 billion (21.68% of total U.S. imports, largely unchanged from the share in 2000). Canada was the second-largest U.S. export market, with $341.3 billion worth of U.S. exports (14.52% of total U.S. exports, down from 18.96% in 2000), and the fourth-largest source of U.S. imports, which totaled $338.5 billion (11.6%, down from 17.39% in 2000). The share of China in U.S. trade has increased dramatically over the past few decades. In 2000, it accounted for 2.00% of total U.S. exports and 7.14% of total U.S. imports. Last year, China's share had risen to 8.00% of total U.S. exports and 18.04% of U.S. imports. Figure 9 and Table 10 present data on bilateral U.S. trade balances on goods and services. The EU\u2014comprised of 28 member states\u2014was the United States' largest two-way (exports plus imports) trading partner for both goods and services. The value of U.S. merchandise trade with the EU increased 4.66% ($32.2 billion), from $690.1 billion in 2016 to $722.2 billion in 2017. However, the EU share of U.S. trade declined slightly, from 18.83% in 2016 to 18.45% in 2017. The U.S. trade deficit with the EU rose 3.01% ($4.5 billion), from $148.1 billion in 2016 to $152.6 billion in 2017. It remains lower than the trade deficit registered in 2015 ($157.4 billion). The EU was the largest market for U.S. merchandise exports both in 2016 and 2017, accounting for 18.53% of total U.S. exports in 2017 ( Figure 10 ). U.S. exports to the EU increased 5.11% ($13.9 billion), from $271.0 billion in 2016 to $284.8 billion in 2017. Leading U.S. exports to the EU included civilian aircraft, engines, and parts (13.02% of all U.S. exports to the EU), medicaments (3.14%), petroleum and petroleum products (not including crude) (2.37%), and immunological products (1.84%). In terms of imports, the EU was the second-largest source of U.S. merchandise imports in 2017, after China. The EU accounted for 18.53% of total U.S. imports in 2017. U.S. imports from the EU increased 4.37% ($18.3 billion), from $419.1 billion in 2016 to $437.4 billion in 2017. Leading U.S. imports were passenger motor vehicles (9.20% of all U.S. imports from the EU), medicaments (5.87%), parts of turbojets or turbo-propellers (1.84%), light oils (1.84%), and airplanes and other aircraft (1.47%). The value of U.S. two-way (exports plus imports) services trade with the 28 member states of the EU increased 5.06% ($21.0 billion), from $414.4 billion in 2016 to $435.4 billion in 2017. However, the EU share of U.S. services trade declined slightly, from 32.66% in 2016 to 32.49% in 2017, as total U.S. trade with other trading partners increased by more than U.S. trade with the EU. The U.S. services trade surplus with the EU declined 8.28% ($4.6 billion), from $56.1 billion in 2016 to $51.4 billion in 2017, lower than the U.S. trade surplus registered with the EU in 2014 ($52.3 billion) and 2015 ($54.9 billion). The EU was the largest market for U.S. service exports in 2017, accounting for 30.51% of total U.S. services exports ( Figure 11 ). U.S. services exports to the EU increased 3.47% ($8.2 billion), from $235.2 billion in 2016 to $243.4 billion in 2017. In terms of imports, the EU was the largest source of U.S. services imports. It accounted for 35.39% of total U.S. services imports in 2017. U.S. services imports from the EU increased 7.15% ($12.8 billion), from $179.2 billion in 2016 to $192.0 billion in 2017. The UK was the EU's largest services trader with the United States, followed by Germany, France, and Italy. U.S. total exports (goods and services) to the EU increased $22.0 billion (4.35%) to $528.2 billion, while U.S. total imports from the EU increased $31.1 billion (5.20%) to $629.4 billion ( Table 11 ). Overall, the U.S. trade deficit with the EU rose 9.87% ($9.1 billion) to $101.2 billion. In 2017, China was the United States' largest, single-country trading partner based on two-way (exports plus imports) merchandise trade, accounting for 16.27% of total U.S. merchandise trade, up from 15.80% in 2016. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with China amounted to $636.7 billion in 2017, an increase of 9.93% over the $579.2 billion recorded in 2016. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit with China of $375.9 billion remained higher than the U.S. trade deficit registered with any other trading partner in 2017. The deficit's $28.6 billion increase from 2016 was due to a $43.1 billion increase in U.S. merchandise imports from China in 2017 that outpaced a $14.4 billion increase in U.S. merchandise exports to China. China was the third-largest single-country destination for U.S. merchandise exports in 2017, behind Canada and Mexico.
