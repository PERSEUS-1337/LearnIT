DEFINITION.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the term ``biofuel engineering'' means the discipline \n        concerned with utilization of harvested living plant material \n        to produce fuels; and\n            (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Energy.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY AND DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS.\n\n    The Secretary shall make a grant to an appropriate standard-setting \nor other entity to conduct a study of, and develop appropriate \nstandards for, accreditation of undergraduate and graduate biofuel \nengineering programs at institutions of higher education, and to study \nand the needs of the biofuel industry for engineering support. Such \nstudy shall include--\n            (1) a determination of subspecialty requirements for \n        engineers who will concentrate on creating other products in \n        addition to fuel, including animal feed and other consumer \n        products;\n            (2) consideration of the interaction of biological \n        feedstock with the structural material in the production and \n        distribution systems, the carbon footprint of the production \n        and distribution of biofuels, and related genetic challenges; \n        and\n            (3) supplemental courses of study that could be used by \n        experienced engineers for transition into the new biofuel \n        engineering discipline.\n\nSEC. 4.
