(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the College Construction Loan Insurance Association \n        (hereinafter referred to as ``the Corporation'') was \n        established by the Higher Education Amendments of 1986 (Public \n        Law 99-498) in order to assist in financing the construction, \n        reconstruction, renovation, acquisition, or purchase of \n        postsecondary education facilities;\n            (2) in order to attract initial investors and establish the \n        Corporation as a viable corporate entity, the Secretary of \n        Education was required by statute to purchase a minority equity \n        interest in the Corporation;\n            (3) it was the intent of Congress, in establishing the \n        Corporation, that the Federal Government's ownership interest \n        in the Corporation would eventually terminate through the sale \n        of the stock of the Corporation owned by the Secretary of \n        Education;\n            (4) current statutory restrictions on the Corporation's \n        business activities and organization impede the Corporation's \n        efforts to operate effectively and to provide the services \n        needed by educational institutions; and\n            (5) eliminating all statutory restrictions on the \n        Corporation's business activities, as well as other links \n        between the Federal Government and the Corporation, would--\n                    (A) eliminate a Federal presence where the \n                operation of market forces would be more suitable and \n                contribute toward reducing the scope of Government;\n                    (B) improve the ability of the Corporation to \n                provide assistance in the financing of education \n                facilities; and\n                    (C) return funds to the United States Treasury.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) terminate, in an orderly manner, the Corporation's \n        financial and other connections to the United States \n        Government; and\n            (2) enable the Corporation to engage in any business or \n        other activities for which corporations may be organized under \n        the laws of any State of the United States or the District of \n        Columbia.\n\n    status of the corporation and corporate powers; obligations not \n                          federally guaranteed\n\n    Sec. 3.
