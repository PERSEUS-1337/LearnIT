SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Tax Lien \nSimplification Act''.\n    (b) Amendment of 1986 Code.--Except as otherwise expressly \nprovided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in \nterms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, \nthe reference shall be considered to be made to a section or other \nprovision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The present decentralized system for filing Federal tax \n        liens in local property offices, which was established before \n        the advent of modern computers, the Internet, and e-government \n        programs, is inefficient, burdensome, and expensive.\n            (2) Current technology permits the creation of a \n        centralized Federal tax lien filing system which can provide \n        for enhanced public notice of and access to accurate tax lien \n        information in a manner that is more efficient, more timely, \n        and less burdensome than the existing tax lien filing system; \n        which would expedite the release of liens; and which would be \n        less expensive for both taxpayers and users.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to simplify and modernize \nthe process for filing notices of Federal tax liens, to improve public \naccess to tax lien information, and to save taxpayer dollars by \nestablishing a nationwide, Internet accessible, and fully searchable \nfiling system for Federal tax liens which would replace the current \nsystem of local tax lien filings.\n\nSEC. 3.
