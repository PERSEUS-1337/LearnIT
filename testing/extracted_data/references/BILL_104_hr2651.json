FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Expanded markets.--One of the purposes of the NAFTA, as \n        stated in the preamble, is to ``create an expanded and secure \n        market'' for goods and services. Instead, the NAFTA has \n        resulted in a spiraling trade deficit with Mexico and Canada \n        that will exceed $30,000,000,000 in 1995. Rather than \n        harmonious development and expansion as envisioned, the NAFTA \n        has resulted in trade deficits which are draining \n        $2,500,000,000 a month from the United States economy.\n            (2) Currency stability.--One of the purposes of the NAFTA \n        is to ``ensure a predictable commercial framework for business \n        planning and investment''. However, the NAFTA contains no \n        safeguards to minimize the negative economic impacts of severe \n        shifts in currency exchange rates among the NAFTA Parties. To \n        protect its own economy the United States has sought to bolster \n        the Mexican peso which is now being supported by \n        $30,000,000,000 in loans, mostly from unwilling United States \n        taxpayers. The devaluation of the Mexican peso has more than \n        offset tariff reductions and other trade benefits the United \n        States expected to achieve from the agreement.\n            (3) Fair agricultural trade.--One of the purposes of the \n        NAFTA is to reduce distortions to trade. In addition, the NAFTA \n        is supposed to promote conditions of fair competition and to \n        establish mutually advantageous rules governing trade. However, \n        since the NAFTA, there has been a rapid escalation of one-way \n        trade of Canadian grain exports of wheat, durum wheat, and \n        barley to the United States, disrupting markets and marketing \n        channels. Surges in the importation of certain Mexican fruits \n        and vegetables threaten domestic production and the importation \n        of livestock and meat products from the NAFTA Parties has \n        exacerbated the severe problems facing United States livestock \n        producers.\n            (4) Jobs, wages, and living standards.--One of the purposes \n        of the NAFTA is to ``create new employment opportunities and \n        improve working conditions and living standards'' in the \n        respective territories of the NAFTA Parties. Instead, there has \n        been a substantial loss of over 300,000 high-paying jobs in the \n        United States. A survey of United States companies conducted 20 \n        months after the implementation of the NAFTA found that 90 \n        percent of the companies that had anticipated an increased \n        number of jobs from the NAFTA have, in fact, not increased \n        employment since the NAFTA was implemented. In the first year \n        of the NAFTA's implementation, United States workers had the \n        sharpest drop of real hourly wages on record. More than \n        2,000,000 workers have become unemployed in Mexico since the \n        implementation of the NAFTA and real wages of Mexican workers \n        have been slashed 50 percent. In addition to the loss of \n        purchasing power, there has been an erosion in the standards of \n        living in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n            (5) Manufacturing base.--One of the purposes of the NAFTA \n        is to enhance the competitiveness of firms in the global \n        market. However, rather than increase the ability of the \n        manufacturing sector in the United States to compete in the \n        world market, the NAFTA has facilitated the movement of United \n        States manufacturing facilities and jobs to Mexico. The NAFTA \n        has contributed to a net loss of 227,000 manufacturing jobs in \n        the United States during the last 7 months and an unprecedented \n        flood of imports of manufactured goods into the United States.\n            (6) Health and environment.--Other purposes of the NAFTA \n        are ``to safeguard the public welfare'' and ``to strengthen the \n        development and enforcement of environmental laws and \n        regulations''. Yet, since the implementation of the NAFTA, the \n        public welfare has been undermined by increased imports of food \n        products that do not meet United States health standards. In \n        addition, the NAFTA has accelerated the relocation of United \n        States manufacturing facilities to the United States-Mexico \n        border zone, where hundreds of new manufacturing plants have \n        been added. Without adequate environmental safeguards, the \n        uncontrolled industrial and population growth in the border \n        zone has aggravated pollution and health hazards, increasing \n        the incidence of infectious diseases and human exposure to \n        toxins.\n            (7) Illegal drugs.--Rather than safeguarding the public \n        welfare, the NAFTA has allowed the increased flow of illegal \n        drugs and controlled substances into the United States from \n        Mexico. More than half of all cocaine and marijuana illegally \n        entering the United States now comes through Mexico, with an \n        increasing portion carried by trucks which undergo more limited \n        inspection under the NAFTA.\n            (8) Protect rights.--The promotion of sustainable \n        development as well as the protection and enhancement of basic \n        rights are stated objectives of the NAFTA. As envisioned, the \n        NAFTA is to increase economic opportunity together with \n        expansion of political freedoms and human rights. Yet these \n        objectives are not being fulfilled, especially in Mexico, where \n        some citizens continue to experience infringements of such \n        rights and freedoms.\n            (9) NAFTA should not be expanded.--The Congress approved \n        the NAFTA in order to achieve economic, social, and \n        environmental benefits for the people of the United States. \n        Based on currently available information, the goals and \n        objectives of the NAFTA are not being achieved. Therefore, the \n        NAFTA should not be expanded to include any other country.\n            (10) NAFTA to be renegotiated and benefits certified.--\n        Based on the experience with the NAFTA since its \n        implementation, it has become evident that further negotiation \n        is required to resolve fundamental inadequacies within the \n        NAFTA with respect to trade balances, currency differentials, \n        and agricultural provisions. If the NAFTA is to continue, \n        responsible public officials must be able to certify specific \n        measures of economic, social, and environmental progress. \n        Otherwise Congress has no choice but to withdraw its approval \n        of the NAFTA.\n\nSEC. 3.

The \n        President is further authorized and directed to renegotiate the \n        NAFTA to establish and strengthen provisions to prevent imports \n        of agricultural commodities from any NAFTA Party from unfairly \n        displacing United States production and to provide improved \n        mechanisms for relief for United States producers that are \n        adversely impacted by such imports.\n            (4) Certification of gains in united states jobs and living \n        standards.--If the Secretary of Labor, after consultation with \n        appropriate government agencies and citizen organizations, \n        determines that--\n                    (A) the number of jobs resulting from increased \n                exports of United States manufactured goods to other \n                NAFTA Parties exceeds the number of jobs lost because \n                of imports of manufactured goods from other NAFTA \n                Parties since January 1, 1994, and\n                    (B) the purchasing power of wage-earners in the \n                United States has increased since January 1, 1994,\n        the Secretary shall so certify to the Congress.\n            (5) Certification of increased domestic manufacturing.--If \n        the Secretary of Commerce, after consultation with the \n        appropriate government agencies and citizen organizations, \n        determines that the export of United States manufactured goods \n        to the NAFTA Parties exceeds the imports of manufactured goods \n        from NAFTA Parties, the Secretary shall so certify to the \n        Congress. In making the determination, the Secretary shall not \n        include any goods originating outside the United States that \n        are exported to another NAFTA Party, nor imports from another \n        NAFTA Party that are destined for other countries.\n            (6) Certification relating to health and environmental \n        standards.--\n                    (A) In general.--If the Secretary of Agriculture \n                and the Administrator of the Food and Drug \n                Administration, after consultation with appropriate \n                government agencies and citizen organizations, \n                determine, with respect to imports from NAFTA Parties, \n                that since January 1, 1994, there has been a reduced \n                incidence of contaminated and adulterated food, food \n                containing additives or pesticide residues exceeding \n                United States standards, or food containing additives \n                or pesticide residues which cannot be legally used in \n                the United States, the Secretary and Administrator \n                shall so certify to the Congress. In making this \n                determination, all foods and food products, including \n                fruits, vegetables, grains, oilseeds, and meats, both \n                fresh and processed, shall be reviewed.

The report shall include--\n                            (i) a description and status report of all \n                        industrial site cleanup and environmental \n                        improvement projects begun in the border zone \n                        since January 1, 1994;\n                            (ii) information available from local, \n                        State, and Federal health agencies reflecting \n                        the incidence since January 1, 1990, in and \n                        around the border zone of hepatitis, neural \n                        stem birth defects, lupus, chronic adolescent \n                        diarrhea, tuberculosis, nonneural birth \n                        defects, cholera, botulism, and other disorders \n                        commonly related to industrial pollution, \n                        inadequate infrastructures, and hazardous \n                        waste; and\n                            (iii) information on the incidence of air \n                        and water pollution since January 1, 1990, and \n                        the causes, levels, and types of pollution \n                        which have occurred.\n            (7) Certification relating to illegal drugs.--If the \n        Attorney General of the United States determines, after a \n        review by the Drug Enforcement Administration and consultation \n        with appropriate government agencies and citizen organizations, \n        that increased imports from the NAFTA Parties are not resulting \n        in an increase in illegal drugs or other controlled substances \n        from Mexico or Canada, the Attorney General shall so certify to \n        the Congress. The Attorney General through the Drug Enforcement \n        Administration shall conduct a thorough review and report to \n        the Congress regarding the flow of illegal drugs from Mexico \n        and Canada and the relationship of such flow to trade of other \n        commodities and services with the NAFTA Parties.\n            (8) Certification relating to democracy and human \n        freedoms.--If the President, after consultation with \n        appropriate government agencies, international organizations, \n        and citizen organizations, determines that the Government of \n        Mexico--\n                    (A) is elected in free and fair elections,\n                    (B) protects the rights of its citizens to organize \n                into political parties,\n                    (C) protects the rights of its citizens to free \n                speech and the right of the news media to operate \n                without fear of government control or reprisal, and\n                    (D) protects the rights of its citizens to assemble \n                and to organize associations to advance human rights \n                and economic opportunities,\n        the President shall so certify to the Congress.\n\nSEC. 4. CONSULTATION WITH CONGRESS.\n\n    The President shall consult regularly with the Congress regarding \nthe negotiations described in section 3(b) (1), (2), and (3). The \nUnited States Trade Representative shall consult with the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress in the development of any technical and \nconforming amendments that may be required to carry out the provisions \nof this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. NO EXPANSION OF NAFTA.\n\n    Until such time as the conditions described in section 3(b) are \nmet, it is the sense of the Congress that the President should not \nengage in negotiations to expand the NAFTA to include other countries \nand that fast-track authority should not be renewed with respect to the \napproval of any such expansion of the NAFTA.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) NAFTA.--The term ``NAFTA'' means the North American \n        Free Trade Agreement entered into between the United States, \n        Canada, and Mexico on December 17, 1992.\n            (2) NAFTA party.--The term ``NAFTA Party'' means the United \n        States, Canada, or Mexico.\n            (3) United States-Mexico border zone.--The term ``United \n        States-Mexico border zone'' means the area that comprises the \n        12-mile zone on the Mexican side of the United States-Mexico \n        border and the counties within any State of the United States \n        that are contiguous with Mexico."
