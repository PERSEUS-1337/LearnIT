FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Air medical critical care transport is an essential \n        component of the healthcare system.\n            (2) The presence of air medical services in rural areas \n        provides tens of millions of rural Americans with access to \n        critical care within an hour of injury.\n            (3) As an emergency responder, air medical providers must \n        maintain readiness 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.\n            (4) Air medical providers transport all emergent patients \n        for which they are dispatched regardless of insurance status or \n        ability to pay.\n            (5) The air ambulance fee schedule under the Medicare \n        program was first implemented in 2002 and developed through \n        negotiated rulemaking, which required the new fee schedule to \n        be created in a budget neutral manner. As such, the Medicare \n        air ambulance fee schedule has never reflected true costs.\n            (6) Since the implementation of the air ambulance fee \n        schedule under the Medicare program, reimbursements have only \n        been adjusted by inflationary updates averaging 2.2 percent a \n        year.\n            (7) Operational readiness and safety enhancement costs have \n        grown at a far faster rate than the Medicare inflationary \n        updates, creating a fundamental imbalance within the air \n        ambulance fee schedule.\n            (8) It is imperative that balance be restored to the air \n        ambulance fee schedule to preserve access to timely care for \n        tens of millions of Americans.\n\nSEC. 2.
