FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The inappropriate sale or purchase of social security \n        numbers is a significant factor in a growing range of illegal \n        activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in some \n        cases, stalking and other violent crimes.\n            (2) While financial institutions, health care providers, \n        and other entities have often used social security numbers to \n        confirm the identity of an individual, the sale or purchase of \n        these numbers often facilitates the commission of criminal \n        activities, and also can result in serious invasions of \n        individual privacy.\n            (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n        individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a social \n        security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for social \n        security benefits, or to seek employment. An unintended \n        consequence of these requirements is that social security \n        numbers have become tools that can be used to facilitate crime, \n        fraud, and invasions of the privacy of the individuals to whom \n        the numbers are assigned. Because the Federal Government \n        created and maintains this system, and because the Federal \n        Government does not permit individuals to exempt themselves \n        from those requirements, it is appropriate for the Federal \n        Government to take steps to stem the abuse of this system.\n            (4) A social security number is simply a sequence of \n        numbers. In no meaningful sense can the number itself impart \n        knowledge or ideas. Persons do not sell or transfer such \n        numbers in order to convey any particularized message, nor to \n        express to the purchaser any ideas, knowledge, or thoughts.\n            (5) A social security number does not contain, reflect, or \n        convey any publicly significant information or concern any \n        public issue. The sale of such numbers in no way facilitates \n        uninhibited, robust, and wide-open public debate, and \n        restrictions on such sale would not affect public debate.\n            (6) No one should seek to profit from the sale of social \n        security numbers in circumstances that create a substantial \n        risk of physical, emotional, or financial harm to the \n        individuals to whom those numbers are assigned.\n            (7) Consequently, Congress should enact legislation that \n        will offer individuals assigned such numbers necessary \n        protection from the sale and purchase of social security \n        numbers in circumstances that might facilitate unlawful conduct \n        or that might otherwise likely result in unfair and deceptive \n        practices.\n\nSEC. 3.
