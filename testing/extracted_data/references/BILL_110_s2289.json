FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n            (1) Consent decrees are for remedying violations of \n        requirements of Federal law, and they should not be used to \n        advance any policy extraneous to that purpose.\n            (2) Consent decrees are also for protecting the party or \n        class facing injury and should not be expanded to apply to \n        parties not involved in the litigation.\n            (3) In structuring consent decrees, courts should take into \n        account the interests of State and local governments in \n        managing their own affairs.\n            (4) Consent decrees should be structured and administered \n        to give due deference to the policy judgments of State and \n        local officials, and their successors, as to how to obey the \n        law.\n            (5) Whenever possible, courts should not impose consent \n        decrees that require technically complex and evolving policy \n        choices, especially in the absence of judicially discoverable \n        and manageable standards.\n            (6) Consent decrees should not be unlimited, but should \n        contain an explicit and realistic strategy for ending court \n        supervision.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON CONSENT DECREES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 1660.
