    "content": "South Korea is the seventh largest U.S. export partner, receiving nearly $39 billion in U.S. goods exports, or about 3% of all such U.S. exports of almost $1.3 trillion in 2010. Individual state shares of these exports varied from 21% (California) to 0.03% (South and North Dakota). When services exports are added, total combined U.S. exports to South Korea in 2010 totaled about $55 billion ( Table 1 ).  In contrast, the United States imported nearly $60 billion in goods and services from South Korea in 2010. Goods accounted for $49 billion, or about 2.6% of total U.S. goods imports of $1.9 trillion. As a consequence, the United States experienced a merchandise trade deficit with South Korea in 2010 of $10 billion, or about 1.5% of the total U.S. merchandise trade deficit. Despite being the seventh largest U.S. trade partner, export opportunities for the United States are limited because of the size of the South Korean market, which consists of some 50 million consumers.  Table 2 and Table 3 list key U.S. exports to and imports from South Korea, respectively. The products in the tables represent 88% of all U.S. exports to and imports from South Korea. Table 2 indicates that U.S. exports to South Korea are varied, with the top five such U.S. exports accounting for about 50% of all U.S. exports to South Korea. These categories are: machinery (e.g., for manufacturing semiconductor devices), electrical machinery (especially integrated circuits and semiconductor devices), medical instruments, civilian aircraft engines and parts, and organic chemicals. (For more export and import detail, see Table B -1 .)  Table 3 shows that U.S. imports from South Korea are narrowly focused and more concentrated than are U.S. exports. Nearly 70% of all import categories are concentrated in three broad sectors. These are: electrical machinery (especially telephone sets and other apparatus for voice/image/data transmission), non-electrical machinery (especially parts and accessories for office machines, refrigerators and freezers, and washing machines), and motor vehicles (primarily passenger cars, parts, and accessories). (For more detail, see Table B -2 .) According to studies conducted by the USITC, U.S. exports of goods to South Korea under the KORUS FTA could increase by more than imports from South Korea, in both percentage and value terms, slightly reducing, but not eliminating the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea. With this slight reduction in the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, however, the overall U.S. trade deficit with the world would change almost imperceptibly. The USITC projects that, compared with a no KORUS FTA scenario, total U.S. merchandise exports to South Korea as a result of the FTA would grow over the 10-year implementation period, by about 24% an average of about 2% per year, and merchandise imports would grow by about 10%, or an average of about 1% per year, as indicated in Figure 1 . For most products, major increases in exports could occur in the latter part of the phase-in period. The study cautions, however, that without a full quantitative analysis of services trade and international investment patterns, simulation results of the USITC study in general should not be interpreted as changes in total imports and exports, or as implying meaningful information about the balance of trade impact of the entire U.S.-Korea FTA.  U.S. imports in some sectors could rise more than normally expected as a consequence of the KORUS FTA. According to the USITC, such imports as textiles, apparel, leather products, petroleum and coal products, metal products, and motor vehicles and parts could increase over the full implementation period of the agreement. The USITC used an economic model known as the Global Trade Atlas Project (GTAP), located at Purdue University to estimate quantitative changes in trade (exports and imports) for 40 sectors. These estimations are based on KORUS FTA changes in tariff rates and tariff rate quotas at the end of the phase-in period of the agreement. The results are reported as a range of high and low proportional effects (percentage increases or decreases in trade) and high and low potential changes in trade values for various sectors, relative to trade flows that would have occurred in 2008 if there were no FTA with South Korea. Table 4 lists these in three groups: (1) sectors for which increases in U.S. exports to South Korea are expected to exceed increases in U.S. imports from South Korea; (2) industries for which U.S. exports and imports are not expected to increase; and (3) sectors for which U.S. imports from South Korea are expected to exceed U.S. exports to South Korea.  Note that macroeconomic changes, such as changes in investment patterns, shifts in the relative values of foreign currencies, and changes in types of goods traded can overwhelm the impact on trade of changes in tariffs, such as would occur under the KORUS FTA. At the state level, tables are included for each state in Appendix A . Each state table lists: (1) the top-10 state exports to South Korea at the two-digit harmonized tariff schedule (HTS) level; (2) their dollar value for 2010; and (3) the state's share of total exports to South Korea that the sector's exports represent. These listings may be compared with the USITC-projected direction of trade estimated to result from the KORUS FTA upon full implementation for that highly-aggregated sector at the national level . At a disaggregated level, the composition of trade for any given state may differ considerably from that at the national level. However, because the GTAP model uses only highly-aggregated sectors, the extent of that difference cannot be determined. Exports in the state tables are reported at the two-digit level to correspond with similar categories in the GTAP model. The export data for the various states are from the Census Bureau's series showing the Origin of Movement (OM) of state-level exports, by foreign destination. The Census Bureau's OM Data Series is compiled from the Electronic Export Information (EEI) filed by exporters or their agents. The data represent a shipment of one or more kinds of merchandise from one exporter to one foreign importer on a single carrier. The state identified in the data is that from which the merchandise starts its journey. It represents the origin of transportation , not the origin of production of the exports. According to the Census Bureau, there are a number of known limitations to the data. In particular, whenever shipments represent a consolidation of goods, such as through warehouses, the state with the warehouse will be credited with the exports, rather than the state of origin of the exports. This caveat is particularly relevant to agricultural products shipped from inland states down the Mississippi River for export from the port of New Orleans. In this case, New Orleans would be credited as the state of origin of the exports. In addition, when goods are stored and then exported by central offices or intermediaries, export data would understate exports from the original production state and overstate exports from the office or consolidation point.  Generally speaking, OM data tend to overestimate exports from port states such as California and New York, and underestimate exports from such interior states as Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota. For more details, see Appendix C .  Table 5 lists state exports to South Korea based on available OM data. It also includes: (1)\u00a0information on state shares of all U.S. exports to South Korea, and (2) state exports to South Korea as a share of total state exports to the world. CRS did not attempt to rank the states by the OM data because of limitations explained above\u2014namely that the data tend to overestimate or underestimate exports for various states.

Detailed U.S.-South Korea Trade Data Appendix C. Trade Models and Data Issues Trade Models Trade models of the type used in the analysis of the KORUS FTA are part of a class of economic models referred to as computable general equilibrium models (CGE) that incorporate data on trade and a range of domestic economic variables on nearly 100 countries. As a result of this large number of countries, and the vast amounts of data that are used, the models can provide important insights into the mechanisms by which changes in tariffs or other parameters can affect a range of countries. For practical reasons, however, the data in the models must be limited, so the models necessarily must sacrifice some level of precision in their estimating abilities. Since such trade models originally were developed with the intent of analyzing the economic effects of such multi-country trade agreements as the Uruguay Round, this lack of precision was not considered to be an important drawback. However, this lack of precision may be an issue when the models are used to estimate the effects of bilateral trade agreements, especially at the state level, where the overall amount of trade and, therefore, the impact of the agreement, is expected to be less than that of a comprehensive multilateral agreement. In addition, such models do not account for changes in exchange rates, since such effects were considered to be neutral in a large multi-country trade agreement. Movements in exchange rates, however, could have an important impact on trade patterns that involve countries that are parties to a bilateral trade agreement. In addition, estimates derived from trade models represent a static analysis that does not represent the dynamic effects that likely arise from trade agreements. In particular, the estimates are based on the assumption that all other economic factors would remain constant during the time leading to full implementation. The estimates also are based on the assumption that the composition of trade between the United States and South Korea at the time the estimates were made, in this case 2001 data projected to 2008, would also remain constant. Considering the dynamic nature of both economies, however, these assumptions appear to be unrealistic and may limit the usefulness of the final results of the trade model. If the U.S. and South Korean economies continue to change over the next decade at the rate experienced during the past decade, both economies and the composition of trade between them likely will differ appreciably from what can be projected from current data. In order to mitigate some of the limitations of the trade model, USITC industry analysts refined the estimates\u2014that is, they prepared a qualitative assessment, of the potential impact of the agreement at the industry level. These estimates provide an analysis of the immediate impact of the agreement and of the phased elimination of tariffs and tariff rate quotas on 40 broadly-defined industrial sectors and on a group of 20 narrowly defined industrial sectors and their sub-sectors. Both of these groups of industries are used in this report to provide estimates of the impact of the KORUS FTA on state-level industries.  State Export Data Issues  As mentioned, this report uses Census Bureau data on the origin of movement of commodities by state to estimate exports to South Korea as a result of the KORUS FTA. The Census Bureau's Origin of Movement (OM) Data Series is compiled from the Electronic Export Information (EEI) filed by exporters or their agents. The OM data series tracks exports from the zip code where their documented transportation begins, not the origin of production, to the country of their foreign destination. The data represent a shipment of one or more kinds of merchandise from one exporter to one foreign importer on a single carrier. The state identified in the data is that from which the final merchandise starts its journey. According to the Census Bureau, there are a number of known limitations to the data. In particular, whenever shipments represent a consolidation of goods, such as through warehouses, the state with the warehouse will be credited with the exports, rather than the state of origin of the exports. This caveat is particularly relevant to agricultural products shipped from inland states down the Mississippi River for export from the port of New Orleans. In this case, New Orleans would be credited as the state of origin of the exports. In addition, when goods are stored and then exported by central offices or intermediaries, export data would understate exports from the original production state and overstate exports from the office or consolidation point. Generally speaking, the origin of movement (OM) data tend to overestimate exports from port states such as California and New York and underestimate exports from such interior states as Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota. This miscounting is particularly prevalent when products are either consolidated or stored by central offices or intermediaries before entering official export channels. In such a case, the state-level export data do not provide a precise picture of the product composition of exports from each state to the world or to individual countries such as South Korea. Despite this limitation, these data provide the best available indication of what is produced and exported from each state.  The issue of underestimation or overestimation is less of a problem among manufactured goods than among agricultural products. For manufactured products, the origin of movement and the origin of production often coincide. Typically, manufacturers ship their exports to a foreign destination directly from the factory gate or from a nearby distribution facility. In these instances, the state where the product is manufactured receives credit for the export. CRS estimates that OM data underestimates manufacturing exports by 25% or more in 10 states and overestimates them in 12 states, as shown in Table C -1 . However, manufactured products from different states sometimes are consolidated for export before shipment. When this occurs, the state-of-production-origin is lost. Instead, the state where these manufactured goods are consolidated receives credit for the entire value of the export, even though those products were manufactured in other states. In general, coastal states with large ports such as California, Texas, or New York record higher exports because of these consolidated shipments, while inland states report lower exports.  Several other issues\u00a0affect state-level trade statistics for manufactured goods.\u00a0Value-added considerations are not taken into account in recording state level exports. The OM data series only reports the sales price and the state from which the completed/finished product is exported. It does not capture value added by myriads of workers and businesses in states where intermediate steps were taken toward the completion of complex manufactured export goods, such as automobiles and aircraft \u2013exports that are comprised of thousands of parts produced in many different locations. As a result, the OM data seriously underestimates value added in many states. See Table C -1 for a list of states whose exports are overestimated or underestimated by the data series.  Accounting for agricultural exports by state, however, is particularly complicated. The Census Bureau explicitly warns that the OM state export data tend to understate agricultural exports from farm states and inflate agricultural exports from states with major ports that handle large volumes of bulk agricultural commodities (e.g., grains, soybeans) and high-value shipments of processed foods. By CRS calculations, OM data underestimate agricultural exports by at least 25% in more than 28 states, and overestimate such exports by the same extent in 12 states. Bulk agricultural products in particular are overwhelmingly sold in many interior states to intermediaries, who ship them by barge or rail to major coastal ports to await export. Other unprocessed agricultural products are produced in one state but sent to a warehouse in another state, or to a facility for processing into a food or beverage product, before being exported. When shipped, these products are not counted as exports of the state where the commodities were produced but rather as exports from the state where they began to move to foreign markets. For instance, corn and soybeans produced in Iowa, Missouri, and other Midwestern states are shipped down the Mississippi River for consolidation at the elevators located in New Orleans. Also, a food product produced in Idaho, and then shipped to a Washington wholesaler or freight forwarder for sale abroad, could be credited as an export of Washington state instead of as a export from Idaho under the OM state export data collection system.
