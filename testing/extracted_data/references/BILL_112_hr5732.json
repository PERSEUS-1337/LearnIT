FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Digital learning technology holds the promise of \n        transforming rural education by removing barriers of distance \n        and increasing school capacity.\n            (2) While many large urban local educational agencies are \n        at the forefront of implementing new digital learning \n        innovations, it is often harder for smaller and more rural \n        local educational agencies to access these tools. Smaller local \n        educational agencies with less capacity may also find it more \n        difficult to provide the training needed to effectively \n        implement new digital learning technologies.\n            (3) Despite the potential of digital learning in rural \n        areas, these advancements risk passing rural areas by without \n        support for their implementation. Rather than having schools \n        and local educational agencies apply digital learning \n        innovations designed for urban environments to rural areas, it \n        is important that digital learning technologies be developed \n        and implemented in ways that reflect the unique needs of rural \n        areas.\n            (4) Digital learning is rapidly expanding, and new tools \n        for improving teaching and learning are being developed every \n        day. A growing demand for digital learning tools and products \n        has made rigorous evaluation of their effectiveness \n        increasingly important, as this information would allow school \n        and local educational agency leaders to make informed choices \n        about how best to use these tools to improve student \n        achievement and educational outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    (a) Grants to Eligible Partnerships.--From the amounts appropriated \nto carry out this Act, the Secretary of Education is authorized to \naward grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible partnerships to carry \nout the activities described in section 6.\n    (b) Duration of Grant.--A grant under subsection (a) shall be \nawarded for not less than a 3-year and not longer than a 5-year period.\n    (c) Fiscal Agent.--If an eligible partnership receives a grant \nunder this Act, a school partner in the partnership shall serve as the \nfiscal agent for the partnership.\n\nSEC. 4. APPLICATION.\n\n    An eligible partnership desiring a grant under this Act shall \nsubmit an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, \nand containing such information as the Secretary may require, which \nshall include the following:\n            (1) A description of the eligible partnership, including \n        the name of each of the partners and their respective roles and \n        responsibilities.\n            (2) A description of the technology-based learning \n        practice, tool, strategy, or course that the eligible \n        partnership proposes to develop or implement using the grant \n        funds.\n            (3) Information relevant to the selection criteria under \n        section 5(c).\n            (4) A description of the evaluation to be undertaken by the \n        eligible partnership, including--\n                    (A) how the school partner and the evaluation \n                partner will work together to implement the practice, \n                tool, strategy, or course in such a way that permits \n                the use of a rigorous evaluation design that meets the \n                standards of the What Works Clearinghouse of the \n                Institute of Education Sciences; and\n                    (B) a description of the evaluation design that \n                meets such standards, which will be used to measure any \n                significant effects on the outcomes described in \n                paragraphs (1) through (3) of section 7(a).\n            (5) An estimate of the number of students to be reached \n        through the grant and evidence of its capacity to reach the \n        proposed number of students during the course of the grant.\n            (6) An assurance that the school partner in the eligible \n        partnership will ensure that each school to be served by the \n        grant under this Act is designated with a school locale code of \n        Fringe Rural, Distant Rural, or Remote Rural, as determined by \n        the Secretary.\n            (7) Any other information the Secretary may require.\n\nSEC. 5.
