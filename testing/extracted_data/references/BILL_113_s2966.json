FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Critical care medicine is the care for patients whose \n        illnesses or injuries present a significant danger to life, \n        limb, or organ function and require comprehensive care and \n        constant monitoring, usually in intensive care units (ICUs).\n            (2) Each year, approximately 5,000,000 people in the United \n        States are admitted into adult medical, surgical, pediatric, or \n        neonatal ICUs.\n            (3) Critical care medicine encompasses a wide array of \n        diseases and health issues. The care provided in the ICU is \n        highly specialized and complex due to the extreme severity of \n        illness of its patient population, often involving multiple \n        disease processes in different organ systems at the same time.\n            (4) Critical care medicine consumes a significant amount of \n        financial resources, accounting for more than 17 percent of all \n        hospital costs.\n            (5) According to a 2006 report by the Health Resources and \n        Services Administration (referred to in this section as \n        ``HRSA''), demand in the United States for critical care \n        medical services is on the rise, due in part to the growing \n        elderly population, as individuals over the age of 65 consume a \n        large percentage of critical care services.\n            (6) The HRSA report also found that the growing aging \n        population will further exacerbate an existing shortage of \n        intensivists, the physicians certified in critical care who \n        primarily deliver care in intensive care units, potentially \n        compromising the quality and availability of care. Today, \n        intensivist-led teams treat only one-third of critically ill \n        patients despite substantial evidence that these teams lead to \n        improved outcomes.\n            (7) Ensuring the strength of our critical care medical \n        delivery infrastructure is integral to the improvement of the \n        quality and delivery of health care in the United States.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assess the current \nstate of the United States critical care medical delivery system and \nimplement policies to improve the quality and effectiveness of care \ndelivered to the critically ill and injured.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDIES ON CRITICAL CARE.\n\n    (a) Institute of Medicine Study.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall enter into \n        an agreement with the Institute of Medicine under which, not \n        later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n        the Institute will--\n                    (A) conduct an analysis of the current state of \n                critical care health services in the United States;\n                    (B) develop recommendations to bolster critical \n                care capabilities to meet future demand; and\n                    (C) submit to Congress a report including the \n                analysis and recommendations under subparagraphs (A) \n                and (B).\n            (2) Issues to be studied.--The agreement under paragraph \n        (1) shall, at a minimum, provide for the following:\n                    (A) Analysis of the current critical care system in \n                the United States, including--\n                            (i) the system's capacity and resources, \n                        including the size of the critical care \n                        workforce and the availability of health \n                        information technology and medical equipment;\n                            (ii) the system's strengths, limitations, \n                        and future challenges; and\n                            (iii) the system's ability to provide \n                        adequate care for the critically ill or injured \n                        in response to a national health emergency, \n                        including a pandemic or natural disaster.\n                    (B) Analysis and recommendations regarding \n                regionalizing critical care systems.\n                    (C) Analysis regarding the status of critical care \n                research in the United States and recommendations for \n                future research priorities.\n    (b) Health Resources and Services Administration Study.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall review and update the \n        Health Resources and Services Administration's 2006 study \n        entitled ``The Critical Care Workforce: A Study of the Supply \n        and Demand for Critical Care Physicians''.\n            (2) Scope.--In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary \n        shall expand the scope of the study to address the supply and \n        demand of other providers within the spectrum of critical care \n        delivery, such as critical care nurses, mid-level providers \n        (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), \n        intensive care unit pharmacists, and intensive care unit \n        respiratory care practitioners.\n\nSEC. 4.
