FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds, with respect to immunizations against vaccine-\npreventable diseases, the following:\n            (1) Childhood illnesses that can be prevented by timely \n        application of commonly available vaccinations, through a \n        program of Federal and local cooperation, are rising at an \n        alarming rate.\n            (2) The incidence of measles increased 336 percent in 1989, \n        increasing to eighteen thousand one hundred ninety three cases \n        from three thousand three hundred ninety six in 1988.\n            (3) The cost of appropriate immunizations is minimal. One \n        estimate places that cost at $130 per child.\n            (4) The typical price per dose of a measles, mumps, rubella \n        vaccine is approximately $24 to the practitioner and the \n        average cost of hospitalization for a child with measles is \n        approximately $5,000-$6,000.\n            (5) A child who was not immunized from measles died in a \n        California hospital after $800,000 was spent in an effort to \n        treat the child's measles complications.\n            (6) In November 1990 the measles rate for the year had \n        already surpassed the rates of other full years since 1978 and \n        deaths from measles are the highest since 1971. Measles caused \n        more than sixty deaths in 1990, the largest annual number of \n        reported cases due to measles in almost two decades.\n            (7) Fifty four percent of measles cases occur among \n        vaccine-eligible infants and preschool children who have not \n        been vaccinated.\n            (8) One-third to one-half of children up to age two who \n        live in poor, inner-city areas are not properly immunized.\n            (9) Preschool children in other Western, industrialized \n        nations have significantly higher immunization rates than \n        United States children of the same age group.\n            (10) There are seven to nine million uninsured children in \n        the United States.\n            (11) While programs to immunize school-aged children have \n        been very successful, preschoolers as a group now make up 47 \n        percent of measles cases, up from 25 percent in 1988.\n            (12) Computerized systems of tracking immunization status \n        and utilization from birth have been operationalized in several \n        countries, including Great Britain and the Netherlands. Such \n        systems can aid in surveillance of immunization status, \n        provision of reminders to parents when vaccines are due, and \n        monitoring the distribution of vaccines through public and \n        private providers.\n\nSEC. 3.
