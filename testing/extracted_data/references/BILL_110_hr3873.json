CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) providing rural housing for poor families in the United \n        States has been an important goal, and the primary reason for \n        enactment, of the Housing Act of 1949;\n            (2) rural multifamily housing financed under the section \n        515 of the Housing Act of 1949 has been an essential resource \n        for providing affordable housing for some of the Nation's \n        poorest families;\n            (3) the majority of the approximately 16,000 projects \n        financed under section 515 that currently have loans \n        outstanding were constructed more than 25 years ago and need \n        new financing in order to continue to provide decent, \n        affordable housing for families eligible to reside in such \n        housing;\n            (4) many owners of such projects are working to transfer \n        the properties, which often involves leveraging Federal \n        resources with private and commercial resources; and\n            (5) the Secretary of Agriculture should protect the \n        portfolio of section 515 projects by making administrative and \n        procedural changes to process ownership transfers in a \n        commercially reasonable time and manner when such transfers \n        will further the preservation of such projects for use as \n        affordable housing for families eligible to reside in such \n        housing.\n\nSEC. 3. TRANSFERS OF SECTION 515 RURAL MULTIFAMILY HOUSING PROJECTS.\n\n    Section 515(h) of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1485) is \namended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(1) Condition.--'' after ``(h)''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n    ``(2) Transfers for Preservation and Rehabilitation of Projects.--\n            ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall make such \n        administrative and procedural changes as may be necessary to \n        expedite the approval of applications to transfer ownership of \n        projects for which a loan is made or insured under this section \n        for the preservation, continued use restriction, and \n        rehabilitation of such projects.
