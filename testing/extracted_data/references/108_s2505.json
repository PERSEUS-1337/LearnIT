    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 led \n        to increased ownership consolidation in the radio industry.\n            (2) At a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n        Science, and Transportation, on June 4, 2003, all 5 members of \n        the Federal Communications Commission testified that there has \n        been, in at least some local radio markets, too much \n        consolidation.\n            (3) A commitment to localism--local operations, local \n        research, local management, locally-originated programming, \n        local artists, and local news and events--would bolster radio \n        listening.\n            (4) Local communities have sought to launch radio stations \n        to meet their local needs. However, due to the scarce amount of \n        spectrum available and the high cost of buying and running a \n        large station, many local communities are unable to establish a \n        radio station.\n            (5) In 2003, the average cost to acquire a commercial radio \n        station was more than $2.5 million dollars.\n            (6) In January, 2000, the Federal Communications Commission \n        authorized a new, affordable community radio service called \n        ``low power FM'' or ``LPFM'' to ``enhance locally focused \n        community-oriented radio broadcasting''.\n            (7) Through the creation of LPFM, the Commission sought to \n        ``create opportunities for new voices on the air waves and to \n        allow local groups, including schools, churches and other \n        community-based organizations, to provide programming \n        responsive to local community needs and interests''.\n            (8) The Commission made clear that the creation of LPFM \n        would not compromise the integrity of the FM radio band by \n        stating, ``We are committed to creating a low power FM radio \n        service only if it does not cause unacceptable interference to \n        existing radio service.''.\n            (9) Small rural broadcasters were particularly concerned \n        about a lengthy and costly interference complaint process. \n        Therefore, in September, 2000, the Commission created a simple \n        process to address interference complaints regarding LPFM \n        stations on an expedited basis.\n            (10) In December, 2000, Congress delayed the full \n        implementation of LPFM until an independent engineering study \n        was completed and reviewed. This delay was due to some \n        broadcasters' concerns that LPFM service would cause \n        interference in the FM band.\n            (11) The delay prevented millions of Americans from having \n        a locally operated, community based radio station in their \n        neighborhood.\n            (12) Approximately 300 LPFM stations were allowed to \n        proceed despite the congressional action. These stations are \n        currently on the air and are run by local government agencies, \n        groups promoting arts and education to immigrant and indigenous \n        peoples, artists, schools, religious organizations, \n        environmental groups, organizations promoting literacy, and \n        many other civically-oriented organizations.\n            (13) After 2 years and the expenditure of $2,193,343 in \n        taxpayer dollars to conduct this study, the broadcasters' \n        concerns were demonstrated to be unsubstantiated.\n\nSEC. 2. REPEAL OF PRIOR LAW.\n\n    Section 632 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 (Public Law \n106-553; 114 Stat. 2762A-111), is repealed.\n\nSEC. 3. MINIMUM DISTANCE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission shall modify its rules to \neliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements \nbetween--\n            (1) low-power FM stations; and\n            (2) full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and \n        FM booster stations.\n\nSEC. 4. PROTECTION OF RADIO READING SERVICES.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission shall retain its rules that \nprovide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power non-commercial \nFM stations that broadcast radio reading services via a subcarrier \nfrequency from potential low-power FM station interference.\n\nSEC. 5. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION RULES.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission shall retain its rules that \nprovide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power FM stations \nthat are licensed in significantly populated States with more than \n3,000,000 housing units and a population density greater than 1,000 \npeople per square mile land area.\n\nSEC. 6. TRANSLATOR LICENSING.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission shall evaluate the impact of \ntranslator licensing on low power and full power radio stations. The \nFederal Communications Commission shall implement policies to promote \nopportunities for locally based low power radio stations, while \nprotecting full power stations from harmful interference from \ntranslator networks.\n                                                       "
