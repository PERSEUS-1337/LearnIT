FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has been effectively engaged in the \n        Northern Ireland peace process through both participating in \n        negotiations and contributing to the economic development of \n        Northern Ireland and border areas of the Republic of Ireland \n        that are affected by the conflict in Northern Ireland.\n            (2) The Government of Ireland, the Irish people, the \n        Government of the United Kingdom, and the British people are \n        longstanding friends of the United States Government and the \n        people of the United States.\n            (3) In 1986, the United States, in support of the Agreement \n        Between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the \n        United Kingdom dated November 15, 1985 (``Anglo-Irish \n        Agreement''), established the International Fund for Ireland \n        (``International Fund'') to help bolster economic development \n        and support programs that would foster peace and reconciliation \n        in Northern Ireland and the affected border areas of the \n        Republic of Ireland.\n            (4) The United States has been a generous and faithful \n        donor to the International Fund, contributing more than \n        $386,000,000 to help improve relations between Catholics and \n        Protestants in Northern Ireland through the creation of \n        thousands of jobs and the development of business opportunities \n        that allow Catholics and Protestants to work together.\n            (5) More than 80 percent of the International Fund's \n        investments have been in disadvantaged areas. Programs funded \n        by the investments offer work experience and important job \n        training programs to disadvantaged and unemployed youth through \n        the economic, social, and physical regeneration of such areas.\n            (6) The International Fund has also developed a series of \n        community-building programs promoting greater dialogue and \n        understanding between Catholics and Protestants and leadership \n        programs designed to develop a new generation of leaders in \n        Northern Ireland to bring about a more peaceful and prosperous \n        future in the region.\n            (7) Section 2(b) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act \n        of 1986 (Public Law 99-415; 100 Stat. 947), states that the \n        purpose of the United States contributions to the International \n        Fund is to support the promotion of ``reconciliation in \n        Northern Ireland and the establishment of a society in Northern \n        Ireland in which all may live in peace, free from \n        discrimination, terrorism, and intolerance, and with the \n        opportunity for both communities to participate fully in the \n        structures and processes of government''.\n            (8) United States assistance to the International Fund has \n        contributed greatly to the economic development of Northern \n        Ireland and to accomplishing the objectives of the Anglo-Irish \n        Agreement Support Act of 1986, economic development and \n        reconciliation, which are critical to achieving a just and \n        lasting peace in the region, especially in the economically \n        depressed areas of Northern Ireland.\n            (9) The Agreement Reached in the Multi-Party Negotiations \n        in Belfast on April 10, 1998 (the ``Good Friday Agreement'') \n        created the Northern Ireland Executive Assembly and Executive \n        Committee and provided for a ``democratically elected Assembly \n        in Northern Ireland which is inclusive in its membership, \n        capable of exercising executive and legislative authority, and \n        subject to safeguards to protect the rights and interests of \n        all sides of the community''.\n            (10) The Good Friday Agreement also called for police \n        reform and establishment of a ``new beginning'' in policing in \n        Northern Ireland with an effective, accountable, and fair \n        police service capable of attracting and sustaining support \n        from the community as a whole, capable of maintaining law \nand order, and based on principles of protection of human rights.\n            (11) In 1999, the Independent Commission on Policing in \n        Northern Ireland, a commission required by the Good Friday \n        Agreement, made 175 recommendations for policing reform in \n        Northern Ireland, some of which have been implemented.\n            (12) In 2002, the Department of State issued a report \n        required by section 701(d) of the Foreign Relations \n        Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228; 116 \n        Stat. 1419), entitled ``Report on Policing Reform and Human \n        Rights in Northern Ireland''. The report concluded that a new \n        police training facility and an increase in funding for police \n        training programs were critically needed in Northern Ireland.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) although there has been positive economic development \n        in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the \n        United States should continue to contribute to the \n        International Fund to support much needed programs in \n        economically depressed areas of Northern Ireland as such \n        programs remain very important to accomplishing the objectives \n        of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986;\n            (2) the United States should support an expansion of \n        reconciliation projects funded by the International Fund as a \n        way to promote peace and economic stability in Northern \n        Ireland; and\n            (3) as policing reform is a significant part of winning \n        public confidence and acceptance of the new form of government \n        in Northern Ireland, the International Fund should support \n        programs to enhance relations between communities and between \n        the police officers and the communities served by such \n        officers, promote human rights training for police officers, \n        and enhance peaceful mediation in neighborhoods of continued \n        conflict.\n\nSEC. 4.
