The efforts \nof those soldiers have enabled the Republic of Korea to develop into a \nsuccessful and modern country. Since 1953, the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States experienced more than 40,000 `Armistice violation \nincidents.' Those incidents have caused the deaths of over 100 soldiers \nof the Armed Forces of the United States and the wounding of hundreds \nmore from hostile fire in the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding \nwaters. Unknown to most citizens, the soldiers of the United States and \nthe Republic of Korea fought and won the `DMZ War' between November \n1966 and December 1969. That war caused the majority of the Armistice \ncasualties. We remember the service, sacrifice, and valor of all of \nthose soldiers on this 40th anniversary of the start of the DMZ War. \nTheir fellow soldiers and their families will never forget them. Let \nthis Plaque aid their countries to remember them as well. Placed this \nday, [__________].''."
