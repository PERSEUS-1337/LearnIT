FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the number of single-parent households has increased \n        significantly;\n            (2) there is a high correlation between childhood poverty \n        and growing up in a single-parent household;\n            (3) family dissolution often brings the economic \n        consequence of a lower standard of living for the custodian and \n        children;\n            (4) children are nearly twice as likely to be in poverty \n        after a family dissolution as before a family dissolution;\n            (5) one-fourth of the single mothers who are owed child \n        support receive none and another one-fourth of such mothers \n        receive only partial child support payments;\n            (6) single mothers above and below the poverty line are \n        equally likely to receive none of the child support they are \n        owed; and\n            (7) the failure of children to receive an adequate level of \n        child support limits the ability of such children to thrive and \n        to develop their potential and leads to long-term societal \n        costs in terms of health care, welfare, and loss in labor force \n        productivity.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to enable participating \nStates to establish child support assurance systems in order to improve \nthe economic circumstances of children who do not receive a minimum \nlevel of child support from the noncustodial parents of such children \nand to strengthen the establishment and enforcement of child support \nawards. The child support assurance approach is structured on a \ndemonstration basis in order to implement and evaluate different \noptions with respect to the provision of intensive support services and \nmechanisms for administering the program on a national basis.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT ASSURANCE DEMONSTRATION \n              PROJECTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--In order to encourage States to provide a \nguaranteed minimum level of child support for every eligible child not \nreceiving such support, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n(hereafter in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall make \ngrants to not more than 6 States to conduct demonstration projects for \nthe purpose of establishing or improving a system of assured minimum \nchild support payments in accordance with this section.\n    (b) Contents of Application.--An application for grants under this \nsection shall be submitted by the Governor of a State and shall--\n            (1) contain a description of the proposed child support \n        assurance project to be established, implemented, or improved \n        using amounts provided under this section, including the level \n        of the assured benefit to be provided, the specific activities \n        to be undertaken, and the agencies that will be involved;\n            (2) specify whether the project will be carried out \n        throughout the State or in limited areas of the State;\n            (3) estimate the number of children who will be eligible \n        for assured minimum child support payments under the project, \n        and the amounts to which they will be entitled on average as \n        individuals and in the aggregate;\n            (4) describe the child support guidelines and review \n        procedures which are in use in the State and any expected \n        modifications;\n            (5) contain a commitment by the State to carry out the \n        project during a period of not less than 3 and not more than 5 \n        consecutive fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 1996;\n            (6) contain assurances that the State--\n                    (A) is currently at or above the national median \n                paternity establishment rate (as defined in section \n                452(g)(2) of the Social Security Act),\n                    (B) will improve the performance of the agency \n                designated by the State to carry out the requirements \n                under part D of title IV of the Social Security Act by \n                at least 4 percent each year in which the State \n                operates a child support assurance project under this \n                section in--\n                            (i) the number of cases in which paternity \n                        is established when required;\n                            (ii) the number of cases in which child \n                        support orders are obtained;

and\n            (8) contain such other information as the Secretary may \n        require by regulation.\n    (c) Use of Funds.--A State shall use amounts provided under a grant \nawarded under this section to carry out a child support assurance \nproject designed to provide a minimum monthly child support benefit for \neach eligible child in the State to the extent that such minimum child \nsupport is not paid in a month by the noncustodial parent.\n    (d) Requirements.--(1) A child support assurance project funded \nunder this section shall provide that--\n            (A) any child (as defined in paragraph (2)) with a living \n        noncustodial parent for whom a child support order has been \n        sought (as defined in paragraph (3)) or obtained and any child \n        who meets ``good cause'' criteria for not seeking or enforcing \n        a support order is eligible for the assured child support \n        benefit;\n            (B) the assured child support benefit shall be paid \n        promptly to the custodial parent at least once a month and \n        shall be--\n                    (i) an amount determined by the State which is--\n                            (I) not less than $1,500 per year for the \n                        first child, $1,000 per year for the second \n                        child, and $500 per year for the third and each \n                        subsequent child, and\n                            (II) not more than $3,000 per year for the \n                        first child and $1,000 per year for the second \n                        and each subsequent child;\n                    (ii) offset and reduced to the extent that the \n                custodial parent receives child support in a month from \n                the noncustodial parent;\n                    (iii) indexed and adjusted for inflation; and\n                    (iv) in the case of a family of children with \n                multiple noncustodial parents, calculated in the same \n                manner as if all such children were full siblings, but \n                any child support payment from a particular \n                noncustodial parent shall only be applied against the \n                assured child support benefit for the child or children \n                of that particular noncustodial parent;\n            (C) for purposes of determining the need of a child or \n        relative and the level of assistance, one-half of the amount \n        received as a child support payment shall be disregarded from \n        income until the total amount of child support and Aid to \n        Families With Dependent Children benefit received under part A \n        of title IV of the Social Security Act equals the Federal \n        poverty level for a family of comparable size;\n            (D) in the event that the family as a whole becomes \n        ineligible for Aid to Families With Dependent Children under \n        part A of the Social Security Act due to consideration of \n        assured child support benefits, the continuing eligibility of \n        the caretaker for Aid to Families With Dependent Children under \n        such title shall be calculated without consideration of the \n        assured child support benefit; and\n            (E) in order to participate in the child support assurance \n        project, the child's caretaker shall apply for services of the \n        State's child support enforcement program under part D of title \n        IV of the Social Security Act.\n    (2) For purposes of this section, the term ``child'' means an \nindividual who is of such an age, disability, or educational status as \nto be eligible for child support as provided for by the law of the \nState in which such individual resides.\n    (3) For purposes of this section, a child support order shall be \ndeemed to have been ``sought'' where an individual has applied for \nservices from the State agency designated by the State to carry out the \nrequirements of part D of title IV of the Social Security Act or has \nsought a child support order through representation by private or \npublic counsel or pro se.\n    (e) Consideration and Priority of Applications.--(1) The Secretary \nshall consider all applications received from States desiring to \nconduct demonstration projects under this section and shall approve not \nmore than 6 applications which appear likely to contribute \nsignificantly to the achievement of the purpose of this section.
