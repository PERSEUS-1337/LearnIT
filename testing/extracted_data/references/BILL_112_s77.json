FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) actions taken to reduce emissions of air pollutants, as \n        defined in section 302 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7602), \n        will spur investments that create new jobs and foster \n        innovation and entrepreneurship in clean technology industries; \n        and\n            (2) according to the Environmental Protection Agency--\n                    (A) the average building wastes 30 percent of the \n                energy consumed by the building because of \n                inefficiency; and\n                    (B) the operating costs of the nearly 5,000,000 \n                buildings in the United States exceed $100,000,000,000 \n                per year.\n\nSEC. 3.
