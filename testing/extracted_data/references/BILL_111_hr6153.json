FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Millions of incarcerated people in the world suffer \n        inhumane conditions in prisons and other detention facilities \n        that are overcrowded, unsanitary, and unsafe to the point of \n        endangering their lives.\n            (2) According to a 2009 International Centre for Prison \n        Studies report, there are an estimated 9,800,000 people held in \n        penal institutions in the world, with prison populations \n        increasing in 71 percent of the over 200 countries surveyed.\n            (3) Rates of malnutrition, disease, and death among \n        prisoners and other detainees far exceed those of the general \n        population, and medical treatment for serious illness or injury \n        is, in many instances, non-existent or grossly inadequate.\n            (4) These conditions are compounded by severe overcrowding \n        in prisons and other detention facilities. Excessive pre-trial \n        detention and dysfunctional justice systems frequently result \n        in prisoners and other detainees spending years in such \n        conditions before their cases are adjudicated. In some \n        countries, such facilities are filled to capacity many times \n        over resulting in conditions so cramped that individual \n        prisoners cannot move without all doing so en masse.\n            (5) Amnesty International's 2009 State of the World's Human \n        Rights Report documented widespread inhumane prison conditions, \n        including overcrowding, inadequate food and water, no access to \n        hygiene products or medical care, juveniles detained with \n        adults, and denial of visits from family.\n            (6) Some governments fail to provide even the most \n        rudimentary sanitation in prisons and other detention \n        facilities, putting prisoners and other detainees at even \n        greater risk of easily preventable and often life-threatening \n        diseases. Toilets are few or non-existent and human waste \n        repositories often are located among the general prison \n        population, forcing prisoners to eat, sleep, and live in \n        grossly unsanitary conditions.\n            (7) According to a 2009 report by the United Nations \n        Economic and Social Council's Commission on Crime Prevention \n        and Criminal Justice, former prisoners are likely to spread \n        diseases contracted in prison to the local population.\n            (8) Some governments fail to permit prisoners and other \n        detainees reasonable exercise of religious worship or contact \n        with family members or other visitors.\n            (9) According to the United States Commission on \n        International Religious Freedom's 2009 Annual Report, religious \n        prisoners have been confined to overcrowded cells, exposed to \n        extreme temperature fluctuations, denied adequate food and \n        medical care, and denied access to clergy and religious \n        literature.\n            (10) Inhumane conditions in prisons and other detention \n        facilities often exist in countries where resources for law \n        enforcement are limited and only a small fraction of such \n        resources are made available for the operation and maintenance \n        of prisons and other detention facilities. Inadequate, \n        misplaced, or lost prison records often result in prisoners and \n        detainees being incarcerated indefinitely because of never \n        being tried or otherwise adjudicated, and being held long after \n        their sentences have expired thereby further swelling prison \n        populations. Allocating the relatively modest resources \n        necessary to provide for the basic human needs of prisoners and \n        other detainees and to remediate the inhumane conditions under \n        which such prisoners are held is often a low priority.\n            (11) The United States Government currently provides \n        significant amounts of assistance to countries whose \n        governments operate prisons and other detention facilities \n        that, because of their inhumane conditions, seriously \n        jeopardize the lives of prisoners and other detainees held \n        under their authority.\n            (12) The Department of State's 2009 Country Reports on \n        Human Rights Practices reported prison conditions as poor, \n        inhumane, or life threatening in more than 100 countries, all \n        of which receive United States assistance.\n            (13) The United States Government should use its influence \n        and resources to help ensure that governments that receive \n        United States assistance do not operate prisons and other \n        detention facilities under inhumane conditions. The United \n        States Government also should assist countries that are making \n        significant efforts to eliminate inhumane conditions in prisons \n        and other detention facilities.\n            (14) Eliminating inhumane conditions in foreign prisons and \n        other detention facilities will strengthen the rule of law, \n        save lives, and enhance the health and well-being of vulnerable \n        people in poor countries, and it will advance United States \n        interests.\n\nSEC. 3.
