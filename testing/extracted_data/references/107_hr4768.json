    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Garment Consumer's Right-to-Know Act \nof 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The production of garments in sweatshops that violate \n        labor rights and standards burdens interstate and international \n        commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce by spreading \n        and perpetuating labor conditions that undermine minimum living \n        standards and by providing an unfair means of competition to \n        the detriment of employers who comply with the law.\n            (2) The existence of domestic and foreign working \n        conditions detrimental to fair competition and the maintenance \n        of minimum standards of living necessary for health, \n        efficiency, and general well-being of domestic and foreign \n        workers are a continuing and growing problem in the garment \n        industry.\n            (3) Many consumers of garments wish to know whether the \n        garments they purchase in interstate and international commerce \n        are made under working conditions that the consumer deems \n        morally repugnant, indecent, violative of workers' human \n        dignity and fundamental rights, or otherwise unacceptable. The \n        absence of reliable and available information about such \n        sweatshop conditions impairs consumers' capacity to freely and \n        knowingly choose whether to purchase garments made in \n        sweatshops and sold into interstate and international commerce.\n            (4) The Congress concurs in the findings of the Comptroller \n        General that most sweatshop employers violate the recordkeeping \n        requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n        201 et seq.).\n            (5) The failure of these employers to maintain adequate \n        records, as well as the lack of access to such records by \n        consumers, employees, consumer and employee representatives, \n        and the public at large has adversely affected and continues to \n        adversely affect the ability of employees and the Department of \n        Labor to collect wages due to workers and to otherwise ensure \n        compliance with the Act's wage and hour, child labor, and \n        industrial homework provisions.\n            (6) These failures of recordkeeping and lack of access to \n        records--combined with the inadequacy in the scope of \n        information that manufacturers have been required to record and \n        disclose--also obstruct consumers from freely and knowingly \n        choosing whether to buy garments that are made under sweatshop \n        conditions.\n            (7) It is necessary to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act \n        of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) to ensure free consumer choice \n        and to promote fair competition and working conditions that are \n        not detrimental to the maintenance of health, efficiency, and \n        general well-being of workers in the garment industry.\n\nSEC. 3. RECORDKEEPING AND DISCLOSURE IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY.\n\n    The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is \namended by inserting after section 11 the following new section:\n\n         ``recordkeeping and disclosure in the garment industry\n\n    ``Sec. 11A.
