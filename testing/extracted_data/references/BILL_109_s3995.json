FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The academic intensity of a student's secondary school \n        curriculum counts more than any other precollegiate factor in \n        providing momentum toward eventual completion of a college \n        degree.\n            (2) By failing to provide challenging course work, some \n        secondary schools do not present adequate opportunities for all \n        students to learn. Some groups of students are excluded from \n        such opportunities more than others. For example, students from \n        the lowest socioeconomic status are much more likely than their \n        wealthier peers to attend secondary schools that do not offer \n        any mathematics beyond Algebra 2.\n            (3) To close gaps in the preparation for college, and in \n        the eventual attainment of a college degree, the provision of \n        challenging curriculum for all students is necessary.\n            (4) Colleges and community colleges have recently begun to \n        provide challenging courses to secondary school students, and \n        distance learning provides additional options if students have \n        access to distance learning technology.\n            (5) The cost of enrolling in a college-level course is a \n        barrier to learning opportunities for those students most in \n        need of such opportunities. Providing grants to capable \n        students from low-income families will provide these students \n        with increased access to the challenging coursework that leads \n        to success in college or the workplace.\n\nSEC. 3. EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GRANTS FOR ELIGIBLE LOW-INCOME SECONDARY \n              SCHOOL STUDENTS.\n\n    (a) Education Opportunity Grants for Eligible Low-Income Secondary \nSchool Students.--Part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of \n1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n\n   ``Subpart 9--Education Opportunity Grants for Eligible Low-Income \n                       Secondary School Students\n\n``SEC. 420L.
