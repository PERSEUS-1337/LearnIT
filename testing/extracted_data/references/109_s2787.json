    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Western Hemisphere Energy Security \nAct of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States is the largest oil importer in the \n        world;\n            (2) the Federal Government predicts that, by 2025, 68 \n        percent of the oil used in the United States will be imported;\n            (3) \\2/3\\ of the oil reserves of the world are located in \n        the politically unstable Middle East and are controlled by \n        members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n            (4) global fuel consumption is projected to increase by 100 \n        percent to 150 percent during the next 20 years, driven largely \n        by the Chinese and Indian economies;\n            (5) that increased demand for fuel--\n                    (A) will place the United States in ever-greater \n                competition for oil and gas resources; and\n                    (B) may result in an extension of Chinese \n                involvement in developing Cuban oil and gas reserves to \n                within a few miles of the coastline of the United \n                States;\n            (6) the United States adheres to the principle that, in a \n        case in which the exclusive economic zone of the United States \n        is contiguous to the exclusive economic zone of another \n        country, a point equidistant to the maritime baselines of the 2 \n        countries demarcates the exclusive economic zone of each;\n            (7) an example of the application of the principle \n        described in paragraph (6) is that the exclusive economic zone \n        of Cuba extends to within--\n                    (A) 52 miles of the Florida Keys at--\n                            (i) south of 24 degrees north latitude; and\n                            (ii) east of -81 degrees west longitude; \n                        and\n                    (B) 85.4 miles of the Florida peninsula at--\n                            (i) south of 24 degrees north latitude; and\n                            (ii) east of -81 degrees west longitude;\n            (8) Cubapetroleo, the state oil company of Cuba, recently--\n                    (A) signed an oil production sharing agreement with \n                the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation; and\n                    (B) purchased 3 deep-water drilling rigs from that \n                Chinese state enterprise for use in the exclusive \n                economic zone of Cuba;\n            (9) the exclusive economic zone of Cuba in the Gulf of \n        Mexico is a 112,000-square-kilometer area that has been divided \n        into 59 exploration blocks, each of which is approximately \n        2,000 square kilometers and an average depth of 2,000 meters \n        (except that some of those blocks have a depth of as great as \n        4,000 meters);\n            (10) the northernmost of the exploration blocks described \n        in paragraph (9) are located off the southwest coast of the \n        State of Florida;\n            (11) a United States Geological Survey report entitled \n        ``Assessment of Undiscovered Oil and Gas Resources of the North \n        Cuba Basin 2004'' estimated that between 1,000,000,000 and \n        9,300,000,000 barrels of undiscovered oil and between \n        1,900,000,000,000 and 22,000,000,000,000 cubic feet of \n        undiscovered natural gas along the northern coast of Cuba;\n            (12) the national security strategy of the President \n        recognizes the increasing resource needs of China by stating \n        that China is ``expanding trade, but acting as if they can \n        somehow lock up energy supplies around the world or seek to \n        direct markets rather than opening them up.'';\n            (13) the United States embargo on Cuba prohibits United \n        States persons from engaging in the exploration or extraction \n        of hydrocarbon resources from the exclusive economic zone of \n        Cuba;\n            (14) United States oil and gas industries are the world's \n        leaders in the efficient and environmentally-safe extraction of \n        oil and gas resources from marine deposits; and\n            (15) it is in the energy, national security, and \n        environmental interests of the United States that the oil and \n        gas companies of the United States be permitted to operate in \n        the foreign exclusive economic zones that is contiguous to the \n        exclusive economic zone of the United States.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to permit United States \npersons to participate in the exploration for and the extraction of \nhydrocarbon resources from any portion of a foreign maritime exclusive \neconomic zone that is contiguous to the exclusive economic zone of the \nUnited States.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF UNITED STATES PERSON.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``United States person'' means--\n            (1) any United States citizen or alien lawfully admitted \n        for permanent residence in the United States; and\n            (2) any person other than an individual, if 1 or more \n        individuals described in paragraph (1) own or control at least \n        51 percent of the securities or other equity interest in the \n        person.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF ACTIVITIES AND EXPORTS INVOLVING HYDROCARBON \n              RESOURCES BY UNITED STATES PERSONS.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including a \nregulation), United States persons (including agents and affiliates of \nthose United States persons) may--\n            (1) engage in any transaction necessary for the exploration \n        for and extraction of hydrocarbon resources from any portion of \n        any foreign exclusive economic zone that is contiguous to the \n        exclusive economic zone of the United States; and\n            (2) export without license authority all equipment \n        necessary for the exploration for or extraction of hydrocarbon \n        resources described in paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 5. TRAVEL IN CONNECTION WITH AUTHORIZED HYDROCARBON EXPLORATION \n              AND EXTRACTION ACTIVITIES.\n\n    Section 910 of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement \nAct of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7209) is amended by inserting after subsection \n(b) the following:\n    ``(c) General License Authority for Travel-Related Expenditures by \nPersons Engaging in Hydrocarbon Exploration and Extraction \nActivities.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, \n        authorize under a general license the travel-related \n        transactions listed in section 515.560(c) of title 31, Code of \n        Federal Regulations, for travel to, from or within Cuba in \n        connection with exploration for and the extraction of \n        hydrocarbon resources in any part of a foreign maritime \n        Exclusive Economic Zone that is contiguous to the United \n        States' Exclusive Economic Zone.\n            ``(2) Persons authorized.--Persons authorized to travel to \n        Cuba under this section include full-time employees, \n        executives, agents, and consultants of oil and gas producers, \n        distributors, and shippers.''."
