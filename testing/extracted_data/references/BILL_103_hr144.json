FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The intolerably high number of Americans without \n        adequate health insurance has resulted in major part from the \n        high cost of health insurance premiums.\n            (2) By eliminating the full tax deductibility of most \n        medical expenses, the Federal Government has effectively \n        increased the cost of health insurance. This same misguided \n        policy has increased the cost of regular maintenance of one's \n        own health through regular physician visits. This policy of the \n        Federal Government, therefore, has both discouraged the \n        purchase of health insurance and exposed taxpayers to greater \n        expense because individuals are more likely to develop chronic \n        illnesses and more likely to go without insurance to pay for \n        critical care.\n            (3) Excessive, wasteful, and abusive litigation in medical \n        care liability suits throughout the United States has also \n        significantly contributed to the high cost of health care in \n        America. The enormous sums and valuable time that hospitals and \n        physicians lose because of needless litigation amount to a huge \n        tax on health care for all Americans. Even more expensive is \n        the huge and thoroughly unnecessary cost of so-called \n        ``defensive medicine''. Because of the ubiquitous threat of \n        lawsuits, doctors and other health care providers all too often \n        prescribe unnecessary tests, studies, and procedures simply to \n        protect themselves--not their patients. Reforming the abuses of \n        our civil litigation system in medical cases is therefore an \n        essential step in controlling health care costs.\n            (4) Noneconomic damages in medical cases should be \n        eliminated. Payment of huge money damages for conceptually \n        elusive measure of loss such as ``pain and suffering'' and \n        ``inconvenience'' has proven to be unworkable. Our society \n        simply cannot afford it. Money damages should be limited to \n        repayment of actual monetary losses such as medical expenses, \n        out-of-pocket costs, lost future earnings, and other \n        traditional measures of actual damages.\n            (5) Punitive damages in medical care liability suits are \n        meant to punish malefactors rather than provide a windfall to \n        attorneys and random litigants. The existence of this potential \n        windfall (always unrelated to the actual damages suffered in \n        any case) creates a perverse incentive for even more litigation \n        against ``deep pockets'' doctors, hospitals, and health care \n        providers. Punitive damages should, therefore, be paid over to \n        community hospitals to offset the cost of indigent care. This \n        will end one of the most significant incentives for abusive and \n        unnecessary litigation that drives up medical costs. Even more \n        importantly, it will reduce the cost of health care for the \n        poor and taxpayers alike.\n            (6) Medical care liability suits should be decided on their \n        merits. But in recent years, the vast majority of medical care \n        liability suits have been decided without a single day of \n        trial, when parties realize that they cannot afford the \n        lawyers' costs and other expenses of obtaining their day in \n        court. This has led all too often to economic blackmail, in \n        which innocent parties--hospitals, physicians, nurses, other \n        health care workers--are forced to settle for large amounts \n        even though they should, in fact, be held harmless by our legal \n        system. Patients with meritorious medical malpractice cases \n        find their recoveries substantially reduced by attorneys' fees. \n        Health care providers victimized by groundless litigation must \n        often pay enormous fees simply to prove they are blameless. To \n        redress this inequity, the loser in a medical case should pay \n        the costs and attorneys' fees of the winner. This will end \n        another perverse incentive in the present system for \n        unnecessary litigation that drives up health care costs.\n            (7) By reducing the cost of health care and by making \n        health insurance more affordable, millions more Americans will \n        be able to obtain needed health coverage. This, in turn, will \n        increase the size of insurance risk pools, further reducing the \n        cost of necessary insurance for all Americans.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTORATION OF THE FULL DEDUCTIBILITY OF MEDICAL EXPENSES.\n\n    Section 213(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \nthe treatment of medical and dental expenses) is amended to read as \nfollows:\n    ``(a) Allowance of Deduction.--There shall be allowed as a \ndeduction the expenses paid during the taxable year, not compensated \nfor by insurance or otherwise, for medical care of the taxpayer, the \ntaxpayer's spouse, or a dependent (as defined in section 152).''.\n\nSEC. 4. ATTORNEYS' FEES IN MEDICAL CARE LIABILITY SUITS.\n\n    (a) Awarding Attorneys' Fees and Other Costs to Prevailing Party.--\nThe nonprevailing party in a medical care liability suit shall pay to \nthe prevailing party in such suit its litigation expenses under the \naction (including attorneys' fees and fees paid to expert witnesses, \nbut not including court fees, filing fees, or other expenses paid \ndirectly to the court). The amount to be paid for such litigation \nexpenses shall not exceed the litigation expenses of the nonprevailing \nparty in such medical care liability suit. If the nonprevailing party \nreceives attorney services under a contingent fee agreement, the amount \nof the attorneys' fees paid under this subsection shall not exceed the \nreasonable value of those services, determined without regard to the \ncontingent nature of the fee arrangement.\n    (b) Definition of Prevailing Party.--The term `prevailing party' \nmeans a party to a medical care liability suit who obtains a favorable \nfinal judgment (other than by settlement) on all or a portion of the \nclaims asserted in the action.\n\nSEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF NONECONOMIC DAMAGES IN MEDICAL CARE LIABILITY \n              SUITS.\n\n    (a) Scope of Prohibition.--Noneconomic damages may not be imposed \nin a medical care liability suit. Compensatory damages may be awarded \nas in any other type of action.\n    (b) Definition of Noneconomic Damages.--The term `noneconomic \ndamages' means damages for pain, suffering, inconvenience, or any other \nnonpecuniary loss, but does not include punitive damages.\n\nSEC. 6. PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO BE REDIRECTED TO COMMUNITY HOSPITALS TO PAY \n              FOR INDIGENT CARE.\n\n    (a) Local Government to Receive Moneys on Behalf of Hospitals.--Any \npunitive damages imposed in a medical care liability suit shall be paid \nto the county, parish, or comparable unit of local government in which \nthe action is brought and which has primary responsibility for payment \nfor indigent health services in its jurisdiction.\n    (b) Use of Moneys.--A county, parish, or comparable unit of local \ngovernment which receives moneys under subsection (a) shall use it \ntoward payment of its unreimbursed expenses incurred in providing \nhealth care to individuals entitled to medical assistance under titles \nXVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act.\n\nSEC. 7. APPLICABILITY.\n\n    (a) Applicability.--This Act shall apply with respect to any \nmedical care liability suit brought in any State or Federal court, \nexcept that this Act shall not apply to a claim or action for damages \narising from a vaccine-related injury or death to the extent that title \nXXI of the Public Health Service Act applies to the action.\n    (b) Effect on State Law.--This Act supersedes State law only to the \nextent that State law differs from any provision of law established by \nor under this Act. Any issue that is not governed by any provision of \nlaw established by or under this Act shall be governed by otherwise \napplicable State or Federal law.\n    (c) Federal Court Jurisdiction Not Established on Federal Question \nGrounds.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to establish any \njurisdiction in the district courts of the United States over medical \ncare liability suits on the basis of sections 1331 or 1337 of title 28, \nUnited States Code.\n    (d) Definition of Medical Care Liability Suit.--The term `medical \ncare liability suit' means an action for damages arising out of the \nprovision of (or the failure to provide) health care services.\n\nSEC. 8.
