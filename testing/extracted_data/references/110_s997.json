    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act \nof 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH.\n\n    Part H of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 498C the following:\n\n``SEC. 498D. HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n(including any regulation or guidance), the Secretary shall conduct and \nsupport research that utilizes human embryonic stem cells in accordance \nwith this section (regardless of the date on which the stem cells were \nderived from a human embryo) .\n    ``(b) Ethical Requirements.--Human embryonic stem cells shall be \neligible for use in any research conducted or supported by the \nSecretary if the cells meet each of the following:\n            ``(1) The stem cells were derived from human embryos that \n        have been donated from in vitro fertilization clinics, were \n        created for the purposes of fertility treatment, and were in \n        excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such \n        treatment.\n            ``(2) Prior to the consideration of embryo donation and \n        through consultation with the individuals seeking fertility \n        treatment, it was determined that the embryos would never be \n        implanted in a woman and would otherwise be discarded.\n            ``(3) The individuals seeking fertility treatment donated \n        the embryos with written informed consent and without receiving \n        any financial or other inducements to make the donation.\n    ``(c) Guidelines.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the \nenactment of this section, the Secretary, in consultation with the \nDirector of NIH, shall issue final guidelines to carry out this \nsection.\n    ``(d) Reporting Requirements.--The Secretary shall annually prepare \nand submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report \ndescribing the activities carried out under this section during the \npreceding fiscal year, and including a description of whether and to \nwhat extent research under subsection (a) has been conducted in \naccordance with this section.''.\n\nSEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL RESEARCH.\n\n    Part H of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284 \net seq.), as amended by section 2, is further amended by inserting \nafter section 498D the following:\n\n``SEC. 498E. ALTERNATIVE HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL RESEARCH.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--In accordance with section 492, the Secretary \nshall conduct and support basic and applied research to develop \ntechniques for the isolation, derivation, production, or testing of \nstem cells that, like embryonic stem cells, are capable of producing \nall or almost all of the cell types of the developing body and may \nresult in improved understanding of or treatments for diseases and \nother adverse health conditions, but are not derived from a human \nembryo.\n    ``(b) Guidelines.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this section, the Secretary, after consultation with the \nDirector, shall issue final guidelines to implement subsection (a), \nthat--\n            ``(1) provide guidance concerning the next steps required \n        for additional research, which shall include a determination of \n        the extent to which specific techniques may require additional \n        basic or animal research to ensure that any research involving \n        human cells using these techniques would clearly be consistent \n        with the standards established under this section;\n            ``(2) prioritize research with the greatest potential for \n        near-term clinical benefit; and\n            ``(3) consistent with subsection (a), take into account \n        techniques outlined by the President's Council on Bioethics and \n        any other appropriate techniques and research.\n    ``(c) Reporting Requirements.--Not later than January 1 of each \nyear, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the appropriate \ncommittees of the Congress a report describing the activities carried \nout under this section during the fiscal year, including a description \nof the research conducted under this section.\n    ``(d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to affect any policy, guideline, or regulation regarding \nembryonic stem cell research, human cloning by somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer, or any other research not specifically authorized by this \nsection.\n    ``(e) Definition.--\n            ``(1) In general.--In this section, the term `human embryo' \n        shall have the meaning given such term in the applicable \n        appropriations Act.\n            ``(2) Applicable act.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the \n        term `applicable appropriations Act' means, with respect to the \n        fiscal year in which research is to be conducted or supported \n        under this section, the Act making appropriations for the \n        Department of Health and Human Services for such fiscal year, \n        except that if the Act for such fiscal year does not contain \n        the term referred to in paragraph (1), the Act for the previous \n        fiscal year shall be deemed to be the applicable appropriations \n        Act.\n    ``(f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years \n2008 through 2010, to carry out this section.''.\n                                                        "
