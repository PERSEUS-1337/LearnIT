    "content": "Pakistan has long been a leading recipient of U.S. foreign aid despite contentious issues in the bilateral relationship. In May 2013, Pakistan conducted scheduled national elections to seat new National and Provincial Assemblies. The exercise was itself historic as an unprecedented transfer of power from one elected government to another. The right-leaning, conservative Pakistan Muslim League faction led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (PML-N) won an unexpectedly strong victory that includes a simple majority in the National Assembly as well as continued control of Punjab, where the bulk of Pakistan's citizens reside. The incumbent Pakistan People's Party suffered a major defeat and is relegated to opposition status at the federal level, although it retained control of the Sindh government.\u00a0The newly formidable Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) part\u2014led by Imran Khan, a strident critic of Pakistan's cooperation with the United States\u2014now heads a coalition government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In June, Sharif began his third non-consecutive term as Prime Minister. Although the elections were marked by violence and some reports of rigging, their conduct was welcomed by the U.S. and other international governments as an important step in Pakistan's democratization process. Analysts do not anticipate any major adjustments in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in the near- or middle-term and Sharif's priorities\u2014resolving Pakistan's energy crisis and reversing its economic decline\u2014track well with the central goals of the U.S. assistance program. Following the May 2011 U.S. commando raid in Pakistan to kill Osama bin Laden, already troubled U.S.-Pakistani relations soured, prompting the 112 th Congress to consider new restrictions on, or even elimination of, the billions of annual assistance dollars currently being provided. Since the raid, U.S.-Pakistani military cooperation has been disrupted and clouded by increased mutual distrust; Islamabad has significantly reduced the number of U.S. military trainers allowed in the country, and the Obama Administration indicated that deliveries of certain security-related financial transfers and other aid are under suspension. A November 2011 incident near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border left two dozen Pakistani soldiers dead after their posts came under fire from NATO forces; the event further disrupted relations. A significant shift in the Obama Administration's public statements on U.S. relations with Pakistan was suggested in September 2011 when Admiral Mike Mullen, the outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. In that hearing, both explicitly accused Pakistan's main intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), of supporting Haqqani Network insurgents who engage in attacks on U.S. targets in Afghanistan. When asked by a committee member whether he supported a move in Congress to further condition U.S. aid to Pakistan, Secretary Panetta replied, \"Anything that makes clear to them that we cannot tolerate their providing this kind of safe haven to the Haqqanis, and that they have to take action\u2014any signal that we can send to them\u2014I think would be important to do.\"  Weeks later, however, President Barack Obama stated in a press conference, \"We could not have been as successful as we have been without the cooperation of the Pakistan government. And so on a whole range of issues, they have been an effective partner with us,\" adding, \"[W]e will constantly evaluate our relationship with Pakistan\" in the context of U.S. interests. The Administration's scrutiny of the relationship has continued since, especially in light of increased congressional attention following the tumultuous events of 2011. Yet its fundamental support for a continued large-scale assistance program is unchanged. During an April 2013 House hearing on the Administration's FY2014 foreign affairs budget proposal, newly seated Secretary of State John Kerry was asked about ending all foreign assistance to Pakistan. His reply: \"Cutting off aid to Pakistan would\u2014would not be a good move, certainly at this point in time, for a lot of different reasons. We are working with Pakistan with respect to nuclear safety and nonproliferation. We are working with Pakistan to get our supplies both in and out of Afghanistan.\" At the same time that the Administration expressed serious displeasure with Pakistan, the United States responded in FY2011 and FY2012 with more than $110 million in humanitarian aid to a September 2011 disaster due to flooding there. Previously, the United States had provided about $600 million in disaster and refugee assistance for the widespread summer 2010 Pakistan floods. More recently, in September 2012 and February 2013, the Administration waived certification requirements to allow for continued transfers of major defense equipment. The latter waiver was taken as a signal that the bilateral security relationship was being substantively renewed after a nearly two-year-long period of estrangement. While numerous concerns exist about whether Pakistan can be accountable in how it uses U.S. aid and whether it is capable of being a reliable U.S. partner in combating terrorism, many experts believe that key U.S. strategic interests are inextricably linked with a stable Pakistan and region. They emphasize the importance of maintaining close bilateral engagement with Pakistan, including providing assistance, to promote stability and contribute to U.S. national security. Over past decades Congress has expressed concern with the U.S.-Pakistan relationship and has placed limitations and reporting requirements on U.S. aid to Pakistan in both authorization and appropriation laws. Following, in reverse chronological order, are laws passed by Congress that restrict aid and/or establish certain requirements for the release of such aid. H.R. 4310 was introduced March 29, 2012, and was passed by the full House on May 18, 2012. The bill was referred to the Senate, where it passed on December 21, 2012. The conference report ( H.Rept. 112-705 ) was filed on December 18, 2012. The President signed it into law on January 2, 2013. Section 1227 of the act extends authority of Coalition Support Fund (CSF) reimbursements for FY2013 and limits CSF reimbursements to Pakistan to $1.2 billion for that fiscal year. It prohibits CSF reimbursements for the period between November 2011-July 2012 when Pakistan had barred NATO from transiting along its Ground Lines of Communication (GLOCs) linking Afghanistan with the Arabian Sea. FY2013 CSF reimbursements can only be made after the Secretary of Defense certifies that Pakistan is maintaining security along the GLOCs, is taking demonstrable steps against terrorism, and that it is countering the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The Secretary may waive these certification requirements for U.S. national security reasons. This measure requires a report from the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, within 90 days of enactment, on the reimbursement process, the conditions regarding the GLOCs, and an estimate of transshipment costs for FY2011 through FY2013 supporting the forces in Afghanistan. Section 1228 extends the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund (PCF) through FY2013 and extends the limitation of funds until the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, certifies to certain congressional committees that the government of Pakistan is demonstrating efforts to counter IEDs, is cooperating on counterterrorism efforts, and is not detaining Pakistani citizens, including Dr. Shakil Afridi, as a result of their cooperation with the U.S. government on counterterrorism efforts. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may waive these requirements if doing so is deemed to be in the U.S. national security interest. H.R. 1540 was introduced in the House on April 14, 2011. The House passed it on May 26. The bill was referred to the Senate on June 6, when it was referred to the Committee on Armed Services. The Senate passed it with an amendment on December 1, 2011. The conference report ( H.Rept. 112-329 ) was filed on December 12. The conference report was agreed to in the House on December 14 and in the Senate on December 15, 2011. The President signed it into law on December 31, 2011. Section 1220 of the bill stipulates that not more than 40% of FY2012 appropriated amounts for PCF may be obligated or expended until the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, submits an annual report to the relevant defense committees in the House and Senate, and to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations that includes a strategy to use PCF and the metrics used to determine progress on use of PCF, and a strategy to enhance Pakistani efforts to counter improvised explosive devices (IEDs). At a minimum, the report shall include (i) a discussion of U.S. strategic objectives in Pakistan; (ii) a list of terrorist organizations in Pakistan opposing U.S. goals in the region and against which the United States encourages Pakistan to take action; (iii) a discussion of the gaps in capabilities of Pakistan security units that hamper the ability of the government of Pakistan to take action against the organizations listed; (iv) a discussion of how assistance provided using PCF will address the gaps in capabilities; (v) a discussion of efforts undertaken by other U.S. government departments and agencies or other activities by the Department of Defense to address gaps in capabilities and how they all are coordinated with activities undertaken by PCF; (vi) a discussion of whether the government of Pakistan is demonstrating a commitment to countering IEDs; and (vii) metrics used to track progress of the government of Pakistan in listing terrorist organizations, address capability gaps, and counter IEDs. The section further requires the Secretary of Defense, in concurrence with the Secretary of State, to include in the quarterly reports mandated under Section 1224(f) of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 a discussion of progress in achieving U.S. strategic objectives in Pakistan during such fiscal quarter, utilizing metrics used to track progress in achieving such strategic objectives; and a discussion of progress made by programs supported from amounts in the PCF during such fiscal quarter. H.R. 2055 was introduced on May 31, 2011 as the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding measure. It became the vehicle for the omnibus appropriation legislation in December. The conference report ( H.Rept. 112-331 ) was passed by both House and Senate in December 2011. The President signed in into law ( P.L. 112-74 ) on December 23, 2011. Section 7010 requires the Secretary of State to provide in writing to the congressional appropriations committees before April 1, 2012, and each fiscal quarter thereafter a report on the uses of Foreign Military Financing (FMF), International Military Education and Training (IMET), Peacekeeping Operations (PKO), and Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF). Section 7046(c)(1)(A) (Pakistan Certification) states that none of the funds appropriated by this act may be made available to the government of Pakistan unless the Secretary of State certifies to the House and Senate appropriations committees that the government of Pakistan is (i) cooperating with the United States in counterterrorist efforts against Haqqani Network, the Quetta Shura Taliban, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Al Qaeda, and other domestic and foreign terrorist organizations, including taking steps to end support for them and preventing them from basing and operating in Pakistan and carrying out cross border attacks into neighboring countries; (ii) not supporting terrorist activities against U.S. or coalition forces in Afghanistan, and Pakistan military and intelligence agencies are not intervening extra-judicially into political and judicial processes in Pakistan; (iii) dismantling improvised explosive devices (IED) networks and interdicting precurser chemicals used in manufacture of IEDs; (iv) preventing the proliferation of nuclear-related material and expertise; (v) issuing visas in a timely manner for U.S. visitors engaged in counterterrorism efforts and assistance programs in Pakistan; and (vi) providing humanitarian organizations access to detainees, internally displaced persons, and other Pakistani civilians affected by the conflict. Section 7046(c)(B) authorizes the Secretary of State to waive the above certification requirement if it is in U.S. national security interests. Section 7046(c)(2) (Assistance to Pakistan) states that  FMF funds can only be used to support counterterrorism and counterinsurgency capabilities in Pakistan and subject to Sec. 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961; Economic Support Fund (ESF) should be made available to interdict precursor materials from Pakistan to Afghanistan used to make IEDs, including calcium ammonium nitrates; to support programs to train border and customs officials in Pakistan and Afghanistan; and for agricultural extension programs that encourage alternative fertilizer use among Pakistani farmers; Of ESF funds for Pakistan, $10.0 million shall be made available through the Department of State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor for human rights and democracy programs in Pakistan, including training of government officials and security forces, and assistance for human rights organizations and the development of democratic political parties; ESF may be made available to the Chief of Mission Fund in Pakistan as authorized by P.L. 111-73 Sec. 101(c)(5). ESF for infrastructure projects must be implemented consistent with implemented in a manner consistent with workers' rights and eliminating the worst forms of child labor laws. Funds may be made available for Pakistan under Titles III \u2013 VI of this act if in accordance with the above conditions and Sec. 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Section 7046(c)(3)(A) (Reports) (i) states that the Secretary of State must submit a report to the congressional appropriations committees on the spend plan required by Section 7078 of this act within six months after submission of the spend plan and every six months thereafter until September 30, 2013. The plan shall include achievable and sustainable goals, benchmarks for measuring progress, and expected results regarding further development in Pakistan, countering extremism, and establishing conditions conducive to the rule of law and transparent and accountable governance. The report shall include the status of achieving the goals and benchmarks provided in the spend plan. (ii) urges the Secretary of State to suspend assistance for the government of Pakistan if any report required by (A)(i) indicates that Pakistan is failing to make measurable progress in meeting the stated goals or benchmarks. (B) requires the Secretary of State within 90 days after enactment of this act to submit a report to the congressional appropriations committees with an assessment on costs and objectives regarding U.S.-supported infrastructure projects in Pakistan. Section 7078 (b) (Spend Plans) requires the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to submit to House and Senate Appropriations Committees a spend plan for assistance to Pakistan, among other countries.  Title VIII (Overseas Contingency Operations) requires the Secretary of State to report in writing within 30 days after enactment of this act and each fiscal quarter thereafter to the Committees on Appropriation regarding the uses of PCCF on a project-by-project basis. Section 2121(b) states that ESF appropriated or otherwise made available by this division for assistance for Afghanistan and Pakistan may not be made available for direct government-to-government assistance unless the Secretary of State certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that the relevant implementing agency has been assessed and considered qualified to manage such funds; that the government of the recipient country has agreed, in writing, to clear and achievable goals and objectives for the use of such funds; and that there are mechanisms within each implementing agency to ensure that such funds are used for the purposes for which they were intended. Section 1220 amends P.L. 111-84 (see below) and requires that assistance provided to the security forces of Pakistan from the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund (PCF) after FY2010 shall be provided in a manner that promotes \"observance of and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\" and \"respect for legitimate civilian authority within Pakistan.\" Section 1005 stipulates that FMF and the PCCF appropriated in this and prior acts shall be made available in a manner that promotes unimpeded access by humanitarian organizations to detainees, internally displaced persons, and other Pakistani civilians adversely affected by the conflict; and in accordance with Section 620J of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (popularly cited as the Leahy Amendment, relating to human rights standards as a requirement for aid to security forces), the Secretary of State shall inform relevant Pakistani authorities of the requirements of Section 620J, and regularly monitor units of Pakistani security forces that receive United States assistance and their treatment of human rights matters. Title III states that ESF funds appropriated under this heading that are made available for assistance for infrastructure projects in Pakistan shall be implemented in a manner consistent with workers' rights and eliminating the worst forms of child labor laws. Of the funds appropriated under this heading for assistance for Afghanistan and Pakistan,  assistance may be provided for cross border stabilization and development programs between Afghanistan and Pakistan; funds appropriated by this act for assistance for Afghanistan and Pakistan may be made available for government-to-government assistance only if the Secretary of State certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that the U.S. government and the government of the recipient country have agreed, in writing, to clear and achievable goals and objectives for the use of such funds, and have established mechanisms within each implementing agency to ensure that such funds are used for the purposes for which they were intended; any such cash transfer assistance shall be subject to prior consultation with the Committees on Appropriations; the Secretary of State should suspend any such cash transfer assistance to an implementing agency if the Secretary has credible evidence of misuse of such funds by any such agency; any decision to significantly modify the scope, objectives, or implementation mechanisms of United States assistance programs in Afghanistan or Pakistan shall be subject to prior consultation with, and the regular notification procedures of, the Committees on Appropriations, except that the prior consultation requirement may be waived if it is determined that failure to do so would pose a substantial risk to human health or welfare; in case of any such waiver, notification to the Committees on Appropriations shall be provided as early as practicable, but in no event later than three days after taking the action to which such consultation requirement was applicable; and of the funds made available under this heading for assistance for Pakistan, $2 million shall be transferred to, and merged with, funds available under the heading \"Administration of Foreign Affairs, Office of Inspector General\" for oversight of programs in Pakistan. Section 1015 prohibits the use of Department of Defense counternarcotics assistance funds to construct any proposed Border Coordination Center in Pakistan. The Secretary of Defense may waive this for vital U.S. national security interests. Section 1224 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit quarterly reports to Congress summarizing on a project-by-project basis any transfer of funds from the PCF during each fiscal quarter. Section 1225 (22 U.S.C. 2785 note) requires the Secretary of Defense to establish and carry out a program to provide for the registration and end-use monitoring of defense articles and defense services transferred to Pakistan, and prohibits transfer of defense articles or defense services to Pakistan until the Secretary certifies to Congress that such program has been established. Section 102(b)(1)(B)(i) limits economic assistance to $750 million per year unless the President's Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan certifies that assistance to Pakistan is making reasonable progress in achieving the principal U.S. aid objectives as stated in the Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report with reasons justifying the certification. The Secretary of State may waive the limitations if it is in the national security interest of the United States to do so. Section 203 (U.S.C. 8423) limits all security-related assistance and arms transfers to Pakistan during FY2011-FY2014 unless the Secretary of State annually certifies and reports to the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Oversight and Government Reform, and Select Committees on Intelligence that  the Pakistani government is continuing to cooperate with the United States in efforts to dismantle supplier networks relating to the acquisition of nuclear weapons-related materials, such as providing relevant information from or direct access to Pakistani nationals associated with such networks; the Pakistani government has during the preceding fiscal year demonstrated a sustained commitment to and is making significant efforts towards combating terrorist groups including taking into account the extent to which the government of Pakistan has made progress on matters such as (1) ceasing support, including by any elements within the Pakistan military or its intelligence agency, to extremist and terrorist groups, particularly to any group that has conducted attacks against U.S. or coalition forces in Afghanistan, or against the territory or people of neighboring countries; (2) preventing al Qaeda, the Taliban and associated terrorist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, from operating in the territory of Pakistan, including carrying out cross-border attacks into neighboring countries, closing terrorist camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, dismantling terrorist bases of operations in other parts of the country, including Quetta and Muridke, and taking action when provided with intelligence about high-level terrorist targets; and (3) strengthening counterterrorism and anti-money laundering laws; the security forces of Pakistan are not materially and substantially subverting the political or judicial processes of Pakistan. Furthermore, none of the security-related aid for FY2010 through FY2014 or any funds appropriated to the PCCF may be used toward the purchase of F-16 combat aircraft and related munitions and logistics, with the exception of basing construction at Pakistan's Shabaz air base. The Secretary may waive this certification requirement if s/he determines that \"it is important to the national security interests of the United States to do so.\" Title IV stipulates that funds appropriated for FMF to Pakistan \"may be made available only for border security, counterterrorism, and law enforcement activities directed against Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated terrorist groups.\" Section 706 (22 U.S.C. 2291j-l) authorizes withholding aid to countries identified by the President as \"major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries\" if the country is not adhering to international agreements and is not making substantial efforts to meet certain counternarcotics measures. This restriction can be waived if the President reports annually to Congress that  providing such assistance is vital to the national interests of the United States; or that Pakistan has made substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and to take the counternarcotics measures set forth in Section 489(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Section 490 (Annual Certification Procedures, U.S.C. 2291j) requires the President to certify annually that in the previous year a country earlier identified as an illicit drug-producing or drug transit country has fully cooperated with the United States or taken steps on its own to achieve full compliance with the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances, or that it is of vital U.S. national interests for a country to receive U.S. bilateral economic assistance or for the United States to vote for multilateral development bank assistance for that country. Section 620E (Assistance to Pakistan, U.S.C. 2375) authorizes security assistance to Pakistan to help Pakistan deal with the threat of the Soviet Union presence in Afghanistan. Military assistance is prohibited, however, unless the President certifies in writing to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device and that the military assistance will reduce significantly the risk that Pakistan will possess a nuclear device. Some Members of the 113 th Congress have concerns about providing billions of dollars of annual aid to a country that appears unwilling or unable to act as a reliable U.S. partner. Numerous legislative proposals before the 113 th Congress go beyond current law. In order of most recent congressional action, following are pending measures proposed to restrict future aid to Pakistan: H.R. 2397 was introduced in the House on June 17, 2013. The House Committee on Appropriations reported an original measure ( H.Rept. 113-113 ) that same day. House floor action left it as unfinished business on July 24, 2013.  Section 9014 of this Defense appropriation bill would prohibit any FY2014 Coalition Support Fund payments to Pakistan unless the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, certifies that Pakistan is  cooperating with U.S. counterterrorism efforts against the Haqqanni Network, the Quetta Shura Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Al Qaeda, and other domestic and foreign terrorist organization, including ending support and preventing them from being based and operating in Pakistan and carrying out cross-border attacks; not supporting terrorist activities against the United States or coalition forces in Afghanistan, and Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies are not intervening in the political and judicial processes in Pakistan; dismantling IED networks ad interdicting precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of IEDs; preventing the proliferation of nuclear-related material and expertise; implementing policies to protect judicial independence and due process of law; issuing visas in a timely manner for U.S. visitors engaged in counterterrorism efforts and aid programs in Pakistan; providing humanitarian organizations access to detainees, internally displaced persons, and other Pakistani civilians affected by the conflict. The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, may waive the previous restrictions on a case-by-case basis by certifying in writing to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and the Senate that it is in the national security interest to do so. The Secretaries must report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the justification for the waiver and the specific points listed above that the Government of Pakistan were unable to meet. H.R. 1960 was introduced on May 14, 2013. It was amended and reported by the Committee on Armed Services on June 7, 2013 ( H.Rept. 113-102 and H.Rept. 113-102 , Part II). The House passed the measure (315-108) on June 14, 2013. The Senate received the measure on July 8, 2013. No further action has occurred to date.  Sec. 1211of the act would provide a one-year extension of Coalition Support Fund (CSF) reimbursements for Pakistan and limits such reimbursement to $1.5 billion in FY2014. These reimbursements would be prohibited pending certification to congressional defense committees that Pakistan is maintaining security and is not limiting movement of U.S. equipment and supplies along the Ground Lines of Communications (GLOCs) through Pakistan to Afghanistan; taking demonstrable steps to support counterterrorism efforts against al Qaeda, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, and other militant extremist groups such as the Haqqani Network and the Quetta Shura Taliban in Pakistan; disrupt cross-border attacks against U.S., coalition, and Afghanistan security forces located in Afghanistan by certain groups including the Haqqani Network and Quetta Shura Taliban from bases in Pakistan; counter the threat of IEDs; conduct cross-border coordination and communication with Afghan security forces and U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan. not using military or any funds or equipment provided by the United States to persecute minority groups, including Baloch, Sindhi, and Hazara ethnic groups and minority religious groups, including Christian, Hindu, and Ahmadi Muslim. The Secretary of Defense may waive the limitation of reimbursements if the Secretary certifies to congressional defense committees in writing that such waiver is in U.S. national security interests and provides justification for the waiver. H.R. 1922 , referred to as the Foreign Assistance under Limitation and Transparency Act (FAULT Act), was introduced May 9, 2013, and referred to the House Foreign Affairs and Rules Committees. No further action has occurred to date. Sec. 2 finds that Iran, North Korea, Syria, Egypt, and Pakistan have engaged in activities that undermine the security and foreign policy objectives of the United States or compromise regional and international stability. Sec. 101 would prohibit U.S. government funding for foreign assistance to Iran, North Korea, Syria, Egypt, and Pakistan except for up to $50 million in any one fiscal year for agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices. The limitation may not be waived unless the President submits a report certifying and identifying specified fundamental changes in the policies of the country in question to the appropriate congressional committees at least 45 days before the proposed waiver would take effect. Congress, however, may enact a joint resolution to prohibit the waiver. The President also may waive the foreign assistance limitations for humanitarian purposes for up to $50 million and 120 days in any fiscal year, and may renew the humanitarian waiver for an additional 90 days by submitting a comprehensive status report to the appropriate congressional committees. Sec. 201(b) requires the President to terminate the designation of Pakistan as a major non-NATO ally and may not reissue a separate designation as a major non-NATO ally. The designation is to be effective upon the enactment of this act and end when the Secretary of State certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the government of Pakistan has drafted a new constitution and scheduled a date for national democratic elections to elect a new government under the new constitution. H.R. 5857 was introduced on May 25, 2012, and approved by the House Appropriations Committee on the same day. This bill to fund the State Department and foreign operations for FY2013, contains provisions that would provide no funding for PCCF; withhold all funds appropriated for Pakistan under ESF, INCLE, FMF, and PCCF unless the Secretary of State certifies that Pakistan is (1) cooperating with the United States in counterterrorism efforts against the Haqqani Network, the Quetta Shura Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Al Qaeda, and other domestic and foreign terrorist organizations; (2) not supporting terrorist activities against United States or coalition forces in Afghanistan, and Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies are not intervening extra-judicially into political and judicial processes in Pakistan; (3) dismantling IED networks; (4) preventing nuclear-related proliferation; (5) issuing visa in a timely manner for official U.S. visitors; and (6) providing humanitarian organizations access to detainees, internally displaced persons, and other Pakistani civilians affected by the conflict (Sec. 7046(c)(1)) (unlike S. 3241 , this provision does not include a national security waiver); require the Secretary of State to submit to Congress a spend plan for assistance to Pakistan to include achievable and sustainable goals, benchmarks for measuring progress, and expected results regarding furthering development in Pakistan, countering extremism, and establishing conditions conducive to the rule of law and transparent and accountable governance; report biannually on the status of achieving that plan's goals and benchmarks; and recommend that the Secretary suspend all assistance to Pakistan if this report finds Pakistan is failing to make measureable progress toward stated goals and benchmarks (Sec. 7046(b)(3)); allow ESF funds, notwithstanding any other provision of law, for cross border stabilization and development programs between Afghanistan and Pakistan or between either country and the central Asian republics (Sec. 7046(c)). allow INCLE and FMF funds to be transferred to PCCF and remain available until September 30, 2014, as long as the Secretary of State notifies Congress 15 days before such action and specifies source of funds and implementation plan. Obligation of such funds are subject to Sec. 7046(b) of this act. S. 3241 was introduced May 24, 2012. The full Senate appropriations committee approved it the same day.
