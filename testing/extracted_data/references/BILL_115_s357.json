EXCHANGE OF LAND; EQUALIZATION OF VALUE.\n\n    (a) Exchange Authorized.--Notwithstanding the land use planning \nrequirements of sections 202, 210, and 211 of the Federal Land Policy \nand Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1712, 1720-21), subject to valid \nexisting rights, and conditioned upon any equalization payment \nnecessary under section 206(b) of the Federal Land Policy and \nManagement Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(b)), and subsection (b) of this \nAct, as soon as practicable, but not later than 2 years after the date \nof enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall--\n            (1) quitclaim to the conservation district all right, \n        title, and interest of the United States in and to the public \n        land, and any such portion of the public exchange parcel as may \n        be required to equalize the values of the lands exchanged; and\n            (2) accept from the conservation district a conveyance of \n        all right, title, and interest of the conservation district in \n        and to the exchange land, and any such portion of the non-\n        public exchange parcel as may be required to equalize the \n        values of the lands exchanged.\n    (b) Equalization Payment.--To the extent an equalization payment is \nnecessary under section 206(b) of the Federal Land Policy and \nManagement Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716), the amount of such \nequalization payment shall first be made by way of in-kind transfer of \nsuch portion of the public exchange parcel to the conservation \ndistrict, or transfer of such portion of the non-public exchange parcel \nto the United States, as the case may be, as may be necessary to \nequalize the fair market values of the exchanged properties, as such \nvalues are indicated by the appraisal provided for under the Federal \nLand Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716). Such appraisal \nshall include an appraisal of the public exchange parcel and the non-\npublic exchange parcel. The fair market value of the public exchange \nparcel or non-public exchange parcel, as the case may be, shall be \ncredited against any required equalization payment. To the extent such \ncredit is not sufficient to offset the entire amount of equalization \npayment so indicated, any remaining amount of equalization payment \nshall be treated as follows:\n            (1) If the equalization payment is to equalize values by \n        which the public land exceeds the exchange land and the \n        credited value of the non-public exchange parcel, conservation \n        district may make the equalization payment to the United \n        States, notwithstanding any limitation regarding the amount of \n        the equalization payment under section 206(b) of the Federal \n        Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716). In the \n        event conservation district opts not to make the indicated \n        equalization payment, the exchange shall not proceed.\n            (2) If the equalization payment is to equalize values by \n        which the exchange land exceeds the public land and the \n        credited value of the public exchange parcel, the Secretary \n        shall order the exchange without requirement of any additional \n        equalization payment by the United States to the conservation \n        district.\n    (c) Map and Legal Descriptions.--As soon as practicable after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall finalize a map \nand legal descriptions of all land to be conveyed under this Act. The \nSecretary may correct any minor errors in the map or in the legal \ndescriptions.

CANCELLATION OF SECRETARIAL ORDER 241.\n\n    Secretarial Order 241, dated November 11, 1929 (withdrawing a \nportion of the public land for an unconstructed transmission line), is \nterminated and the withdrawal thereby effected is revoked."
