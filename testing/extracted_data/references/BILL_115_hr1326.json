EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION TO IMPLEMENT STUDY.\n\n    (a) Qualifying Legislation Defined.--In this section, the term \n``qualifying legislation'' means a bill or joint resolution of the \nHouse of Representatives or the Senate--\n            (1) that is introduced by the Chairman or ranking member of \n        the Committee on Armed Services of the House of \n        Representatives, the Chairman or ranking member of the \n        Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, the Majority Leader \n        of the House of Representatives, the Minority Leader of the \n        House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, or \n        the Minority Leader of the Senate;\n            (2) the title of which is as follows: ``To implement cost \n        savings in the Department of Defense as identified by the \n        Defense Business Board.''; and\n            (3) consists solely of the following provisions:\n                    (A) Provisions that allow for a short title, \n                findings, or other text that does not affect the \n                authority or responsibility of the President or a \n                department or agency of the Federal Government.\n                    (B) Provisions that implement not less than 80 \n                percent of the cost savings in the Department of \n                Defense as identified by the Defense Business Board in \n                the study titled ``Transforming Department of Defense's \n                Core Business Processes for Revolutionary Change'' and \n                submitted to Congress pursuant to section 2.\n    (b) Consideration.--\n            (1) Committee referral.--Qualifying legislation that is \n        introduced in the House of Representatives shall be referred to \n        the Committee on Armed Services of the House of \n        Representatives. Qualifying legislation introduced in the \n        Senate shall be referred to the Committee on Armed Services of \n        the Senate.\n            (2) Reporting and discharge.--If the committee to which \n        qualifying legislation is referred has not reported the \n        qualifying legislation within 10 session days after the date of \n        referral of the legislation, the committee shall be discharged \n        from further consideration of the legislation, and the \n        qualifying legislation shall be placed on the appropriate \n        calendar of the House involved.\n            (3) Consideration.--On or after the third day after the \n        date on which the committee to which qualifying legislation is \n        referred has reported, or has been discharged under paragraph \n        (2) from further consideration of, such legislation, it is in \n        order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has \n        been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to \n        move to proceed to the consideration of the qualifying \n        legislation. A Member may make the motion only on the day after \n        the calendar day on which the Member announces to the House \n        concerned the Member's intention to make the motion, except \n        that, in the case of the House of Representatives, the motion \n        may be made without such prior announcement if the motion is \n        made by direction of the committee to which the qualifying \n        legislation was referred. All points of order against the \n        qualifying legislation (and against consideration of the \n        qualifying legislation) are waived. The motion is highly \n        privileged in the House of Representatives and is privileged in \n        the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to \n        amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n        proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n        reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n        disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to \n        the consideration of the qualifying legislation is agreed to, \n        the respective House shall immediately proceed to consideration \n        of the qualifying legislation without intervening motion, \n        order, or other business, and the qualifying legislation shall \n        remain the unfinished business of the respective House until \n        disposed of.\n            (4) Debate.--Debate on qualifying legislation, and on all \n        debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be \n        limited to not more than 20 hours, which shall be divided \n        equally between, and controlled by, the Majority Leader and the \n        Minority Leader or their designees. A motion to further limit \n        debate is in order and not debatable. The only amendments to \n        the qualifying legislation that are in order are amendments \n        that seek to ensure the qualifying legislation meets the \n        criteria under subsection (a)(3). A motion to postpone, or a \n        motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a \n        motion to recommit the qualifying legislation is not in order. \n        A motion to reconsider the vote by which the qualifying \n        legislation is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n            (5) Vote on passage.--Immediately following the conclusion \n        of the debate on the qualifying legislation and a single quorum \n        call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance \n        with the rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final \n        passage of the qualifying legislation shall occur.\n            (6) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n        decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules \n        of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may \n        be, to the procedure relating to qualifying legislation shall \n        be decided without debate.\n    (c) Consideration by Other House.--\n            (1) In general.--If, before the passage by one House of \n        qualifying legislation of that House, that House receives from \n        the other House qualifying legislation, then the following \n        procedures shall apply:\n                    (A) The qualifying legislation of the other House \n                shall not be referred to a committee and may not be \n                considered in the House receiving it except in the case \n                of final passage as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii).\n                    (B) With respect to any qualifying legislation of \n                the House receiving the qualifying legislation--\n                            (i) the procedure in that House shall be \n                        the same as if no qualifying legislation had \n                        been received from the other House; but\n                            (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on \n                        the qualifying legislation of the other House.\n            (2) Disposition.--Upon disposition of the qualifying \n        legislation received from the other House, it shall no longer \n        be in order to consider the qualifying legislation that \n        originated in the receiving House.\n    (d) Rules of the Senate and House of Representatives.--This section \nis enacted by Congress--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n        and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such is \n        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in \n        that House in the case of qualifying legislation described in \n        subsection (a)(1), and supersedes other rules only to the \n        extent that this section is inconsistent with such rules; and\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n        House."
