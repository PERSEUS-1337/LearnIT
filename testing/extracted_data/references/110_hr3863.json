    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing America's Security through \nStrategic Redeployment from Iraq Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) First Principal Finding.--Ending the war in Iraq is necessary, \nhowever, how the war is ended is of even greater importance for United \nStates national security, the safety of members of the United States \nArmed Forces currently serving in Iraq, and stability in both Iraq and \nthe Middle East.\n    (b) Second Principal Finding.--\n            (1) Open-ended commitment is unsustainable.--An open-ended \n        United States involvement in Iraq is not in the interest of \n        United States national security, and United States military \n        forces must be redeployed or risk becoming severely over-\n        strained.\n            (2) Supporting facts.--\n                    (A) Currently, 40 percent of all United States Army \n                equipment is in Iraq.\n                    (B) There is no Army unit currently in the United \n                States in a state of readiness that would permit the \n                unit to deploy anywhere another contingency might occur \n                in the world.\n    (c) Third Principal Finding.--\n            (1) Lengthy redeployment process.--Redeployment from Iraq \n        will be a lengthy process.\n            (2) Supporting facts.--\n                    (A) Redeploying approximately 160,000 troops and \n                50,000 civilian contractors from Iraq and closing bases \n                are logistically challenging, especially during \n                conflict.\n                    (B) The critical consideration is the closure or \n                turnover of the sixty-five Forward Operating Bases held \n                by the United States Armed Forces in Iraq.\n                    (C) It takes on average 100 days to close just one \n                Forward Operating Base, and any decision regarding the \n                number of Forward Operating Bases to close at one time \n                depends on surrounding strife and the fact that \n                receiving facilities in Kuwait to prepare military \n                vehicles for shipment to the United States or elsewhere \n                can handle only 2 to 2\\1/2\\ brigade combat teams at a \n                time and there are currently 40 brigade combat teams or \n                their equivalent in Iraq.\n                    (D) Redeployment is the most vulnerable of military \n                operations, particularly in this case because \n                redeployment will rely on a single road, leading from \n                Iraq to Kuwait.\n                    (E) For comparison purposes, the removal of 6,300 \n                members of the Armed Forces from Somalia in 1993 took \n                six months and actually required the deployment of \n                another 19,000 troops to protect their withdrawal.\n                    (F) In view of the logistical challenges, it will \n                take at least a year, more likely 15 to 20 months to \n                complete redeployment of United States forces from \n                Iraq.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) First Declaration of Policy.--\n            (1) Need for comprehensive regional security plan.--\n        Congress declares that it is critical that a comprehensive \n        security plan is developed for Iraq and the region that accepts \n        the necessity for a deliberate redeployment of United States \n        forces from Iraq.\n            (2) Supporting details.--\n                    (A) A comprehensive security plan is necessary for \n                both the safety of United States forces in Iraq and the \n                overall national security of the United States.\n                    (B) Redeployment would allow large numbers of \n                members of the United States Armed Forces to return to \n                the United States, while some forces could be deployed \n                to areas, such as Afghanistan, where terrorists pose a \n                threat to the national security of the United States or \n                could remain at existing bases in Kuwait, Bahrain, the \n                United Arab Emirates, or Qatar and on aircraft carrier \n                and amphibious groups, to protect United States \n                interests in the region.\n    (b) Second Declaration of Policy.--\n            (1) Iraqi assumption of responsibility.--Congress declares \n        that a planned end to United States involvement in Iraq will \n        serve to force Iraqi leaders to assume responsibility for the \n        security and governance of their country while providing Iran \n        and Syria the incentive to prevent violence otherwise caused by \n        the redeployment of United States forces.\n            (2) Supporting details.--\n                    (A) The United States intelligence community has \n                found that Iran and Syria, currently involved \n                destructively in the fighting in Iraq want stability in \n                Iraq following redeployment, and can play a \n                constructive role in improving security and stability \n                in Iraq.\n                    (B) Because the redeployment of United States may \n                take up to 20 months, there is an opportunity for a \n                strategic approach to work diplomatically for political \n                accommodation in Iraq with Iran and Syria (as well as \n                Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region) during \n                that timeframe.\n    (c) Third Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that while a \n``date certain'' deadline for the redeployment of United States forces \ncould force Iraqi leaders to assume responsibility and provide Iran and \nSyria the incentive to prevent violence that could result from the \nredeployment, a ``goal'' for the redeployment's end instead of a ``date \ncertain'' is a necessary compromise in order to ensure a strategic \napproach for United States security and create a greater level of Iraqi \nstability in the aftermath of the redeployment.\n\nSEC. 4. REDEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Redeployment Required.--\n            (1) Requirement.--Redeployment of United States Armed \n        Forces serving in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom shall \n        begin within three months after the date of the enactment of \n        this Act.
