NATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY AND RESILIENCE PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Commerce shall establish a \nNational Climate Change Vulnerability and Resilience Program (in this \nsection referred to as the ``Program'') for evaluating and making \nrecommendations with respect to local, regional, and national \nvulnerability and resilience to impacts related to both longer term \nclimatic changes and shorter term climatic variations, including \nchanges and variations resulting from human activities.\n    (b) Consultation.--In designing the Program, the Secretary of \nCommerce shall consult with Federal agencies participating in the \nUnited States Global Change Research Program and any other appropriate \nFederal, State, or local agency.\n    (c) Office of Climate Change Vulnerability and Resilience \nResearch.--The Secretary of Commerce shall establish an Office of \nClimate Change Vulnerability and Resilience Research (in this section \nreferred to as the ``Office'') within the Department of Commerce, which \nshall be responsible for managing the Program and shall, in accordance \nwith the design of the Program, coordinate climatic change and climatic \nvariation vulnerability and resilience research in the United States.\n    (d) Vulnerability Assessments.--The Program shall include--\n            (1) evaluations, based on historical data, current \n        observational data, and, where appropriate, available \n        predictions, of local, State, regional, and national \n        vulnerability to phenomena associated with climatic change and \n        climatic variation, including--\n                    (A) severe weather events, such as severe \n                thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;\n                    (B) annual and interannual climate events, such as \n                the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic \n                Oscillation;\n                    (C) changes in sea level and shifts in the \n                hydrological cycle;\n                    (D) natural hazards, including tsunamis, droughts, \n                floods, and wildfires; and\n                    (E) alterations of ecological communities as a \n                result of climatic change and climatic variation; and\n            (2) the production of a Vulnerability Scorecard, in \n        cooperation with State and local institutions including \n        university researchers and programs, that assesses each State's \n        vulnerability and capacity to respond to climatic change and \n        climatic variation hazards.\n    (e) Preparedness Recommendations.--Not later than 2 years after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, the Office shall transmit to the \nCongress a report that--\n            (1) includes the Vulnerability Scorecards produced under \n        subsection (d)(2); and\n            (2) identifies, and recommends implementation and funding \n        strategies for, short-term and long-term actions that may be \n        taken at the local, State, regional, or national level--\n                    (A) to minimize climatic change and climatic \n                variation threats to human life and property;\n                    (B) to minimize negative economic impacts of \n                climatic change and climatic variation; and\n                    (C) to improve resilience to climatic change and \n                climatic variation hazards.\n    (f) Vulnerability Research.--In addition to its other \nresponsibilities under this section, the Office shall--\n            (1) apply the results of available vulnerability research \n        to develop and improve criteria that measure resilience to \n        climatic change and climatic variation hazards at the local, \n        State, regional, and national levels;\n            (2) coordinate the implementation of short-term and long-\n        term research programs based on the recommendations made under \n        subsection (e)(2);\n            (3) measure progress in increasing each State's capacity to \n        respond to climatic change and climatic variation hazards, \n        using the Vulnerability Scorecards produced under subsection \n        (d)(2) as a benchmark; and\n            (4) review not less than annually and, when additional \n        information becomes available making it appropriate, update the \n        Vulnerability Scorecards and the recommendations made under \n        subsection (e)(2).\n    (g) Information and Technology Dissemination.--The Secretary of \nCommerce shall make widely available appropriate information, \ntechnologies, and products to assist local, State, regional, and \nnational efforts to reduce loss of life and property due to climatic \nchange and climatic variation, and shall coordinate the dissemination \nof such information, technologies, and products through all appropriate \nchannels.\n    (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary of Commerce $10,000,000 for carrying out \nthis section."
