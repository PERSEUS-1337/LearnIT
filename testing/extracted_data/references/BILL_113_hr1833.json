SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Improving the \nJuvenile Justice System for Girls Act of 2013''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The proportion of girls entering the justice system has \n        increased steadily over the past several decades, rising from \n        20 percent in 1980 to 30 percent in 2009. Most of these girls, \n        up to 73 percent, have histories of physical and sexual \n        violence, and their entry into the criminal and juvenile \n        justice system is linked to their sexual and physical \n        victimization.\n            (2) Girls' pathways into juvenile justice involvement are \n        distinct from boys' pathways. Girls account for a much larger \n        proportion of nonviolent status offenders than delinquency \n        offenders (40 percent compared to 14 percent, respectively).\n            (3) A study by the Oregon Social Learning Center found the \n        average reported age of first sexual encounter for girls in \n        juvenile justice is 6.75.\n            (4) The trauma of untreated physical and sexual abuse \n        results in lifetime consequences for girls. These consequences \n        include a higher risk for a number of negative social and \n        health outcomes such as higher mortality rates, a variety of \n        psychiatric problems, dysfunctional and violent relationships, \n        poor educational achievement, less stable work histories, \n        increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases and early \n        pregnancy, substance abuse or addiction, and increased reliance \n        on social services as compared to non-delinquent girls.\n            (5) A growing body of evidence suggests that girls who \n        enter the juvenile justice system have equal if not higher \n        rates of mental health issues than boys who enter the system.\n            (6) Current research and data have shown that gender-\n        responsive, strength-based programming providing trauma-\n        informed care and trauma-specific services is the most \n        effective means of preventing juvenile offenses and reducing \n        recidivism.\n\nSEC. 2. INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR LOCAL DELINQUENCY PREVENTION PROGRAMS.\n\n    The second title V of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act of 1974 (relating to Incentive Grants for Local \nDelinquency Prevention Programs, as added by Public Law 102-586 and \namended by Public Law 107-273) is amended--\n            (1) by amending section 502 (42 U.S.C. 5781) to read as \n        follows:\n\n``SEC. 502.
