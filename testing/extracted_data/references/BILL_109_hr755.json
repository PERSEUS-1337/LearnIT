No \n        enforcement action may be taken against such contractor for any \n        violation of Nuclear Regulatory Commission decommissioning \n        requirements, if such violation is the result of a failure of \n        the Department to authorize or fund decommissioning activities. \n        The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department shall, not \n        later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, \n        enter into a memorandum of understanding establishing \n        decommissioning procedures and requirements for nonmilitary \n        energy laboratories owned or operated by the Department.\n            (4) Accelerators.--Notwithstanding the provisions of the \n        Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et. seq.), effective \n        2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Nuclear \n        Regulatory Commission shall have exclusive regulatory authority \n        over accelerators, other electronic sources of radiation not \n        assigned to the Commission as of the date of enactment of this \n        Act, accelerator-produced radioisotopes, and naturally \n        occurring radioactive materials at nonmilitary energy \n        laboratories, consistent with the authorities granted the \n        Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. \n        Until such time as the Commission has completed a rulemaking \n        for the foregoing equipment and radioisotopes, nonmilitary \n        energy laboratories shall be required to meet the requirements \n        stipulated in a license for the facility.\n            (5) Administration.--The responsibilities assumed by the \n        Nuclear Regulatory Commission under this subsection shall be \n        administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, not by \n        States.\n            (6) Judicial review.--Section 189 b. of the Atomic Energy \n        Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2239(b)) is amended by adding the \n        following paragraph after paragraph (4):\n            ``(5) Any final order or regulation of the Commission \n        establishing standards to govern nonmilitary energy \n        laboratories owned or operated by the Department of Energy that \n        is issued to implement the Commission's responsibilities under \n        the Act which enacted this paragraph, and any final \n        determination of the Commission relating to whether a \n        nonmilitary energy laboratory owned or operated by the \n        Department is in compliance with such standards and all \n        applicable Commission regulations or orders.''.\n            (7) Employee protection.--Any Department contractor \n        operating a nonmilitary energy laboratory that is regulated by \n        the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under this section shall be \n        subject to section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 \n        (42 U.S.C. 5851) to the same extent as any other employer \n        subject to such section 211.\n            (8) Conflict of interest.--Section 170A of the Atomic \n        Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210a) applies to contracts, \n        agreements, or other arrangements of the Nuclear Regulatory \n        Commission proposed or entered into pursuant to its \n        responsibilities assumed under this subsection.\n    (c) Occupational Safety and Health.--\n            (1) OSHA jurisdiction.--Notwithstanding section 4(b)(1) of \n        the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. \n        653(b)(1)), effective 2 years after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n        shall assume the exclusive regulatory and enforcement \n        responsibilities of the Department relating to matters covered \n        by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 with regard \n        to all nonmilitary energy laboratories owned or operated by the \n        Department, except as provided in paragraph (2).
