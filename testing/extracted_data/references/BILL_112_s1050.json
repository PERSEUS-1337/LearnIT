FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution \n        states ``The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n        houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \n        seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, \n        but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and \n        particularly describing the place to be searched, and the \n        persons or things to be seized.''.\n            (2) Prior to the American Revolution, American colonists \n        objected to the issuance of writs of assistance, which were \n        general warrants that did not specify either the place or goods \n        to be searched.\n            (3) Writs of assistance played an important role in the \n        events that led to the American Revolution.\n            (4) The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution \n        was intended to protect against the issuance of general \n        warrants, and to guarantee that only judges, not soldiers or \n        police officers, are able to issue warrants.\n            (5) Various provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law \n        107-56; 115 Stat. 272) expressly violate the original intent of \n        the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON ROVING WIRETAPS.\n\n    Section 105(c) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n(50 U.S.C. 1805(c)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking subparagraphs (A) and (B) \n        and inserting the following:\n            ``(A)(i) the identity of the target of the electronic \n        surveillance, if known; or\n            ``(ii) if the identity of the target is not known, a \n        description of the specific target and the nature and location \n        of the facilities and places at which the electronic \n        surveillance will be directed;\n            ``(B)(i) the nature and location of each of the facilities \n        or places at which the electronic surveillance will be \n        directed, if known; or\n            ``(ii) if any of the facilities or places are not known, \n        the identity of the target;''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (2)--\n                    (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (B) through (D) \n                as subparagraphs (C) through (E), respectively; and\n                    (B) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the \n                following:\n                    ``(B) in cases where the facility or place at which \n                the electronic surveillance will be directed is not \n                known at the time the order is issued, that the \n                electronic surveillance be conducted only for such time \n                as it is reasonable to presume that the target of the \n                surveillance is or was reasonably proximate to the \n                particular facility or place;''.\n\nSEC. 4.
