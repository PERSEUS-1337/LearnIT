FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the microloan demonstration program of the Small \n        Business Administration, established under section 7(m) of the \n        Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(m)), has been a successful \n        method of assisting women, low-income and minority \n        entrepreneurs and business owners, and others by providing \n        access to small-scale loans and technical assistance, which \n        enables these individuals to operate successful business \n        concerns;\n            (2) some welfare recipients who become borrowers under the \n        microloan demonstration program have been able to eliminate \n        their dependence on welfare and operate successful business \n        concerns as a result of assistance received through the \n        microloan demonstration program;\n            (3) welfare recipients who become borrowers under the \n        microloan demonstration program often require more intensive \n        management, marketing, and technical assistance than other \n        borrowers under that program; and\n            (4) the lack of affordable or available child care and \n        transportation is often a barrier to individuals wishing to \n        eliminate their dependence on welfare and establish a small \n        business.\n\nSEC. 103.
