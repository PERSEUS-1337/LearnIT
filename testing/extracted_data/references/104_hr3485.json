    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Colville National Forest Adaptive \nManagement of Timber Resources Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Forest vegetation on Federal lands in the intermountain \n        West, including eastern Washington and particularly the \n        Colville National Forest in the State of Washington, is in an \n        extremely overstocked condition due to fire exclusion and \n        nonmanagement, resulting in unhealthy, low-vigor stands that \n        are susceptible to disease, insects, and fire.\n            (2) The value of this forest vegetation far exceeds the \n        cost of managing these stands for a healthy, productive \n        ecosystem, but the current regulatory structure of overlapping \n        directives and planning documents hinders management of this \n        forest vegetation in a manner necessary to achieve, \n        simultaneously, healthy and productive ecosystems and community \n        benefits.\n            (3) The current regulatory structure and overall policy \n        direction further hinder the flexibility of the Forest Service \n        to plan and prepare projects that effectively consider local \n        conditions and opportunities or capture market opportunities.\n            (4) Federal budgetary limitations have reduced the trained \n        and experienced Forest Service workforce below the level \n        necessary to plan for and maintain healthy and productive \n        ecosystems. At the same time the Forest Service is forced to \n        spend a disproportionate amount of its resources on planning, \n        with insufficient resources remaining to implement \n        scientifically acceptable forest management activities.\n            (5) Implementation of adaptive management techniques in \n        selected areas of the Colville National Forest will provide a \n        healthy ecosystem, provide for long-term national fiber needs, \n        generate funds in excess of costs, and stimulate the economies \n        of local, resource-dependent communities.\n            (6) The scientific knowledge gained from projects conducted \n        using the adaptive management techniques required under this \n        Act will benefit similar forest stands throughout the \n        intermountain West.\n            (7) The economic knowledge gained from such projects will \n        benefit management projects in all timber stands.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To combat the adverse human and environmental \n        consequences of catastrophic wildfire, including immediate-term \n        loss of life, vegetation, soil, water, and nearby land use, and \n        long-term loss of land productivity and continuous resource \n        flow.\n            (2) To use a creditable, science-based, adaptive management \n        approach to manage fire-generated, overstocked, small-diameter, \n        stagnated forest stands to improve forest health, meet current \n        and future environmental needs, and provide wood fiber for \n        processing in dependent communities.\n            (3) To demonstrate the cost-effective use of private \n        contractors to perform substantive planning and plan \n        implementation tasks for the Forest Service.\n\nSEC. 4. PREPARATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION OF ADAPTIVE FOREST \n              MANAGEMENT IN COLVILLE NATIONAL FOREST.\n\n    (a) Adaptive Management Research Plan Required.--Not later than 1 \nyear after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \nAgriculture shall prepare and submit to Congress a research plan, \nincluding supporting environmental documents, that provides for the \nimplementation and evaluation of controlled silvicultural treatment in \nfire-generated, overstocked, small-diameter, stagnated forest stands in \ndesignated areas of the Colville National Forest in the State of \nWashington for the purpose of testing the effect of adaptive management \ntechniques in the treatment of such forest stands.\n    (b) Areas Covered by Plan.--The research plan prepared under \nsubsection (a) shall apply to the following areas of the Colville \nNational Forest:\n            (1) The approximately 110,000 acres of the Colville \n        National Forest identified as economically suited for adaptive \n        management techniques in the Forest Service study of 1989-1994 \n        regarding creating opportunities.\n            (2) Other lands in the Colville National Forest selected by \n        the Secretary as having characteristics similar to the lands \n        identified in paragraph (1).\n    (c) Implementation of Plan.--The Secretary shall implement the \nresearch plan prepared under subsection (a) not later than the second \nfull field season beginning after the date of the enactment of this \nAct.
