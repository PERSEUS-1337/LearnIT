FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) more than half of all people of the United States, 153 \n        million people, currently live on or near a coast and an \n        additional 12 million are expected in the next decade;\n            (2) coastal counties in the United States average 300 \n        persons per square mile, compared with the national average of \n        98;\n            (3) on a typical day, more than 1,540 permits for \n        construction of single-family homes are issued in coastal \n        counties, combined with other commercial, retail, and \n        institutional construction to support this population;\n            (4) much of the 95,000 miles of United States shoreline \n        does not have current, accurate maps and geospatial \n        information;\n            (5) the lack of current and accurate remote sensing and \n        geospatial data on United States coasts, harbors, and ports \n        results in an environmental, infrastructure, economic, and \n        homeland security vulnerability for the Nation;\n            (6) the Federal Government can and should play an important \n        role in the development and demonstration of innovative remote \n        sensing and other geospatial techniques to improve the \n        management of the coast of the United States, comprehensive \n        emergency preparedness and response in the event of a tsunami, \n        storm surges, and oil spills as well as for homeland security;\n            (7) highly accurate, high resolution remote sensing and \n        other geospatial data, including elevation data, play an \n        important role in management of the coastal zone, including \n        flood prediction capabilities; risk, vulnerability, and hazard \n        assessments; emergency response plans; permitting and zoning \n        decisionmaking; and landscape change detection; as well as port \n        security and other homeland security applications;\n            (8) the full range of applications of remote sensing and \n        other forms of geospatial information to meet national \n        requirements has not been adequately explored or exploited; and\n            (9) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in \n        coordination with other agencies, can play a unique role in \n        demonstrating how commercial remote sensing and other private \n        sector geospatial capabilities can be applied to assist State, \n        local, regional, and tribal agencies in emergency preparedness, \n        emergency response, homeland security, infrastructure \n        management, environmental decisionmaking, and other \n        applications in such areas as agriculture, weather forecasting, \n        and forest management.\n\nSEC. 3.
