PILOT PROGRAM TO PROTECT ANADROMOUS FISH IN THE STANISLAUS \n              RIVER.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Non-Native Predator Fish Removal Program.--The \nCommissioner and districts, in consultation with the National Marine \nFisheries Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the \nCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall jointly develop and \nconduct a pilot non-native predator fish removal program to remove non-\nnative striped bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black bass, and \nother non-native predator fishes from the Stanislaus River. The pilot \nprogram shall--\n            (1) be scientifically based;\n            (2) include methods to quantify the number and size of \n        predator fishes removed each year, the impact of such removal \n        on the overall abundance of predator fishes, and the impact of \n        such removal on the populations of juvenile anadromous fish \n        found in the Stanislaus River by, among other things, \n        evaluating the number of juvenile anadromous fish that migrate \n        past the rotary screw trap located at Caswell;\n            (3) use wire fyke trapping, portable resistance board \n        weirs, and boat electrofishing, which are the most effective \n        predator collection techniques that minimize affects to native \n        anadromous fish;\n            (4) be developed, including the application for all \n        necessary scientific research and species enhancement permits \n        under section 10(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n        (16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)), for the performance of the pilot \n        program, not later than 6 months after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act;\n            (5) be implemented on the first business day of the \n        calendar year following the issuance of all necessary \n        scientific research and species enhancement permits needed to \n        begin the pilot program; and\n            (6) be implemented for a period of five consecutive \n        calendar years.\n    (b) Management.--The management of the pilot program shall be the \njoint responsibility of the Commissioner and the districts. Such \nparties shall work collaboratively to insure the performance of the \npilot program, and shall discuss and agree upon, among other things, \nchanges in the structure, management, personnel, techniques, strategy, \ndata collection, reporting, and conduct of the pilot program.\n    (c) Conduct.--\n            (1) In general.--At the election of the districts, the \n        pilot program may be conducted by their own personnel, \n        qualified private contractors hired by the districts, personnel \n        of, on loan to, or otherwise assigned to the Bureau of \n        Reclamation, or a combination thereof.\n            (2) Participation by bureau of reclamation.--In the event \n        the districts elect to conduct the program using their own \n        personnel or qualified private contractors hired by them, the \n        Commissioner has the option to assign an employee of, on loan \n        to, or otherwise assigned to the Bureau of Reclamation, to be \n        present for all activities performed in the field. Such \n        presence shall insure compliance with the agreed upon elements \n        specified in subsection (b). The districts shall pay 100 \n        percent of the cost of such participation as specified in \n        subsection (d).\n            (3) Timing of election.--The districts shall notify the \n        Commissioner of their election on or before October 15 of each \n        calendar year of the pilot program, which election shall apply \n        to the work performed in the subsequent calendar year.\n    (d) Funding.--\n            (1) Annual funding.--The districts shall be responsible for \n        100 percent of the cost of the pilot program. On or before \n        December 1 of each year of the pilot program, the Commissioner \n        shall submit to the districts an estimate of the cost to be \n        incurred by the Bureau of Reclamation in the following calendar \n        year, if any, including the cost of any data collection and \n        posting under subsection (e). If an amount equal to the \n        estimate is not provided to the reclamation fund identified in \n        section 3 of the Act of February 21, 1911 (43 U.S.C. 525), by \n        the districts on or before December 31 of each year--\n                    (A) the Bureau of Reclamation shall have no \n                obligation to conduct the pilot program activities \n                otherwise scheduled until full payment is made by the \n                districts; and\n                    (B) the districts shall be prohibited from \n                conducting any aspect of the pilot program until full \n                payment is made by the districts.\n            (2) Accounting.--On or before September 1 of each calendar \n        year, the Commissioner shall provide an accounting of the prior \n        calendar year's expenses to the districts.

If the estimate paid by the districts was \n        greater than the actual costs incurred by the Bureau of \n        Reclamation, then a credit shall be provided to the districts, \n        which shall be deducted from the estimate payment the districts \n        must make for the work performed by the Bureau of Reclamation, \n        if any, in the next calendar year.\n    (e) Reporting and Evaluation.--\n            (1) In general.--On or before the 15th day of each month, \n        the Commissioner shall post on the Web site of the Bureau of \n        Reclamation a tabular summary of the raw data collected in the \n        prior month.\n            (2) Report.--On or before June 30 of the calendar year \n        following the completion of the program, the Commissioner and \n        districts shall jointly publish a peer reviewed report that--\n                    (A) discusses the findings and conclusions of the \n                pilot program;\n                    (B) synthesizes the data collected under paragraph \n                (1); and\n                    (C) makes recommendations for further study and \n                action.\n    (f) Permits Process.--\n            (1) Not later than 180 days after filing of an application \n        by the Commissioner and the districts, the Secretary of the \n        Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, or both, as appropriate, \n        shall issue all necessary scientific research and species \n        enhancement permits under section 10(a)(1) of the Endangered \n        Species Act (16 U.S.C. 153(9)(a)(1)), for the performance of \n        the pilot program.\n            (2) Any permit application that is not approved by the \n        Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Commerce, or both, as \n        appropriate, for any reason, within 180 days after receiving \n        the application, shall be deemed approved.\n            (3) All permits issued shall be in the name of the Bureau \n        of Reclamation and the districts.\n            (4) Districts may delegate the authority to administer the \n        permit authority to any qualified private contractor retained \n        in accordance with subsection (c).\n            (5) The pilot program, including amendments thereto by the \n        appropriate Federal and State agencies, shall constitute a \n        conservation plan that complies with the requirements of \n        section 10(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 \n        U.S.C. 1539(a)(2)).\n    (g) NEPA.--Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy \nAct of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) shall not apply with respect to \nsection 2 and the issuance of any permit under this subsection during \nthe seven-year period beginning on the date of the implementation of \nthe pilot program.\n\nSEC. 3.
