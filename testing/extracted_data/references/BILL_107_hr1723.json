FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n        deaths among American women.\n            (2) More women in the United States are living with breast \n        cancer than any other cancer (excluding skin cancer). \n        Approximately 3 million women in the United States are living \n        with breast cancer: 2 million who have been diagnosed and an \n        estimated 1 million who do not yet know they have the disease.\n            (3) Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer \n        among women in the United States and worldwide (excluding skin \n        cancer). In 2001, it is estimated that 233,000 new cases of \n        breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United \n        States: 192,000 invasive breast cancer and 40,800 cases of \n        ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\n            (4) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of breast \n        cancer death for women in the United States; approximately \n        40,000 women in the U.S. die from the disease each year. Breast \n        cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for U.S. women \n        between the ages of 20 and 59, and the leading cause of cancer \n        death for women worldwide.\n            (5) A woman in the United States has a 1 in 8 chance of \n        developing invasive breast cancer in her lifetime--this risk \n        was 1 in 11 in 1975. In 2001, a new case of breast cancer will \n        be diagnosed every 2 minutes, and a woman will die from breast \n        cancer every 13 minutes.\n            (6) All women are at risk for breast cancer. About 90 \n        percent of women who develop breast cancer do not have a family \n        history of the disease.\n            (7) The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer, a public \n        private partnership, has recognized the importance of expanding \n        the scope and breadth of biomedical, epidemiological, and \n        behavioral research activities related to the etiology of \n        breast cancer and the role of the environment.\n            (8) To date, there has been only a limited research \n        investment to expand the scope or coordinate efforts across \n        disciplines or work with the community to study the role of the \n        environment in the development of breast cancer.\n            (9) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous \n        potential for avenues of prevention, the Federal investment in \n        the role of the environment and the development of breast \ncancer should be expanded.\n            (10) In order to understand the effect of chemicals and \n        radiation on the development of cancer, multi-generational, \n        prospective studies are probably required.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES; AWARDS FOR \n              DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF RESEARCH CENTERS REGARDING \n              ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS RELATED TO BREAST CANCER.\n\n    Subpart 12 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 285l et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 463B. RESEARCH CENTERS REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS RELATED \n              TO BREAST CANCER.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Director of the Institute, based on \nrecommendations from the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research \nAdvisory Panel (hereafter in this section referred to as the `Panel'), \nshall make grants, after a process of peer review and programmatic \nreview, to public or nonprofit private entities for the development and \noperation of not more than 8 centers for the purpose of conducting \nmultidisciplinary and multi-institutional research on environmental \nfactors that may be related to the etiology of breast cancer. Each such \ncenter shall be known as a Breast Cancer and Environmental Research \nCenter of Excellence. The Panel shall oversee the peer review process \nand shall conduct a programmatic review. The Panel will recommend the \nfunding criteria and mechanisms by which the grant funds shall be \nallocated. The Panel shall make final programmatic recommendations on \nallocation of grant funds.\n    ``(b) Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Advisory Panel.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish in the \n        Institute of Environmental Health Sciences the Breast Cancer \n        and Environmental Research Panel (hereafter in this section \n        individually referred to as the `Panel').\n            ``(2) Membership.--The Panel shall be composed of nine \n        appointed members and nonvoting ex officio members.
