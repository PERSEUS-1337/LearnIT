FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) there is a Federal responsibility to provide \n        opportunities for public recreation, tourism, and economic \n        development at Federal water projects, in partnership with \n        other Federal and non-Federal interests;\n            (2) certain provisions of the Federal Water Project \n        Recreation Act (Public Law 89-72 as amended) unduly restrict \n        the management of the Canyon Ferry Recreation Management Area \n        because the provisions do not allow for the increasing economic \n        burden that construction and management of recreational \n        facilities are placing on managing entities, especially at the \n        State and local levels;\n            (3) non-Federal responsibility for a significant portion of \n        all costs of operation, maintenance, and replacement of \n        facilities on Federal lands at the Canyon Ferry Recreation \n        Management Area as well as total management responsibility is \n        an unfair burden on non-Federal managers, especially in \n        instances where the facilities are old, underdesigned, do not \n        provide adequate access for the disabled, and are utilized by \n        national and international publics, and responsibilities for \n        complex fisheries reservoir management and for wildlife and \n        wetlands management have been borne solely by the non-Federal \n        entities, further increasing the overall management burden; and\n            (4) the recreational, tourism, and economic development \n        needs at the Canyon Ferry Recreation Area can best be met \n        through cooperative management efforts by the Bureau of \n        Reclamation, the Bureau of Land Management, the State of \n        Montana, and other appropriate entities.\n\nSEC. 3. COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS.\n\n    (a) Authorization.--The Secretary of the Interior (hereafter in \nthis Act referred to as the ``Secretary''), acting through the Bureau \nof Reclamation and the Bureau of Land Management, may enter into such \nagreements as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act.\n    (b) Contents of Agreements.--Any management agreement entered into \nunder this Act shall provide that the management responsibilities given \nto the Bureau of Land Management for lands withdrawn or acquired for \nreclamation purposes shall be accomplished in accordance with the \nstatutory authority generally exercised by the Bureau of Land \nManagement in the management of the public lands.\n\nSEC. 4. PROTECTION OF AUTHORIZED PURPOSES OF RECLAMATION PROJECTS.\n\n    (a) No Alteration of Purposes of Canyon Ferry Unit.--Nothing in \nthis Act is intended to change, modify, or expand the authorized \npurposes of the Canyon Ferry Unit.\n    (b) Original Purpose of Canyon Ferry Dam and Reservoir \nUnaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall change the responsibility of the \nBureau of Reclamation to meet the needs for which the Canyon Ferry Dam \nand Reservoir were originally constructed.\n    (c) No Authorization to Affect Water Supply.--This Act is not \nintended to authorize any action or inaction by any person, including \nany person who has contracted for the water supply from a reclamation \nproject, that reduces the quantity, or modifies the time and manner of \navailability, of the water supply from the Canyon Ferry Unit to project \nbeneficiaries.\n\nSEC. 5. MANAGEMENT.\n\n    (a) Management Under the Plan.--The Secretary shall manage all \nlands and facilities in the area associated with recreation, tourism, \nand related economic development pursuant to the Canyon Ferry Resources \nManagement Plan, of 1993, and any amendments thereto.\n    (b) Exemption From Provisions of the Federal Water Project \nRecreation Act.--Provisions of the Federal Water Project Recreation Act \n(16 U.S.C. 4601-12) that limit or prescribe costs that may be incurred \nby Federal and non-Federal entities for recreation planning, \nmanagement, or facilities, or that require non-Federal management of \nrecreation facilities or programs do not apply to the Area.\n    (c) Recreation User Fees.--All recreation user fees collected from \nthe Canyon Ferry Recreation Area by the managing agency(ies) shall be \nretained by the managing agency(ies) and used exclusively to fund the \noperation, maintenance, and development of the Canyon Ferry Recreation \nArea for recreation, tourism, and economic development. Fees collected \nfor cabin site permits, concession operations, entrance fees, and other \nspecial use fees are all considered to be recreation user fees.\n    (d) Contents of Agreement.--The cooperative agreements shall \nprovide that the responsibilities given to the Bureau of Land \nManagement for the area will be carried out in accordance with the \nstatutory authority generally exercised by the Bureau of Land \nManagement in the management of the public lands.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \nnecessary to carry out this Act, to remain available until expended. \nEspecially critical are the first 10 years of the interagency project \nmanagement agreement when major management, maintenance, replacement, \nand construction must occur."
