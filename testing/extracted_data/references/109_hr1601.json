    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Transform America \nTransaction Fee Act of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An effective stimulus plan meets the criteria of job \n        creation, fiscal responsibility, fairness, targeting of unmet \n        needs, tax reform and revenue sharing.\n            (2) The current tax structure creates economic distortions \n        that limit growth and job creation.\n            (3) The estimated cost of compliance to taxpayers is five \n        billion hours and approximately $200 billion.\n            (4) The tax code produces inefficiency in revenue raising \n        that forces the nation to struggle unnecessarily under the \n        burden of unequal and inadequate systems of public education \n        and health care, a crumbling physical and social services \n        infrastructure, and a crushing national debt.\n            (5) Implementing a transaction fee will provide the \n        structure to maintain current expenditures on defense-related \n        activities without sacrificing expenditures on additional \n        important national priorities.\n            (6) Restructuring the tax code will promote economic \n        prosperity.\n            (7) Replacing existing Federal taxes with a fee on \n        transactions eliminates systemic inefficiency that plagues the \n        current tax code.\n            (8) Economic analyses have estimated a transaction fee \n        would allow businesses to undertake projects that are not \n        profitable in the current tax system, and workers would be more \n        willing to supply labor.\n            (9) Responsible tax reform is necessary for all to enjoy \n        financial security, economic prosperity, educational \n        opportunities, and affordable health care.\n            (10) Therefore, the Department of the Treasury shall \n        prepare a comprehensive analytical report to achieve these \n        stated goals.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A TRANSACTION FEE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall conduct an in-\ndepth study on the implementation of a transaction fee in the United \nStates. In particular, such study shall include a comprehensive \nanalytical report of the proposal outlined in subsection (b) (as well \nas an implementation/action plan) to replace all existing Federal taxes \nwith a per transaction fee based on the value of the transaction.\n    (b) Transaction Fee Proposal.--\n            (1) In general.--The fee under the proposal would apply to \n        all non-cash transactions (including checks, credit cards, \n        transfers of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments) \n        and all high-dollar cash transactions.\n            (2) Potential exclusions.--The fee would not apply to--\n                    (A) cash transactions of less than $500,\n                    (B) salaries and wages by employers to employees, \n                and\n                    (C) transactions involving individual savings \n                instruments through financial institutions.\n            (3) Cash withdrawals from financial institutions.--The fee \n        under the proposal would apply to cash withdrawals from \n        financial institutions and be set at a rate that is either \n        double or higher than the standard transaction fee.\n            (4) Fee rate.--\n                    (A) In general.--The fee rate is set at a level \n                sufficient to generate revenues equal to revenues under \n                the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n                    (B) Other potential uses of fee.--The fee rate \n                could be structured to cover 1 or more of the \n                following:\n                            (i) A national debt reduction plan \n                        requiring elimination of the current national \n                        debt of $7.7 trillion over a period of 10 \n                        years, with equal annual payments.\n                            (ii) A Federal revenue sharing program \n                        providing funding to States to support 50 \n                        percent of the K-16 education costs of each \n                        State which agrees to adopt an equitable public \n                        school finance system.\n                            (iii) A plan to meet the promised levels of \n                        certain provisions listed under the National \n                        Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 \n                        (Public Law 108-458), including those sections \n                        related to air cargo security (subtitle C of \n                        title IV of such Act), detention bed space \n                        (section 5204 of such Act), and border patrol \n                        agents (section 5202 of such Act); to create a \n                        dedicated funding stream for port security and \n                        improvements at levels recommended by the \n                        United States Coast Guard; and to increase \n                        expenditures for first responder grant programs \n                        funded under the Department of Homeland \n                        Security.\n                            (iv) A Federal program providing quality \n                        health care insurance coverage (for the current \n                        estimated 45 million uninsured Americans).\n                            (v) An increase in the military basic pay \n                        rate to a level comparable with that of Federal \n                        civilian pay, considering, but not being \n                        limited to, the following criteria: age, \n                        education, skills, years of service, and \n                        responsibilities.\n                            (vi) A Federal revenue sharing program \n                        supporting community and economic development \n                        investments in new markets (rural and urban \n                        areas) at a level equal to 10 percent of \n                        current Federal tax revenues.\n                            (vii) A plan to increase the pay for \n                        National Guard and Reserve soldiers to that of \n                        active duty military for periods of extended \n                        deployments abroad.\n                            (viii) A Social Security and Medicare \n                        solvency plan ensuring that revenues continue \n                        to exceed expected outlays.\n            (5) Progressivity.--The base standard transaction fee shall \n        not be greater than 1 percent for all noncash transactions \n        under $500. If more revenues are needed to meet the \n        requirements of paragraph (4), the Secretary of the Treasury \n        would calculate the minimum level of progressivity required to \n        cover these costs. This progressivity factor may include--\n                    (A) a higher transaction fee for all transactions \n                above $500, and\n                    (B) a progressive schedule of rates to tiered \n                ranges of transactions above $500.\n            (6) General provisions.--\n                    (A) Liability for fee.--Persons become liable for \n                the fee at the moment the person exercises control over \n                a piece of property or service, regardless of the \n                payment method.\n                    (B) Collection.--The fees will be collected by the \n                seller or financial institution servicing the \n                transaction.\n    (c) Report of Study.--\n            (1) In general.--The results of the study shall be \n        submitted to the Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury in a \n        comprehensive analytical report, detailing--\n                    (A) the methodology employed in the calculation of \n                the fee rate,\n                    (B) the factors considered in assessing feasibility \n                of the proposed revenue generating system and the \n                weight applied to each, and\n                    (C) the portion of the transaction fee attributable \n                to each of the programs identified in subsection \n                (b)(4)(B) and the methodology used to calculate each.\n            (2) Other requirements.--The study shall (in the following \n        order)--\n                    (A) compute the fee needed to meet current revenue \n                generation,\n                    (B) compute the fee needed to meet revenue \n                neutrality and generate additional revenue to support \n                the program described in subsection (b)(4)(B)(i) \n                (relating to national debt reduction plan),\n                    (C) compute the fee needed to meet revenue \n                neutrality and generate additional revenue to support \n                all the programs described in subsection (b)(4)(B), and\n                    (D) determine the utility of pegging changes in the \n                transaction fee schedule of rates to the rate of \n                inflation.\n            (3) Comparative analysis.--The study shall include a \n        comparative analysis of the existing revenue-raising system \n        versus the proposed fee-based system on economic behavior.
