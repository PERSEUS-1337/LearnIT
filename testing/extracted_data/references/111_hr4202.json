FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many water resources in the United States are \n        declining, particularly in urban areas.\n            (2) This decline of water resources is the result of an \n        increase in population, water consumption, and impermeable \n        surfaces, as well as the negative effects of urbanization, \n        commercial and industrial activities, and climate change.\n            (3) An October 2008 study by the National Research Council \n        found that some of the benefits of green infrastructure include \n        increased water supplies, the creation of green jobs, cost \n        savings, and a reduction of stormwater runoff, surface water \n        discharge, stormwater pollution, and stormwater flows.\n\nSEC. 3.
