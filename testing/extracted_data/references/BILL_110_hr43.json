FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Addressing the problem of contaminated abandoned \n        industrial or commercial properties by funding programs that \n        encourage the reuse of such properties must continue to be a \n        priority of this country.\n            (2) Brownfields grant programs funded through the \n        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are utilized for \n        environmental assessment, planning, job training, and cleanup.\n            (3) EPA brownfields programs are not adequate to \n        rehabilitate, demolish, or redevelop structures.\n            (4) The Department of Housing and Urban Development is an \n        appropriate agency to provide grants to redevelop contaminated, \n        abandoned or underutilized buildings, which pose not only a \n        possible health risk but also impact a community's quality of \n        life.\n            (5) Local communities need additional redevelopment \n        programs that provide new flexibility to organizations to be \n        part of community development efforts.\n            (6) The Congress should fund appropriate Federal programs \n        that allow communities to redevelop their neighborhoods and \n        improve the quality of life in the surrounding areas.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to empower local \ncommunities and their partners to clean and redevelop brownfields in \ntheir communities by providing--\n            (1) flexibility for the development of local plans to \n        address brownfields problems; and\n            (2) access to economic development grant funds.\n\nSEC. 3.
