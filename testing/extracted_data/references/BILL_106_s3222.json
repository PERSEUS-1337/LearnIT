FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) public and private land in the United States faces \n        unprecedented and severe stress from harmful, nonnative weeds;\n            (2) the economic and resource value of the land is being \n        destroyed as harmful nonnative weeds overtake native \n        vegetation, making the land unusable for forage and for diverse \n        plant and animal communities;\n            (3) damage caused by harmful nonnative weeds has been \n        estimated to run in the hundreds of millions of dollars \n        annually;\n            (4) successfully fighting this scourge will require \n        coordinated action by all affected stakeholders, including \n        Federal, State, and local governments, private landowners, and \n        nongovernmental organizations;\n            (5) the fight must begin at the local level, since it is at \n        the local level that persons feel the loss caused by harmful \n        nonnative weeds and will therefore have the greatest motivation \n        to take effective action; and\n            (6) to date, effective action has been hampered by \n        inadequate funding at all levels of government and by \n        inadequate coordination.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide assistance to eligible weed management \n        entities in carrying out projects to control or eradicate \n        harmful, nonnative weeds on public and private land;\n            (2) to coordinate the projects with existing weed \n        management areas and districts;\n            (3) in locations in which no weed management entity, area, \n        or district exists, to stimulate the formation of additional \n        local or regional cooperative weed management entities, such as \n        entities for weed management areas or districts, that organize \n        locally affected stakeholders to control or eradicate weeds;\n            (4) to leverage additional funds from a variety of public \n        and private sources to control or eradicate weeds through local \n        stakeholders; and\n            (5) to promote healthy, diverse, and desirable plant \n        communities by abating through a variety of measures the threat \n        posed by harmful, nonnative weeds.\n\nSEC. 3.
