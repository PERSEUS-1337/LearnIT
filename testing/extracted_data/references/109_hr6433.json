FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On July 25, 2006, United States Ambassador to Lebanon \n        Jeffrey Feltman declared a humanitarian emergency in Lebanon \n        due to ongoing insecurity and humanitarian needs.\n            (2) On August 11, 2006, the United Nations Security Council \n        adopted Security Council Resolution 1701, calling for an end to \n        hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, and stating that \n        ``the situation in Lebanon constitutes a threat to \n        international peace and security''.\n            (3) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, \n        ``Stresses the importance of, and the need to achieve, a \n        comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.''.\n            (4) On August 14, 2006, the United Nations brokered a \n        ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel.\n            (5) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, \n        ``Welcom[es] the efforts of the Lebanese Prime Minister and the \n        commitment of the Government of Lebanon, in its seven-point \n        plan, to extend its authority over its territory, through its \n        own legitimate armed forces, such that there will be no weapons \n        without the consent of the Government of Lebanon and no \n        authority other than that of the Government of Lebanon.''.\n            (6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, \n        ``Calls on the international community to take immediate steps \n        to extend its financial and humanitarian assistance to the \n        Lebanese people, including through facilitating the safe return \n        of displaced persons and, under the authority of the Government \n        of Lebanon, reopening airports and harbors, consistent with \n        paragraphs 14 and 15, and calls on it also to consider further \n        assistance in the future to contribute to the reconstruction \n        and development of Lebanon.''.\n            (7) It is estimated that there are approximately 8,500 \n        unexploded ordnance in the region.\n            (8) The Lebanese Government estimates that Lebanon suffered \n        approximately $3.6 billion in damages to physical \n        infrastructure.\n            (9) Lebanon's economy has been severely impacted by the \n        violence, especially in the tourism sector, which compromises \n        15 percent of its GDP.\n            (10) It is in the national security interests of the United \n        States, Israel and the region to have a functioning Lebanese \n        central government that is able to protect its borders and \n        provide municipal services to all its citizens and a strong \n        economy able to generate jobs and foster economic growth.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress makes the following declarations of policy:\n            (1) Assisting failed states emerging from violent conflict \n        is a complex and long-term task, as demonstrated by the \n        experience that 50 percent of such states emerging from \n        conditions of violent conflict slip back into violence within \n        five years.\n            (2) The United States Government recognizes the threat to \n        United States national security posed by failed and failing \n        states by adopting Directive 3000.05 for the Department of \n        Defense that places stabilization and reconstruction operations \n        on par with traditional war fighting and National Security \n        Policy Directive 45 for the Department of State that makes the \n        State Office of Coordinator for Reconstruction and \n        Stabilization, S/CRS, the government-wide coordinating and \n        planning entity for stabilization and reconstruction \n        operations.\n            (3) Therefore, it is in the best interests of the United \n        States Government to assist the Lebanese Government with long-\n        term reconstruction and stabilization to further peace and \n        stability within Lebanon and the greater Middle East region.\n            (4) United States assistance to Lebanon shall be \n        implemented in accordance with section 102(b) of the Foreign \n        Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151-1(b)) that makes \n        building the capacity of local communities and institutional \n        capabilities of the government and people a primary goal and \n        ``should focus on establishing and upgrading the institutional \n        capacities of developing countries in order to promote long-\n        term development''.\n\nSEC. 4.
