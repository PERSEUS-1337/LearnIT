    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Used Fuel Prize Act of \n2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Administering entity.--The term ``administering \n        entity'' means the entity with which the Secretary enters into \n        an agreement under section 4(c).\n            (2) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the \n        Department of Energy.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The rising cost of energy has become a hindrance to \n        American economic progress.\n            (2) High and rising energy costs have become a burden upon \n        the American family.\n            (3) Nuclear energy can be a safe, efficient, clean, and \n        affordable source of renewable energy and should be considered \n        as part of the solution for long-term American energy \n        independence.\n            (4) Used nuclear fuel is and has been safely stored on \n        nuclear energy electricity producing reactor sites for many \n        years.\n            (5) Those sites were originally not designed or built for \n        such storage.\n            (6) By 2015 it is estimated that the United States will \n        maintain 70,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste.\n            (7) The country's electricity needs are best served by \n        allowing new nuclear reactors to be built, in many cases on \n        existing reactor sites.\n            (8) Removal of the used nuclear fuel from those sites can \n        be safely done and would lead to more efficient management of \n        used fuel, and lower costs.\n            (9) Development of alternatives to current storage \n        facilities, including the Yucca Mountain long-term storage \n        facility, would also allow used nuclear fuel from \n        decommissioned reactor sites to be moved and final clean up of \n        those sites to take place.\n            (10) Citizens and communities in the United States \n        interested in developing alternatives to current storage \n        proposals, including the high-level Yucca Mountain storage \n        facility, should be provided the incentive to move forward with \n        these designs and plans.\n            (11) Prize legislation has been a successful method used by \n        the United States Government to solve some of our country's \n        most difficult problems, from space travel to vehicles with \n        super efficiency.\n            (12) There is merit in and need for establishing a program \n        of prize incentives to develop used nuclear fuel management \n        plans.\n\nSEC. 4. PRIZE AUTHORITY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall carry out a program to \ncompetitively award cash prizes in conformity with this Act to advance \nthe research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of \nnuclear used fuel storage.\n    (b) Advertising and Solicitation of Competitors.--\n            (1) Advertising.--The Secretary shall widely advertise \n        prize competitions to encourage broad participation in the \n        program carried out under subsection (a), including \n        individuals, universities, communities, and large and small \n        businesses.\n            (2) Announcement through federal register notice.--The \n        Secretary shall announce each prize competition by publishing a \n        notice in the Federal Register.
