FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States largely relies on a direct tax \n        system, whereas 150 countries currently employ one particular \n        form of indirect tax known as value-added taxes (VAT) as well \n        as direct taxes. The worldwide VAT tax average in 2005 was 15.7 \n        percent, and in countries of the European Union it ranges \n        between 15 and 25 percent.\n            (2) Under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), \n        direct taxes, such as corporate income taxes, if rebated or \n        refunded upon the export of goods are viewed as export \n        subsidies and prohibited on most goods and are at least \n        potentially actionable on all goods. However, indirect taxes, \n        such as sales taxes and VAT, may be rebated or refunded upon \n        the export of goods and such rebate or refund is not defined as \n        constituting a subsidy and hence is not actionable under WTO \n        rules.\n            (3) At present, there are no WTO rules on subsidies as \n        applied to trade in services. However, a number of countries \n        currently impose taxes on the import of services and exempt or \n        rebate or refund taxes upon the export of services, to the \n        disadvantage of United States services providers.\n            (4) The disparate treatment of border taxes detrimentally \n        affects United States agricultural producers, manufacturers, \n        and service providers in that--\n                    (A) refunds of indirect taxes effectively act as \n                export subsidies to foreign exporters; and\n                    (B) United States exporters are subject to double \n                taxation, by paying direct taxes on domestic production \n                in the United States and having their exported product \n                or service face a border tax in the importing country \n                consisting of indirect taxes.\n            (5) Foreign governments paid their producers an estimated \n        $369 billion of VAT rebates on goods exported to the United \n        States. Foreign governments collected from United States \n        producers an estimated $122.4 billion of VAT equivalent taxes \n        on their imported goods. The combined goods and services \n        disadvantage in 2007 was $474 billion.\n            (6) For more than 40 years, United States businesses have \n        complained of border tax inequity and, since 1968, prior United \n        States Administrations and Congresses have sought to resolve \n        it.\n            (7) Congress has repeatedly recognized the prejudicial \n        effect of the disparate treatment of border taxes with respect \n        to goods and has directed the United States to seek a \n        negotiated solution:\n                    (A) In passing the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n                2101 et seq.), Congress sought ``revision of GATT \n                articles with respect to the treatment of border \n                adjustments for international taxes to redress the \n                disadvantage to countries relying primarily on direct \n                rather than indirect taxes for revenue needs.''.\n                    (B) In section 1101(b)(16) of the Omnibus Trade and \n                Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2901(b)(16)) and \n                section 2102(b)(15) of Bipartisan Trade Promotion \n                Authority Act of 2002 (19 U.S.C. 3802(b)(15)), Congress \n                declared that a principal trade negotiating objective \n                of the United States is to obtain a revision of WTO \n                rules with respect to the treatment of border taxes in \n                order to redress the disadvantage to countries relying \n                primarily on direct taxes for revenue rather than \n                indirect taxes.\n            (8) The disparate treatment of border taxes is arbitrary, \n        inequitable, causes economic distortions based only on the type \n        of tax system used by a country, and is a primary obstacle to \n        more balanced trade relations between the United States and its \n        major trading partners.\n    (b) Declarations of Policy.--Congress declares the following:\n            (1) It is critically necessary that the issue of border \n        taxes be addressed and resolved in WTO negotiations, whether in \n        the ongoing Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations or \n        subsequent WTO negotiations.\n            (2) If such WTO negotiations fail to achieve the United \n        States trade negotiating objective of revising WTO rules with \n        respect to the treatment of border taxes in order to redress \n        the disadvantage to countries relying primarily on direct taxes \n        for revenue rather than indirect taxes, then effective action \n        through legislation is warranted given the massive and \n        inequitable distortions to trade that United States \n        agricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers \n        face as a result of border taxes.\n\nSEC. 3. REPORT ON RESULTS OF WTO NEGOTIATIONS TO REVISE WTO RULES \n              REGARDING BORDER TAXES.\n\n    (a) Report Required.--Not later than 60 days after the completion \nof WTO negotiations, or by January 1, 2011, whichever occurs first, the \nUnited States Trade Representative shall submit to Congress a report \ncertifying whether or not each of the United States trade negotiating \nobjectives regarding border tax treatment, as specified in subsection \n(b), has been met as a result of such negotiations.\n    (b) U.S. Trade Negotiating Objectives Regarding Border Tax \nTreatment Specified.--The United States trade negotiating objectives \nregarding border tax treatment specified in this subsection are the \nfollowing:\n            (1) With respect to trade in goods, the revision of WTO \n        rules with respect to the treatment of border adjustments for \n        internal taxes to redress the disadvantage to countries relying \n        primarily on direct taxes for revenue rather than indirect \n        taxes, as provided for in section 2102(b)(15) of Bipartisan \n        Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 (19 U.S.C. 3802(b)(15)).\n            (2) With respect to trade in services--\n                    (A) the elimination of the disadvantage in trade in \n                services that exists for countries relying primarily on \n                direct taxes that are not adjusted at the border rather \n                than indirect taxes that are adjusted at the border; \n                and\n                    (B) the revision of WTO rules regarding trade in \n                services to ensure that such rules do not result in \n                disparate treatment of border adjustments for internal \n                taxes based on the direct or indirect nature of such \n                taxes.\n    (c) Definition.--In this section, the terms ``WTO negotiations'' \nand ``negotiations'' mean the ongoing Doha Development Round of World \nTrade Organization negotiations or subsequent WTO negotiations that may \nresult in revisions to WTO rules to meet the United States trade \nnegotiating objectives regarding border tax treatment, as specified in \nsubsection (b).\n\nSEC. 4.
