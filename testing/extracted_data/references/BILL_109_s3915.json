FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) At least 1 out of every 10 pregnant women in the United \n        States smokes, which accounts for over 500,000 births per year.\n            (2) Tobacco use during pregnancy causes serious harm to the \n        fetus. Fetal mortality rates are 35 percent higher among \n        pregnant women who smoke than among nonsmokers and the Surgeon \n        General reports that a pregnant woman who smokes is 1.5 to 3.5 \n        times more likely than a non-smoker to have a low birth weight \n        baby.\n            (3) Studies have found that smoking and exposure to \n        secondhand smoke among pregnant women is a major cause of \n        miscarriage, stillbirths, and sudden infant death syndrome \n        (SIDS).\n            (4) Preventing just 1 smoking-related low birth weight baby \n        can save more than $40,000 in health care expenditures.\n            (5) For every $1 spent on smoking cessation for pregnant \n        women, an estimated $3 in neonatal intensive care costs could \n        be avoided.\n            (6) Such expenditures have a disproportionate impact on \n        Medicaid, with estimates indicating that pregnant women on \n        Medicaid are 2.5 times more likely to smoke than pregnant women \n        not on Medicaid. Smoking-attributable neonatal health care \n        costs are estimated to be $1,400,000,000 to $2,000,000,000 \n        annually, and such costs for Medicaid total almost \n        $228,000,000, that is, approximately, $738 per pregnant smoker.\n            (7) States this year will collect $21,300,000,000 from the \n        Master Settlement Agreement of November 23, 1998, between \n        participating tobacco manufacturers and Attorneys General of 46 \n        States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n        Rico, and 4 territories of the United States, other settlement \n        agreements between companies within the tobacco industry and \n        the States of Mississippi, Florida, Texas, and Minnesota, and \n        tobacco taxes (an increase from $20,000,000,000 in fiscal year \n        2005). States are spending only 2.6 percent of their tobacco \n        revenue on tobacco prevention and cessation.\n            (8) Evidence shows that the cuts States have made in \n        tobacco prevention funding since 2002 have slowed or possibly \n        stalled recent declines in youth smoking, putting further \n        progress at risk.\n\nSEC. 3. PROMOTING CESSATION OF TOBACCO USE BY PREGNANT WOMEN UNDER THE \n              MEDICAID PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Requiring Coverage of Counseling and Pharmacotherapy for \nCessation of Tobacco Use by Pregnant Women.--Section 1905 of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(4)--\n                    (A) by striking ``and'' before ``(C)'';
