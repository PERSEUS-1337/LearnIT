FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The uniqueness of the Hawaiian islands lies in part due \n        to their isolation from continental landmasses, their great \n        topographic and climatic diversity, and the intervals between \n        natural colonization (colonization without human assistance) of \n        the Hawaiian islands by new plant or animal species, which have \n        been on the order of thousands of years.\n            (2) The resulting evolution in isolation over time has \n        often led to the generation of species entirely unique to \n        particular islands and found nowhere else, and such isolation \n        also often meant the absence of natural predatory or \n        competitive species.\n            (3) The natural geographic isolation of the Hawaiian \n        islands is no match for the advancement of human activities, \n        including transportation and global commerce, and native biota \n        and ecosystems are being overwhelmed by the introduction and \n        establishment of non-native plant and animal species and plant \n        and animal diseases associated with such species.\n            (4) More than 5,000 species of non-native plants and \n        animals have become established in the Hawaiian islands in the \n        past 200 years, which represents a rate of successful \n        colonization of new species every 18 days.\n            (5) Although not all new species introductions alter \n        ecosystem function and structure, damage agriculture, or cause \n        human health or other safety hazards, the introduction of \n        invasive species to the Hawaiian islands has resulted in the \n        extinction of native species, the destruction of native \n        forests, and the spread of disease and costs the State of \n        Hawaii millions of dollars in crop losses.\n            (6) For example, Miconia calvescens, an aggressive weedy \n        tree from South America, has established itself in Hawaii and \n        threatens Hawaii's tropical forests and the watersheds those \n        forests support, and the resulting decreased water infiltration \n        in just two of Hawaii's priority watersheds could amount to \n        additional water costs of $13 million annually.\n            (7) Just one new invasive species, such as the the brown \n        tree snake, could change the very character of the Hawaiian \n        islands. In addition to its devastating impacts on fragile \n        native bird populations, the venomous brown tree snake poses a \n        public health risk because it bites people and pets, threatens \n        poultry farms because it feeds on chickens and eggs, and \n        presents the risk of dangerous and costly power outages because \n        it climbs electrical lines causing short circuits in power \n        supply.\n            (8) Although Congress responded to the danger of the brown \n        tree snake by enacting the Brown Tree Snake Control and \n        Eradication Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-384; 7 U.S.C. 8501 et \n        seq.), many more invasive species, including fire ants and West \n        Nile Virus, threaten to invade Hawaii and cause further \n        environmental and economic damage.\n            (9) The current Federal statutory and regulatory regime is \n        not sufficient to minimize the introduction of invasive species \n        into Hawaii and the environmental, economic, and social harm \n        that would result from the introduction of additional invasive \n        species.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Disease.--The term ``disease'' means any living stage \n        of a bacterium, a fungus, a virus or viroid, an infectious \n        agent or other pathogen, or any other article similar to or \n        allied with any of these specified articles, that can directly \n        or indirectly cause economic or environmental harm or harm to \n        human health.\n            (2) Introduction.--The terms ``introduce'' and \n        ``introduction'' refer to the intentional or unintentional \n        dissemination, placement, release, or escape of a species as a \n        result of human activity outside of the range where the species \n        is commonly found.\n            (3) Invasive species.--The term ``invasive species'' means \n        any species, including its seeds, eggs, spores, or other \n        biological material capable of propagating that species, whose \n        introduction does or is likely to cause economic or \n        environmental harm or harm to human health.\n            (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary concerned'' means--\n                    (A) the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to \n                matters under the jurisdiction of the Department of the \n                Interior; and\n                    (B) the Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to \n                matters under the jurisdiction of the Department of \n                Agriculture.\n            (5) Secretaries.--The term ``Secretaries'' means both the \n        Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture.\n            (6) Species.--The term ``species'' means a group of \n        organisms all of which have a high degree of physical and \n        genetic similarity, generally interbreed only among themselves, \n        and show persistent differences from members of allied groups \n        of organisms.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO \n              PREVENTING THE INTRODUCTION OF INVASIVE SPECIES IN \n              HAWAII.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that there \nexists a need for improved and better coordinated control, \ninterdiction, and eradication of invasive species and diseases on the \npart of the United States and other interested parties to prevent the \nintroduction or spread of invasive species or diseases in Hawaii.\n    (b) United States Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \nfund and support coordinated and concerted programs and activities to \ncontrol, interdict, and prevent the introduction or spread of invasive \nspecies and diseases in Hawaii.\n    (c) Preventing Introduction.--Notwithstanding any other provision \nof law, to the extent practicable, no Federal agency may authorize, \nfund, or carry out any action that would likely cause or promote the \nintroduction or spread of invasive species and diseases in Hawaii. All \nFederal agencies shall consider invasive species and disease issues, to \nthe extent possible, when planning any activity that may cause the \naccidental introduction of invasive species and diseases in Hawaii.\n\nSEC. 5.
