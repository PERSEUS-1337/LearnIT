The \nSecretary of the Treasury, in consultation with appropriate agencies, \nshall develop and publish criteria that will be used to evaluate \nwhether a country will be deemed a cooperating country. These criteria \nwill be subject to public notice and comment before adoption in final \nform.\n    (d) The Secretary of the Treasury may extend cooperating country \nstatus for more than six months after the initial designation, but \nshall provide to Congress an explanation of the reasons for why such an \nextension is necessary.\n    (e) The President of the United States shall ensure that \nimplementation of and compliance with title I of this Act is monitored \nby appropriate agencies or by an independent body.\n\nSEC. 106.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The most effective and desirable means of eliminating \n        international trade in conflict diamonds is through \n        international cooperative efforts involving governments, the \n        private sector, civil society, and appropriate international \n        organizations.\n            (2) The initiatives of the world diamond industry, as \n        reflected in the Resolution of the World Federation of Diamond \n        Bourses and the International Diamond Manufacturers Association \n        in Antwerp on July 19, 2000, as well as the efforts of the \n        South African-led Working Group on African Diamonds and the \n        World Diamond Council in developing proposals for a global \n        certification system for rough diamonds, are important efforts \n        at international cooperation and may provide effective \n        mechanisms that could be incorporated in an international \n        agreement to eliminate trade in conflict diamonds.\n            (3) Eliminating imports of rough diamonds from countries \n        where conflict diamonds are mined, transshipped, or \n        subsequently shipped into countries where cutting and polishing \n        occur is the most effective way to eliminate trade in conflict \n        diamonds.\n\nSEC. 202. SENSE OF CONGRESS--NEGOTIATION OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the President should engage in \nnegotiations on and seek to conclude an international agreement to \neliminate trade in conflict diamonds as soon as possible. The system \nimplementing this agreement shall be transparent and subject to \nindependent verification and monitoring. Participants in such an \nagreement should include all countries that either export or import \ndiamonds or diamond jewelry.\n\nSEC. 203. OVERALL NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVE OF THE UNITED STATES AND \n              ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT.\n\n    (a) The overall negotiating objective of the United States is to \nestablish an effective global certification system covering the major \nexporting and importing countries of rough diamonds that will eliminate \ntrade in conflict diamonds.\n    (b) The elements of an effective global certification system for \nrough diamonds that the United States should seek in its negotiations \nare as follows:\n            (1) Rough diamonds, when exported from the country in which \n        they were extracted, must be sealed in a secure, transparent \n        container or bag by appropriate government officials of that \n        country.\n            (2) The sealed container described in paragraph (1) must \n        include a fully visible government document certifying the \n        country of extraction and recording a unique export \n        registration number and the total carat weight of the rough \n        diamonds enclosed.\n            (3) A database containing information described in \n        paragraph (2) must be established for rough diamond exports in \n        each exporting country, including countries engaged in the re-\n        export of rough diamonds.\n            (4) No country may allow importation of rough diamonds \n        unless they are sealed in a secure, transparent container that \n        includes a fully visible document that states a unique export \n        registration number for such container and the total carat \n        weight of the rough diamonds enclosed. The legitimacy of such \n        document must be verified by electronic or other reliable means \n        with the database maintained in the country of export.\n            (5) Provisions shall be made for physical inspection of \n        sealed containers of rough diamonds by appropriate authorities.\n            (6) Diamonds may be freely imported and exported from a \n        country that implements and enforces a rough diamond \n        certification system that contains the elements specified in \n        paragraphs (1) through (5), or a system that is its functional \n        equivalent, provided that the country of extraction need only \n        be specified when rough diamonds are exported from such country \n        and need not be specified when rough diamonds are exported from \n        a country that implements and enforces such a rough diamond \n        certification system.\n\nSEC. 204. CONSULTATIONS WITH CONGRESS.\n\n    The President of the United States shall consult periodically with \nCongress in developing and negotiating proposals for an international \nagreement as described in sections 202 and 203.\n\nSEC. 205. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    The President of the United States will provide a written report to \nCongress no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act and \nannually thereafter on the progress made towards concluding an \ninternational agreement and the progress of the signatories to that \nagreement in implementing it, including which countries are not \nimplementing it and the effects of their actions on trade in conflict \ndiamonds. Each report shall also describe any technological advances \nthat permit determining a diamond's origin, marking a diamond, and \ntracking it.\n\nSEC. 206. IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION.\n\n    The President of the United States will submit to Congress a draft \nbill implementing the provisions of any agreement that is negotiated no \nlater than 60 calendar days after entering into that agreement.\n\nSEC. 207.

SEVERABILITY.\n\n    If any provision of this Act or the application of such provision \nto any person or circumstance is held invalid, it is the intent of \nCongress that the remainder of this Act and application of such \nprovision to other persons or circumstances will not be affected \nthereby.\n\nSEC. 303.
