REVIEW OF DISCHARGE CHARACTERIZATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--In accordance with this section, the appropriate \ndischarge boards--\n            (1) shall review the discharge characterization of covered \n        members at the request of the covered member; and\n            (2) if such characterization is any characterization except \n        honorable, may change such characterization to honorable.\n    (b) Criteria.--In changing the discharge characterization of a \ncovered member to honorable under subsection (a)(2), the Secretary of \nDefense shall ensure that such changes are carried out consistently and \nuniformly across the military departments using the following criteria:\n            (1) The original discharge must be based on Don't Ask Don't \n        Tell (in this Act referred to as ``DADT'') or a similar policy \n        in place prior to the enactment of DADT.\n            (2) Such discharge characterization shall be so changed if, \n        with respect to the original discharge, there were no \n        aggravating circumstances, such as misconduct, that would have \n        independently led to a discharge characterization that was any \n        characterization except honorable. For purposes of this \n        paragraph, such aggravating circumstances may not include--\n                    (A) an offense under section 925 of title 10, \n                United States Code (article 125 of the Uniform Code of \n                Military Justice), committed by a covered member \n                against a person of the same sex with the consent of \n                such person; or\n                    (B) statements, consensual sexual conduct, or \n                consensual acts relating to sexual orientation or \n                identity, or the disclosure of such statements, \n                conduct, or acts, that were prohibited at the time of \n                discharge but after the date of such discharge became \n                permitted.\n            (3) When requesting a review, a covered member, or the \n        member's representative, shall be required to provide either--\n                    (A) documents consisting of--\n                            (i) a copy of the DD-214 form of the \n                        member;\n                            (ii) a personal affidavit of the \n                        circumstances surrounding the discharge; and\n                            (iii) any relevant records pertaining to \n                        the discharge; or\n                    (B) an affidavit certifying that the member, or the \n                member's representative, does not have the documents \n                specified in subparagraph (A).\n            (4) If a covered member provides an affidavit described in \n        subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3)--\n                    (A) the appropriate discharge board shall make \n                every effort to locate the documents specified in \n                subparagraph (A) of such paragraph within the records \n                of the Department of Defense; and\n                    (B) the absence of such documents may not be \n                considered a reason to deny a change of the discharge \n                characterization under subsection (a)(2).\n    (c) Request for Review.--The appropriate discharge board shall \nensure the mechanism by which covered members, or their representative, \nmay request to have the discharge characterization of the covered \nmember reviewed under this section is simple and straightforward.\n    (d) Review.--\n            (1) In general.--After a request has been made under \n        subsection (c), the appropriate discharge board shall review \n        all relevant laws, records of oral testimony previously taken, \n        service records, or any other relevant information regarding \n        the discharge characterization of the covered member.\n            (2) Additional materials.--If additional materials are \n        necessary for the review, the appropriate discharge board--\n                    (A) may request additional information from the \n                covered member or the member's representative, in \n                writing, and specifically detailing what is being \n                requested; and\n                    (B) shall be responsible for obtaining a copy of \n                the necessary files of the covered member from the \n                member, or when applicable, from the Department of \n                Defense.\n    (e) Change of Characterization.--The appropriate discharge board \nshall change the discharge characterization of a covered member to \nhonorable if such change is determined to be appropriate after a review \nis conducted under subsection (d) pursuant to the criteria under \nsubsection (b).
