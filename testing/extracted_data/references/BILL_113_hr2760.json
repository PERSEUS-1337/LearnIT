FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Panama Canal, which cuts across the Isthmus of \n        Panama, was built between 1890 and 1914. It was the world's \n        greatest engineering feat of its time and required a labor \n        force of almost 40,000.\n            (2) President Theodore Roosevelt, recognizing the value of \n        a canal, led the United States in buying the equipment and \n        concession to build the canal for $40 million, and championed \n        the effort that overcame malaria and immense logistical \n        problems. The Canal opened on August 15, 1914--401 years after \n        Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa first crossed Panama.\n            (3) Stretching 51 miles, the Panama Canal connected the \n        Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, saving sailors a \n        dangerous 8,000-mile journey around Cape Horn and through the \n        Straits of Magellan, and cutting in half the time previously \n        required to sail between the oceans.\n            (4) The 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition was a \n        world's fair held in San Francisco, California. The Exposition \n        ran from February 20 until December 4, 1915.\n            (5) The Exposition commemorated the completion of the \n        Panama Canal and the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the \n        Pacific Ocean by Balboa.\n            (6) Congress authorized the United States Mint to issue \n        five different coins dated 1915 in connection with the Panama-\n        Pacific International Exposition. The coins represent a high-\n        water mark for American commemorative coins. Produced at the \n        San Francisco Mint, these were the first United States \n        commemorative coins to bear the motto ``In God We Trust'', and \n        included the silver Panama-Pacific half dollar and four gold \n        coins in denominations of one dollar, 2\\1/2\\ dollars, a 50-\n        dollar round coin, and a unique 50-dollar octagonal coin.\n            (7) The octagonal $50 gold piece was the largest coin \n        authorized by Congress, and the first minted since 1852 in a \n        shape other than round.\n            (8) The United States should mark the centennial of this \n        important event in San Francisco and the monumental achievement \n        of the opening of the Panama Canal.\n            (9) The proceeds from the surcharge on the sale of such \n        commemorative coins will assist in supporting the educational \n        programs of the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society.\n\nSEC. 3.
