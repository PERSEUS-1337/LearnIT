    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Affinity Scams for \nSeniors Act of 2010'' or the ``PASS Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Financial exploitation of the elderly is becoming an \n        increasingly familiar problem. Regular review of news headlines \n        reveals that elders and vulnerable adults are victimized \n        routinely by frauds and scams at the hands of strangers as well \n        as loved ones.\n            (2) Older individuals may be targeted merely because they \n        possess more assets, such as savings, annuities, and retirement \n        accounts, stocks and bonds, insurance policies, and property \n        than younger people. People over 50 years of age control at \n        least 70 percent of the net worth of the nation's households.\n            (3) Those elders with cognitive impairments, mental health \n        conditions, or physical disabilities may be dependent upon \n        others (family members, friends, formal and informal \n        caregivers, or court-appointed representatives) for assistance \n        in making financial decisions or carrying out daily \n        transactions, and therefore may be even more vulnerable to \n        theft, exploitation, or undue influence.\n            (4) Affinity scams on seniors involve transactions in which \n        a person trusted by the senior uses the relationship to defraud \n        the senior. Millions of elderly are scammed each year, losing \n        at least 2,600,000,000 a year to thieves, many of whom are in \n        their own families (conservative estimate given of the schemes \n        left unreported).\n            (5) Elder financial abuse is commonly linked with other \n        forms of abuse and neglect and threatens the health, dignity, \n        and economic security of millions of older Americans. Elder \n        financial abuse has received limited attention because it is \n        not regarded as visible, life-threatening, or newsworthy as is \n        the physical or sexual abuse of elders.\n            (6) Financial exploitation can be devastating to the victim \n        and is often traced to family members, trusted friends, or \n        caregivers. Financial abuse often occurs with the implied \n        acknowledgment and consent of the elder person and can be more \n        difficult to detect.\n            (7) Elder financial abuse affects elders and their families \n        in significant and long-lasting ways by putting enormous \n        emotional duress on the elders, increasing their risk of \n        depression, decreasing their quality of life, and increasing \n        unnecessary institutionalization.\n            (8) The financial services industry is often the first to \n        detect a change in the pattern of customers with whom they have \n        regular contact. This puts institutions in a unique position to \n        assist in protecting customers and upholding the inherent trust \n        relationship with clients.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Affinity scam.--The term ``affinity scam'' means a \n        transaction in which a person trusted by a senior, such as a \n        caregiver, relative, guardian, ``new friend'', or service \n        provider, claims to share similar interests or values with the \n        senior, establishes a relationship with the senior (either on \n        the person's own initiative or through some other method, such \n        as a court-appointed guardianship), and then uses the \n        relationship to defraud the senior.\n            (2) Financial institution.--The term ``financial \n        institution'' means--\n                    (A) an insured bank (as defined in section 3(h) of \n                the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(h));\n                    (B) a credit union; and\n                    (C) a thrift institution.\n            (3) Senior.--The term ``senior'' means an individual who is \n        at least 65 years of age.\n\nSEC. 4.
