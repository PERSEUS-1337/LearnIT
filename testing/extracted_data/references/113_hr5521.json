URBAN FLOODING DEFINED.\n\n    (a) In General.--In this Act, the term ``urban flooding'' means the \ninundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more \ndensely populated areas, caused by rain falling on increased amounts of \nimpervious surface and overwhelming the capacity of drainage systems, \nsuch as storm sewers.\n    (b) Inclusions.--In this Act, the term ``urban flooding'' \nincludes--\n            (1) situations in which stormwater enters buildings through \n        windows, doors, or other openings;\n            (2) water backup through sewer pipes, showers, toilets, \n        sinks, and floor drains;\n            (3) seepage through walls and floors;\n            (4) the accumulation of water on property or public rights-\n        of-way; and\n            (5) the overflow from water bodies, such as rivers and \n        lakes.\n    (c) Exclusion.--In this Act, the term ``urban flooding'' does not \ninclude flooding in undeveloped or agricultural areas.\n\nSEC. 3. URBAN FLOODING STUDY.\n\n    (a) Agreement With National Research Council.--The Administrator of \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency shall enter into an agreement \nwith the National Research Council under which the National Research \nCouncil will conduct a study on urban flooding in accordance with the \nrequirements of this section.\n    (b) Contents.--\n            (1) General review and evaluation.--In conducting the \n        study, the National Research Council shall review and evaluate \n        the latest available research, laws, regulations, policies, \n        best practices, procedures, and institutional knowledge \n        regarding urban flooding.\n            (2) Specific issue areas.--The study shall include, at a \n        minimum, an examination of the following:\n                    (A) The prevalence and costs associated with urban \n                flooding events across the United States, with a focus \n                on the largest metropolitan areas and any clear trends \n                in frequency and severity over the past 2 decades.\n                    (B) The adequacy of existing federally provided \n                flood risk information and the most cost-effective \n                methods and products to identify, map, or otherwise \n                characterize the risk of property damage from urban \n                flooding on a property-by-property basis, whether or \n                not a property is in or adjacent to a 1-percent (100-\n                year) flood plain, and the potential for training and \n                certifying local experts in flood risk characterization \n                as a service to property purchasers and owners and \n                their communities.\n                    (C) The causes of urban flooding and its apparent \n                increase over the past 20 years, including the impacts \n                of--\n                            (i) global climate change;\n                            (ii) increasing urbanization and the \n                        associated increase in impervious surfaces; and\n                            (iii) undersized, deteriorating and \n                        otherwise ineffective stormwater \n                        infrastructure.\n                    (D) The most cost-effective strategies, practices, \n                and technologies used to reduce the impacts of urban \n                flooding, with a focus on decentralized, easy-to-\n                install, and low-cost approaches, such as nonstructural \n                and natural infrastructure on public and private \n                property. The examination under this subparagraph shall \n                include an assessment of opportunities for implementing \n                innovative strategies and practices on government-\n                controlled land, such as Federal, State, and local \n                roads, parking lots, alleys, sidewalks, buildings, \n                recreational areas, and open space.\n                    (E) The role of the Federal Government and State \n                governments, as conveners, funders, and advocates, in \n                spurring market innovations based on public-private-\n                nonprofit partnerships. Such innovations may include \n                smart home technologies for improved flood warning \n                systems connected to high-resolution weather forecast \n                data and Internet- and cellular-based communications \n                systems.\n                    (F) The most sustainable and effective methods for \n                funding flood risk and flood damage reduction at all \n                levels of government, including--\n                            (i) the potential for establishing a State \n                        revolving fund program for flood prevention \n                        projects similar to the revolving fund programs \n                        under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n                        and the Safe Drinking Water Act;\n                            (ii) stormwater fee programs using \n                        impervious surface as the basis for fee rates \n                        and providing credits for the installation of \n                        flood prevention or other stormwater management \n                        features;\n                            (iii) grant programs; and\n                            (iv) public-private partnerships.\n                    (G) Information and education strategies and \n                practices, including nontraditional approaches such as \n                the use of social media, for community leaders, \n                government staff, and property owners on--\n                            (i) flood risks;\n                            (ii) flood risk reduction strategies and \n                        practices; and\n                            (iii) the availability and effectiveness of \n                        different types of flood insurance policies.\n                    (H) The relevance of the National Flood Insurance \n                Program and Community Rating System to urban flooding \n                areas outside traditional flood plains, and strategies \n                for broadening coverage and increasing participation \n                under the programs.\n                    (I) Strategies for protecting downstream \n                communities from the flooding impacts of development in \n                upstream communities, including a review of--\n                            (i) potential standards for watershed-wide \n                        flood protection planning; and\n                            (ii) the potential establishment of \n                        streamlined legal processes for victims of \n                        flood damage, to avoid the need for expensive \n                        litigation.\n    (c) Consultation.--The Administrator of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency shall carry out this section in consultation with the \nSecretary of the Army (acting through the Chief of Engineers), the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and State, regional, and local \nstormwater management agencies, and such other interested parties as \nthe Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency considers \nappropriate.\n    (d) Report to Congress.--Not later than 3 years after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency shall submit to the Committee on Financial Services \nand the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee \non Appropriations of the Senate a report containing the findings of the \nNational Research Council based on the results of the study, including \nrecommendations for implementation of strategies, practices, and \ntechnologies relating to urban flooding by Congress and the executive \nbranch."
