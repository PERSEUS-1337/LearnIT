FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION REGULATION OF BONNEVILLE \n              POWER ADMINISTRATION TRANSMISSION RATES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The transmission of electric energy by the \nAdministration shall be subject to the provisions of parts II and III \nof the Federal Power Act (except sections 204, 207, 209, 214, and 305), \nand the Commission shall have jurisdiction under such parts II and III \nover the rates, terms, and conditions of such transmission. Such \nprovisions of the Federal Power Act and the rules, regulations, and \npolicies of the Commission thereunder shall apply to such transmission \nby the Administration to the same extent and in the same manner as such \nprovisions apply to the transmission of electric energy by a public \nutility otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under \npart II of such Act, except that rates charged by the Administration \nfor the transmission of electric energy shall be sufficient to recover \nall costs for compliance with treaty, trust, and Endangered Species Act \nresponsibilities, the fish mitigation and enhancement requirements of \nthe Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act, and \nthe water quality standards under the Clean Water Act.\n    (b) Separation.--(1) The financial and accounting system \nestablished for the Administration under section 5 shall assure the \nseparation of all costs, revenues, and other fiscal matters associated \nwith transmission from the costs, revenues, and other fiscal matters \nassociated with power sales. The Commission shall review and approve or \ndisapprove such administrative separation and assure that only costs \nproperly allocable to transmission rates are recovered through \ntransmission rates. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to \nlimit or affect the authority of the Administrator to impose a \ntransmission fee as part of cost recovery measures under subsection \n(c)(1)(B)(ii).\n    (2) Except for purposes of assuring such transmission access as is \nnecessary for purposes of meeting treaty, trust, and Endangered Species \nAct responsibilities, the fish mitigation and enhancement requirements \nof the Northwest Power Act, and the water quality standards under the \nClean Water Act, the Commission shall take such steps as may be \nnecessary to assure that no preference is accorded to the \nAdministration for the transmission of power sold by the \nAdministration.\n    (c) Cost Recovery Adjustment.--(1) Whenever, during the period \nbeginning October 1, 2001, and ending September 30, 2016, the \nAdministrator, in accordance with account procedures established under \nsection 5, determines that either--\n            (A) the Administration's reserves have fallen below \n        $800,000,000, or\n            (B) a 10-year forecast indicates that in any 1 future year, \n        the Administration has less than a 95 percent probability of \n        meeting a payment to the United States Treasury,\nthe Administrator shall submit to the Commission a transmission rate \nincrease under this subsection and implement the following cost \nrecovery measures designed to correct, within 5 years, such reserve \ndeficiency or reduced payment ability forecast:\n            (i) the Administrator shall adjust wholesale power rates \n        (up to the market rate for electricity in the Western System \n        Coordinating Council) to meet the revenue requirement set forth \n        in subparagraph (A) or (B), as the case may be; and\n            (ii) if increasing wholesale rates up to the market rate of \n        electricity in the Western System Coordinating Council is not \n        sufficient to meet such requirement, the Administrator shall \n        implement a transmission fee to generate revenues sufficient to \n        meet such requirement but not in excess of $100,000,000 a year.\n    (2) The Commission shall approve, disapprove, or modify any \ntransmission rate increase submitted under this subsection within 30 \ndays after the date of submission. The Commission shall approve such \nincrease if the Commission determines that such rate increase meets the \nrequirements of this subsection and that the Administrator has taken \nreasonable steps to avoid such increase by using its authority under \nsection 4(h)(10)(C) of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power, Planning \nand Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 838b(h)(10)(D))."
