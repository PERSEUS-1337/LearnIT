FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) As directed by Congress in section 723 of the \n        Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 613), as added by section \n        305 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104; \n        110 Stat. 126), the Federal Communications Commission adopted \n        rules requiring closed captioning of most television \n        programming, which gradually require new video programming to \n        be fully captioned beginning in 2006.\n            (2) More than 28,000,000 Americans, or 8 percent of the \n        population, are considered deaf or hard of hearing, and many \n        require captioning services to participate in mainstream \n        activities.\n            (3) More than 24,000 children are born in the United States \n        each year with some form of hearing loss.\n            (4) According to the Department of Health and Human \n        Services and a study done by the National Council on Aging--\n                    (A) 25 percent of Americans over 65 years old are \n                hearing impaired;\n                    (B) 33 percent of Americans over 70 years old are \n                hearing impaired; and\n                    (C) 41 percent of Americans over 75 years old are \n                hearing impaired.\n            (5) The National Council on Aging study also found that \n        depression in older adults may be directly related to hearing \n        loss and disconnection with the spoken word.\n            (6) Empirical research demonstrates that captions improve \n        the performance of individuals learning to read English and, \n        according to numerous Federal agency statistics, could \n        benefit--\n                    (A) 3,700,000 remedial readers;\n                    (B) 12,000,000 young children learning to read;\n                    (C) 27,000,000 illiterate adults; and\n                    (D) 30,000,000 people for whom English is a second \n                language.\n            (7) Over the past 5 years, student enrollment in programs \n        that train court reporters to become realtime writers has \n        decreased significantly, causing such programs to close on many \n        campuses.\n\nSEC. 3.
