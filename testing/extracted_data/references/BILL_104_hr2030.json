PARENTAL CHOICE IN TELEVISION PROGRAMMING.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Television influences children's perception of the \n        values and behavior that are common and acceptable in society.\n            (2) Television station operators, cable television system \n        operators, and video programmers should follow practices in \n        connection with video programming that take into consideration \n        that television broadcast and cable programming has established \n        a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of American \n        children.\n            (3) The average American child is exposed to 25 hours of \n        television each week and some children are exposed to as much \n        as 11 hours of television a day.\n            (4) Studies have shown that children exposed to violent \n        video programming at a young age have a higher tendency for \n        violent and aggressive behavior later in life that children not \n        so exposed, and that children exposed to violent video \n        programming are prone to assume that acts of violence are \n        acceptable behavior.\n            (5) Children in the United States are, on average, exposed \n        to an estimated 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on \n        television by the time the child completes elementary school.\n            (6) Studies indicate that children are affected by the \n        pervasiveness and casual treatment of sexual material on \n        television, eroding the ability of parents to develop \n        responsible attitudes and behavior in their children.\n            (7) Parents express grave concern over violent and sexual \n        video programming and strongly support technology that would \n        give them greater control to block video programming in the \n        home that they consider harmful to their children.\n            (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n        empowering parents to limit the negative influences of video \n        programming that is harmful to children.\n            (9) Providing parents with timely information about the \n        nature of upcoming video programming and with the technological \n        tools that allow them easily to block violent, sexual, or other \n        programming that they believe harmful to their children is the \n        least restrictive and most narrowly tailored means of achieving \n        that compelling governmental interest.\n    (b) Establishment of Television Rating Code.--Section 303 of the \nAct (47 U.S.C. 303) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(v) Prescribe--\n            ``(1) on the basis of recommendations from an advisory \n        committee established by the Commission that is composed of \n        television broadcasters, television programming producers, \n        cable operators, appropriate public interest groups, and other \n        interested individuals from the private sector and that is \n        fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and \n        the functions to be performed by the committee, rules to \n        identify and rate video programming that contains sexual, \n        violent, or other material about which parents should be \n        informed before it is displayed to children; and\n            ``(2) rules requiring the transmission by distributors of \n        video programming of signals that contain an identification of \n        the rating (pursuant to the rules prescribed under paragraph \n        (1)) of the programming being distributed and that permit \n        parents to block the display of video programming that they \n        have determined is inappropriate for their children.''.\n    (c) Requirement for Manufacture of Televisions That Block \nPrograms.--Section 303 of the Act, as amended by subsection (a), is \nfurther amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(w) Require, in the case of apparatus designed to receive \ntelevision signals that are manufactured in the United States or \nimported for use in the United States and that have a picture screen 13 \ninches or greater in size (measured diagonally), that such apparatus--\n            ``(1) be equipped with circuitry designed to enable viewers \n        to block the display of channels, programs, and time slots; and\n            ``(2) enable viewers to block display of all programs with \n        a common rating.''.\n    (d) Shipping or Importing of Televisions That Block Programs.--\n            (1) Regulations.--Section 330 of the Communications Act of \n        1934 (47 U.S.C. 330) is amended--\n                    (A) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection \n                (d); and\n                    (B) by adding after subsection (b) the following \n                new subsection (c):\n    ``(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person shall ship \nin interstate commerce, manufacture, assemble, or import from any \nforeign country into the United States any apparatus described in \nsection 303(w) of this Act except in accordance with rules prescribed \nby the Commission pursuant to the authority granted by that section.\n    ``(2) This subsection shall not apply to carriers transporting \napparatus referred to in paragraph (1) without trading it.\n    ``(3) The rules prescribed by the Commission under this subsection \nshall provide for the oversight by the Commission of the adoption of \nstandards by industry for blocking technology. Such rules shall require \nthat all such apparatus be able to receive the rating signals which \nhave been transmitted by way of line 21 of the vertical blanking \ninterval and which conform to the signal and blocking specifications \nestablished by industry under the supervision of the Commission.\n    ``(4) As new video technology is developed, the Commission shall \ntake such action as the Commission determines appropriate to ensure \nthat blocking service continues to be available to consumers.''.\n            (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 330(d) of such Act, as \n        redesignated by subsection (a)(1), is amended by striking \n        ``section 303(s), and section 303(u)'' and inserting in lieu \n        thereof ``and sections 303(s), 303(u), and 303(w)''.\n    (e) Applicability and Effective Dates.--\n            (1) Applicability of rating provision.--The amendment made \n        by subsection (b) of this section shall take effect 1 year \n        after the date of enactment of this Act, but only if the \n        Commission determines, in consultation with appropriate public \n        interest groups and interested individuals from the private \n        sector, that distributors of video programming have not, by \n        such date--\n                    (A) established voluntary rules for rating video \n                programming that contains sexual, violent, or other \n                material about which parents should be informed before \n                it is displayed to children, and such rules are \n                acceptable to the Commission; and\n                    (B) agreed voluntarily to broadcast signals that \n                contain ratings of such programming.\n            (2) Effective date of manufacturing provision.--In \n        prescribing regulations to implement the amendment made by \n        subsection (c), the Federal Communications Commission shall, \n        after consultation with the television manufacturing industry, \n        specify the effective date for the applicability of the \n        requirement to the apparatus covered by such amendment."
