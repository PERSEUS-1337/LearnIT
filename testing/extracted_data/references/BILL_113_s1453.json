FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Pulmonary hypertension is a serious, debilitating, and \n        often fatal progressive condition where the blood pressure in \n        the lungs rises to dangerously high levels. In pulmonary \n        hypertension patients, the walls of the arteries that take \n        blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs thicken and \n        constrict. As a result, the right side of the heart has to pump \n        harder to move blood into the lungs, causing it to enlarge and \n        ultimately fail.\n            (2) In advanced stages of pulmonary hypertension, the \n        patient is able to perform only minimal activity and has \n        symptoms even when resting, resulting in considerable \n        disability. The disease may worsen to the point where the \n        patient is completely bedridden. In a matter of months, many \n        pulmonary hypertension patients have become so functionally \n        deteriorated that they have lost their jobs and are dependent \n        on family and disability benefits.\n            (3) Despite the importance of early diagnosis on prognosis, \n        pulmonary hypertension is rarely picked up in a routine medical \n        exam. Even in its later stages, the signs of the disease are \n        frequently confused with more common conditions that affect the \n        heart and lungs. Due to the fact that the average length of \n        time between the onset of symptoms and an accurate diagnosis is \n        presently 2.8 years, nearly three out of four patients have \n        advanced pulmonary hypertension by the time they are accurately \n        diagnosed.\n            (4) While pulmonary hypertension remains an incurable \n        condition, progress in our scientific understanding of the \n        disease has led to the development and Food and Drug \n        Administration approval of nine innovative therapies indicated \n        to treat pulmonary hypertension.\n            (5) Existing treatment options can significantly extend \n        life and improve quality of life for patients with pulmonary \n        hypertension. The effectiveness of pulmonary hypertension \n        treatment options is directly tied to how early in the \n        progression of the condition a patient can be accurately \n        diagnosed and begin the correct regimen of therapies. Improved \n        early intervention will improve health outcomes for pulmonary \n        hypertension patients while reducing the necessity for more \n        drastic and costly treatment options, such as a lung or heart-\n        lung transplant.\n\nSEC. 3.
