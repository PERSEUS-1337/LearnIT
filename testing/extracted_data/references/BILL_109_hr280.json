FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) returning the Nation's brownfield sites to productive \n        economic use could generate more than 550,000 additional jobs \n        and up to $2,400,000,000 in new tax revenues for cities and \n        towns;\n            (2) redevelopment of brownfield sites and reuse of \n        infrastructure at such sites will protect natural resources and \n        open spaces;\n            (3) lack of funding for redevelopment is a primary obstacle \n        impeding the reuse of brownfield sites;\n            (4) the Department of Housing and Urban Development is the \n        agency of the Federal Government that is principally \n        responsible for supporting community development and \n        encouraging productive land use in urban areas of the United \n        States;\n            (5) grants under the Brownfields Economic Development \n        Initiative of the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n        provide local governments with a flexible source of funding to \n        pursue brownfields redevelopment through land acquisition, site \n        preparation, economic development, and other activities;\n            (6) to be eligible for such grant funds, a community must \n        be willing to pledge community development block grant funds as \n        partial collateral for a loan guarantee under section 108 of \n        the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, and this \n        requirement is a barrier to many local communities that are \n        unable or unwilling to pledge such block grant funds as \n        collateral; and\n            (7) by de-linking grants for brownfields development from \n        section 108 community development loan guarantees and the \n        related pledge of community development block grant funds, more \n        communities will have access to funding for redevelopment of \n        brownfield sites.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide cities and \ntowns with more flexibility for brownfields development, increased \naccessibility to brownfields redevelopment funds, and greater capacity \nto coordinate and collaborate with other government agencies--\n            (1) by providing additional incentives to invest in the \n        development and redevelopment of brownfield sites; and\n            (2) by de-linking grants for brownfields development from \n        community development loan guarantees and the related pledge of \n        community development block grant funds.\n\nSEC. 3. BROWNFIELDS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE.\n\n    Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 \nU.S.C. 5301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 123.
