The parties may \nnot by consent extend the function of a special master beyond that \npermitted under this subsection.\n    ``(f) Attorney's Fees.--No attorney's fee under section 722 of the \nRevised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1988) may be granted \nto a plaintiff in a civil action with respect to prison conditions \nexcept to the extent such fee is--\n            ``(1) directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual \n        violation of the plaintiff's Federal rights; and\n            ``(2) proportionally related to the extent the plaintiff \n        obtains court ordered relief for that violation.''.\n    ``(g) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n            ``(1) the term `prison' means any Federal, State, or local \n        facility that incarcerates or detains juveniles or adults \n        accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated \n        delinquent for, violations of criminal law;\n            ``(2) the term `relief' means all relief in any form which \n        may be granted or approved by the court, and includes consent \n        decrees and settlement agreements (except a settlement \n        agreement the breech of which is not subject to any court \n        proceeding which such agreement settled); and\n            ``(3) the term `prospective relief' means all relief other \n        than compensatory monetary damages.''\n    (b) Application of Amendment.--Section 3626 of title 18, United \nStates Code, as amended by this section, shall apply with respect to \nall relief (as defined in such section) whether such relief was \noriginally granted or approved before, on, or after the date of the \nenactment of this Act.\n    (c) Clerical Amendment.--The item relating to section 3526 in the \ntable of sections at the beginning of subchapter C of chapter 229 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, is amended by striking ``crowding'' and \ninserting ``conditions''."
