    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Teacher Education for Autistic \nChildren Act of 2007'' or the ``TEACH Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE; DEFINITION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has \n        increased during the past decade from an estimated one in 500 \n        to an estimated one in 150 according to data released by the \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in February \n        2007. CDC classified as having ASD children whose behaviors \n        were consistent with the DSM-IV-TR criteria for Autistic \n        Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental \n        Disorder--Not Other Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).\n            (2) Autism is a complex developmental disability that \n        affects an individual in the areas of social interaction and \n        communication. Because it is a spectrum disorder, it affects \n        each individual differently and to varying degrees of severity. \n        People with autism process and respond to information in unique \n        ways. In some cases, aggressive or self-injurious behavior may \n        be present.\n            (3) The increased number of children diagnosed with an \n        autism spectrum disorder is a growing and urgent concern for \n        families and educators, as our education systems struggle to \n        respond to the needs of this population in a comprehensive \n        manner.\n            (4) Factors that have a major impact on the intensity and \n        types of education-related services for individuals with an \n        autism spectrum disorder include the uniqueness of the ways \n        individuals with autism process and respond to information, the \n        variability of how autism affects each individual, the \n        percentage of time individuals with autism are successfully \n        taught in a regular classroom, and the communication and \n        socialization deficits of those individuals.\n            (5) Children with an autism spectrum disorder who receive \n        intensive and appropriate educational services often make very \n        significant functional improvements.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to increase the number \nof teachers and paraprofessional teaching assistants with expertise in \nautism spectrum disorders by providing a refundable tax credit for \nqualified education expenses of such teachers and paraprofessional \nteaching assistants.\n    (c) Definition.--For purposes of this Act, the term ``autism \nspectrum disorders'' has the meaning given to the term ``Pervasive \nDevelopmental Disorder'' by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).\n\nSEC. 3. REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING RELATING TO \n              AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to refundable credits) \nis amended by redesignating section 36 as section 37 and by inserting \nafter section 35 following new section:\n\n``SEC. 36.
