FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress make the following findings:\n            (1) According to a 1999 issue brief prepared by the \n        National Center for Education Statistics, the average public \n        school in America is 42 years old, and school buildings begin \n        rapid deterioration after 40 years. In addition, 29 percent of \n        all public schools are in the oldest condition, meaning that \n        the schools were built before 1970 and have either never been \n        renovated or were renovated prior to 1980.\n            (2) According to reports issued by the General Accounting \n        Office (GAO) in 1995 and 1996, it would cost $112,000,000,000 \n        to bring the Nation's schools into good overall condition, and \n        one-third of all public schools need extensive repair or \n        replacement.\n            (3) Many schools do not have the appropriate infrastructure \n        to support computers and other technologies that are necessary \n        to prepare students for the jobs of the 21st century.\n            (4) Without impeding on local control, the Federal \n        Government appropriately can assist State and local governments \n        in addressing school construction, renovation, and repair needs \n        by providing low-interest loans for purposes of paying interest \n        on related bonds.\n\nSEC. 3.
