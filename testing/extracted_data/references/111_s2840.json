    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Concussion Treatment and Care Tools \nAct of 2009'' or the ``ConTACT Act of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Concussions are mild traumatic brain injuries, the \n        long-term effects of which are not well understood.\n            (2) As many as 3.8 million concussions related to sports \n        and recreation are estimated to occur in the United States each \n        year, although reliable data does not exist on the incidence of \n        concussions and second impact syndrome among student athletes.\n            (3) There is an increased risk for subsequent brain \n        injuries among persons who have had at least one previous brain \n        injury.\n            (4) A repeat concussion, one that occurs before the brain \n        recovers from a previous concussion, can slow recovery or \n        increase the likelihood of having long-term problems.\n            (5) In rare cases, repeat concussions can result in second \n        impact syndrome, which can be marked by brain swelling, \n        permanent brain damage, and death.\n            (6) Recurrent brain injuries and second impact syndrome are \n        highly preventable.\n            (7) Many national organizations, including the American \n        Academy of Neurology, the National Football League, the \n        American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Brain Injury \n        Association of America, have adopted concussion management \n        guidelines, but multiple directives have created confusion and \n        sparked debate.\n\nSEC. 3. CONCUSSION MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES WITH RESPECT TO SCHOOL-AGED \n              CHILDREN.\n\n    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 317T the following:\n\n``SEC. 317U.
