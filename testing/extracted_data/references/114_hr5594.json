    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Strategy for Combating \nTerrorist, Underground, and Other Illicit Financing Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit \n        finance present a direct threat to national security and a \n        threat to global stability.\n            (2) New terrorist groups or threats can form quickly, and \n        other groups change tactics to adapt, creating a constantly \n        changing terrorist environment, presenting ever-changing risks \n        and challenges to programs to disrupt the financing of \n        terrorism and related forms of illicit finance.\n            (3) As demonstrated in hearings before the Task Force to \n        Investigate Terrorism Financing, terrorists in some instances \n        have formed symbiotic relationships with, or are taking over, \n        transnational crime syndicates, so that funding for both \n        terrorism and profits from crime flow in the same fashion and \n        often are indistinguishable.\n            (4) Methods of concealing the movement of illicit funding \n        change quickly in a globalized economy, and rapid technological \n        changes and financial innovation pose new risks that may be \n        increasingly difficult for governments to stay abreast of \n        without an agile, constantly adjusted strategy to spot, \n        disrupt, and prevent the financing of terrorism and related \n        forms of illicit finance.\n            (5) A bipartisan requirement to create a national anti-\n        money laundering strategy enacted in 1998 expired in 2007. \n        Given the rapid globalization and rapid technology changes of \n        the financial sector, an updated strategy focused on the \n        financing of terrorism is necessary.\n            (6) It is important for the Government to have a unified \n        strategy to fight financial crime and to update it annually, \n        both to accommodate new and developing threats and to help \n        Congress develop legislative and funding priorities.\n            (7) An effective strategy to counter terrorism financing is \n        a critical component of the broader counter terrorism strategy \n        of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL STRATEGY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The President, acting through the Secretary of the \nTreasury (the ``Secretary'') shall, in consultation with the Attorney \nGeneral, the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Homeland Security, the \nDirector of National Intelligence and the appropriate Federal banking \nagencies, develop a national strategy for combating the financing of \nterrorism and related forms of illicit finance.\n    (b) Transmittal to Congress.--By June 1 each year following the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the \nappropriate congressional committees a national strategy developed in \naccordance with subsection (a).\n    (c) Evaluation of Existing Efforts and Broader Strategy.--The \nPresident shall accompany each strategy submitted under subsection (b) \nwith a report that--\n            (1) describes the effectiveness of efforts to enforce \n        existing prohibitions against illicit finance;\n            (2) describes how the United States is addressing the \n        highest levels of risk identified in the National Money \n        Laundering Risk Assessment and the National Terrorist Financing \n        Risk Assessment published by the Department of the Treasury;\n            (3) evaluates the effectiveness of United States efforts to \n        fight illicit finance at actually preventing, discovering, and \n        countering terrorist financing and other forms of illicit \n        finance (and the effectiveness of those efforts that the United \n        States coordinates with foreign nations); and\n            (4) describes how the strategy submitted under subsection \n        (b) is integrated into, and supports, the broader counter \n        terrorism strategy of the United States.\n    (d) Separate Presentation of Classified Material.--Any part of the \nnational strategy that involves information which is properly \nclassified under criteria established by the President shall be \nsubmitted to the Congress separately in a classified annex and, if \nrequested by the chairman or ranking Member of one of the appropriate \ncongressional committees, as a briefing at an appropriate level of \nsecurity.\n\nSEC. 4.
