Sec. 300gg-15) and any rules or regulations issued thereunder. A health care service plan that issues the uniform summary of benefits referenced in this paragraph shall do both of the following:\n(i) Ensure that all applicable benefit disclosure requirements specified in this chapter and in Title 28 of the California Code of Regulations are met in other health plan documents provided to enrollees under the provisions of this chapter.\n(ii) Consistent with applicable law, advise applicants and enrollees, in a prominent place in the plan documents referenced in subdivision (a), that enrollees are not financially responsible in payment of emergency care services, in any amount that the health care service plan is obligated to pay, beyond the enrollee\u2019s copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles as provided in the enrollee\u2019s health care service plan contract.\n(B) Commencing October 1, 2016, the uniform summary of benefits and coverage referenced in this paragraph shall constitute a vital document for the purposes of Section 1367.04. Not later than July 1, 2016, the department shall develop written translations of the template uniform summary of benefits and coverage for all language groups identified by the State Department of Health Care Services in all plan letters as of August 27, 2014, for translation services pursuant to Section 14029.91 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, except for any language group for which the United States Department of Labor has already prepared a written translation. Not later than July 1, 2016, the department shall make available on its Internet Web site written translations of the template uniform summary of benefits and coverage developed by the department, and written translations prepared by the United States Department of Labor, if available, for any language group to which this subparagraph applies.\n(C) Subdivision (c) shall not apply to a health care service plan contract subject to subparagraph (A).\n(c) Nothing in this section shall prevent a plan from using appropriate footnotes or disclaimers to reasonably and fairly describe coverage arrangements in order to clarify any part of the matrix that may be unclear.\n(d) All plans, solicitors, and representatives of a plan shall, when presenting any plan contract for examination or sale to an individual prospective plan member, provide the individual with a properly completed disclosure form, as prescribed by the director pursuant to this section for each plan so examined or sold.\n(e) In the case of group contracts, the completed disclosure form and evidence of coverage shall be presented to the contractholder upon delivery of the completed health care service plan agreement.\n(f) Group contractholders shall disseminate copies of the completed disclosure form to all persons eligible to be a subscriber under the group contract at the time those persons are offered the plan. If the individual group members are offered a choice of plans, separate disclosure forms shall be supplied for each plan available. Each group contractholder shall also disseminate or cause to be disseminated copies of the evidence of coverage to all applicants, upon request, prior to enrollment and to all subscribers enrolled under the group contract.\n(g) In the case of conflicts between the group contract and the evidence of coverage, the provisions of the evidence of coverage shall be binding upon the plan notwithstanding any provisions in the group contract that may be less favorable to subscribers or enrollees.\n(h) In addition to the other disclosures required by this section, every health care service plan and any agent or employee of the plan shall, when presenting a plan for examination or sale to any individual purchaser or the representative of a group consisting of 25 or fewer individuals, disclose in writing the ratio of premium costs to health services paid for plan contracts with individuals and with groups of the same or similar size for the plan\u2019s preceding fiscal year. A plan may report that information by geographic area, provided the plan identifies the geographic area and reports information applicable to that geographic area.\n(i) Subdivision (b) shall not apply to any coverage provided by a plan for the Medi-Cal program or the Medicare Program pursuant to Title XVIII and Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 10603 of the Insurance Code, as amended by Section 8 of Chapter 1 of the First Extraordinary Session of the Statutes of 2013, is amended to read:\n10603.\n(a) (1) On or before April 1, 1975, the commissioner shall promulgate a standard supplemental disclosure form for all disability insurance policies. Upon the appropriate disclosure form as prescribed by the commissioner, each insurer shall provide, in easily understood language and in a uniform, clearly organized manner, as prescribed and required by the commissioner, the summary information about each disability insurance policy offered by the insurer as the commissioner finds is necessary to provide for full and fair disclosure of the provisions of the policy.\n(2) On and after January 1, 2014, a disability insurer offering health insurance coverage subject to Section 2715 of the federal Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 300gg-15) shall satisfy the requirements of this section and the implementing regulations by providing the uniform summary of benefits and coverage required under Section 2715 of the federal Public Health Service Act and any rules or regulations issued thereunder. An insurer that issues the federal uniform summary of benefits referenced in this paragraph shall ensure that all applicable disclosures required in this chapter and its implementing regulations are met in other documents provided to policyholders and insureds. An insurer subject to this paragraph shall provide the uniform summary of benefits and coverage to the commissioner together with the corresponding health insurance policy pursuant to Section 10290.\n(3) Commencing October 1, 2016, the uniform summary of benefits and coverage referenced in this subdivision shall constitute a vital document for the purposes of Section 10133.8. Not later than July 1, 2016, the commissioner shall develop written translations of the template uniform summary of benefits and coverage for all language groups identified by the State Department of Health Care Services in all plan letters as of August 27, 2014, for translation services pursuant to Section 14029.91 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, except for any language group for which the United States Department of Labor has already prepared a written translation. Not later than July 1, 2016, the commissioner shall make available on its Internet Web site written translations of the template uniform summary of benefits and coverage developed by the commissioner, and written translations prepared by the United States Department of Labor, if available, for any language group to which this subparagraph applies.\n(b) Nothing in this section shall preclude the disclosure form from being included with the evidence of coverage or certificate of coverage or policy.\nSEC. 3.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution."
