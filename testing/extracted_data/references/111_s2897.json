    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Efficiency Modernization Act \nof 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Federally assisted housing programs provide robust \n        opportunities for energy efficiency improvements and up-front \n        investments in such improvements would provide significant \n        long-term cost savings for taxpayers, provide stimulus to the \n        economy through creation of capital projects and jobs, \n        establish best practices for the industry and be consistent \n        with the mandate of the Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development (HUD);\n            (2) the Government Accountability Office reported in an \n        October 2008 study that HUD pays an estimated $5 billion \n        annually for energy costs for approximately 6 million dwelling \n        units of assisted housing, representing almost 17 percent of \n        the Nation's housing stock;\n            (3) according to the Harvard University Graduate School of \n        Design, more than 80 percent of federally assisted housing \n        stock is between 15 years to 30 years old;\n            (4) existing rules and regulations do not adequately \n        incentivize owners of HUD-assisted property to maximize efforts \n        to make energy efficiency improvements to such properties; and\n            (5) increasing the energy efficiency of federally-assisted \n        housing by 25 percent to 40 percent would create near-term \n        savings for HUD of roughly $1 billion to $1.5 billion annually, \n        resulting in substantial long-term cost savings for the Federal \n        Government and for taxpayers.\n\nSEC. 3. GREEN DIVIDEND PROGRAM FOR FEDERALLY ASSISTED RENTAL HOUSING.\n\n    (a) Authority.--The Secretary shall establish a program under this \nsection to provide green dividends to owners of covered federally \nassisted housing projects who undertake utility cost-saving measures \nthat result in utility cost savings for such housing.\n    (b) Green Dividends.--\n            (1) In general.--A green dividend under this section with \n        respect to a covered federally assisted housing project shall \n        be an annual distribution, to the owner of the project, of an \n        amount of the surplus project funds that is equal to the sum \n        of--\n                    (A) 50 percent of the annual utility cost savings \n                resulting from the utility cost-saving measures \n                conducted for the project; and\n                    (B) any reasonable costs, as determined by the \n                Secretary pursuant to subsection (d)(4), incurred by \n                the owner in carrying out the utility cost-saving \n                measures, including financing costs incurred by the \n                owner or a third party, in compliance with guidelines \n                established pursuant to subsection (d)(3).\n            (2) Additional to standard distribution.--Notwithstanding \n        any other law or regulation relating to a limitation on \n        distributions for a covered federally assisted housing project, \n        a green dividend under this section shall be in addition to the \n        standard distribution that the owner of the project is \n        authorized to receive from the project pursuant to the \n        regulations of the Secretary.\n    (c) Standards for Measurement and Monitoring.--In carrying out the \nprogram under this section, the Secretary shall establish and utilize \nthe following standardized methods:\n            (1) Methods that an owner of a covered federally assisted \n        housing project may use to accurately measure the baseline \n        utility use of the project before undertaking the utility cost-\n        saving measures for the project.\n            (2) Methods that an owner of a covered federally assisted \n        housing project may use to effectively monitor reductions in \n        the utility use of the project resulting from the completed \n        utility cost-saving measures for the project.\n            (3) Methods that an owner of a covered federally assisted \n        housing project may use to track, and that the Secretary may \n        use to verify, utility cost savings resulting from the utility \n        cost-saving measures for the project that account for the \n        effect of changes in utility costs and such other factors that \n        the Secretary considers necessary or appropriate.\n    (d) Other Requirements.--\n            (1) Application and selection.--The Secretary shall \n        establish requirements for owners of covered federally assisted \n        housing projects to apply for participation in the program \n        under this section and shall select among such applications \n        based upon selection criteria, which the Secretary shall \n        establish.\n            (2) Cost-effectiveness.--The Secretary shall establish \n        guidelines to ensure that any utility cost-saving measures \n        undertaken pursuant to the program under this section are cost-\n        effective in relation to the utility cost savings resulting \n        from the measures and the green dividend provided under this \n        section to the owner.\n            (3) Energy performance contracts.--The Secretary shall \n        establish guidelines for the use of energy performance \n        contracting in carrying out utility cost-saving measures \n        pursuant to the program under this section.\n            (4) Financing costs.--The Secretary shall establish \n        guidelines for the financing of the reasonable costs incurred \n        by an owner of a covered federally assisted housing project in \n        carrying out utility cost-saving measures under the program \n        under this section, and whether such costs, whether financed by \n        the limited dividend owner or a third party, shall be repayable \n        from project funds.\n            (5) Reporting.--\n                    (A) To secretary.--The Secretary shall require each \n                owner of a covered federally assisted housing project \n                for which a green dividend is provided pursuant to the \n                program under this section to submit to the Secretary \n                such reports regarding the project, the utility cost-\n                saving measures undertaken for the project, and the \n                utility cost savings of the project in accordance with \n                such requirements as the Secretary shall establish.\n                    (B) To congress.--The Secretary shall submit a \n                reports to the Congress describing the implementation \n                and operation of the program under this section,
