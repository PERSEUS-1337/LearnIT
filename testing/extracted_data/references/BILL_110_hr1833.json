STATE OF COLORADO STUDIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior may provide \nfinancial assistance to the State of Colorado, under the direction of \nthe Governor of that State, to conduct a study, or choose an \nappropriate organization such as Colorado State University-Pueblo to \nconduct a study, to identify the cumulative impacts of past, current, \nor proposed transfers of water from the Arkansas and Colorado River \nbasins to communities not located in the natural basins of the Arkansas \nRiver or the Colorado River, and from agriculturally based communities \nwithin the Arkansas River basin to expanding municipalities within the \nArkansas River basin.\n    (b) Study Criteria.--The study authorized under this section shall \nevaluate the following:\n            (1) Environmental impacts such as impacts on water quality \n        and wildlife habitat, and water supply both for human and \n        environmental and recreational uses.\n            (2) Social, cultural, recreational and economic impacts, \n        including any disproportionate impacts of minority and/or low-\n        income populations that result from actual or proposed water \n        exchanges, water trades, and out-of-basin transfers from the \n        Arkansas River basin and the Colorado River basin.\n            (3) The financial effects of water transfers out of the \n        Arkansas River basin and the Colorado River basin for the \n        sending and receiving communities.\n            (4) The impacts, including cumulative effects, of proposed \n        water supply and storage methods on the area served by the \n        Fryingpan-Arkansas Project and the natural basins of the \n        Arkansas River and the Colorado River within Colorado that may \n        be impacted by the implementation of such water supply and \n        storage methods, taking into account the hydrologic conditions \n        during the period from 1982 to the date the study is conducted.\n            (5) The impacts of return and exchange flows in the \n        Fountain Creek due to proposed and past transfers and exchanges \n        of water from the Arkansas River to municipalities and \n        entities, including the municipality of Colorado Springs, \n        including but not limited to--\n                    (A) the effects on water quality and flood \n                potential; and\n                    (B) mitigation alternatives for identified impacts, \n                including flood control storage facilities on the \n                Fountain Creek.\n            (6) Any effect to stream flows in the Roaring Fork River \n        due to any expansions of the Fryingpan-Arkansas facilities.\n            (7) Feasible options to resolve or mitigate the impacts and \n        effects evaluated in the study.\n    (c) Submission of Report.--As a condition of assistance under the \nsection, the Governor of Colorado shall submit a report of the results \nof the study funded under this section to the President and the \nPresident Pro Tempore of the United States Senate and the Speaker of \nthe United States House of Representatives upon completion of the \nstudy.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated $10,000,000 to carry out this section.\n\nSEC. 4.
