FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Research shows that exposure to video games, \n        television, movies, and other forms of media has powerful \n        effects on the development of children and adolescents and that \n        such effects can be positive or negative depending on the \n        nature and content of the media.\n            (2) Experimental research and longitudinal research \n        conducted over the course of decades shows that exposure to \n        higher levels of violence on television, in movies, and in \n        other forms of media in adolescence causes people in the short-\n        term and, after repeated exposure, even years later to exhibit \n        higher levels of violent thoughts, anti-social and aggressive \n        behavior, fear, anxiety, and hostility, and desensitization to \n        the pain and suffering of others.\n            (3) This evidence is so strong, it has been replicated in \n        so many populations, and it draws on such diverse methodologies \n        that a 2003 comprehensive review of the literature concluded \n        ``the scientific debate over whether media violence increases \n        aggression and violence is essentially over'' and 6 major \n        medical and public health organizations, including the American \n        Medical Association and the American Psychological Association, \n        issued a Joint Statement to Congress in 2000 stating that \n        research points ``overwhelmingly to a causal connection between \n        media violence and aggressive behavior''.\n            (4) New research shows that exposure to violent video games \n        causes similar effects as does exposure to violence in other \n        media, including increased levels of aggression in both the \n        short-term and long-term, and research shows that the uniquely \n        interactive, engaging nature of video games may be especially \n        powerful in shaping children's thoughts, feelings, and \n        behaviors.\n            (5) Research shows that children are more likely to imitate \n        the actions of a character with whom they identify, and in \n        violent video games the player is often provided with a \n        behavioral script where he or she takes the point of view of \n        the shooter or perpetrator.\n            (6) Research shows that children are more likely to learn \n        from behaviors that they repeat over and over again and \n        behaviors that they are rewarded for taking, and in most video \n        games, surveys show, players repeat actions over and over \n        again, aggression goes unpunished, and perpetrators are \n        rewarded for taking aggressive action\n            (7) The video game industry, through the Entertainment \n        Software Ratings Board, has created a system of self-\n        regulation, and a system to provide information to parents \n        about the nature and content of video games.\n            (8) The Entertainment Software Ratings Board has determined \n        that certain video games contain intense violence and explicit \n        sexual content that makes them inappropriate for minors, and \n        has rated these games Mature and Adults-Only.\n            (9) Research shows that children whose parents monitor and \n        control their access to violent media are less likely to \n        demonstrate the negative effects of such media.\n            (10) Parents rely on the Entertainment Software Ratings \n        Board ratings system to protect their children from \n        inappropriate material yet, numerous studies have demonstrated \n        that young people can access Mature-rated games with relative \n        ease.\n            (11) There is a need to enact legislation to ensure that \n        the ratings system is meaningful.\n\nSEC. 3.
