FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to testimony by the Director of Physical \n        Infrastructure of the General Accountability Office before the \n        Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives \n        in May 2013, schedule delays of major medical center \n        construction projects of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        have averaged 35 months, with the delays ranging from 14 months \n        to 74 months.\n            (2) The average cost increase attributed to such delays has \n        been $336,000,000 per project.\n            (3) Management of the major medical facility projects \n        currently underway as of the date of the enactment of this Act \n        in Denver, Colorado, Orlando, Florida, and New Orleans, \n        Louisiana, should be subject to the oversight of a special \n        project manager of the Army Corps of Engineers that is \n        independent of the Department of Veterans Affairs because, \n        according to the Comptroller General of the United States, such \n        projects have experienced continuous delays and a total cost \n        increase of nearly $1,000,000,000.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the management of the major medical center construction \n        projects of the Department of Veterans Affairs has been an \n        abysmal failure; and\n            (2) in order to minimize repeated delays and cost increases \n        to such projects, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should \n        fully implement all recommendations made by the Comptroller \n        General of the United States in an April 2013 report to improve \n        construction procedures and practices of the Department.\n\nSEC. 3.
