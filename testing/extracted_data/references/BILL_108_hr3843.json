FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n        Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) (hereinafter in \n        this section referred to as the ``Act'') was enacted to ensure \n        fairness and equity for the civilian men and women who, during \n        the past 50 years, performed duties uniquely related to the \n        nuclear weapons production and testing programs of the \n        Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies by \n        establishing a program that would provide efficient, uniform, \n        and adequate compensation for beryllium-related health \n        conditions and radiation-related health conditions.\n            (2) The Act provides a process for consideration of claims \n        for compensation by individuals who were employed at relevant \n        times at various locations, but also included provisions \n        designating employees at certain other locations as members of \n        a special exposure cohort whose claims are subject to a less-\n        detailed administrative process.\n            (3) The Act also authorizes the President, upon \n        recommendation of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker \n        Health, to designate additional classes of employees at \n        Department of Energy facilities as members of the special \n        exposure cohort if the President determines that-\n                    (A) it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient \n                accuracy the radiation dose that the class received; \n                and\n                    (B) there is a reasonable likelihood that the \n                radiation dose may have endangered the health of \n                members of the class.\n            (4) It has become evident that it is not feasible to \n        estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose received \n        by employees at the Department of Energy facility in Colorado \n        known as the Rocky Flats site for the following reasons:\n                    (A) Many worker exposures were unmonitored over the \n                lifetime of the plant at the Rocky Flats site. Even in \n                2004, a former worker from the 1950s was monitored \n                under the former radiation worker program of the \n                Department of Energy and found to have a significant \n                internal deposition that had been undetected and \n                unrecorded for more than 50 years.\n                    (B) No lung counter for detecting and measuring \n                plutonium and americium in the lungs existed at Rocky \n                Flats until the late 1960s. Without this equipment, the \n                very insoluble oxide forms of plutonium cannot be \n                detected, and a large number of workers had inhalation \n                exposures that went undetected and unmeasured.\n                    (C) Exposure to neutron radiation was not monitored \n                until the late 1950s, and most of those measurements \n                through 1970 have been found to be in error. In some \n                areas of the plant the neutron doses were as much as 2 \n                to 10 times as great as the gamma doses received by \n                workers, but only gamma doses were recorded. The old \n                neutron films are being re-read, but those doses have \n                not yet been added to the workers' records or been used \n                in the dose reconstructions for Rocky Flats workers \n                carried out by the National Institute for Occupational \n                Safety and Health.\n                    (D) Radiation exposures for many workers were not \n                measured or were missing and, as a result, the records \n                are incomplete or estimated doses were assigned. There \n                are many inaccuracies in the exposure records that the \n                Institute is using to determine whether Rocky Flats \n                workers qualify for compensation under the Act.\n                    (E) The model that has been used for dose \n                reconstruction by the Institute in determining whether \n                Rocky Flats workers qualify for compensation under the \n                Act is in error. The default values used for particle \n                size and solubility of the internally deposited \n                plutonium in workers are in error. Use of these \n                erroneous values reduces the actual internal doses for \n                claimants by as much as 3 to 10 times less than the \n                Rocky Flats records and autopsy data indicate.\n            (5) Administrative costs related to Rocky Flats claims have \n        been substantial, but only a few Rocky Flats cases have been \n        processed.\n            (6) Some Rocky Flats workers, despite having worked with \n        tons of plutonium and having known exposures leading to serious \n        health effects, have been denied compensation under the Act as \n        a result of potentially flawed calculations based on records \n        that are incomplete or in error as well as the use of incorrect \n        models.\n            (7) Achieving the purposes of the Act with respect to \n        workers at Rocky Flats is more likely to be achieved if claims \n        by those workers are subject to the administrative procedures \n        applicable to members of the special exposure cohort.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to revise the Energy \nEmployees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act so as to \ninclude certain past and present Rocky Flats workers as members of the \nspecial exposure cohort.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF MEMBER OF SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 3621(14) of the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. \n7384l(14)) is amended by adding at the end of paragraph (14) the \nfollowing:\n                    ``(D) The employee was so employed as a Department \n                of Energy employee or a Department of Energy contractor \n                employee for a number of work days aggregating at least \n                250 work days before January 1, 2006, at the Rocky \n                Flats site in Colorado.''.\n    (b) Reapplication.--A claim that an individual qualifies, by reason \nof subparagraph (D) of section 3621(14) of that Act (as added by \nsubsection (a)), for compensation or benefits under that Act shall be \nconsidered for compensation or benefits (notwithstanding any denial of \nany other claim for compensation with respect to that individual)."
