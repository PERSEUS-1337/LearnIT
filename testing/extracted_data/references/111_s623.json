    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Pre-existing Condition Patient \nProtection Act of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the United States Census Bureau, \n        45,700,000 individuals were uninsured in 2007.\n            (2) According to a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund, \n        the number of underinsured adults ages 19 to 64 has jumped 60 \n        percent over the last 4 years, from 16,000,000 in 2003 to \n        25,000,000 in 2007.\n            (3) According to the Center for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, approximately 45 percent of Americans have at least \n        1 chronic condition.\n            (4) Forty-four States currently allow insurance companies \n        to deny coverage for, limit coverage for, or charge increased \n        premiums for a pre-existing condition.\n            (5) Over 26,000,000 individuals were enrolled in private \n        individual market health plans in 2007. Under the amendments \n        made by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n        of 1996, these individuals have no protections against pre-\n        existing condition exclusions or waiting periods.\n            (6) When an individual has a 63-day gap in health insurance \n        coverage, pre-existing condition exclusions, such as limiting \n        coverage, can be placed on them when they become insured under \n        a new health insurance policy.\n            (7) Eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions for all \n        individuals is a vital safeguard to ensuring all Americans have \n        access to health care when in need.\n            (8) According to a Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard School \n        of Public Health public opinion poll, 58 percent of Americans \n        strongly favor the Federal Government requiring health \n        insurance companies to cover anyone who applies for health \n        coverage, even if they have a prior illness.\n\nSEC. 3.
