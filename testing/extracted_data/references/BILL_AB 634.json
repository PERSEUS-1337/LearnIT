The association shall update this list no less frequently than every six months. The association shall not publish this list or provide a copy of it to any third party, or use or sell the list for commercial purposes. The association shall provide a copy of the list to a member for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association. However, notwithstanding this requirement, if the association reasonably believes that the recipient of the list will use the list for another purpose or provide a copy or disclose the contents to another party, the association shall refuse to provide the member a copy of the list.\n(2)(A)If an owner of a time-share interest in the time-share plan makes a request to the association to communicate by mail with the membership of the association for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association, and the board of administration of the association or the managing entity determines that the mailing pertains to a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association, the requested mailing shall be made within 30 days after receipt of a request and payment by the owner of actual costs in accordance with subparagraph (B).

To the extent possible, the superior court shall dispose of an application on an expedited basis. In the event the court orders the distribution of the requested communication, it may order the board or managing entity to pay the owner\u2019s costs, including attorney\u2019s fees reasonably incurred to enforce the owner\u2019s rights, unless the board or the managing entity can prove it refused to distribute the communication in good faith because of a reasonable belief that the requested communication did not pertain to a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association.\n(D)It is unlawful for the board of administration of the association or managing entity to refuse to distribute a communication requested by an owner if the requested communication would address a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association.\n(3)Section 8330 of the Corporations Code shall not apply to time-share associations under this chapter.\n(f)For single site time-share plans and component sites of a multisite time-share plan located outside of the state, the association shall be subject to the provisions set forth in this section. The association must be in compliance with the applicable laws of the state or jurisdiction in which the time-share property or component site is located, and if a conflict exists between laws of the situs state and the requirements set forth in this section, the law of the situs state shall control. If the association and the time-share instruments provide for the matters contained in this section, the association shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this section and neither the developer nor the association shall be required to make revisions to the time-share instruments in order to comply with the section."
