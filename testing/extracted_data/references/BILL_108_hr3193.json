CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n        provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n        shall not be infringed.\n            (2) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n        protects the rights of individuals, including those who are not \n        members of a militia or engaged in military service or \n        training, to keep and bear arms.\n            (3) The law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia \n        are deprived by local laws of handguns, rifles, and shotguns \n        that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the \n        rest of the United States for sporting use and for lawful \n        defense of persons, homes, and families.\n            (4) The District of Columbia has the highest per capita \n        murder rate in the Nation, which may be attributed in part to \n        local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-abiding \n        persons who would otherwise be able to defend themselves and \n        their loved ones in their own homes and businesses.\n            (5) The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by the \n        Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, and the Brady Handgun \n        Violence Prevention Act of 1993, provide comprehensive Federal \n        regulations applicable in the District of Columbia as \n        elsewhere. In addition, existing District of Columbia criminal \n        laws punish possession and illegal use of firearms by violent \n        criminals and felons. Consequently, there is no need for local \n        laws which only disarm law-abiding citizens.\n            (6) Legislation is required to correct the District of \n        Columbia's law in order to restore the rights of its citizens \n        under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n        and thereby enhance public safety.\n\nSEC. 3. REFORM D.C. COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT FIREARMS.\n\n    Section 4 of the Act entitled ``An Act to prohibit the killing of \nwild birds and wild animals in the District of Columbia'', approved \nJune 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 809; sec. 1-303.43, D.C. Official Code) is \namended by adding at the end the following: ``This section shall not be \nconstrued to permit the Council, the Mayor, or any governmental or \nregulatory authority of the District of Columbia to prohibit, \nconstructively prohibit, or unduly burden the ability of persons \notherwise permitted to possess firearms under Federal law from \nacquiring, possessing in their homes or businesses, or using for \nsporting, self-protection or other lawful purposes, any firearm neither \nprohibited by Federal law nor regulated by the National Firearms Act. \nThe District of Columbia shall not have authority to enact laws or \nregulations that discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use \nof firearms.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
