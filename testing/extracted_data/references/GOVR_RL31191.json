    "content": "Military Order of November 13, 2001. Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism  By the authority vested in me as President and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of theUnited States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including theAuthorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution (Public Law 107-40, 115 Stat. 224) andsections 821 and 836 of title 10, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:  Section 1. Findings.  (a) International terrorists, including members of al Qaida, have carried out attacks on United Statesdiplomatic and military personnel and facilities abroad and on citizens and property within theUnited States on a scale that has created a state of armed conflict that requires the use of the UnitedStates Armed Forces.  (b) In light of grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism, including the terrorist attacks onSeptember 11, 2001, on the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense in the nationalcapital region, on the World Trade Center in New York, and on civilian aircraft such as inPennsylvania, I proclaimed a national emergency on September 14, 2001 (Proc. 7463, Declarationof National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks).  (c) Individuals acting alone and in concert involved in international terrorism possess both thecapability and the intention to undertake further terrorist attacks against the United States that, if notdetected and prevented, will cause mass deaths, mass injuries, and massive destruction of property,and may place at risk the continuity of the operations of the United States Government.  (d) The ability of the United States to protect the United States and its citizens, and to help its alliesand other cooperating nations protect their nations and their citizens, from such further terroristattacks depends in significant part upon using the United States Armed Forces to identify terroristsand those who support them, to disrupt their activities, and to eliminate their ability to conduct orsupport such attacks.  (e) To protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operationsand prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order pursuant tosection 2 hereof to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and otherapplicable laws by military tribunals.  (f) Given the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism, andto the extent provided by and under this order, I find consistent with section 836 of title 10, UnitedStates Code, that it is not practicable to apply in military commissions under this order the principlesof law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the UnitedStates district courts.  (g) Having fully considered the magnitude of the potential deaths, injuries, and property destructionthat would result from potential acts of terrorism against the United States, and the probability thatsuch acts will occur, I have determined that an extraordinary emergency exists for national defensepurposes, that this emergency constitutes an urgent and compelling government interest, and thatissuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency.
