FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Tracking the location of vehicles and the identities of \n        owners for the purpose of taxation, fines or fees has the \n        potential to be misused, and such collected data could be \n        hacked or used for privacy-invading purposes.\n            (2) Government and corporate websites are frequently \n        hacked, and driver-tracking databases may be no more \n        invulnerable to hacking; to the advantage of criminals, \n        stalkers, and identity thieves.\n            (3) GPS tracking enables the technology for automatic \n        speeding, parking and other traffic tickets, charging variable \n        tax rates due to the time of day or other factors, including \n        characterizing driving behavior from acceleration and braking \n        speed, evasive maneuvers such as swerving to avoid a child or \n        deer in the road, or driving in what the Government may believe \n        is a ``fuel-wasting'' manner.\n            (4) GPS tracking schemes may require vehicle owners to \n        maintain bank accounts for the debiting of resultant fees. This \n        may be a hardship for many low-income vehicle owners, as well \n        as opening new hacking vulnerabilities for bank accounts of \n        vehicle owners.\n            (5) The existing gas tax is a rare example of a user fee, \n        whereby vehicle owners pay for the roads they use when \n        purchasing fuel. The tax has successfully provided necessary \n        funding for many decades.\n            (6) There are far less intrusive ways than location-based \n        tracking to get electric vehicle and hybrid owners to pay for \n        their road usage.\n            (7) Vehicle owners must not be required to surrender their \n        Fourth Amendment rights and be tracked everywhere as a \n        condition of driving on public roads.\n            (8) Amendment IV of the United States Constitution states \n        ``The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n        houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \n        seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, \n        but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and \n        particularly describing the place to be searched, and the \n        persons or things to be seized.''.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to prohibit the \nreplacement or supplementation of the Federal gasoline excise tax with \nany tax or fee based upon vehicle location or distance traveled, \nwhether determined by global positioning satellite (GPS), license plate \nreading cameras or any other method of determining owner registration \nor identity information, and vehicle location or distance traveled.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF A GPS, LOCATION OR MILEAGE BASED TAX.\n\n    (a) In General.--It is contrary to the public policy of the United \nStates to require the placement or use of any GPS, location, distance \ntracking system, or any other system to collect identities of vehicle \nowners by any remote means such as license plate reading cameras, radio \nfrequency identification (RFID) devices or by any other means.\n    (b) The Federal gasoline excise tax may not be replaced or \nsupplemented with any tax, fee or fine based upon vehicle location or \ndistance traveled, whether determined by global positioning satellite \n(GPS), cameras that read license plates or any other method of \ndetermining vehicle location, distance traveled or registration and \nidentity data.\n    (c) No motor vehicle may be required to have any device on board \nthe vehicle or to transmit data to any off board device which tracks or \nrecords, collects, stores, transmits and location, distance, or \nregistration or driver identity information.\n\nSEC. 4. LIMITATIONS ON VEHICLE-TO-VEHICLE AND VEHICLE-TO-INFRASTRUCTURE \n              COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n    (a) No public funds may be used to study or implement or require \nthe use of any method of tracking or reporting vehicle movement or \nlocation for the purpose of taxes, user fees, traffic fines, accident \ninvestigation, or to communicate with other vehicles or infrastructure.\n    (b) Vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication \nsystems for the purposes of recording or transmitting or storing for \nlater retrieval location, registration, identity, or speed data are \nprohibited, except for those vehicles owned or leased by Federal \nGovernment agencies in question.\n    (c) Any such transmissions may only be used for momentary accident \navoidance or completely anonymized traffic reporting.\n\nSEC. 5. ``BLACK BOX'' DATA RECORDERS.\n\n    No motor vehicle shall be required by any Federal agency to have \ninstalled and operational any ``black box'' accident data recorder that \nrecords any vehicle data for a period longer than the last five minutes \nof vehicle operation, and such devices may never be capable of \nrecording audio, images, or video from inside the vehicle. Any such \ndevice may not broadcast or transmit any data in any way, except by a \ndirect cable connection to a computer.\n\nSEC. 6. VEHICLE OWNERS EXEMPTED.\n\n    No provisions of this Act shall prohibit the use by vehicle owners \nof GPS or other technologies for tracking the location of their own \nvehicle.\n\nSEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n    The Secretary of the Department of Transportation shall submit to \nCongress, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act, a report describing the actions taken to ensure permanent \ncompliance with this Act."
