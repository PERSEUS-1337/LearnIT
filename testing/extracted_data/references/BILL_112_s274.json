FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Medications are important to the management of chronic \n        diseases that require long-term or lifelong therapy. \n        Pharmacists are uniquely qualified as medication experts to \n        work with patients to manage their medications and chronic \n        conditions and play a key role in helping patients take their \n        medications as prescribed.\n            (2) Nonadherence with medications is a significant problem. \n        According to a report by the World Health Organization, in \n        developed countries, only 50 percent of patients with chronic \n        diseases adhere to medication therapies. For example, in the \n        United States only 51 percent of patients taking blood pressure \n        medications and only 40 to 70 percent of patients taking \n        antidepressant medications adhere to prescribed therapies.\n            (3) Failure to take medications as prescribed costs over \n        $290,000,000,000 annually. The problem of nonadherence is \n        particularly important for patients with chronic diseases that \n        require use of medications. Poor adherence leads to unnecessary \n        disease progression, reduced functional status, lower quality \n        of life, and premature death.\n            (4) When patients adhere to or comply with prescribed \n        medication therapy it is possible to reduce higher-cost medical \n        attention, such as emergency department visits and catastrophic \n        care, and avoid the preventable human costs that impact \n        patients and the individuals who care for them.\n            (5) Studies have clearly demonstrated that community-based \n        medication therapy management services provided by pharmacists \n        improve health care outcomes and reduce spending.\n            (6) The Asheville Project, a diabetes program designed for \n        city employees in Asheville, North Carolina, that is delivered \n        by community pharmacists, resulted over a 5-year period in a \n        decrease in total direct medical costs ranging from $1,622 to \n        $3,356 per patient per year, a 50 percent decrease in the use \n        of sick days, and an increase in productivity accounting for an \n        estimated savings of $18,000 annually.\n            (7) Another project involving care provided by pharmacists \n        to patients with high cholesterol increased compliance with \n        medication to 90 percent from a national average of 40 percent.\n            (8) In North Carolina, the ChecKmeds NC program, which \n        offers eligible seniors one-on-one medication therapy \n        management consultations with pharmacists, has saved an \n        estimated $34,000,000 in healthcare costs and avoided numerous \n        health problems since implementation in 2007 for the more than \n        31,000 seniors receiving such consultations.\n            (9) Results similar to those found under such projects and \n        programs have been achieved in several other demonstrations \n        using community pharmacists.\n\nSEC. 3.
