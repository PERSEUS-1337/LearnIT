STATEMENT OF POLICY; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \nwork cooperatively with the Russian Federation to prevent the diversion \nof weapons of mass destruction and material (including nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical weapons) and scientific and technical \nexpertise necessary to design and build weapons of mass destruction.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the national security interest of the United \n        States to reduce the number of nuclear warheads in the United \n        States and Russian arsenals, to reduce the quantity of nuclear \n        weapons materials in the United States and Russia, and to \n        expand existing programs to prevent diversion and proliferation \n        of Russian nuclear weapons and fissile materials.\n            (2) The President should have at his disposal the ability \n        to successfully implement cooperative threat reduction programs \n        that prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n            (3) As part of the effort to prevent the proliferation of \n        weapons of mass destruction, the United States should work with \n        the Russian Federation to create a comprehensive inventory and \n        data exchange of all United States and Russian nuclear weapons-\n        grade material.\n            (4) There should be a clear plan for the implementation of \n        the reductions in nuclear arsenals agreed upon by President \n        Bush and President Putin.\n            (5) The United States should continue to observe the \n        currently maintained moratorium on nuclear tests. If the \n        President determines that it is in the interest of the United \n        States to resume testing, then he should inform Congress 12 \n        months prior to the resumption of testing, giving Congress an \n        opportunity to express itself on this most important issue.\n\n         TITLE I--COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION WAIVER AUTHORITY\n\nSEC. 101.
