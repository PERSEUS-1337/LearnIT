FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Transportation infrastructure contributes to the \n        pollution of surface and ground water because it is comprised \n        of impervious surfaces that concentrate contaminants which are \n        introduced into the water supply during storms.\n            (2) Scientists and engineers have developed numerous \n        technologies that can be incorporated into transportation \n        infrastructure which control stormwater and mitigate nonpoint \n        source water pollution.\n            (3) There has not been widespread implementation of green \n        transportation infrastructure by governments or private \n        industry because of technical, regulatory, and social barriers, \n        such as lack of training and awareness for builders.\n            (4) The Federal Highway Administration, in partnership with \n        the Environmental Protection Agency, has the technical \n        expertise and capacity to promote the use of green \n        transportation infrastructure technologies by State and local \n        governments and private industry through education and outreach \n        and technical assistance programs.\n\nSEC. 3.
