SHORT TITLE; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Reserve \nFree Enterprise Act''.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To facilitate the development of private enterprise and \n        jobs by promoting competition with the Board of Governors of \n        the Federal Reserve System (hereafter in this section referred \n        to as the ``Board'') in the provision of check-clearing and \n        other services.\n            (2) To further promote such competition by having the Board \n        fairly and accurately price the services provided by the Board \n        or any Federal reserve bank.\n            (3) To save taxpayer funds by eliminating the subsidy the \n        Board provides through the maintenance of a pricing system for \n        check-clearing and other services which does not fully recover \n        the cost of providing such services.\n            (4) To end the practice of the Board of bundling together \n        all the costs and revenue from all check-clearing and other \n        services provided by the Board or any Federal reserve bank and \n        require the Board to price each readily identifiable component \n        of each such service in a way that ensures that the full amount \n        of the costs incurred which are allocable to the provision of \n        such component is fully recovered.\n            (5) To stimulate innovation and provide a wider range of \n        check-clearing and other services through market competition \n        and the free flow of information.\n\nSEC. 2.
