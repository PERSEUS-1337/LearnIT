FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Government of Sudan has engaged in an orchestrated \n        campaign of genocide in Darfur, Sudan, and has severely \n        restricted humanitarian and human rights workers' access to \n        Darfur in an attempt to inflict further harm on the Fur, \n        Masalit, and Zaghawa people of Darfur and to prevent the \n        collection of evidence of war crimes and crimes against \n        humanity.\n            (2) As a result of this campaign, as many as 30,000 people \n        have been killed, more than 1,000,000 people have been \n        displaced within Sudan, and approximately 200,000 have been \n        made refugees in Chad.\n            (3) As many as 320,000 people may die unless humanitarian \n        aid is immediately delivered to the affected individuals.\n            (4) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n        issued a report which ``identified... massive human rights \n        violations in Darfur perpetrated by the Government of Sudan and \n        its proxy militia, which may constitute war crimes and/or \n        crimes against humanity''.\n            (5) The Government of Chad, under President Idriss Deby, \n        has served an important role in facilitating a renewable \n        ``humanitarian cease-fire'' between the Government of Sudan and \n        the two rebel groups challenging that Government in Darfur, the \n        Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation \n        Movement, and has been a crucial partner in permitting \n        humanitarian assistance to reach refugees who have crossed from \n        Darfur to Chad in the tens of thousands.\n            (6) The cooperation and mediation of the SPLM is critical \n        to bringing about a political settlement between the \n        Government, the Sudanese Liberation Army, and the Justice and \n        Equality Movement.\n            (7) Practical implementation of a comprehensive peace \n        agreement between the SPLM and the Government of Sudan is \n        impossible without the implementation of a peace agreement for \n        Darfur.\n\nSEC. 3.
