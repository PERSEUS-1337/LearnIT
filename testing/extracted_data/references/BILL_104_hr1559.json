FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Reforms required by the Telephone Disclosure and \n        Dispute Resolution Act of 1992 have improved the reputation of \n        the pay-per-call industry and resulted in regulations that have \n        reduced the incidence of misleading practices that are harmful \n        to the public interest.\n            (2) Among the successful reforms is a prohibition on \n        charges being assessed for calls to 800 telephone numbers or \n        other telephone numbers advertised or widely understood to be \n        toll free.\n            (3) Nevertheless, certain interstate pay-per-call \n        businesses are taking advantage of an exception in the \n        prohibition on charging for information conveyed during a call \n        to a ``toll-free'' number to continue to engage in misleading \n        practices. These practices are not in compliance with the \n        intent of Congress in passing the Telephone Disclosure and \n        Dispute Resolution Act.\n            (4) Therefore, it is necessary for Congress to clarify that \n        its intent is that charges for information provided during a \n        call to an 800 number or other number widely advertised and \n        understood to be toll free shall not be assessed to the calling \n        party unless the calling party agrees to be billed according to \n        the terms of a written subscription agreement.\n\nSEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Section 228(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 \n(47 U.S.C. 228(c)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking subparagraph (C) of paragraph (7) and \n        inserting the following:\n                    ``(C) the calling party being charged for \n                information conveyed during the call unless--\n                            ``(i) the calling party has a written \n                        subscription agreement with the information \n                        provider that meets the requirements of \n                        paragraph (8); or\n                            ``(ii) the calling party is charged in \n                        accordance with paragraph (9); or''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n            ``(8) Subscription agreements for billing for information \n        provided via toll-free calls.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph \n                (7)(C)(i), a written subscription agreement shall \n                specify the terms and conditions under which the \n                information is offered and include--\n                            ``(i) the rate at which charges are \n                        assessed for the information;\n                            ``(ii) the information provider's name;\n                            ``(iii) the information provider's business \n                        address;\n                            ``(iv) the information provider's regular \n                        business telephone number;\n                            ``(v) the information provider's agreement \n                        to notify the subscriber at least 30 days in \n                        advance of all future changes in the rates \n                        charged for the information;\n                            ``(vi) the signature of a legally competent \n                        subscriber agreeing to the terms of the \n                        agreement; and\n                            ``(vii) the subscriber's choice of payment \n                        method, which may be by phone bill or credit or \n                        calling card.\n                    ``(B) Billing arrangements.--If a subscriber \n                elects, pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vii), to pay by \n                means of a phone bill--\n                            ``(i) the agreement shall clearly explain \n                        that the subscriber will be assessed for calls \n                        made to the information service from the \n                        subscribers phone line;\n                            ``(ii) the phone bill shall include, in \n                        prominent type, the following disclaimer:\n                                    `Common carriers may not disconnect \n                                local or long distance telephone \n                                service for failure to pay disputed \n                                charges for information services.'; and\n                            ``(iii) the phone bill shall clearly list \n                        the 800 number dialed.\n                    ``(C) Use of pin's to prevent unauthorized use.--A \n                written agreement does not meet the requirements of \n                this paragraph unless it provides the subscriber a \n                personal identification number to obtain access to the \n                information provided, and includes instructions on its \n                use.\n                    ``(D) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding paragraph \n                (7)(C), a written agreement that meets the requirements \n                of this paragraph is not required--\n                            ``(i) for services provided pursuant to a \n                        tariff that has been approved or permitted to \n                        take effect by the Commission or a State \n                        commission; or\n                            ``(ii) for any purchase of goods or of \n                        services that are not information services.\n                    ``(E) Termination of service.--On complaint by any \n                person, a carrier may terminate the provision of \n                service to an information provider unless the provider \n                supplies evidence of a written agreement that meets the \n                requirements of this section.
