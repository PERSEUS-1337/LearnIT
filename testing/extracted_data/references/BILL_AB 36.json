Brown Act (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 54950)).\n(b) The legislative body of a local agency may adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing the local law enforcement agency in that jurisdiction to apply for tactical surplus military equipment. The ordinance or resolution shall comply with both of the following requirements:\n(1) The ordinance shall include a list of the types of tactical surplus military equipment that the legislative body authorizes the local law enforcement agency to acquire.\n(2) The legislative body shall review the ordinance or resolution at least annually. During the review, the legislative body shall vote on whether to renew the ordinance or resolution authorizing the acquisition of tactical surplus military equipment. If the legislative body does not approve a renewal pursuant to this paragraph, the authorization shall expire.\n(c) This section shall not be construed to require the legislative body of a local agency to approve the acquisition of each individual item of tactical surplus military equipment, unless specified by the ordinance or resolution adopted pursuant to subdivision (b).\n(d) The Legislature finds and declares that this section constitutes a matter of statewide concern, and shall apply to charter cities and charter counties. The provisions of this section shall supersede any inconsistent provisions in the charter of any city, county, or city and county.\n(e) (1) The state coordinator, by January 31, 2016, shall develop a list of tactical surplus military equipment. The list shall identify surplus military equipment that warrants public input pursuant to this article. The state coordinator shall post this list on its Internet Web site and update it at least annually.\n(2) In developing the list required by this subdivision, the state coordinator shall consider the current list of controlled property designated by the federal Defense Logistics Agency, as well as any other state or federal regulations or policies governing the use of surplus military equipment.\n(3) The list required by this subdivision shall include, at minimum, the following types of equipment:\n(A) Weapons.\n(B) Armored vehicles.\n(C) Watercraft.\n(D) Aircraft.\n(E) Other tactical equipment as determined by the state coordinator.\n(f) Notwithstanding any other law, a local agency shall not apply to receive the following types of surplus military equipment:\n(1) Tracked armored vehicles.\n(2) Weaponized vehicles.\n(3) Firearms of .50 caliber or greater.\n(4) Ammunition of .50 caliber or greater.\n(5) Grenade launchers.\n(6) Bayonets.\n(7) Camouflage uniforms.\nSEC. 3.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 54145 to the Government Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies. Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:\nRequiring local agencies to hold public meetings prior to the acquisition of federal surplus military equipment further exposes that activity to public scrutiny and enhances public access to information concerning the conduct of the people\u2019s business.\nSEC. 4.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII \u2009 B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district under this act would result from a legislative mandate that is within the scope of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution."
