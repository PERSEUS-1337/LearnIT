FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Taliban regime denied women in Afghanistan the most \n        basic human rights, including the rights to work, to an \n        education, to health care, and to move freely.\n            (2) The Taliban regime subjected any women who attempted to \n        exercise her human rights to beatings and imprisonment and \n        women in Afghanistan who lived under the Taliban regime suffer \n        from long-term consequences of such oppression.\n            (3) According to the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs, as \n        a result of 23 years of war and the restrictions imposed by the \n        Taliban after the war ended, most women in Afghanistan do not \n        have adequate food, access to health care, or opportunities for \n        education, employment, or economic livelihood, and such women \n        have experienced violence to themselves or their families.\n            (4) Women in Afghanistan have one of the highest mortality \n        rates in the world, with an estimated 16,000 maternal deaths \n        annually.\n            (5) The strengthening of institutions and non-governmental \n        organizations that are led by women in Afghanistan is essential \n        to building civil society and holding the Government of \n        Afghanistan accountable for protecting women's rights and human \n        rights.\n            (6) It is necessary for significant numbers of women to \n        hold positions within the Government of Afghanistan, including \n        in the cabinet, the Loya Jirga, government commissions, and \n        other key posts, and to hold official positions within United \n        Nations agencies working in Afghanistan to foster democracy and \n        protect the rights of women in Afghanistan.\n            (7) Despite the collapse of the Taliban regime in \n        Afghanistan in 2001, warlords and the Taliban are reorganizing \n        and reemerging in Afghanistan, imperiling the stability of the \n        central government, the security of the people, and the \n        exercise of human rights by women.\n            (8) The United Nations Secretary-General's Special \n        Representative to Afghanistan said that the deteriorating \n        security situation in Afghanistan may force a delay in \n        elections in Afghanistan and that expansion of international \n        peacekeeping forces is necessary to make fair, democratic voter \n        registration and elections possible.\n            (9) In January 2004, the Government of Afghanistan adopted \n        a new constitution that includes basic rights for women, but \n        enforcement of the provisions of the constitution will be \n        difficult unless security in Afghanistan is dramatically \n        improved.\n            (10) Despite the fact that violations of human rights and \n        women's rights continue with impunity in Afghanistan, \n        Provincial Reconstruction Teams composed of United States \n        military forces, Department of Defense civil affairs officers, \nrepresentatives of United States agencies and allied personnel do not \nhave the authority needed to intervene to stop such violations.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the protection of the rights of women, the \n        reestablishment of democracy, and the elimination of terrorism \n        are essential to the reconstruction of a stable Afghanistan and \n        to achieve such a reconstruction the international community \n        should commit substantial resources, including the expansion of \n        international peacekeeping forces inside and outside of the \n        city of Kabul;\n            (2) the United States should provide strong support for the \n        Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs and the Afghan Independent \n        Human Rights Commission, both of which were created by the Bonn \n        Agreement to remedy past violations of women's rights and human \n        rights and to establish institutions and programs to advance \n        such rights;\n            (3) the mandate of international peacekeeping forces and \n        Provincial Reconstruction Teams composed of United States \n        military forces, Department of Defense civil affairs officers, \n        representatives of United States agencies and allied personnel \n        should be authorized to intervene to stop violations of human \n        rights and women's rights;\n            (4) United States foreign policy should ensure that the \n        rights of women and girls are restored in Afghanistan, assist \n        in the recovery of women and girls from the repression of the \n        Taliban and 23 years of war, and strengthen Afghan institutions \n        that are led by women; and\n            (5) grants and assistance provided to Afghanistan should be \n        conditioned upon the Government of Afghanistan adhering to \n        international standards for women's rights and human rights.\n\nSEC. 4.
