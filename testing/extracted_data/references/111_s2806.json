Such programs shall be \n        referred to as `wellness programs'.\n            ``(2) Definition and general rule.--\n                    ``(A) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, \n                a wellness program is any program designed to promote \n                health or prevent disease, including a program designed \n                to encourage individuals to adopt healthy behaviors.\n                    ``(B) General rule.--For purposes of subsections \n                (a)(2) and (b)(2) (which provide exceptions to the \n                general prohibitions against discrimination based on a \n                health factor for group health plan provisions that \n                vary benefits (including cost-sharing mechanisms) or \n                the premium or contribution for similarly situated \n                individuals in connection with a wellness program that \n                satisfies the requirements of this subsection), if none \n                of the conditions for obtaining a reward under a \n                wellness program are based on an individual satisfying \n                a standard that is related to a health factor, under \n                this subsection, such wellness program does not violate \n                this section if participation in the program is made \n                available to all similarly situated individuals. If any \n                of the conditions for obtaining a reward under such a \n                wellness program is based on an individual satisfying a \n                standard that is related to a health factor, the \n                wellness program shall not violate this section if the \n                requirements of paragraph (4) of this section are \n                satisfied.\n            ``(3) Wellness programs not subject to requirements.--If \n        none of the conditions for obtaining a reward under a wellness \n        program are based on an individual satisfying a standard that \n        is related to a health factor (or if a wellness program does \n        not provide a reward), the wellness program shall not violate \n        this section, if participation in the program is made available \n        to all similarly situated individuals. Such programs need not \n        satisfy the requirements of paragraph (4), if participation in \n        the program is made available to all similarly situated \n        individuals. Wellness programs described in this paragraph \n        include the following:\n                    ``(A) A program that reimburses all or part of the \n                cost for memberships in a fitness center.\n                    ``(B) A diagnostic testing program that provides a \n                reward for participation and does not base any part of \n                the reward on outcomes.\n                    ``(C) A program that encourages preventive care \n                through the waiver of the copayment or deductible \n                requirement under a group health plan for the costs of, \n                for example, prenatal care or well-baby visits.\n                    ``(D) A program that reimburses employees for the \n                costs of smoking cessation programs without regard to \n                whether the employee quits smoking.\n                    ``(E) A program that provides a reward to employees \n                for attending a monthly health education seminar.\n            ``(4) Wellness programs subject to requirements.--If any of \n        the conditions for obtaining a reward under a wellness program \n        is based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related \n        to a health factor, the wellness program shall not violate this \n        section if the requirements of this paragraph are satisfied.\n                    ``(A) The reward for the wellness program, coupled \n                with the reward for other wellness programs with \n                respect to the plan that require satisfaction of a \n                standard related to a health factor, shall not exceed \n                30 percent of the cost of employee-only coverage under \n                the plan. However, if, in addition to employees, any \n                class of dependents (such as spouses or spouses and \n                dependent children) may participate in the wellness \n                program, the reward shall not exceed 30 percent of the \n                cost of the coverage in which an employee and any \n                dependents are enrolled. For purposes of this \n                paragraph, the cost of coverage shall be determined \n                based on the total amount of employer and employee \n                contributions for the benefit package under which the \n                employee is (or the employee and any dependents are) \n                receiving coverage. A reward may be in the form of a \n                discount or rebate of a premium or contribution, a \n                waiver of all or part of a cost-sharing mechanism (such \n                as deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance), the \n                absence of a surcharge, or the value of a benefit that \n                would otherwise not be provided under the plan. The \n                Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n                the Treasury may increase the reward available under \n                this subparagraph to up to 50 percent of the cost of \n                coverage under the plan if such Secretaries determine \n                that such an increase is appropriate.\n                    ``(B) The wellness program shall be reasonably \n                designed to promote health or prevent disease.
