    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Prehistoric Trackways National \nMonument Establishment Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Monument.--The term ``Monument'' means the Prehistoric \n        Trackways National Monument established by section 4(a).\n            (2) Public land.--The term ``public land'' has the meaning \n        given the term ``public lands'' in section 103 of the Federal \n        Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702).\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 1987, a major deposit of Paleozoic Era fossilized \n        footprint megatrackways was discovered in the Robledo Mountains \n        in southern New Mexico;\n            (2) the trackways contain footprints of numerous \n        amphibians, reptiles, and insects (including previously unknown \n        species), plants, and petrified wood dating back approximately \n        280,000,000 years, which collectively provide new opportunities \n        to understand animal behaviors and environments from a time \n        predating the dinosaurs;\n            (3) title III of Public Law 101-578 (104 Stat. 2860)--\n                    (A) provided interim protection for the site at \n                which the trackways were discovered; and\n                    (B) directed the Secretary of the Interior to--\n                            (i) prepare a study assessing the \n                        significance of the site; and\n                            (ii) based on the study, provide \n                        recommendations for protection of the \n                        paleontological resources at the site;\n            (4) the Bureau of Land Management completed the Paleozoic \n        Trackways Scientific Study Report in 1994, which characterized \n        the site as containing ``the most scientifically significant \n        Early Permian tracksites'' in the world;\n            (5) despite the conclusion of the study and the \n        recommendations for protection, the site remains unprotected \n        and many irreplaceable trackways specimens have been lost to \n        vandalism or theft; and\n            (6) designation of the trackways site as a National \n        Monument would protect the unique fossil resources for present \n        and future generations while allowing for public education and \n        continued scientific research opportunities.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--In order to conserve, protect, and enhance the \nunique and nationally important paleontological, scientific, \neducational, scenic, and recreational resources and values of the \npublic land described in subsection (b), there is established the \nPrehistoric Trackways National Monument in the State of New Mexico.\n    (b) Description of Land.--The Monument shall consist of \napproximately 5,367 acres of public land in Dona Ana County, New \nMexico, as generally depicted on the map entitled ``Prehistoric \nTrackways National Monument'' and dated June 1, 2006.\n    (c) Map; Legal Description.--\n            (1) In general.--As soon as practicable after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall prepare and submit \n        to Congress an official map and legal description of the \n        Monument.\n            (2) Corrections.--The map and legal description submitted \n        under paragraph (1) shall have the same force and effect as if \n        included in this Act, except that the Secretary may correct any \n        clerical or typographical errors in the legal description and \n        the map.\n            (3) Conflict between map and legal description.--In the \n        case of a conflict between the map and the legal description, \n        the map shall control.\n            (4) Availability of map and legal description.--Copies of \n        the map and legal description shall be on file and available \n        for public inspection in the appropriate offices of the Bureau \n        of Land Management.\n    (d) Minor Boundary Adjustments.--If additional paleontological \nresources are discovered on public land adjacent to the Monument after \nthe date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary may make minor \nboundary adjustments to the Monument to include the resources in the \nMonument.\n\nSEC. 5.
