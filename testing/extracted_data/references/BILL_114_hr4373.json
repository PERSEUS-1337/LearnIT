FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Alcohol-impaired driving fatalities represent \n        approximately one-third of all highway fatalities in the United \n        States in a given year.\n            (2) First offenders were responsible for 75 percent of \n        drunk driving arrests and 25 percent were from repeat \n        offenders.\n            (3) In 2013, there were 10,076 alcohol-impaired driving \n        fatalities in the United States.\n            (4) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \n        partnered with automobile manufacturers to develop alcohol \n        detection technologies that may be installed in vehicles to \n        prevent drunk driving.\n            (5) An estimated 59,000 lives and $343,000,000,000 may be \n        saved over a 15-year period by the widespread installation of \n        alcohol detection technologies in motor vehicles.\n\nSEC. 3. ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO END DRUNK DRIVING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 10 years after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue a final rule \nprescribing or amending a Federal motor vehicle safety standard that \nwould prevent operation of a motor vehicle when the operator is under \nthe influence of alcohol. The standard--\n            (1) shall prevent the operation of the motor vehicle if the \n        operator's blood alcohol content is above the legal limit; and\n            (2) shall require such technology to be--\n                    (A) reliable and accurate;\n                    (B) set at the legal limit;\n                    (C) unobtrusive and fast;\n                    (D) tamper-proof/circumvention-resistant;\n                    (E) functionary in extreme environments (both hot \n                and cold); and\n                    (F) easily maintained.\n\nSEC. 4.
