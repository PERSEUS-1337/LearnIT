    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Communities Act of 2017''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Land use and public facility planning at both the State \n        and local levels have not had adequate financial resources to \n        fully incorporate the threats posed both by natural and human-\n        caused disasters, including acts of terrorism. Too frequently \n        this has resulted in costly disaster relief programs and \n        piecemeal, ad hoc security responses, such as unattractive \n        physical barriers that disrupt and adversely impact the \n        physical, social, economic, and civic lives in United States \n        communities.\n            (2) Although land use planning is rightfully within the \n        jurisdiction of State and local governments, encouraging \n        community safety by incorporating disaster mitigation and \n        emergency preparedness into comprehensive land use planning and \n        urban development should be supported by the Federal Government \n        and State governments.\n            (3) Disaster response and relief efforts impose significant \n        costs to United States taxpayers. Federal expenditure is \n        heavily weighted to post-disaster recovery, rather than \n        mitigation. Planning should be undertaken to prevent property \n        damage and human casualties, proactively incorporating \n        mitigation strategies and methods from the professional fields \n        of urban, community, and regional planning (including \n        transportation and land use), architecture, landscape \n        architecture, and urban design.\n            (4) Disaster planning has traditionally been biased toward \n        facilitating efficient responses and recovery, potentially to \n        the detriment of other planning goals. Comprehensive planning \n        can incorporate a range of effective practices for reducing \n        risks posed by natural disasters and terrorist acts. The \n        Federal Government and States should provide a supportive \n        climate and statutory context for comprehensive planning.\n            (5) Many States have land use statutes that do not \n        currently support comprehensive planning for safe communities, \n        and many States are undertaking efforts to update and reform \n        statutes to better enable planning efforts that incorporate \n        long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness.\n            (6) Efforts to coordinate State and regional investments, \n        including at-risk public infrastructure, with local plans \n        require additional State level planning.\n            (7) Comprehensive urban planning takes into account the \n        relationship between land use, transportation systems, water \n        and wastewater facilities, open space, and other critical \n        infrastructure in promoting safe and economically viable \n        communities.\n            (8) Local governments should integrate safety \n        considerations into comprehensive planning efforts.\n            (9) Safe housing is an essential component of safe \n        community development, and comprehensive planning should \n        incorporate modern, scientific planning techniques to ensure \n        that a broad range of safe housing options are available to all \n        members of the Nation's communities.\n            (10) Prevailing land use patterns often place people, \n        structures, and environmental systems at great risk. Poorly \n        regulated rural communities and small towns located on the \n        metropolitan fringe often face significant growth pressures, \n        resulting in haphazard development patterns that do not \n        incorporate regional impacts on critical disaster-reduction \n        systems, such as open space and wetlands.\n            (11) The Federal Government and State governments should \n        support the efforts of Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian \n        organizations to implement land use planning and community \n        development to improve the safety of housing and socioeconomic \n        conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians.\n\nSEC. 3.

governments that either do not have \n        land use planning statutes, or have inadequate or outmoded land \n        use planning statutes and regulations, such that planning \n        efforts have not adequately incorporated strategies to mitigate \n        natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror, or \n        otherwise hinder coordination of comprehensive planning and \n        emergency preparedness efforts;\n            (2) the creation or revision of State land use planning \n        statutes and local comprehensive land use plans or plan \n        elements in those

risks posed to communities by natural hazards and \n        terrorist acts, planning legislation, comprehensive plans, and \n        regulations are created based on cooperation between Federal, \n
