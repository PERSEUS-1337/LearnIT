FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In the United States, the chance of a woman developing \n        breast cancer during her lifetime has increased from 1 in 11 in \n        1975 to 1 in 8 today.\n            (2) Worldwide, breast cancer is the most frequently \n        diagnosed cancer in women with 1.3 million cases each year and \n        the leading cause of cancer death with more than 500,000 women \n        dying from the disease in 2010.\n            (3) More than 90 percent of deaths from breast cancer are \n        caused by metastasis, when breast cancer has spread to other \n        organs or bone.\n            (4) The National Cancer Institute estimated that breast \n        cancer care in the United States cost $16.5 billion in 2009 and \n        cost the Nation $12.1 billion in lost productivity.\n            (5) Very little has improved in terms of breast cancer \n        incidence, morbidity, and mortality rates over the past 40 \n        years.\n\nSEC. 4.
