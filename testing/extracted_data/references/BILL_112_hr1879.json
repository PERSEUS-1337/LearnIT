FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Ferries are a vital part of the United States \n        transportation system, carrying more than 100,000,000 \n        passengers annually in at least 38 States.\n            (2) In many congested metropolitan areas, ferries are one \n        of the few remaining options for significant transportation \n        capacity expansion.\n            (3) Ferries are the sole or primary transportation \n        connection for many island and isolated communities.\n            (4) Ferries provide a critical emergency evacuation \n        alternative for both large cities and remote locations.\n            (5) Ferries can be part of an interim solution when \n        transportation infrastructure fails. For example, ferries were \n        used to provide interim transportation after the terrorist \n        attacks in New York on September 11, 2001, disrupted train \n        service and after part of the San Francisco Bay Bridge \n        collapsed in the Loma Prieta earthquake.\n            (6) Ferries offer a relatively energy-efficient, \n        environmentally friendly, and low-stress mode of travel.\n            (7) Almost all of the largest and most important ferry \n        services are publicly owned or provide transportation at public \n        terminals, are integrated with other transportation modes, and \n        are operated in a manner to serve the public interest.\n            (8) According to the Secretary of Transportation, almost 25 \n        percent of United States ferries are 40 years or older and 5 \n        percent of United States ferries are 60 years or older.\n            (9) Federal investment in the United States ferry system is \n        necessary because--\n                    (A) of the unique and important role ferries play \n                in the United States transportation system;\n                    (B) of the large and growing need for new and \n                replacement ferry vessels and terminals; and\n                    (C) ferries do not fit neatly into other Federal \n                mode-specific transportation programs.\n            (10) The distribution of Federal ferry funds by formula is \n        appropriate because that method of distribution would dedicate \n        funding to the largest and most important public ferry systems.\n            (11) The distribution of Federal ferry funds by \n        discretionary awards is also appropriate because that method of \n        distribution would help initiate and expand ferry services \n        throughout the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. SECRETARY DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \nTransportation.\n\nSEC. 4.
