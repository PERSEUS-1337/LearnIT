The \nmortgagor may request not more than 1 additional meeting after the \nfirst meeting and before the end of the period during which foreclosure \nproceedings are stayed pursuant to an order under subsection (a) or \n(d). The mortgagee shall comply with that request not later than 30 \ndays after that request.\n    (c) Standard of Proof.--The court shall grant a motion under \nsubsection (a)(1) for an order under subsection (d), if the mortgagor \ndemonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence the following:\n            (1) That the mortgagor has a reasonable ability to make \n        payments described under subsection (d)(5).\n            (2) Financial hardship of the mortgagor.\n            (3) That the property subject to the mortgage would be the \n        primary residence of the mortgagor.\n    (d) Order Described.--An order under this subsection shall, \nbeginning on the date that is 60 days after the filing of the motion \nunder subsection (a)(1)--\n            (1) stay any foreclosure proceedings that have been brought \n        against the property that is subject to the federally related \n        mortgage loan, including proceedings before a State court and \n        eviction or detainer proceedings in a non-judicial foreclosure \n        State;\n            (2) remain in effect for a period of up to 3 years \n        beginning on the date that the order is entered, except that \n        the period shall terminate if an agreement under subsection (b) \n        is executed during such period;\n            (3) prohibit the assessment or collection of any late fees \n        regarding payments on the federally related mortgage loan;\n            (4) toll the statute of limitations for any other \n        applicable laws pertaining to the federally related mortgage \n        loan;\n            (5) require that the mortgagor make payments in an amount \n        the court determines appropriate, which may include the fair \n        market rental value of the property (determined by the court in \n        accordance with subsection (f)), to the mortgagee at such times \n        as the court determines appropriate;
