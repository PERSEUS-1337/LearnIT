    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) With the enactment of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (Division 30 (commencing with Section 40000) of the Public Resources Code), the Legislature declared that the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery and local agencies shall promote composting.\n(b) Since the enactment of the act, local governments and private industries have worked jointly to create an extensive material collection infrastructure and have implemented effective programs to achieve a statewide diversion rate greater than 50 percent.\n(c) Although California now leads the nation in waste reduction and recycling, the state continues to dispose of more than 15 million tons of compostable organics each year in solid waste landfills.\n(d) Composting organic materials results in substantial environmental and agricultural benefits, including the reduction of naturally occurring volatile organic compounds and ammonia.\n(e) The Economic and Technology Advancement Advisory Committee, formed pursuant to the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code), has identified composting as a cost-effective technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n(f) The application of compost in agriculture and landscaping has been shown to offer significant soil-carbon sequestration and water quality benefits, provide erosion control, reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and conserve water and irrigation-associated energy.\n(g) In 2007, the department\u2019s predecessor agency adopted Strategic Directive 6.1 to reduce the amount of organics in the waste stream by 50 percent by the year 2020.\n(h) In 2014, the state required organic waste generators that produce four cubic yards or more of organic waste a week to arrange to recycle this material (Chapter 12.9 (commencing with Section 42649.8) of the Public Resources Code).\n(i) To reduce the amount of organics in landfills, the state must promote the development and permitting of composting facilities and ensure that state regulations account for the lifecycle emissions reduction and water quality benefits of compost, while continuing to protect air and water quality.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 42649.87 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:\n42649.87.\n(a) The California Environmental Protection Agency, in coordination with the department, the State Water Resources Control Board, the State Air Resources Board, and the Department of Food and Agriculture, shall develop and implement policies to aid in diverting organic waste from landfills by promoting the use of agricultural, forestry, and urban organic waste as a feedstock for compost and by promoting the appropriate use of that compost throughout the state.\n(b) In developing policies pursuant to subdivision (a), the California Environmental Protection Agency shall promote a goal of reducing at least five million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year through the development and application of compost on working lands, which include, but are not limited to, agricultural land, land used for forestry, and rangeland. The California Environmental Protection Agency shall work with the Department of Food and Agriculture to achieve this goal.\n(c) The California Secretary for Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Food and Agriculture shall ensure proper coordination of agency regulations and goals to implement this section. The California Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Food and Agriculture, with the department, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the State Air Resources Board shall do all of the following:\n(1) Assess the state\u2019s progress towards developing the organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure necessary to meet the state goals specified in Assembly Bill 341 (Chapter 476 of the Statutes of 2011), Assembly Bill 1826 (Chapter 727 of the Statutes of 2014), the State Air Resources Board\u2019s May 2015 Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Strategy concept paper, and the Department of Food and Agriculture\u2019s Healthy Soils Initiative.\n(2) Meet at least quarterly and consult with interested stakeholders, including, but not limited to, the compost industry, local governments, and environmental organizations, to encourage the continued viability of the state\u2019s organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure.\n(3) Hold at least one public workshop annually to inform the public of actions taken to implement this section and to receive public comment.\n(4) Develop recommendations for promoting organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure statewide, which shall be posted on the California Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Internet Web site no later than January 1, 2017, and updated annually thereafter.\n(d) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends that date.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 43032 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:\n43032.\n(a) The department, in coordination with the State Air Resources Board and the State Water Resources Control Board, shall develop a policy that promotes the development of coordinated permitting and regulation of composting facilities while protecting the environment.\n(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends that date."
