FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) State data and monitoring systems provide reliable data \n        on injury causes and risk factors, identify trends in the \n        incidence of traumatic brain injury, enable the development of \n        cause-specific prevention strategies focused on populations at \n        greatest risk, and monitor the effectiveness of such \n        strategies.\n            (2) Since 1995, when the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention published Guidelines for Surveillance of Central \n        Nervous System Injury, additional causes of traumatic brain \n        injury have emerged: military-related traumatic brain injuries; \n        sports-related concussions; traffic injuries resulting from \n        texting while driving; and increasing numbers of falls-related \n        traumatic brain injuries among older adults.\n            (3) In their 2013 report, Sports-Related Concussions in \n        Youth: Improving the Science, Changing the Culture, the \n        Institute on Medicine and the National Research Council noted \n        that there is currently a lack of data to accurately estimate \n        the incidence of sports-related concussions across a variety of \n        sports and for youth across the pediatric age spectrum. The \n        report recommended that the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention establish and oversee a national surveillance system \n        to accurately determine the incidence of sports-related \n        concussions, including those in youth ages 5 to 21, taking into \n        account Federal efforts to collect information on traumatic \n        brain injury.\n            (4) Traumatic brain injury is a substantial public health \n        problem among older persons. As the population of older persons \n        continues to grow in the United States, the need to design and \n        implement proven and cost-effective prevention measures that \n        focus on the leading causes of traumatic brain injury becomes \n        more urgent.\n            (5) In order to implement this Act, the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention needs to collaborate with Federal \n        agencies reporting military-related traumatic brain injuries, \n        school systems reporting traumatic brain injuries, Medicaid and \n        other Federal programs, and State agencies.\n\nSEC. 3.
