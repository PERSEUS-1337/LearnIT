SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Our \nFuture Act of 2011''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) While Wall Street continues to reap massive profits, \n        the 2008 global economic crisis they helped cause has \n        destabilized economies and impacted the budgets of the United \n        States and impoverished nations, compromising the ability of \n        governments to address pressing needs.\n            (2) The scope of the financial crisis distorted our \n        national deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimates \n        that Federal deficit spending is now at a record $1.5 trillion.\n            (3) Millions of people around the world have been pushed \n        into poverty because of the global financial crisis, through no \n        fault of their own.\n            (4) The impacts of climate change, disease, and ill health \n        undermine the economies of developing nations and their ability \n        to contribute to a secure, stable world.\n            (5) Predictable, adequate, sustainable, long-term, public \n        funding to address global health and climate change in \n        developing countries at the scale needed does not currently \n        exist but it is urgently needed.\n            (6) Cutting vital domestic programs such as education, \n        health care, and nutrition assistance to reduce the national \n        debt will have a harmful impact on the long-term prosperity of \n        the country. Alternative revenue generating mechanisms must be \n        considered to reduce the national debt and meet international \n        development and climate needs.\n            (7) The financial institutions that caused the financial \n        crisis should play a significant role in providing funds that \n        will help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate \n        change, fight global HIV/AIDS, improve maternal and child \n        health in impoverished nations, and reduce the national \n        deficit.\n            (8) Currency speculation by financial institutions has \n        destabilizing impacts on the real economy and can contribute to \n        financial crises.\n            (9) In 2008, $4 trillion in daily currency transactions \n        were undertaken, nearly 80 percent of which by a few major \n        banks, without taxation.\n            (10) A tax on the currency market would be paid by these \n        same banks that caused the financial crisis and would generate \n        funds to help reduce our deficit.\n            (11) A small levy on currency would curb some speculative \n        transactions, bringing greater stability into the currency \n        market.\n            (12) Collection of a small tax would not disrupt legitimate \n        trading in the currency trading markets and would have no \n        significant impact on individual travelers or United States \n        corporations doing business.\n            (13) The Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, and \n        the nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n        Development should work together to implement a broader \n        currency transaction tax to reduce the Federal deficit and fund \n        global health, poverty, and climate change initiatives.\n\nSEC. 2.
