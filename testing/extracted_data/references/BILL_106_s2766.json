FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Over 30,000,000 beneficiaries under the medicare \n        program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act rely on \n        providers of home health services to provide them with cost-\n        effective, high quality home health care.\n            (2) The medicare home health benefit enables many medicare \n        beneficiaries to remain at home and to live with dignity and \n        independence despite serious health conditions.\n            (3) The medicare home health benefit helps alleviate the \n        burden of medicare beneficiaries on hospitals and skilled \n        nursing facilities, where services provided to medicare \n        beneficiaries are more expensive.\n            (4) The amendments made by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n        to title XVIII of the Social Security Act were originally \n        projected to cut $16,100,000,000 from the medicare home health \n        benefit between fiscal years 1998 and 2002.\n            (5) The Congressional Budget Office recently projected that \n        those amendments made by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 will \n        actually cut $69,400,000,000 from the medicare home health \n        benefit between fiscal years 1998 and 2002.\n            (6) The recent projections by the Congressional Budget \n        Office represent more than 4 times the amount of the reduction \n        in the medicare home health benefit originally projected to \n        take effect as a result of the amendments made by the Balanced \n        Budget Act of 1997.\n            (7) The failure of the Health Care Financing Administration \n        to disburse payments under the interim payment system \n        established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 under section \n        1861(v)(1)(L) of the Social Security Act in a timely manner has \n        resulted in medicare overpayments to thousands of providers of \n        home health services, leaving many of these providers on \n        precarious financial footing.\n            (8) Access to care, particularly for high-cost and long-\n        term patients, has become a growing problem because the amount \n        of payment for these types of patients under the current \n        interim payment system is insufficient.\n            (9) Under the proposed regulation implementing the new \n        prospective payment system, 50 percent of the prospective \n        payment amount will be paid upon receipt and processing of the \n        providers initial claim for reimbursement and 50 percent of \n        that amount will be delayed until the final claim is processed \n        at the end of the 60-day episode period.\n            (10) Medicare beneficiaries incur most home health care \n        expenses during the first 30 days of a 60-day episode period \n        and providers of home health services do not have large cash \n        reserves to support delayed payment for those services under \n        the medicare program.\n            (11) It is essential that the Administrator of the Health \n        Care Financing Administration ensure that the initial payment \n        to providers of home health services during a 60-day episode \n        period of home health care provided under the medicare home \n        health benefit provides a steady cash flow for those providers \n        so that medicare beneficiaries may continue to receive \n        necessary home health services.\n            (12) Studies by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n        established under section 1805 of the Social Security Act have \n        indicated that certain populations of medicare beneficiaries \n        risk not receiving necessary home health services because of \n        the systemic changes made by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n            (13) Because the aggregate amount of payment made for all \n        home health services during the first year in which payment \n        will be made for those services under the prospective payment \n        system is limited to the amount that would have been paid in \n        such year for those services under the interim payment system, \n        there is an enormous risk that this limited amount will be \n        insufficient, resulting in a perpetuation of the current crisis \n        under the interim payment system for home health services.\n\nSEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF 15 PERCENT REDUCTION IN PAYMENT RATES UNDER THE \n              MEDICARE PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM FOR HOME HEALTH \n              SERVICES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1895(b)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act \n(42 U.S.C. 1395fff(b)(3)(A)), as amended by sections 302(b) and 303(f) \nof the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of \n1999 (113 Stat. 1501A-359, 361), as enacted into law by section \n1000(a)(6) of Public Law 106-113, is amended to read as follows:\n                    ``(A) Initial basis.--Under such system the \n                Secretary shall provide for computation of a standard \n                prospective payment amount (or amounts).

Each such amount shall \nbe standardized in a manner that eliminates the effect of variations in \nrelative case mix and area wage adjustments among different home health \nagencies in a budget neutral manner consistent with the case mix and \nwage level adjustments provided under paragraph (4)(A). Under the \nsystem, the Secretary may recognize regional differences or differences \nbased upon whether or not the services or agency are in an urbanized \narea.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \ntake effect as if included in the enactment of the Medicare, Medicaid, \nand SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-113).\n\nSEC. 4.
