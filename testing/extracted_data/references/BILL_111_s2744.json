FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) flue gases from coal-fired electric generating \n        facilities typically have carbon dioxide concentrations of \n        approximately 17 percent by volume;\n            (2) it is possible to separate carbon dioxide from dilute \n        sources and even the atmosphere, which has a carbon dioxide \n        concentration of 0.038 percent, but substantial advances in \n        research and technology will be necessary to provide the \n        separation in an economical manner;\n            (3) developing practical separations of carbon dioxide from \n        dilute sources is important to the future development of energy \n        technology;\n            (4) economical onsite separation of atmospheric carbon \n        dioxide can help leverage the use of carbon dioxide in energy \n        applications such as enhanced oil recovery and enhanced \n        geothermal systems at remote sites; and\n            (5) authorizing the Secretary of Energy to provide a \n        technology prize for separation of carbon dioxide from dilute \n        sources can provide the impetus for developing the novel \n        technologies that will be needed in the future as part of the \n        national energy system of the United States.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide incentives \nto encourage the development and implementation of technology to \ncapture carbon dioxide from dilute sources on a significant scale using \ndirect air capture technologies.\n\nSEC. 3.
