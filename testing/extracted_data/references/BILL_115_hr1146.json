CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) eviction prevention programs provide important and \n        effective social and economic benefits;\n            (2) such programs help protect low-income and at-risk \n        households from the trauma and disruption of homelessness and \n        save property owners from the high costs of forced eviction and \n        re-occupancy; and\n            (3) investing more resources in eviction prevention helps \n        communities save on the high cost of homelessness by stopping \n        homelessness before it starts--for example, according to 2015 \n        data, the Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance estimates \n        that a homeless individual residing in Massachusetts creates an \n        additional cost burden for State-supported services (such as \n        shelters, emergency room visits, and incarceration) that is \n        $9,372 greater per year than for a housed individual.\n\nSEC. 3.
