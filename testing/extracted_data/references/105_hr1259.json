SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Dolphin-Safe \nFishing Act''.\n    (b) References to Marine Mammal Protection Act.--Except as \notherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or \nrepeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \nsection or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be \nmade to a section or other provision of the Marine Mammal Protection \nAct of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of \n        1972 that impose a ban on imports from nations that fish for \n        tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and the provisions \n        of that Act that prescribe the conditions under which tuna may \n        be labeled as ``dolphin-safe'' have served as a powerful \n        incentive to reduce the incidence of chasing and netting \n        dolphins and the incidence of dolphin mortalities.\n            (2) The American public has come to rely on the integrity \n        of the dolphin-safe labeling regime, and that requirements of \n        that regime have been an effective means of promoting dolphin \n        conservation through education and market mechanisms.\n            (3) In response to United States dolphin conservation \n        efforts, in 1993 the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission \n        initiated an international dolphin conservation program that \n        has helped to significantly reduce dolphin mortalities and \n        regulate the harvest of yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical \n        Pacific Ocean by vessels chasing and netting dolphins.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To recognize that individual tuna fishermen fishing in \n        the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have made efforts to reduce, \n        and in some cases eliminate, the practice of harvesting \n        yellowfin tuna by chasing and netting dolphins.\n            (2) To eliminate the ban on imports of dolphin-safe tuna \n        harvested by vessels in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean that \n        are in compliance with the requirements of the Inter-American \n        Tropical Tuna Commission and the Intergovernmental Agreement on \n        the Conservation of Tunas and Dolphins in the Eastern Pacific \n        Ocean, otherwise known as the ``La Jolla Agreement''.\n            (3) To strengthen the effectiveness of the dolphin-safe \n        label to ensure that the label is not being used on tuna \n        products that contain tuna harvested on a voyage in which \ndolphins were chased and netted, killed, or seriously injured.\n            (4) To encourage the contracting parties of the Inter-\n        American Tropical Tuna Commission to adopt a program to--\n                    (A) require that any sea turtles or other \n                threatened species or endangered species harvested in \n                the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean in the course of \n                fishing for tuna be released when alive;\n                    (B) reduce the harvest of nontarget species in the \n                yellowfin tuna fishery; and\n                    (C) eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, the \n                mortality of nontarget species in the yellowfin tuna \n                fishery.\n\nSEC. 3.

AMENDMENTS TO TITLE III GLOBAL MORATORIUM PROVISIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Section 301(a)(4) (16 U.S.C. 1411(a)(4)) is amended \nto read as follows:\n            ``(4) Nations harvesting yellowfin tuna in the eastern \n        tropical Pacific Ocean have demonstrated their willingness to \n        participate in appropriate multilateral agreements to reduce, \n        with the goal of eliminating, dolphin mortality in that \n        fishery. Recognition that persons fishing in the eastern \n        tropical Pacific Ocean have made efforts to reduce, and in some \n        cases eliminate, the practice of harvesting yellowfin tuna by \n        chasing and netting dolphins will assure that the existing \n        trend of reduced dolphin mortality continues and will increase \n        the likelihood that the practice of chasing and netting \n        dolphins is eliminated.''.\n    (b) Prohibitions.--Section 307 (16 U.S.C. 1417) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(2), by striking ``intentionally'' and \n        all that follows through ``except--'' and inserting \n        ``intentionally chase and net any dolphin in any tuna fishing \n        operation, except--'';\n            (2) by amending subsection (a)(3) to read as follows:\n            ``(3) for any person to import any yellowfin tuna or \n        yellowfin tuna product or any other fish or fish product in \n        violation of a ban on importation imposed under section \n        101(a)(2);''; and\n            (3) in subsection (b)(2), by striking ``subsection (a)(6)'' \n        and inserting ``subsection (a)(5) and (6)''.\n    (c) Dolphin Safe Standard.--Section 307(d) (16 U.S.C. 1417(d)) is \namended by striking paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) and inserting the \nfollowing:\n            ``(2) in the case of a tuna product that contains tuna \n        referred to in paragraph (1)(B), (C), or (D) of section 901(d) \n        of the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act, it is \n        dolphin safe under, respectively, paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of \n        that section; or\n            ``(3) in the case of tuna referred to in paragraph (1)(B), \n        (C), or (D) of section 901(d) of the Dolphin Protection \n        Consumer Information Act, the export or offering for sale of a \n        tuna product containing that tuna would not, by reason of the \n        presence of the tuna in that product, be a violation under that \n        section.''.\n\nSEC. 5.

REDUCTION OF BYCATCH IN EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC OCEAN.\n\n    The Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 (16 U.S.C. 951 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n        ``reduction of bycatch in eastern tropical pacific ocean\n\n    ``Sec. 13. The Secretary of State, acting through the \nCommissioners, shall immediately take the necessary actions to ensure \nthat the Commission adopts a bycatch reduction program for those \nvessels fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific \nOcean.

EQUITABLE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTER-AMERICAN TROPICAL \n              TUNA COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that each \nnation participating in the International Dolphin Conservation Program \nshould contribute an equitable amount for payment of the expenses of \nthe Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, and that currently, the \nUnited States is paying an inequitable share of the Inter-American \nTropical Tuna Commission's budget and expenses.\n    (b) Determination of Amount.--In determining the amount to be paid \nby the United States as its contribution toward the expenses of the \nInter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Secretary of State shall \ntake into account the number of vessels participating in the eastern \ntropical Pacific Ocean yellowfin tuna fishery, the consumption within \nthe United States of tuna and tuna products from the eastern tropical \nPacific Ocean, and other relevant factors as determined by the \nSecretary.\n\nSEC. 8.
