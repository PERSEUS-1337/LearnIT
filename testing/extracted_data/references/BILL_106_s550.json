FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) through a long line of decisions, the United States \n        Supreme Court has established that States have the right to \n        collect lawfully imposed nondiscriminatory State excise, sales, \n        and transaction taxes on the purchase of a good or service from \n        an Indian tribe (including a tribal government or tribal \n        corporation) by a person who is not a member of that Indian \n        tribe;\n            (2) the collection of those State taxes has been impeded by \n        the assertion of tribal immunity by Indian tribes (including \n        tribal governments and tribal corporations) and members of \n        Indian tribes as a defense in Federal actions in Federal \n        courts; and\n            (3) the failure of an Indian tribe (including a tribal \n        government or tribal corporation) or a member of an Indian \n        tribe to act as an agent of a State to collect such a State \n        tax--\n                    (A) unlawfully deprives that State of essential tax \n                revenues needed for making improvements to \n                infrastructure and ensuring the health and welfare of \n                all of the citizens of that State; and\n                    (B)(i) creates a disadvantage for law-abiding \n                businesses that are not associated with the Indian \n                tribe and that fulfill an obligation to act as an agent \n                of the State; and\n                    (ii) as a result of that disadvantage, some of \n                those businesses may be forced out of business.\n\nSEC. 3. COLLECTION OF STATE TAXES.\n\n    Section 1362 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``The \n        district courts''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Collection of Qualified State Taxes by Indian Tribes.--\n            ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n                    ``(A) Good or service.--The term `good or service' \n                includes any tobacco product or motor fuel (within the \n                meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).\n                    ``(B) Indian tribe.--The term `Indian tribe' \n                means--\n                            ``(i) an Indian tribe or band referred to \n                        in subsection (a);
