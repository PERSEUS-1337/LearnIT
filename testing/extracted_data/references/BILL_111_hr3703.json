FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are the fastest-growing \n        serious developmental disability in the U.S. occurring in all \n        racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.\n            (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention's Autism and Disabilities Monitoring Network the \n        rate of Autism in the United States has exploded from an \n        estimated 1 in 10,000 during the 1980s to a the current rate of \n        1 in 150 demonstrating that the United States is facing an \n        literal epidemic of autism.\n            (3) The epidemic shows no sign of slowing as a new case of \n        autism is diagnosed almost every 20 minutes.\n            (4) More children will be diagnosed with autism this year \n        than with AIDS, diabetes, and cancer combined.\n            (5) Autism costs the Nation over $35,000,000,000 per year, \n        a figure expected to significantly increase in the next decade.\n            (6) Autism is a life changing condition not a life \n        threatening condition. Our Nation's educational, labor, housing \n        and medical communities are ill-equipped and undertrained to \n        handle a generation of autism individuals.\n            (7) In the long-term, this autism epidemic could \n        potentially deprive our Nation of a huge pool of future \n        military, industrial, medical, and scientific talent.\n            (8) Although autism spectrum disorders are an urgent \n        societal concern and comprehensive research is the best hope \n        for understanding the causes of autism and other developmental \n        disorders, autism receives less than 5 percent of the Federal \n        research funding of many less prevalent childhood diseases.\n            (9) In December 2006, Congress passed and President Bush \n        signed into law the ``Combating Autism Act of 2006,'' which \n        committed nearly $1,000,000,000 to autism research, including \n        essential research on environmental factors, treatments, and \n        early identification and support services.\n            (10) A White House Conference on Autism presents an \n        historic opportunity to build on the foundation of the \n        Combating Autism Act to advance the scientific study and \n        analysis of many promising cutting-edge treatments and services \n        for autism.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF THE CONFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Authority To Call Conference.--Not later than December 31, \n2010, the President shall call the White House Conference on Autism (in \nthis Act referred to as the ``Conference'') to be convened not later \nthan 18 months after the selection of the Policy Committee established \nin section 4, in order to make fundamental policy recommendations on \nways to combat the autism epidemic in the United States and to \nimplement the purposes set forth in subsection (c).\n    (b) Planning and Direction.--The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development (in this Act referred to as the ``Cochairs'') shall \nplan, conduct, and convene the Conference, in consultation with the \nSurgeon General.\n    (c) Purposes of the Conference.--The purposes of the Conference are \nto--\n            (1) galvanize a national effort to find the underlying \n        cause or causes of autism;\n            (2) identify viable solutions and valuable services to help \n        autistic individuals and families of autistic individuals meet \n        the challenges they face on a daily basis;\n            (3) bring together the best scientific minds to chart a \n        comprehensive research agenda, including the exploration of \n        potential environmental triggers or contributors;\n            (4) bring together parents of autistic children and leaders \n        in the field of education and social services to begin a \n        national dialogue about addressing the life-long challenges \n        faced by these children and their families;\n            (5) highlight emerging and innovative programs from the \n        public and private sectors, including community-based and \n        faith-based organizations that effectively serve the needs of \n        autistic children and adults and recommend such programs as can \n        be reasonably and cost-effectively replicated; and\n            (6) review the current structure, scope, and effectiveness \n        of existing legislation and programs at the Federal, State, and \n        local levels that provide autism research services; and to \n        develop such specific and comprehensive recommendations for \n        legislative action as may be appropriate for improving those \n        bills and programs with the aim of enhancing the health, \n        quality of life and well-being of autistic individuals and \n        their families.\n\nSEC. 4.
