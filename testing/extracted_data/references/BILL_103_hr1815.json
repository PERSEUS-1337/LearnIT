FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) recreational hunting, when carried out pursuant to law \n        (as implemented by the regulations of Federal and State \n        wildlife management agencies) is a necessary and beneficial \n        element in the proper conservation and management of healthy, \n        abundant, and biologically diverse wildlife resources;\n            (2) recreational hunters (because of a generally \n        demonstrated concern with the conservation of wildlife \n        resources and preservation of habitat necessary for the \n        breeding and maintenance of healthy wildlife populations, and \n        through a familiarity with the resources gained from experience \n        in the field) are a valuable asset in ensuring enlightened \n        public input into decisions regarding management and \n        maintenance programs for wildlife resources and habitat;\n            (3)(A) recreational hunting supports industries highly \n        significant to the national economy through sales in interstate \n        commerce of sporting goods; and\n            (B) the Federal excise taxes imposed on the sales provide a \n        major source of funding for vital programs of wildlife \n        conservation and management;\n            (4) various persons are engaging in (and have announced an \n        intent to continue to engage in) a variety of disruptive \n        activities with the premeditated purpose of preventing and \n        interfering with the conduct of lawful recreational hunting on \n        Federal lands, which activities--\n                    (A) place both recreational hunters and the \n                disruptive persons in imminent jeopardy of grave \n                physical injury or death;\n                    (B) disrupt the peaceful, lawful, and prudent \n                conduct of wildlife population and habitat management \n                programs by Federal and State wildlife management \n                agencies; and\n                    (C) ultimately may alter the planned program \n                objectives, resulting in--\n                            (i) undesirable patterns of activity within \n                        populations of wildlife;\n                            (ii) the endangerment of the future \n                        viability of wildlife species; and\n                            (iii) damage to habitat values;\n            (5) Federal lands comprise important wildlife habitat \n        resources that--\n                    (A) support many large, diverse, and vital \n                populations of wildlife; and\n                    (B) offer significant opportunities for legal \n                recreational hunting as an important management tool to \n                ensure the future viability of the wildlife \n                populations;\n            (6) it is the right of citizens of the United States freely \n        to enjoy lawful recreational hunting on Federal lands in \n        accordance with regulations promulgated by Federal and State \n        wildlife management agencies; and\n            (7) in many instances under current law, vagueness and \n        ambiguity exist regarding the application of State laws and \n        enforcement activities relating to--\n                    (A) the safety of hunters; and\n                    (B) the legal rights of recreational hunters to \n                participate peacefully in lawful hunts on Federal \n                lands.\n\nSEC. 3.
