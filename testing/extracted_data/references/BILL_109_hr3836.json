FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast and New \n        Orleans, Louisiana, on August 29, 2005, substantially disrupted \n        petroleum production, refining, and pipeline systems in the \n        region, impacting energy prices and supply nationwide.\n            (2) In the immediate aftermath of Katrina, United States \n        refining capacity was reduced by more than 2,000,000 barrels \n        per day. While some capacity was restored within several days, \n        4 refineries with a total capacity of 879,000 barrels per day, \n        roughly 5 percent of pre-Katrina capacity, remain offline. \n        These refineries sustained major damage and will not reopen for \n        an extended period of time.\n            (3) Within a week of the hurricane's landfall, the national \n        average retail price for motor vehicle gasoline rose by 46 \n        cents to $3.069 per gallon. Prices of other refined fuels also \n        rose quickly in response to the hurricane.\n            (4) Before Katrina, United States refining capacity was \n        already significantly strained, with industry average \n        utilization rates of 95 percent of capacity or higher.\n            (5) No new refinery has been constructed in the United \n        States since 1976. There are 148 operating refineries in the \n        United States, down from 324 in 1981. Total capacity at \n        operating refineries is 17,000,000 barrels per day, while total \n        United States demand averages nearly 21,000,000 barrels per \n        day. This growing gap is met by an increasing amount of imports \n        of refined products from foreign sources.\n            (6) A growing reliance on foreign sources of refined \n        petroleum products impairs our national security interests.\n            (7) It serves the national interest to increase refinery \n        capacity for gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel \n        wherever located within the United States, to bring more supply \n        to the markets for use by the American people. Production and \n        use of refined petroleum products has a significant impact on \n        interstate commerce.\n            (8) Refiners are subject to significant environmental and \n        other regulations and face several new Clean Air Act \n        requirements over the next decade. New Clean Air Act \n        requirements may benefit the environment but will also require \n        substantial capital investment and additional government \n        permits.\n            (9) More regulatory certainty for refinery owners is needed \n        to stimulate investment in increased refinery capacity. \n        Required procedures for regulatory approvals need to be \n        streamlined to ensure that increased refinery capacity can be \n        developed and operated in a safe, timely, and cost-effective \n        manner.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPEDITED FEDERAL PERMITTING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), an \napplication for a permit under a law described in subsection (c) to \nconstruct or expand a petroleum refining facility in the United States \nshall be approved not later than 90 days after a complete application \nis received. If such permit is not approved within 90 days, the \nSecretary of Energy, in consultation with the Office of Regulatory \nAssistance, shall issue the permit. The Secretary of Energy shall \ncoordinate Federal implementation of this subsection.\n    (b) Presidential Determination.--A permit shall not be approved \nunder subsection (a) if the President determines that the benefits to \nthe United States of increased refinery capacity that would be provided \nby the proposed construction or expansion are outweighed by the costs \nof approving the permit. A decision by the President to not make a \ndetermination under this subsection shall not be subject to judicial \nreview.\n    (c) Covered Laws.--This section applies only to permits under the \nClean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, \nthe Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Historic Preservation \nAct, and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\n    (d) Applicability.--This section shall apply to any refinery repair \nor reconstruction at an existing refinery undertaken in the area \naffected by Hurricane Katrina and undertaken as a result of Hurricane \nKatrina. This section shall not apply during a period with respect to \nwhich the Secretary of Energy has certified to Congress in writing that \nUnited States domestic petroleum refining capacity is sufficient to \nserve the needs of the United States, accounting for the possibility of \nnatural disasters, terrorist attacks, fires, routine maintenance, the \neffects of unique fuel blends, or other potential events.\n\nSEC. 4. LITIGATION.\n\n    (a) Direct Legal Representation.--At the request of the applicant, \nthe Secretary of Energy shall provide direct legal representation for a \nperson who has filed an application described in section 3(a) for any \nlawsuit brought against such person or the Federal Government under \nsuch a law with respect to the permit approval procedure or \nconstruction or expansion of the facility to which the application \nrelates, if the Secretary believes the lawsuit lacks merit, is brought \nsolely to delay the completion of the facility, or will have the effect \nof delaying the completion of the facility in a period when United \nStates domestic refining capacity is insufficient.\n    (b) Attorneys' Fees.--Any party in an action with respect to the \napproval of an application described in section 3(a), or the \nconstruction or expansion of the facility to which the application \nrelates, shall be awarded attorneys' fees in proportion to the amount \nof the original claim that is awarded or denied by the court.\n\nSEC. 5. OFFICE OF REGULATORY ASSISTANCE.\n\n    The Secretary of Energy shall establish an office whose sole \npurpose is to assist applicants in developing permit applications, \nplanning, and otherwise pursuing the construction or expansion of a \npetroleum refining facility in the United States. This assistance shall \ninclude--\n            (1) serving as an advocate for the applicant to the \n        permitting agencies;\n            (2) ensuring that permitting agencies are responsive to \n        applicants;\n            (3) ensuring that permits are issued by statutory \n        deadlines; and\n            (4) consulting with the Secretary of Energy to offer advice \n        relating to issuing a permit for an agency that has not met \n        deadlines contained in section 3(a).\n\nSEC. 6. STANDBY SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN PETROLEUM REFINING FACILITY DELAYS.\n\n    (a) Contract Authority.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Energy may enter into \n        contracts under this section with sponsors of 6 new petroleum \n        refining facilities, each with an output of at least 150,000 \n        barrels per day, in accordance with paragraph (2). The \n        Secretary shall give preference to new refineries that will \n        increase the geographic diversity of existing United States \n        domestic refining capacity.\n            (2) Requirement for contracts.--\n                    (A) Definition of loan cost.--In this paragraph, \n                the term ``loan cost'' has the meaning given the term \n                ``cost of a loan guarantee'' under section 502(5)(C) of \n                the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. \n                661a(5)(C)).\n                    (B) Establishment of accounts.--There is \n                established in the Department of Energy 2 separate \n                accounts, which shall be known as the--\n                            (i) ``Refinery Standby Support Program \n                        Account'';
