While providing a permanent source of timber \n        supply, the State of Oregon shall protect watersheds and \n        fisheries, regulate stream flows, provide wildlife habitat and \n        recreational opportunities, and institute a program that \n        provides for blocking up of the lands through trades and other \n        transfers with willing private and other public landowners \n        within the O&C Counties.\n            (3) That, in managing the lands conveyed by this Act for \n        the purposes set forth in paragraph (2), the State of Oregon \n        will be guided by principles of good stewardship based on the \n        best verifiable scientific information available at the time.\n            (4) That, prior to January 1, 2004, management by the State \n        of Oregon of the transferred lands shall be pursuant to a State \n        management plan that is consistent with the standards and \n        guidelines of the Northwest Forest Plan adopted on April 13, \n        1994, or other Federal land management plans in effect at the \n        time of transfer. Beginning January 1, 2004 and thereafter, \n        management by the State of Oregon in accordance with the \n        objectives of this Act will be conducted under a habitat \n        conservation plan developed and approved pursuant to the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n        seq.) so as to coordinate with management on lands remaining in \n        Federal ownership.\n            (5) That a fund has been established in the treasury of the \n        State of Oregon entitled the ``O&C Lands Fund,'' into which all \n        gross revenues derived from timber sales or otherwise produced \n        from the lands conveyed by this Act or subsequently exchanged \n        lands are deposited.\n            (6) That, prior to January 1, 2004, disbursements will be \n        made annually to the O&C counties, with disbursements to \n        individual counties made in the same proportion that each of \n        them has received disbursements of revenues under the Act of \n        August 28, 1937 (43 U.S.C. 1181a-1181f). Annual disbursements \n        prior to January 1, 2004, to the O&C counties from the O&C \n        Lands Fund shall be the lesser of 50 percent of gross revenues \n        deposited in the O&C Lands Fund or the amount that, when taken \n        together with payments received under section 13983 of the \n        Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66; \n        43 U.S.C. 1181f note), the combined total payments are equal to \n        the amount received by the O&C counties under section 13983 of \n        the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 during the year \n        in which the qualifying resolution of assent is submitted to \n        the Secretary. Prior to January 1, 2004, all of the revenues \n        deposited in the O&C Lands Fund remaining after annual payments \n        to the O&C counties will be utilized by the State of Oregon for \n        management of the lands conveyed by this Act for the purposes \n        set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3).\n            (7) Beginning January 1, 2004, and thereafter, 50 percent \n        of gross revenues deposited in the O&C Lands Fund will be \n        disbursed annually to the O&C counties, with disbursements to \n        individual counties made in the same proportion that each of \n        them has received disbursements of revenues under the Act of \n        August 28, 1937 (43 U.S.C. 1181a-1181f). Beginning January 1, \n        2004, and thereafter, the remaining 50 percent of gross \n        revenues deposited in the O&C Lands Fund will be utilized by \n        the State of Oregon for management of the lands conveyed by \n        this Act for the purposes set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3), \n        with any balance remaining thereafter available to the State \nfor other public purposes at the discretion of the State. Payments to \nthe O&C counties from the O&C Lands Fund shall not serve as a basis for \noffsetting or reducing payments or revenue distributions by the State \nto any O&C county under any other State program or legislation.\n            (8) That the State will accept title subject to all valid \n        existing rights and will assume the obligations of the United \n        States under the terms of any lease, contract, permit, \n        easement, license or other valid binding agreement outstanding \n        between the United States and any other party relating to the \n        lands conveyed by this Act as of the date title is transferred \n        to the State.\n            (9) That the State will administer a mineral rights program \n        applicable to any person who, as of the date of enactment of \n        this Act has filed an unpatented mining claim, filed a patent \n        application, or received a first-half patent certificate. \n        Patented lands located within lands transferred pursuant to \n        this Act shall not be subject to this Act, except for the \n        protection of access and other such rights as provided for in \n        paragraph 8 of this section. The State program required by this \n        paragraph will insure that surface, subsurface and access \n        rights of unpatented mining claims, potentially eligible \n        patentees and private patented lands are no less favorable than \n        under Federal law as of January 1, 1996, and that holders of \n        all first-half final patent certificates as of the date of \n        enactment of this Act will be awarded full patents not later \n        than two years after the notice required by section 4, \n        subsection (f) of this Act, and that all unpatented mining \n        claims and patent applications filed as of the date of \n        enactment of this Act will carry the same rights as, and be \n        subject to requirements that are no less favorable to claimants \n        than under Federal law as of January 1, 1996. The State program \n        established pursuant to this paragraph shall recognize all \n        unpatented mining claims filed as of the date of enactment of \n        this Act for so long as the claimant performs assessment work \n        or pays holding fees and meets other requirements, if any, as \n        provided by Federal law as of January 1, 1996. Any fees charged \n        under the State program required by this paragraph shall be \n        paid to the State.\n            (10) That, in the case of lands conveyed under this Act \n        that are capable of commercial production of timber, the State \n        will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of such lands, \n        except in cases of mineral patents or in trades or exchanges \n        for lands of equal value as timberlands in a program of \n        blocking up to aid in consolidating ownerships to increase the \n        efficiency and effectiveness of management for economic and \n        ecologic purposes.\n            (11) That the State will continue to manage as parks, \n        campgrounds, and other developed recreation sites and \n        facilities any lands conveyed by this Act that are designated \n        as parks, campgrounds, and other developed recreation sites and \n        facilities as of January 1, 1996.\n            (12) That, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n        the State of Oregon will reserve from entry for commercial \n        timber production any lands transferred by this Act that are \n        identified in and designated by Federal statute as of January \n        1, 1996 as areas reserved from entry for commercial timber \n        production including, but not limited to, wild and scenic river \n        areas and wilderness areas.\n            (13) That the State will, except as may be inconsistent \n        with paragraphs 8 and 9 above, hold the lands conveyed by this \n        Act open and accessible for hunting, fishing, hiking, swimming, \n        boating, trapping, rockhounding and other recreational uses in \n        accordance with applicable State and Federal laws by all the \n        people of the State and of the United States.\n            (14) That the State has established a program giving \n        preference in employment within the Oregon Department of \n        Forestry to any person employed by the Bureau of Land \n        Management within the State of Oregon as of the date a \n        qualifying resolution of assent is filed with the Secretary and \n        whose employment by the Bureau of Land Management terminates on \nor before January 1, 2004 as a result of the land transfer provided for \nin this Act, and shall grant an interview to any such person who \nrequests one.\n    (b) Right of Reentry.--\n            (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the United \n        States shall retain a right of reentry until January 1, 2025, \n        in all lands transferred under this Act and held by the State \n        of Oregon.\n            (2) Such right of reentry of the United States shall ripen \n        if, upon petition for review by nine or more of the O&C \n        counties or upon request for review from the President of the \n        United States, the Secretary determines that the land conveyed \n        by this Act is not being managed in accordance with the \n        conditions specified in subsection (a), and such noncompliance \n        is not cured within two years following such determination. Any \n        determination by the Secretary under this subsection shall be \n        made on the record after an opportunity for a hearing.\n            (3) The ripened right of reentry retained by the United \n        States shall vest and all right, title and interest in lands \n        and other property transferred under this Act shall revert to \n        the United States only if--\n                    (A) the Secretary files a declaration of reentry \n                within three months after the two-year period provided \n                for in subsection (2) with the Governor of the State of \n                Oregon; and\n                    (B) the Secretary records a declaration of reentry \n                in the office of the county recorder in each of the O&C \n                counties within three months after the filing required \n                under paragraph (A) and prior to January 1, 2050.\n            (4) As a condition of reentry pursuant to subsections (2) \n        and (3), the United States shall manage the lands thereafter \n        for permanent timber production for the benefit of local \n        communities, with revenues derived therefrom to be distributed \n        in the same manner provided for by the Act of August 28, 1937 \n        (43 U.S.C. 1181a-1181f).\n            (5) Unless exercised and perfected sooner pursuant to \n        subsections (2) and (3), the right of reentry shall expire on \n        January 1, 2050.\n\nSEC. 6.
