    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Community College Teacher \nPreparation Enhancement Act of 2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Well qualified teachers and paraprofessionals are \n        critical to the success of the Nation's students.\n            (2) In order to meet the changing demands of their jobs and \n        the Federal requirements under the No Child Left Behind Act of \n        2001 (Public Law 107-110), teachers and prospective teachers \n        must have access to high-quality teacher training.\n            (3) The 1,200 community colleges across the United States \n        play an important role in training teachers, offering \n        professional development, and continuing education.\n            (4) Community colleges enroll more than 6,000,000 credit \n        students or 44 percent of all undergraduates in the United \n        States.\n            (5) At least 25 percent of undergraduates receiving a \n        teaching degree began their postsecondary education at a \n        community college.\n            (6) Due to teacher attrition, teacher retirement, and a \n        growing student population, the Nation will require an \n        additional 2,400,000 teachers over the next decade.\n            (7) If left unchanged, the production rate of teachers is \n        200,000 short of meeting the expected future demand.\n            (8) In subjects such as mathematics, science, special \n        education, and bilingual education, the Nation risks a severe \n        teacher shortfall.\n            (9) Community colleges offer accessibility and a link to \n        education opportunities present at 4-year institutions of \n        higher education.\n            (10) There is no systematic infrastructure or resources in \n        place to advance more students from community colleges to 4-\n        year institutions of higher education and into the teaching \n        profession.\n            (11) Many 4-year institutions of higher education and \n        community colleges have engaged in collaborative agreements for \n        teacher training.\n            (12) To meet the Nation's needs for highly qualified \n        teachers, it is appropriate that the community college role in \n        teacher training be enhanced and that cooperation between \n        community colleges and 4-year institutions of higher education \n        be increased.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) foster collaboration between 4-year institutions of \n        higher education and community colleges to enhance teacher \n        preparation as required under the No Child Left Behind Act of \n        2001 (Public Law 107-110);\n            (2) enhance the opportunity for community college students \n        in teacher training programs to complete a baccalaureate degree \n        in kindergarten through grade 12 education;\n            (3) promote the development of best practices for \n        coordinating teacher training between community colleges and 4-\n        year institutions of higher education; and\n            (4) expand community college teaching infrastructure to \n        provide, among other things, professional development as called \n        for under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-\n        110) to existing teachers.\n\nSEC. 4.
