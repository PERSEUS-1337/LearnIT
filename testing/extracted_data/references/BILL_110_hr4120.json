FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) Child pornography is estimated to be a multibillion dollar \n    industry of global proportions, facilitated by the growth of the \n    Internet.\n        (2) Data has shown that 83 percent of child pornography \n    possessors had images of children younger than 12 years old, 39 \n    percent had images of children younger than 6 years old, and 19 \n    percent had images of children younger than 3 years old.\n        (3) Child pornography is a permanent record of a child's abuse \n    and the distribution of child pornography images revictimizes the \n    child each time the image is viewed.\n        (4) Child pornography is readily available through virtually \n    every Internet technology, including Web sites, email, instant \n    messaging, Internet Relay Chat, newsgroups, bulletin boards, and \n    peer-to-peer.\n        (5) The technological ease, lack of expense, and anonymity in \n    obtaining and distributing child pornography over the Internet has \n    resulted in an explosion in the multijurisdictional distribution of \n    child pornography.\n        (6) The Internet is well recognized as a method of distributing \n    goods and services across State lines.\n        (7) The transmission of child pornography using the Internet \n    constitutes transportation in interstate commerce.\n    SEC. 103.
