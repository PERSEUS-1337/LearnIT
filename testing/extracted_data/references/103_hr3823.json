FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress find that--\n            (1) the Wisconsin State Legislature has passed legislation \n        calling upon the Congress of the United States to provide for \n        Federal establishment of benefit levels for aid to families \n        with dependent children (AFDC);\n            (2) the current variation in benefit levels from State to \n        State has discouraged families receiving AFDC from remaining in \n        their home communities, although it is generally in the best \n        interest of all citizens to live close to their families, \n        friends, and support networks, and where job opportunities \n        exist, and decisions on where to live should not be complicated \n        by the level of AFDC benefits;\n            (3) under the current system, taxpayers in States are \n        paying differing amounts, with some States providing \n        comparatively more in AFDC benefits while others are paying \n        well beneath the level of poverty; and\n            (4) because poverty does not know State boundaries, and \n        because of the current disparities in the system for both \n        taxpayers and AFDC recipients, uniform AFDC benefits should be \n        determined federally.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``Commission \non Welfare Fairness'' (in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.
