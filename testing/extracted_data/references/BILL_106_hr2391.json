FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States ranks below most industrialized \n        nations in health status measured by longevity, sickness, and \n        mortality.\n            (2) The United States ranks 24th among industrialized \n        nations in infant mortality.\n            (3) This poor rank in health status is attributed in large \n        measure to the lower health status of America's minority \n        populations.\n            (4) Many minority groups suffer disproportionately from \n        cancer. Disparities exist in both mortality and incidence \n        rates. For men and women combined, African Americans have a \n        cancer death rate about 35 percent higher than that for whites. \n        Paralleling the death rate, the incidence rate for lung cancer \n        in African American men is about 50 percent higher than white \n        men. Native Hawaiian men also have elevated rates of lung \n        cancer compared with white men. Alaska Native men and women \n        suffer from higher rates of cancers of the colon and rectum \n        than do whites. Vietnamese women in the United States have a \n        cervical cancer incidence rate more than five times greater \n        than white women. Hispanic women also suffer elevated rates of \n        cervical cancer.\n            (5) Infant death rates among African American, American \n        Indians and Alaska Natives, and Hispanics were well above the \n        national average. The greatest disparity exists for African \n        Americans. The overall American Indian rate does not reflect \n        the diversity among Indian communities, some of which have \n        infant mortality rates approaching twice the national rate.\n            (6) SIDS accounts for approximately 10 percent of all \n        infant deaths in the first year of life. Minority populations \n        are at greater risk for SIDS. In addition to the greater risks \n        among African Americans, the rates are three to four times as \n        high for some American Indians and Alaska Native populations.\n            (7) Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death \n        for all racial and ethnic groups. Major disparities exist among \n        population groups, with a disproportionate burden of death and \n        disability from cardiovascular disease in minority and low-\n        income populations. Stroke is the only leading cause of death \n        for which mortality is higher for Asian-American males than for \n        white males.\n            (8) Racial and ethnic minorities have higher rates of \n        hypertension, tend to develop hypertension at an earlier age, \n        and are less likely to undergo treatment to control their high \n        blood pressure.\n            (9) Diabetes, the seventh leading cause of death in the \n        United States, is a serious public health problem affecting \n        racial and ethnic communities. The prevalence of diabetes in \n        African Americans is approximately 70 percent higher than \n        whites and the prevalence in Hispanics is nearly double that of \n        whites. The prevalence rate of diabetes among American Indians \n        and Alaska Natives is more than twice that for the total \n        population and at least one tribe, the Pimas of Arizona, have \n        the highest known prevalence of diabetes of any population in \n        the world.\n            (10) The human immunodeficiency virus (``HIV''), which \n        causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (``AIDS''), results \n        in disproportionate suffering in minority populations. Minority \n        persons represent 25 percent of the total United States \n        population, but 54 percent of all cases of AIDS.\n            (11) More than 75 percent of AIDS cases reported among \n        women and children occur in minority women and children.\n            (12) Despite suffering disproportionate rates of illness, \n        death, and disability, minorities have not been proportionately \n        represented in many clinical research trials, except in studies \n        of behavioral risk factors associated with negative \n        stereotypes.\n            (13) Culturally sensitive approaches to research are needed \n        to encourage minority participation in research studies.\n            (14) There is a national need for minority scientists in \n        the field of biomedical, clinical, and health services \n        research.\n            (15) In 1990, only 3.3 percent of all United States medical \n        school faculties were underrepresented minority persons.\n            (16) Only 1 percent of full professors were \n        underrepresented minority persons in 1990.\n            (17) The proportion of underrepresented minorities in \n        higher rank academic ranks, such as professors and associated \n        professors, actually decreased from 1980 to 1990.\n\nSEC. 3.
