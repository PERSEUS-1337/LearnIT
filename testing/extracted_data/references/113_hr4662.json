Such opinion shall state whether \n                        or not the specified prospective conduct would, \n                        for purposes of Bureau's present enforcement \n                        policy, violate Federal consumer financial law.\n                            ``(ii) Extension permitted.--If the \n                        Director determines that the Bureau requires \n                        additional time to issue an opinion on an \n                        inquiry, the Director may make a single \n                        extension of the deadline described under \n                        clause (i) of 45 days or less.\n                    ``(C) Rebuttable presumption.--In any action \n                brought under the Federal consumer financial law, there \n                shall be a rebuttable presumption that any conduct for \n                which the Director has issued an opinion that such \n                conduct is in conformity with the Bureau's \n                interpretation of Federal consumer financial law, is in \n                compliance with Federal consumer financial law. Such a \n                presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the \n                evidence. In considering such presumption, a court \n                shall weigh all relevant factors, including whether the \n                information submitted to the Director was accurate and \n                complete and whether the conduct at issue in the action \n                was within the scope of the conduct addressed in the \n                opinion of the Director.\n                    ``(D) Confidentiality.--Any document or other \n                material that is received by or prepared by the Bureau \n                or any other Federal department or agency in connection \n                with an inquiry under this paragraph, including any \n                opinion issued by the Director under this paragraph, \n                shall be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of \n                title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as \n                the Freedom of Information Act) and may not, except \n                with the consent of the covered person making such \n                inquiry, be made publicly available, regardless of \n                whether the Director responds to such inquiry or the \n                covered person withdraws such inquiry before receiving \n                an opinion.\n                    ``(E) Assistance for small businesses.--\n                            ``(i) In general.--The Bureau shall assist, \n                        to the maximum extent practicable, small \n                        businesses in preparing inquiries under this \n                        paragraph.\n                            ``(ii) Small business defined.--For \n                        purposes of this clause, the term `small \n                        business' has the meaning given the term `small \n                        business concern' under section 3 of the Small \n                        Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).''."
