FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that, for national defense, it is \nin the interest of the United States that a clear understanding exists \namong the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense, \nin particular, and all other Federal departments and agencies, that all \nFederal departments and agencies have complementary interests in the \ncontrol and utilization of ocean-going merchant vessels that are \nregistered or documented under the laws of the United States.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that--\n            (1) the Federal Maritime Administration and its wartime \n        counterpart have broad powers of control over ocean-going \n        United States-flag merchant vessels; and\n            (2) the Secretary of Defense, operating under the national \n        policy promulgated in section 101 of the Merchant Marine Act, \n        1936 (46 App. U.S.C. 1101), ensure that military drafts of \n        United States-flag merchant vessels (including breakbulk, roll-\n        on-roll-off, lift-on lift-off (cellularized and containerized), \n        multipurpose carriers, tankers, and various auxiliaries), are \n        operated in conformity with the requirements and plans of the \n        Department of Defense and military exigencies.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to--\n            (1) clarify the Department of Defense cargoes transported \n        by water that are required to be transported on privately owned \n        United States-flag vessels;\n            (2) clarify the Department of Defense cargoes transported \n        by water that may be transported on vessels that are owned, \n        controlled, or chartered by the Government of the United \n        States; and\n            (3) reduce to a minimum the number of cargo transport \n        vessels maintained and operated by the Military Sealift Command \n        in order to give preference to privately owned United States-\n        flag vessels for transportation by water of Department of \n        Defense cargoes.\n\nSEC. 4. TRANSPORTATION BY WATER OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CARGOES.\n\n    Section 2631 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to read as \nfollows:\n``Sec. 2631. Transportation by water of Department of Defense cargoes\n    ``(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, under \nconditions other than full or partial mobilization declared by the \nPresident, transportation by water for Department of Defense cargoes \nshall be obtained, consistent with military requirements and prudent \nmanagement, in the following order of priority:\n            ``(1) To the maximum extent practicable, use of privately \n        owned United States-flag vessels that are--\n                    ``(A) operating in United States liner or tramp \n                trades, and\n                    ``(B) not chartered to the Government.\n            ``(2)(A) Time charter or voyage charter of suitable \n        privately owned United States-flag vessels--\n                    ``(i) operating in liner service providing partial \n                or total space available, or\n                    ``(ii) operating in tramp service,\n        to the extent those vessels are voluntarily made available to \n        the Department of Defense.\n            ``(B) Time charters and voyage charters pursuant to this \n        paragraph shall be kept to the minimum necessary to meet \n        requirements which, barring reasonable foresight, cannot be met \n        by United States-flag liner or tramp operators.\n            ``(3)(A) In the event suitable United States-flag vessels \n        are not available in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2), \n        and upon the written approval of the Secretary of \n        Transportation, use of--\n                    ``(i) vessels in the nucleus fleet established \n                under section 2631a; and\n                    ``(ii) to the extent vessels in the nucleus fleet \n                are not available, as determined by the Secretary of \n                Defense, foreign-flag vessels to the extent necessary \n                to meet urgent military requirements.\n            ``(B) Any use of a foreign-flag vessel pursuant to this \n        paragraph shall be limited to a single voyage.\n    ``(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), any appropriate \ntariff that a person has filed with the Federal Maritime Commission \nunder either the Shipping Act of 1916 or the Shipping Act of 1984 shall \napply to transportation of Department of Defense cargo on any United \nStates-flag vessel that is operated by that person.\n    ``(2)(A) This section does not prohibit an agency that is \nresponsible for procuring transportation of Department of Defense cargo \nfrom procuring that transportation from a person at a negotiated rate \nthat is more favorable to the United States Government than a tariff \nfiled by that person that is otherwise applicable under paragraph (1).\n    ``(B) Any rate that is negotiated under this subparagraph shall be \nfiled with the Federal Maritime Commission in the manner prescribed by \nthe Commission.\n    ``(c)(1) The Office of the Chief of Naval Operations shall be \nsolely responsible in the Department of Defense for obtaining, \nproviding, operating, and controlling Government-owned or Government-\nchartered vessels--\n            ``(A) to transport Department of Defense cargoes in areas \n        that are not served by privately owned United States-flag \n        merchant vessels; and\n            ``(B) for purposes of any partial or full mobilization \n        conducted for any reason declared by the President.\n    ``(2)(A) The Military Sealift Command is the sole manager for ocean \ntransportation of Department of Defense cargoes.\n    ``(B) The purpose of any ocean transportation provided by the \nDepartment of Defense is to support and augment persons who provide \ntransportation by water in commercial service to the extent those \npersons cannot provide the vessels or services required by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n    ``(C) Except as provided in this section and section 2631a, the \nDepartment of Defense shall not engage in competition with private \npersons in the provision of transportation by water in commercial \nservice.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
