OIL VALUATION RULES.\n\n    (a) Separate Rules.--\n            (1) In general.--Subject to the requirements in this \n        section, the Secretary may establish separate rules to govern \n        the calculation of the value for Federal royalty purposes of \n        crude oil produced by independent producers and integrated \n        producers from any Federal onshore or Outer Continental Shelf \n        lease.\n            (2) Integrated producers.--Any rule established under this \n        subsection for integrated producers shall comply with the \n        provisions of subsection (b).\n            (3) Independent producers: gross proceeds.--(A) Any rule \n        under this subsection for independent producers may allow \n        payment of royalties based on the total gross proceeds accruing \n        to an independent producer or its affiliate under an arm's-\n        length contract for a true sale of the crude oil.\n            (B) Rules under this subsection may allow any lessee, in \n        valuing crude oil on the basis of its gross proceeds, to deduct \n        its reasonable, necessary, and actual costs of transportation. \n        No other deductions, allowances, or adjustments to a royalty \n        payment may be made.\n            (C)(i) Rules under this subsection shall require that a \n        lessee, in valuing crude oil on the basis of gross proceeds, \n        shall certify annually to the Secretary that it will comply \n        with its duty to market the production.\n            (ii) If the Secretary finds that any lessee has breached \n        its duty to market the production, the lessee shall be liable \n        for additional royalties as determined under subsection (b) and \n        for the total administrative and legal costs incurred by the \n        Federal government in investigating and prosecuting the breach.\n            (iii) Violations of the certification required under this \n        subparagraph shall be subject to a penalty that shall be not \n        less than an amount equal to the underpayment amount determined \n        by the Secretary under paragraph (3)(C)(i).\n            (4) Independent producers: market-based method.--(A) Any \n        rule established by the Secretary for independent producers \n        that is not based on gross proceeds as provided in paragraph \n        (3) or that will apply to crude oil sold or transferred under \n        non-arm's-length circumstances shall be based on an \n        independent, market-based method. In promulgating such a rule, \n        the Secretary shall consider application of a commodity-based \n        price or marker crude price.\n            (B) Rules under this paragraph shall establish a single \n        method for valuing crude oil, except that such rules--\n                    (i) may apply a different method in different \n                geographic regions, if the Secretary finds that the use \n                of a different method in a region is necessary to \n                reflect the unique market characteristics of that \n                region; and\n                    (ii) may provide for any reasonable and necessary \n                adjustments or deductions, subject to the limitations \n                set forth in subsections (a)(3)(B) and (b)(3).\n    (b) Single Set of Rules.--\n            (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines not to \n        establish separate rules as authorized under subsection (a), \n        the Secretary shall establish a single set of rules to govern \n        the calculations referred to in subsection (a) that apply to \n        both independent producers and integrated producers. Such rules \n        shall use a method for determining the value of all crude oil \n        that is based on a commodity-based price or a marker crude \n        price.\n            (2) Geographic variation.--Rules under this subsection may \n        apply different commodity-based prices or marker crude prices \n        in different geographic regions, if the Secretary finds that \n        the application of a different price in a particular region is \n        necessary to reflect the unique market characteristics of the \n        region.\n            (3) Other variation.--Rules under this section may provide \n        for reasonable and necessary location- and quality-based \n        adjustments to any commodity-based price or marker crude price. \n        No other deductions, allowances, or adjustments to a royalty \n        payment may be made.\n\nSEC. 4.
