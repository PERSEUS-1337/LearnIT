FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the populations of whales that occur in waters of the \n        United States are resources of substantial ecological, \n        scientific, socioeconomic, and esthetic value;\n            (2) whale populations--\n                    (A) form a significant component of marine \n                ecosystems;\n                    (B) are the subject of intense research;\n                    (C) provide for a multimillion dollar whale \n                watching tourist industry that provides the public an \n                opportunity to enjoy and learn about great whales and \n                the ecosystems of which the whales are a part; and\n                    (D) are of importance to Native Americans for \n                cultural and subsistence purposes;\n            (3) whale populations are in various stages of recovery, \n        and some whale populations, such as the northern right whale \n        (Eubaleana glacialis) remain perilously close to extinction;\n            (4) the interactions that occur between ship traffic, \n        commercial fishing, whale watching vessels, and other \n        recreational vessels and whale populations may affect whale \n        populations adversely;\n            (5) the exploration and development of oil, gas, and hard \n        mineral resources, marine debris, chemical pollutants, noise, \n        and other anthropogenic sources of change in the habitat of \n        whales may affect whale populations adversely;\n            (6) the conservation of whale populations is subject to \n        difficult challenges related to--\n                    (A) the migration of whale populations across \n                international boundaries;\n                    (B) the size of individual whales, as that size \n                precludes certain conservation research procedures that \n                may be used for other animal species, such as captive \n                research and breeding;\n                    (C) the low reproductive rates of whales that \n                require long-term conservation programs to ensure \n                recovery of whale populations; and\n                    (D) the occurrence of whale populations in offshore \n                waters where undertaking research, monitoring, and \n                conservation measures is difficult and costly;\n            (7)(A) the Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator \n        of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has \n        research and regulatory responsibility for the conservation of \n        whales under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 \n        U.S.C. 1361 et seq.); and\n            (B) the heads of other Federal agencies and the Marine \n        Mammal Commission established under section 201 of the Marine \n        Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1401) have related \n        research and management activities under the Marine Mammal \n        Protection Act of 1972 or the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n        (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);\n            (8) the funding available for the activities described in \n        paragraph (8) is insufficient to support all necessary whale \n        conservation and recovery activities; and\n            (9) there is a need to facilitate the use of funds from \n        non-Federal sources to carry out the conservation of whales.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL WHALE CONSERVATION FUND.\n\n    Section 4 of the National Fish and Wildlife Establishment Act (16 \nU.S.C. 3703) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(f)(1) In carrying out the purposes under section 2(b), the \nFoundation may establish a national whale conservation endowment fund, \nto be used by the Foundation to support research, management \nactivities, or educational programs that contribute to the protection, \nconservation, or recovery of whale populations in waters of the United \nStates.\n    ``(2)(A) In a manner consistent with subsection (c)(1), the \nFoundation may--\n            ``(i) accept, receive, solicit, hold, administer, and use \n        any gift, devise, or bequest made to the Foundation for the \n        express purpose of supporting whale conservation; and\n            ``(ii) deposit in the endowment fund under paragraph (1) \n        any funds made available to the Foundation under this \n        subparagraph, including any income or interest earned from a \n        gift, devise, or bequest received by the Foundation under this \n        subparagraph.\n    ``(B) To raise funds to be deposited in the endowment fund under \nparagraph (1), the Foundation may enter into appropriate arrangements \nto provide for the design, copyright, production, marketing, or \nlicensing, of logos, seals, decals, stamps, or any other item that the \nFoundation determines to be appropriate.\n    ``(C)(i) The Secretary of Commerce may transfer to the Foundation \nfor deposit in the endowment fund under paragraph (1)--\n            ``(I) any amount (or portion thereof) received by the \n        Secretary under section 105(a)(1) of the Marine Mammal \n        Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1375(a)(1)) as a civil \n        penalty assessed by the Secretary under that section; or\n            ``(II) any amount (or portion thereof) received by the \n        Secretary as a settlement or award for damages in a civil \n        action or other legal proceeding relating to damage of natural \n        resources.\n    ``(ii) The Directors of the Board shall ensure that any amounts \ntransferred to the Foundation under clause (i) for the endowment fund \nunder paragraph (1) are deposited in that fund in accordance with this \nsubparagraph.\n    ``(3) It is the intent of Congress that in making expenditures from \nthe endowment fund under paragraph (1) to carry out activities \nspecified in that paragraph, the Foundation should give priority to \nfunding projects that address the conservation of populations of whales \nthat the Foundation determines--\n            ``(A) are the most endangered (including the northern right \n        whale (Eubaleana glacialis)); or\n            ``(B) most warrant, and are most likely to benefit from, \n        research managment, or educational activities that may be \n        funded with amounts made available from the fund.\n    ``(g) In carrying out any action on the part of the Foundation \nunder subsection (f), the Directors of the Board shall consult with the \nAdministrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nand the Marine Mammal Commission.''."
