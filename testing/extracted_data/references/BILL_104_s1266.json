FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) during the 25 years preceding the date of enactment of \n        this Act, the United States experienced a deterioration of \n        potential economic growth;\n            (2) there is sufficient evidence to suggest that increased \n        Government spending, deficits, high taxes, and regulation have \n        significantly contributed to slower economic growth, higher \n        inflation, and diminished expectations;\n            (3) micromanagement of the economy and fine tuning have not \n        alleviated economic hardship;\n            (4) the conditions and goals established by the Full \n        Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, have not been and \n        could not be met, and continue to cause confusion and ambiguity \n        about the appropriate role of monetary policy;\n            (5) the multiple policy goals of the Board of Governors of \n        the Federal Reserve System, stipulated in the Full Employment \n        and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, have created uncertainty about \n        the aims of monetary policy, which can add to volatility in \n        economic activity and financial markets, costing workers jobs \n        and harming economic growth;\n            (6) there is a need for the Congress to clarify the proper \n        role of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in \n        economic policymaking, in order to achieve the best environment \n        for long-term economic growth and the lowest possible interest \n        rates;\n            (7) recognizing the dangers of inflation and the \n        appropriate role of monetary policy, political leaders in \n        countries throughout the world are directing the central banks \n        of those countries to institute reforms that focus monetary \n        policy on the single objective of price stability, rather than \n        on multiple policy goals; and\n            (8) because price stability leads to the lowest possible \n        interest rates and is a key condition to maintaining the \n        highest possible levels of productivity, real incomes, living \n        standards, employment, and global competitiveness, price \n        stability should be the primary long-term goal of the Board of \n        Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States \nthat--\n            (1) the principal economic responsibilities of the \n        Government are to establish and ensure an environment that is \n        conducive to both long-term economic growth and increases in \n        living standards, by establishing and maintaining free markets, \n        low taxes, respect for private property, and the stable, long-\n        term purchasing power of the United States currency; and\n            (2) the primary long-term goal of the Board of Governors of \n        the Federal Reserve System should be to promote price \n        stability.\n\nSEC. 3. MONETARY POLICY.\n\n    (a) Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act.--Section 2A of the \nFederal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 225a) is amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 2A.
