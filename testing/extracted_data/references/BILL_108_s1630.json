FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Federal Communications Commission has assigned 2-1-\n        1 as the national telephone number for telephone service for \n        information and referral on human services, declaring that 2-1-\n        1 best satisfies the public interest in allotting the limited \n        resource of this abbreviated number. In 2005, the Commission \n        will assess the widespread utilization of the 2-1-1 telephone \n        number and evaluate whether to continue the assignment of that \n        telephone number for that service.\n            (2) The number ``2-1-1'' is an easy-to-remember telephone \n        number that facilitates critical connections between \n        individuals and families seeking services, volunteer \n        opportunities, or both and appropriate human service agencies, \n        including community-based and faith-based organizations and \n        government agencies.\n            (3) There are more than 820,000 nonprofit organizations in \n        the United States. Individuals and families often find it \n        difficult to navigate through a complex and ever-growing maze \n        of human service agencies and programs, spending inordinate \n        amounts of time trying to identify an agency or program that \n        provides a service that may be immediately or urgently required \n        and often abandoning the search from frustration or a lack of \n        quality information.\n            (4) At the Federal, State, and local levels, government \n        funding supports well-intentioned programs that are not fully \n        utilized because of a lack of access to and information on such \n        programs by the public. Program administrators have indicated \n        that there is a need for a simple way to connect those eligible \n        for programs with available program resources. 2-1-1 telephone \n        service will reduce the number of inappropriate calls to \n        government offices by directing consumers to the appropriate \n        human services agency, resulting in a more effective use of \n        government services.\n            (5) Many families need information on government and not-\n        for-profit services that address domestic violence, support \n        adequate and stable housing, alleviate hunger, and provide for \n        high-quality day care, afterschool activities, summer \n        activities, job training and assistance, elder care, and \n        disaster recovery.\n            (6) Individuals often need support, services, or both when \n        suffering emotional distress, having suicidal thoughts or \n        behavior, contemplating violence, or using drugs or alcohol.\n            (7) Americans desire to volunteer and become involved in \n        their communities. This desire, together with a desire to \n        donate to organizations which provide human services, are among \n        the reasons to contact a center which provides information and \n        referral on volunteer opportunities and human services.\n            (8) Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, an \n        estimated 400 telephone hotlines were established in New York, \n        New York, for various funds and services, creating a confusing \n        network for victims and volunteers to navigate. A Comptroller \n        General report on charitable aid following the terrorist \n        attacks found that ``families of victims generally believed \n        they had to navigate a maze of service providers in the early \n        months'' and that ``good information about and easy access to \n        available assistance could help survivors in the recovery \n        process''.\n            (9) The 107th Congress recognized the importance of 2-1-1 \n        telephone service in community preparedness and response by \n        including use of that telephone number for public information \n        as an allowable use of funds under grants for preparedness and \n        response to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies \n        under section 319C-1 of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 247d-3a), as added by section 131 of the Public Health \n        Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 \n        (Public Law 107-188).\n            (10) While 20 percent of the population has access to 2-1-1 \n        telephone service in 21 States, inadequate funding prevents \n        access to that telephone service throughout each of the States. \n        2-1-1 telephone service is currently available statewide only \n        in Connecticut and Hawaii.\n            (11) Rapid deployment nationwide of 2-1-1 telephone service \n        as a means of access to information about and referral on human \n        services requires collaboration among State governments, \n        comprehensive and specialized information and referral centers, \n        human service organizations and service providers, emergency \n        management and homeland security officials, telephone \n        companies, and other relevant entities.\n            (12) 2-1-1 telephone service facilitates the availability \n        of a single repository where comprehensive data on all \n        community services is collected, maintained, and updated \n        regularly, reducing costs and duplication of efforts. The \n        reliable data provided through 2-1-1 telephone service helps to \n        better assess the needs of our communities and to immediately \n        mobilize resources toward those needs.\n\nSEC. 3.
