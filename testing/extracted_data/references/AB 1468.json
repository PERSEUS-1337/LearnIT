    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Existing law provides that individuals with disabilities or medical conditions have the same right as the general public to the full and free use of streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways, public buildings, medical facilities, public facilities, and other public places.\n(b)\nExisting law prescribes a process for bringing an action to remedy issues of accessibility and provides that a person aggrieved or potentially aggrieved by a violation of these rights may bring an action for damages.\n(c)\nLegislation enacted in 2012 requires an attorney to provide a written advisory with each demand letter or complaint to a defendant or potential defendant for any construction-related accessibility claim. Certain basic review requirements are also required prior to sending a demand letter. This legislation did not and does not apply to public facilities.\n(d)\nIt is the mission of community colleges and school districts to provide quality educational programs and services that address the diverse needs of students and communities throughout the state.\n(e)\nCalifornia\u2019s community colleges place a heavy importance on providing quality educational facilities that are accessible to all members of the community.\n(f)\nCommunity colleges and local educational agencies, as well as other public agencies, are subject to design and construction oversight by the Division of the State Architect. The Division of the State Architect evaluates compliance with building code and Education Code requirements for accessibility, structural safety, and fire and life safety on new construction projects and on modernization projects.\n(g)\nAs part of its responsibilities, the Division of the State Architect performs a project closeout to determine that the project complies with codes and regulations governing school construction, including accessibility. This process examines facilities for specific requirements before, during, and after construction to ensure any outstanding issues have been resolved. At the end of construction, the Division of the State Architect issues a closeout letter for the project that indicates compliance with applicable rules and regulations.\n(h)\nIn light of the participation of the Division of the State Architect in the design and construction of facilities of community colleges and local educational agencies, it is appropriate that these facilities receive additional protections already extended to private defendants in construction-accessibility actions.\nSECTION 1.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 54.26 is added to the Civil Code, to read:\n54.26.\n(a) For any action commenced on or after January 1, 2016, or for an action commenced prior to that date for which a final judgment has not been entered, the following shall apply:\n(1) New construction or alteration of a structure conducted by a public entity on or before September 15, 2010, that complies with the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design or the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards are deemed not in violation of this part.\n(2) New construction or alteration of a structure conducted by a public entity on or after September 15, 2010, and before March 15, 2012, that complies with either the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design or 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design are deemed not in violation of this part.\n(3) New construction or alteration of a structure conducted by a public entity on or after March 15, 2012, that complies with the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design or the applicable code in place at the time of construction or alteration are deemed not in violation of this part.\n(4) Elements in existing facilities of a public entity that have not been altered on or before March 15, 2012, that comply with the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design or 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design are deemed not in violation of this part.\n(b) A public entity\u2019s possession of a closeout letter from the State Architect certifying that the public buildings, public facilities, and other public places to which the letter applies meet the applicable building and construction-related accessibility standards of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act shall serve as presumptive evidence that the public buildings, facilities, and places are in compliance with this part and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.\nSEC. 2.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 55.52 of the Civil Code is amended to read:\n55.52.\n(a) For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:\n(1) \u201cConstruction-related accessibility claim\u201d means any civil claim in a civil action with respect to a place of public accommodation, including, but not limited to, a claim brought under Section 51, 54, 54.1, or 55, based wholly or in part on an alleged violation of any construction-related accessibility standard, as defined in paragraph (6).\n(2) \u201cApplication for stay and early evaluation conference\u201d means an application to be filed with the court that meets the requirements of subdivision (c) of Section 55.54.\n(3) \u201cCertified access specialist\u201d or \u201cCASp\u201d means any person who has been certified pursuant to Section 4459.5 of the Government Code.\n(4) \u201cMeets applicable standards\u201d means the site was inspected by a CASp and determined to meet all applicable construction-related accessibility standards pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 55.53.
