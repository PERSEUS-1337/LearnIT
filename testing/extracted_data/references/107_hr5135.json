    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Aviation Security Enhancement Act of \n2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The safety and security of the civil air transportation \n        system is critical to the security and national defense of the \n        United States.\n            (2) A large percentage of the Nation's airports will have \n        checked baggage explosive detection systems in place by the \n        statutory deadline of December 31, 2002, but the remaining \n        airports will be required to implement expensive interim \n        systems requiring full replacement or relocation (or both) \n        within a short period of time.\n            (3) Implementation and replacement of the interim systems \n        will cost millions of taxpayer dollars, will present serious \n        problems in ensuring that a sufficient number of operators are \n        hired and trained within the allotted time, and will require \n        unprecedented demands on lobby space in airports.\n            (4) The statutory deadline of December 31, 2002, which was \n        originally believed to be adequate in providing a reasonable \n        time frame for implementing an effective baggage screening \n        system, may be insufficient and inefficient to accomplish the \n        mission envisioned by Congress in approving the Aviation and \n        Transportation Security Act.\n            (5) In order to meet that critical mission, significant \n        flexibility was included in that Act to allow the Under \n        Secretary of Transportation for Security to continue using \n        current screening practices until explosive detection systems \n        can be installed. A high level of security can be maintained in \n        the interim using current practices while the longer-term \n        systems are installed.\n            (6) A measured approach to installations will provide the \n        Transportation Security Administration with appropriate leeway \n        to incrementally address individual airport requirements and \n        potentially allow that agency to accommodate technology \n        improvements and lessons learned.\n            (7) Such installations should be accomplished without undue \n        delays after the planning phase has been completed.\n            (8) By providing optimal solutions, air passengers will be \n        better protected.\n\nSEC. 3.
