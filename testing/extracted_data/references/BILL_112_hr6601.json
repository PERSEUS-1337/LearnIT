FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Approximately 1.5 million Americans, including \n        children, are diagnosed with cancer annually.\n            (2) Over 500,000 Americans die from cancer every year.\n            (3) Less than 5 percent of all cancers are caused by \n        genetic factors.\n            (4) Cancer is the top cause of disease-related death for \n        American children and adolescents.\n            (5) Children are more vulnerable to environmental \n        carcinogens than adults.\n            (6) Reducing exposure to carcinogens reduces risk of \n        cancer.\n            (7) The average consumer currently lacks the ability to \n        easily identify products that do not contain carcinogens.\n            (8) Consumers benefit from additional information about the \n        potential health impact of products they use.\n            (9) When comparing products to purchase for their families, \n        many consumers use potential health impact as a determining \n        factor.\n            (10) The 2008-2009 Annual Report of the President's Cancer \n        Panel urges action to prevent environmental and occupational \n        exposure to carcinogens.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to enable consumers to \nreduce their exposure to carcinogens by allowing manufacturers to affix \na Carcinogen-Free label to products that do not contain known or \nprobable carcinogens through a voluntary process that does not require \npublic disclosure of trade secrets.\n\nSEC. 3.
