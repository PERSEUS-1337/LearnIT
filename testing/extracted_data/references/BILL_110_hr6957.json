FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Microfinance is considered one of the great success \n        stories of United States foreign aid because of its ability to \n        reach the poor, especially women, with programs that have a \n        high impact and are highly sustainable.\n            (2) Studies conducted in India, Kenya, and the Philippines \n        found average annual returns on microbusiness investments \n        ranging from 177 to 847 percent, demonstrating the enormous \n        capacity the poor have to work and save their way out of \n        poverty.\n            (3) An estimated 113 million clients are currently being \n        served with microcredit, and the Microcredit Summit Campaign \n        has set a goal of reaching 175 million of the world's poorest \n        families by 2015.\n            (4) The lack of human capital is widely recognized as the \n        single greatest constraint to the growth of leading \n        microfinance networks and other practitioners providing direct \n        financial services to the poor.\n            (5) According to some industry estimates, in order to meet \n        the anticipated demand for microfinance, the industry will have \n        to hire 1.6 million new loan officers in Africa, Asia, Latin \n        America, and the Near East, assuming a loan officer to client \n        ratio of 1 to 300.\n            (6) Conservative estimates state that $2 billion in private \n        investment capital is currently being leveraged for \n        microfinance. Substantially more could be mobilized and \n        invested in some of the world's poorest countries but remains \n        untapped due to the lack of institutional capacity and \n        qualified leaders.\n            (7) The lack of human capacity is particularly severe in \n        sub-Saharan Africa due to the relative immaturity of the \n        microfinance industry, a small pool of trained and certified \n        bankers and finance experts, and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the microfinance capacity-building \nactivities supported by subsection (d) of section 252 of the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2211a), as added by section 4 of this \nAct, is intended to drive innovation and provide comprehensive \nsolutions that address the lack of human capital in developing \ncountries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Such activities should \nprovide a regional and sub-regional approach to maximizing economies of \nscale and should focus predominately on educating and training African \nnationals in order to build capacity in the microfinance industry in \ndeveloping countries, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries.\n\nSEC. 4. CAPACITY-BUILDING FOR MICROFINANCE SERVICE PROVIDERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 252 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n(22 U.S.C. 2211a) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Capacity Building for Microfinance Service Providers.--\n            ``(1) Authorization.--In carrying out the programs \n        authorized under subsection (a), the Administrator shall \n        establish a grant program to provide assistance on a non-\n        reimbursable basis to private, non-profit networks of \n        microfinance institutions that provide direct financial \n        services, which may include credit of all types, savings, \n        insurance, remittances and cash transfers, to the poor and very \n        poor in developing countries.\n            ``(2) Activities supported.--Assistance provided under \n        paragraph (1) shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be used \n        to carry out traditional and nontraditional education and \n        training for individuals working in the microfinance industry \n        in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan African \n        countries.
