    "content": "Conferees agreed to a FY2004 legislative branch appropriation of $3.548 billion contained in H.R. 2547 . The President signed the bill into law on September 30, 2003, P.L. 108-83 ,117 Stat. 1007. The act also contains $937.6 million for FY2003 emergency supplementalappropriations (for non-legislative branch programs).  The annual legislative branch appropriations bill contains two titles. Appropriations forlegislative branch agencies are contained in Title I. Title II contains general administrativeprovisions, and from time to time appropriations for legislative branch entities. For example, in theFY2003 Act Title II contained funding for the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Trainingand Development and the Congressional Award Act. Congress changed the structure of the annual legislative branch appropriations bill effective in FY2003. Prior to enactment of the FY2003 bill, and effective in FY1978, the legislative branchappropriations bill was divided into two titles. Title I, Congressional Operations, contained budgetauthorities for activities directly serving Congress. Included in this title were the budgets of theHouse, the Senate, Joint Items (joint House and Senate activities), the Office of Compliance, theCongressional Budget Office (CBO), the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) (except the Library ofCongress (LOC) buildings and grounds), the Congressional Research Service (CRS) within theLibrary of Congress, and congressional printing and binding activities of the Government PrintingOffice (GPO). Title II, Related Agencies, contained budgets for activities not directly supporting Congress. Included in this title were budgets of the Botanic Garden, the Library of Congress (except theCongressional Research Service), the Library buildings and grounds maintained by the Architect ofthe Capitol, the Government Printing Office (except congressional printing and binding costs), andthe General Accounting Office (GAO). Periodically since FY1978, the bill contained additionaltitles for such purposes as capital improvements and special one-time functions. In addition to activities funded in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill, there are legislative budget authorities that include permanent budget authority for both federal funds and trustfunds, and non-legislative entities.  Permanent federal funds are available as the result of previously enacted legislation and do not require annual action. (1) Permanent trust funds are monies held in accounts credited with collections from specific sources earmarked by law for a defined purpose. Trust funds do not appear in the annual legislativebill since they are not budget authority. They are included in the U.S. Budget either as budgetreceipts or offsetting collections. (2) The Budget also contains non-legislative entities within the legislative branch budget. They are funded in other appropriation bills, but are placed in the legislative section by the Office ofManagement and Budget for bookkeeping purposes. (3)  Table 1. Legislative Branch Appropriations, FY1995 toFY2004 (budget authority in billions of current dollars) a a. These figures represent current dollars, exclude permanent budget authorities, and contain supplementals and rescissions. Permanent budget authorities are not included in the annuallegislative branch appropriations bill but, rather, are automatically funded annually. b.

The first FY2001legislative branch appropriations bill, H.R. 4516 , was vetoed Oct. 30, 2000. The second legislative branch appropriations bill, H.R. 5657 , was introduced Dec. 14 and incorporated in P.L 106-554. in P.L.106-554 . This figure does not reflect any terrorism supplementals funds released pursuant to P.L. 107-38 .  e. This figure contains regular annual appropriations in P.L. 107-68 ; transfers from the legislativebranch emergency response fund pursuant to P.L. 107-117 ; and FY2002 supplementalappropriations in P.L. 107-206 .  f.

On February 3, 2003, President Bush issued the FY2004 U.S.Budget containing an estimate of $3.76 billion for operations of the legislative branch. Subsequently, the request was later revised to $3.78 billion due to modifications by legislativebranch agencies, which reflected an increase of 9.1% ($315.5 million) over the FY2003appropriation of $3.46 billion. A substantial part of the increase was to meet mandatoryexpenses required by law, including additional funding for salaries and related expenses andincreased costs of goods and services for internal operations of legislative branch agencies.  Hearings on FY2004 Budget Requests. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations held most of their hearings on FY2004legislative branch agency requests in March, April, and May 2003.

The Housebill did not contain funds for the center.  H.R. 2657 passed with an amendment prohibiting the use of funds in the bill for supplemental dental and vision health insurance benefits for House Members andemployees. This language was contained as an amendment to H.R. 2657 in thenature of a substitute to the rule providing for consideration of H.R. 2657 ( H.Res. 311 ). The rule was agreed to by a vote of 411-13.

H12445).  Soon after approving the FY2003 regular annual legislative branch appropriations ( P.L.108-7 ), and prior to consideration of the FY2004 legislative branch budget, Congress clearedan FY2003 supplemental ( H.R. 1559 , P.L. 108-11 ) containing $125 million forthe legislative branch emergency response fund. (7) Appropriations were made available asfollows:  $11.0 million -- House of Representatives, committee employees (standing committees, special and select), for salaries and expenses; $37.8 million -- Capitol Police, general expenses, \"for increasingemergency costs of the security requirements for the United States Capitol Complex relatedto protecting the occupants and visitors;\" $111,000 -- Office of Compliance, salaries and expenses, \"to covercontracted services of hearings officers and mediators for the increasing number ofhearings;\" $63.9 million -- Architect of the Capitol, Capitol police buildings andgrounds, \"for the property purchase, design, and the beginning of construction for a newCapitol Police headquarters,\" $5.5 million -- Library of Congress, salaries and expenses, \"toimplement a public address system for the Library's buildings to assure effectivecommunications in all emergency situations;\" $1.9 million -- Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service,\"to support the planning, design, and implementation of the Congressional Research Serviceportion of the alternate computer facilities;\" $4.9 million -- General Accounting Office, salaries and expenses, \"tosupport the implementation of important security enhancements required within the GAOfacility.\" (8) Funding Issues. In recent years, Congress has undertaken to strengthen the capabilities of the Capitol Police by providing increasedfunding; the FY2002 budget was increased by 47.1%, and the FY2003 budget by 38.6%.  The Capitol Police requested a 20.9% increase of $50.3 million for FY2004. (9) Conferees,however, agreed to withhold additional funds and actually reduce the Capitol Policeappropriation by 8.0%, to $221.1 million from $240.2 million in FY2003. (10) The conferencefigure reflects an increase of 4.4% from the appropriation contained in the House bill, anda decrease of 7.9% from that contained in the Senate bill.  The FY2004 Capitol Police appropriation funds 1,993 positions, including 1,592 sworn staff and 401 civilian employees. Language authorizes 30 positions to be converted fromsworn to civilian positions. Conferees also directed the Capitol Police to recruit 75 newpersonnel as follows: five positions for the chief, three of which are to be mid-level attorneysin the Office of General Counsel; 33 positions, three of which are to be intelligence analystsand 13 positions for the Security Services Bureau; and 37 positions for the Office of the ChiefAdministrative Officer.  Conferees noted \"that should the Capitol Police strategic plan, and associated staffing plan, be completed and approved by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees,during fiscal year 2004, there is ample funding from the Emergency Response Fund for newsworn positions.\" (11) The Capitol Police appropriation is contained in two accounts: (12) salaries account , which conferees funded at $197.6 million, a 13.2% increase from $174.5 million; the House funded the salaries account at $189.9 million, anincrease of 8.8% (request was a 25.1% increase), and the Senate funded the account at $207.0million, an increase of 18.6%;  general expenses account , which conferees funded at $23.5 million, adecrease of 15.8% from $27.9 million; the House funded the account at $21.9 million, adecrease of 21.5% (request was a 158.8% increase), and the Senate funded the account at$33.0 million, an increase of 18.2%. A separate appropriation under the Architect of the Capitol account contains $3.3 millionfor Capitol Police buildings and grounds, the same amount contained in both the House andSenate bills. This represents a significant decrease from the FY2003 appropriation of $63.9million. (13) Among other Capitol Police provisions contained in P.L. 108-83 are those  authorizing the recruitment and training of sworn positions for assignment to the Library of Congress, including 23 positions in FY2004; restating a requirement that the Capitol Police notify and consult with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on plans that \"result in theredistribution, reprogramming, or reallocation of FTE's or funds in a manner different fromthat presented in each budget year's appropriation hearings; position reports to theCommittees; and the final approved budget;\" (14) authorizing any counsel providing legal assistance and representation to the Capitol Police to appear in any federal or state court;  directing that hazardous materials response team members assisting the Capitol Police be treated as members of the force in order to receive retirement benefits thatare comparable to benefits available to other federal firefighters and law enforcementpersonnel;  providing for a \"more effective and efficient\" transfer of Library of Congress police to the Capitol Police force; (15) redefining and extending the physical jurisdiction of the Capitol Police over traffic within and around the Capitol grounds to limit and prohibit trucks, referred to asthe \"truck interdiction program;\" directing the Capitol Police Board to make regulations regarding \"implementation, execution and maintenance\" of the truck interdiction program and to submitits regulations to the Committee on House Administration and the Senate Committee on Rulesand Administration for approval; and directing that FY2004 basic training expenses of the Capitol Police at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center be paid from Department of Homeland Securityfunds.  Conferees agreed to a $48.839 million additional appropriation for the Capitol Visitors' Center, funded under the Architect of the Capitol account. The appropriation is similar to theamount considered necessary to complete construction of the center, based upon a review bythe General Accounting Office (GAO) and a GAO \"assessment of a cost-to-complete estimateprepared by a third party with expertise in construction cost analysis.\" (16) Of this amount,$1.039 million is marked for operational costs, and $48.550 million is no-year money. TheSenate version of the FY2004 bill contained an appropriation of $47.8 million for the center;the House did not provide funds for the center.  The actual new appropriation for FY2004 is $36.839 million, since conferees authorized $12.0 million to be transferred to the center' appropriation from previously appropriated fundsmade available for Capitol Police buildings and grounds also funded under the Architect ofthe Capitol account. Conferees also  directed the General Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct quarterly performance reviews of construction progress to determine adherence and changes to thecenter's expenses and schedule, to support oversight by the House and Senate Committees onAppropriations and the Capitol Preservation Commission; limited federal funds that can be obligated or spent on a tunnelconnecting the center with the Library of Congress to $10.0 million; prohibited the expenditure of funds by the Architect of the Capitol for construction of the tunnel until a plan for obligation of funds (showing purpose, amount, andschedule) is approved by the chairmen and ranking members of the House and SenateCommittees on Appropriations; and \"urged\" those responsible for exhibits in the center to consult with the Library of Congress \"to ensure that the exhibit presents history of the Congress as well as therole of the congress in the preservation of the cultural and artistic heritage of the Americanpeople.\" (17) Senate report language addressed concerns of the Senate with several aspects of management of the project, expressing reservations about providing additional funds \"withoutbetter management practices.\" The Senate requested the Architect to impose necessarycontrols on construction of the Capitol Visitors' Center (CVC), stating that the top priorityof the Architect is to ensure completion in a timely and financially responsible manner;directed the Architect to \"develop a risk mitigation plan, and institute a global project costcoding and tracking system for all costs, to ensure to the extent practicable there will not beadditional cost requirements to complete the project in a timely fashion without jeopardizingquality.\"  The Senate further prohibited the Architect from obligating any of the $$47.8 million contained in the report without receipt of (1) a recommendation by the Capitol PreservationCommission, and (2) approval of an spending plan by the House and Senate Committees onAppropriations. (18) Interest in the construction of the Capitol Visitors' Center reflects a heightened interest by some Members of Congress in making the necessary appropriations available so thatconstruction of the center can be completed in 2005. (19) Congressional leadership broke groundfor the center on June 20, 2000, and construction began in early 2002. Revised constructioncost estimates have increased the original budget of $265 million to $373.5 million. (20) A totalof $308.5 million in federal appropriations have been made for the center's construction, andan additional $65 million in private funds is reportedly available.  Funding Issues. Conferees agreed to $405.4 million for activities of the Architect of the Capitol, a decrease of $51.4 million(-11.3%) from the FY2003 appropriation of $456.8 million. Operations of the Architect arefunded in nine accounts. The FY2004 appropriations for these accounts and the percentagechanges from FY2003 are as follows: general administration -- $77.1 million (+30.7%);  Capitol building -- $28.2 million (-14.5%); Capitol grounds -- $6.9 million (-17.1%); Senate office buildings -- $63.4 million (-1.7%);  House office buildings -- $62.8 million (+3.7%); Capitol power plant -- $81.5 million (-34.4%); (21)  Library buildings and grounds -- $39.2 million(+5.1%); Capitol Police buildings and grounds -- $3.3 million (-94.8%); (22) and Botanic garden -- $6.2 million (+2.1%).  From time to time, other projects of the Architect are funded in separate accounts of the bill under the Architect, as is the case in the FY2004 Act which makes available $48.839million for completion of the Capitol Visitors' Center (CVC). That figure reflects a newappropriation of $36.839 million combined with $12.0 million made available by confereesin a transfer from the Capitol Police buildings and grounds account under the Architect of theCapitol.  Prior to FY2004, Congress funded separate accounts under the Architect in FY2002, including $70.0 million for the CVC and $1.3 million for the Congressional Cemetery. Conferees on the FY2004 bill also  directed the AOC to issue control and administrative procedures and processes to prevent waste and fraud in the use of funds by offices under hisjurisdiction; encouraged the AOC to cooperate with other legislative branch entitiesto increase the \"volume and visibility\" of artwork which reflects the contributions ofAfrican-Americans throughout the history of the United States; deferred action on personnel and costs associated with energy service at the Capitol Power Plant until completion of a study by the AOC on the organization andadministration of his office (as directed in the House report on H.R. 2657 ); directed that the study of the AOC on organization and administration of his office be \"comprehensive\" and address \"all aspects of AOC central and administrativestaff, including any administrative positions that have been established in the offices of thesuperintendents to ensure that duplicative services do not occur; that all positions are requiredto conduct business; and that they are aligned with the AOC strategic plan;\" (23) funded replacement os high voltage switchgear for the Senate ($2.0 million), the House ($3.6 million), and the Library of Congress ($1.8million); provided $275,000 for upgrades to the emergency evacuation andnotification system in the Capitol Complex;  provided $6.0 million for phase two of the U.S. Capitol Master Plan; provided $9.5 million for modernization of elevators in the House; $4.3 million to upgrade the House data center; directed the General Accounting Office (GAO) to review the master plan of the Capitol Power Plant, its operations and management, and report its findings andrecommendations on the \"adequacy of the master plan, the capacity and efficiency of plantoperations, the reliability and security of its distribution infrastructure, as well as the statusof the expansion projects;\" (24) provided $22.0 million for the West Refrigeration Plant Expansion project at the Capitol Power Plant; and provided transfer authority for an alternate computing facility.  FY2004 Budget Proposal and House and Senate Floor Action. The original FY2004 budget proposal for the Architect was $513.9million, an increase of $57.1 million (12.5%) from $456.8 million in FY2003, including aFY2003 supplemental of $63.9 million for Capitol Police buildings and grounds. (25) Theproposal also authorized the Architect to use $4.4 million in reimbursements made to hisoffice for utilities provided to nonlegislative branch agencies. (27) Most of the increase was for general administration of activities of the Architect (+169.0%), maintenance of the Capitol building (+58.8%), and enhancements to the BotanicGarden (+80.1%). In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee in May 2003,the Architect stated that the most significant factor in the FY2004 budget increase is thepurchase of an alternate computer facility to be shared by legislative branch agencies ($61.0million). (28) The request also reflected a significant decrease for the Capitol police buildings and grounds appropriation (-95.4%), primarily due to a FY2003 supplemental of $40.1 million fora new police headquarters. Other reductions were to be made in funds for the Capitol powerplant (-17.8%) and maintenance of the Capitol grounds (-15.9%). The House version of the FY2004 bill contained a reduction of 9.6% in the budget of the Architect, excluding funds for Senate office buildings , to $357.8 million from $396.2million.  The Senate version contained a decrease of 9.6%, excluding funds for House office buildings , to $357.8 million from $396.2 million in FY2003. The FY2004 figure contains anappropriation of $47.8 million for the Capitol Visitors' Center.  Overall Funding. The FY2004 appropriation for House internal operations is $1.01 billion, an increase of 5.8% over theFY2003 funding level of $960.9 million, (29) anda reduction of 2.4% from the House budgetrequest. Most of the increase is for mandatory expenses, those required by law to meet suchexpenses as the annual salary adjustment and related costs, plus increased costs of goods andservices. Among increases are those for Members' representational allowances to assist Members in their official duties, an increase of 8.0%; salaries and expenses for House leadership offices, an increase of 9.8%; salaries of House administrative officers, their employees and other personnel, an increase of 3.2%;  Office of the Chief Administrative Officer of the House, an increase of 5.5%; and allowances and expenses heading (which includes supplies; official mail for committees, leadership and administrative offices; and mandatory House contributions toinsurance and retirement programs for House employees), an increase of8.9%. Among other provisions of P.L. 108-83 are those that  established the House Office of Interparliamentary Affairs with jurisdiction over visits to the House by participants in interparliamentary exchanges, members of foreign legislative bodies, and permanent officials of foreign governments; required unused funds available to Members for their representational allowances to be used to reduce the deficit; and prohibited the use of funds in the Act to provide supplemental dental or vision health insurance benefits to Members and other Houseemployees. House conferees included language in the conference report regarding the role of the Office of House Finance in the annual budget preparation process. (30) They directed theFinance Office to set deadlines for the receipt of budget information, includingreprogramming activities, from House entities. They also expressed the AppropriationsCommittee's expectation that each House entity will \"provide its utmost support in meetingOffice of Finance deadlines,\" necessitating at times \"an immediate response with little or noadvance notification.\" Conferees noted that in the event a House entity \"is not available torespond to the Finance Office, the Committee expects the Finance Office to provide theirindependent analysis to the Committee.\" (31) House Committee Funding. The FY2004 appropriation for House committee operations is $132.1 million, a decrease of 4.7% from theFY2003 appropriation of $138.6 million. (32) Funding for House committees is contained in the appropriation heading, committee employees, that comprises two subheadings. The first subheading contains funds forpersonnel and non-personnel expenses of House committees, except the AppropriationsCommittee, as authorized by the House in a committee expense resolution. The FY2004appropriation is $107.2 million.  The second subheading contains funds for the personnel and non-personnel expenses of the Committee on Appropriations.
