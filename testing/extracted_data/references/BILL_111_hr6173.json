FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Regenerative medicine has the potential to treat many \n        chronic diseases and promote economic growth in the United \n        States.\n            (2) Regenerative medicine has the potential to provide \n        cures, treatments and diagnostics for a range of diseases and \n        disabilities including diabetes, spinal cord injury, heart \n        disease, stroke, and various forms of cancer.\n            (3) The Department of Defense has stated that regenerative \n        medicine has the potential to treat many battlefield injuries \n        such as burns, that it has the potential to heal wounds without \n        scarring, and that it has the potential to be used for \n        craniofacial reconstruction, limb reconstruction, regeneration, \n        and transplantation.\n            (4) The Department of Health and Human Services and the \n        Multi-Agency Tissue Engineering Science Interagency Working \n        Group have endorsed a national initiative to support research \n        and product development in regenerative medicine.\n            (5) The Department of Health and Human Services has said \n        the potential benefits of regenerative medicine in improved \n        health care and economic savings are enormous. States that have \n        invested in regenerative medicine have experienced economic \n        growth and see future growth potential, including an increase \n        in biotech employment, payroll increases, and proportional \n        impacts on tax receipts.\n\nSEC. 3.
