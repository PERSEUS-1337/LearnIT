FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) poaching of African elephants has increased \n        dramatically since 2006, and has reached levels that threaten \n        the continued existence of many elephant populations;\n            (2) poaching of African elephants is being driven by \n        increased demand for ivory in Asia, which has caused ivory \n        prices to rise exponentially in recent years;\n            (3) high ivory prices have drawn organized criminal \n        elements into the illegal ivory trade, and it is widely \n        recognized that transnational crime rings involved in \n        trafficking in drugs, guns, and humans are also responsible for \n        trafficking in large quantities of poached ivory from Africa to \n        Asia;\n            (4) there is significant evidence that terrorist and \n        insurgent groups in Africa, including groups with ties to al-\n        Qaeda, are financing their operations through the sale of \n        illegal ivory;\n            (5) the elephant poaching crisis has become so severe, and \n        the tactics of poachers so sophisticated, that traditional \n        approaches to conservation law enforcement intended to protect \n        elephants in their habitat in Africa are failing;\n            (6) a number of countries that serve as major source, \n        transit, or destination points for illegal ivory have proven \n        unable or unwilling to stop the product from coming across \n        their borders; and\n            (7) strategies to reduce demand for ivory through education \n        and other nonbinding means are necessary, but not sufficient, \n        to conserve African elephant populations.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide a means by \nwhich the United States can affect demand for and illegal trafficking \nof African elephant ivory in other countries by requiring those \ncountries to enter into consultations with the United States to end the \nillegal ivory trade, as a condition of continued access to United \nStates markets for other natural resource products.\n\nSEC. 3. ILLEGAL IVORY TRADE DEFINED.\n\n    Section 2305 of the African Elephant Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. \n4244) is amended by redesignating paragraphs (5) through (13) as \nparagraphs (6) through (14), respectively, and by inserting after \nparagraph (4) the following:\n            ``(5) Illegal ivory trade.--The term `illegal ivory trade' \n        means any sale, purchase, barter, transit, or exchange of raw \n        ivory or worked ivory that was taken in violation of the laws \n        of an ivory producing country or of international wildlife \n        trade agreements, including CITES.''.\n\nSEC. 4. AMENDMENT TO FINDINGS IN AFRICAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION ACT.\n\n    Section 2003 of the African Elephant Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. \n4202) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(10) Poaching and trafficking of wildlife has become a \n        global crisis, funding organized criminal syndicates and \n        terrorist organizations and harming elephant populations and \n        local communities. African elephant ivory is at the center of \n        this crisis, and immediate action is necessary to eliminate the \n        demand for ivory and the profit incentive for poachers and \n        traffickers.''.\n\nSEC. 5. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Section 2004 of the African Elephant Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. \n4203) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``and'' after the semicolon at the end of \n        paragraph (1);\n            (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (2) and \n        by inserting ``; and''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(3) to prevent additional African elephant ivory from \n        entering global commerce, and to reduce demand for ivory that \n        is driving elephant poaching by limiting natural resources-\n        related trade with countries whose nationals are engaged in \n        illegal ivory trade.''.\n\nSEC. 6. CERTIFICATION UNDER FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT OF 1967.\n\n    Section 2202 of the African Elephant Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. \n4222) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(g) Certification.--Identification of a country by the CITES \nStanding Committee as a country of primary concern because it is a \nsignificant source or transit or destination point for illegal ivory \ntrade is deemed to be a certification with respect to the country for \nthe purposes of section 8(a) of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 \n(22 U.S.C. 1978(a)).''.\n\nSEC. 7. CONSULTATION AND SANCTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Part II of the African Elephant Conservation Act \n(16 U.S.C. 4221 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 2206. CONSULTATION AND SANCTION.\n\n    ``(a) Consultation.--Not later than 30 days after a certification \nwith respect to the country under section 2202(g), the President shall \nseek to enter into consultations with the government of the country for \nthe purpose of obtaining an agreement that will immediately terminate \nall illegal ivory trade into, out of, or within that country.\n    ``(b) Prohibition on Trade in Related Natural Resources.--\n            ``(1) In general.--If consultations with a government under \n        subsection (a) are not satisfactorily concluded within 90 days \n        or if a government refuses to enter into consultations, the \n        President shall direct the Secretary to prohibit the \n        importation into the United States of products of wildlife, \n        fish, and plants from that country until the earlier of--\n                    ``(A) the date an agreement with the country under \n                subsection (a) is finalized; or\n                    ``(B) the date the CITES Standing Committee finds \n                that the country is no longer a significant source or \n                transit or destination point for illegal ivory trade.\n            ``(2) Public notice.--The Secretary shall publish public \n        notice of any prohibition under this subsection not later than \n        30 days before the effective date of the prohibition.\n    ``(c) Determination of Effectiveness of Sanctions.--Not later than \n180 days after the effective date of a prohibition under subsection \n(b), the Secretary shall determine and report to Congress whether--\n            ``(1) the prohibition is sufficient to cause the country to \n        terminate illegal ivory trade into, out of, or within that \n        country; and\n            ``(2) that country has retaliated against the United States \n        as a result of that prohibition.''.\n    (b) Countries Identified Before Enactment.--In the case of a \ncountry that before the date of the enactment of this Act was \nidentified by the CITES Standing Committee as a country of primary \nconcern because it is a significant source or transit or destination \npoint for illegal ivory trade and that the CITES Standing Committee \ncontinues to identify as such on the date of the enactment of this Act, \nthe President shall seek to enter into consultations under the \namendment made by subsection (a) by not later than 30 days after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act."
