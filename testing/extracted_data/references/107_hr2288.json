    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Asthma Awareness, Education and \nTreatment Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Asthma is a chronic lung condition that affects an \n        estimated 14,600,000 Americans, including 4,800,000 children.\n            (2) An estimated 40,000,000 to 50,000,000 Americans suffer \n        from allergies, including allergic asthma.\n            (3) Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease \n        of children, accounting for 25 percent of school absenteeism, \n        and is the third leading cause of preventable hospitalizations.\n            (4) During the period 1980 through 1994 the prevalence of \n        pediatric asthma increased by 72 percent, and the percentage of \n        preschool children with asthma increased by 160 percent.\n            (5) The prevalence of asthma is greater in women than in \n        men (5.6 percent of women as compared to 5.1 percent of men).\n            (6) Asthma has a disparate impact on low income families, \n        i.e, a family of four with an income of less than $17,650. In \n        households with an annual income of less than $10,000, 79.2 of \n        1,000 individuals who are under the age of 45 have asthma, \n        while in families with an annual income of between $20,000 and \n        $35,000, 53.6 of 1,000 individuals under the age of 45 have \n        asthma.\n            (7) In 1997, more than 5,000 Americans died from asthma \n        attacks. During the period 1993 through 1995, the average \n        number of deaths from asthma for African Americans was 38.5 \n        deaths per million individuals, while the average for \n        Caucasians was 15.1 deaths per million.\n            (8) Asthma is estimated to cost the United States over \n        $12,000,000,000 annually and the rise in the prevalence of \n        asthma will lead to higher costs in the future.\n            (9) African Americans are five times more likely than other \n        segments of the population to seek care for asthma at an \n        emergency room.\n            (10) The asthma death rate is four times higher among \n        African American children and two times higher among all \n        African Americans.\n            (11) Exercise improves the physical and psychological well-\n        being of children. Children with asthma require treatment \n        programs that are tailored to their unique needs because in \n        some instances, exercise can trigger negative response among \n        asthmatics.\n\nSEC. 3.
