FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) almost 20 percent of American children between the ages \n        of 2 and 19 are overweight or suffer from obesity;\n            (2) 8 of the 9 most expensive illnesses in the United \n        States are more common among overweight and obese individuals;\n            (3) according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, the increase in the number of overweight and obese \n        Americans between 1987 and 2001 resulted in a 27 percent \n        increase in per capita health care costs;\n            (4) the World Health Organization determined that in the \n        United States a $1 investment in physical activity alone (in \n        time and equipment) would reduce medical expenses by $3.20;\n            (5) research indicates that 2 in 5 Americans would become \n        more physically active if offered a financial incentive;\n            (6) the United States ranks last in the world in reducing \n        the number of preventable deaths resulting from obesity-related \n        chronic illnesses; and\n            (7) engaging in physical activities at young ages when \n        children are learning lifelong behaviors can have a significant \n        impact on their long-term health.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote health and \nprevent disease, particularly diseases related to being overweight and \nobese, by--\n            (1) encouraging healthier lifestyles;\n            (2) providing financial incentives to ease the financial \n        burden of engaging in healthy behavior; and\n            (3) increasing the ability of individuals and families to \n        participate in physical fitness activities.\n\nSEC. 3.
