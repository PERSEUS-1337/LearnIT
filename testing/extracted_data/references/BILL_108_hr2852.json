FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health \n        and conducted in full compliance with applicable Food and Drug \n        Administration regulations has demonstrated the feasibility of \n        using cord blood for clinical applications. Stem cells, \n        obtained from the blood contained in the delivered placenta and \n        umbilical cord and donated by the mother, can be used for bone \n        marrow reconstitution by transplantation to recipients with \n        certain malignancies (such as leukemia and lymphoma), genetic \n        disorders (such as sickle cell anemia), and acquired diseases.\n            (2) The placenta, umbilical cord, and the neonatal blood \n        they contain are normally discarded after childbirth. This \n        residual neonatal blood, termed cord blood, is a source of stem \n        cells that can be collected as donor tissue without risk to the \n        donor and can be preserved through freezing for many years and \n        be made immediately available for transplantation in routine or \n        emergency clinical situations. It can also be used for \n        scientific research involving its stem cells.\n            (3) Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants relative \n        to bone marrow transplants include the reduction of risks to \n        the donor, availability of donor cell units in days rather than \n        months, and lower risk of transplant complications, including \n        graft versus host disease and latent virus infections (such as \n        Epstein-Barr virus or Cytomegalovirus).\n            (4) In conventional bone marrow transplantation, matched \n        siblings are the preferred donors, but only 30 percent of \n        patients have a matched sibling. When no sibling match is \n        found, a search is initiated for an unrelated donor.\n            (5) Finding a fully matched unrelated donor optimizes the \n        chances of successful bone marrow transplantation. In \n        conventional bone marrow transplantation, patients of ethnic \n        minorities generally have difficulty finding fully matched \n        donors, leaving partially matched transplants as their only \n        transplant option. Partially matched bone marrow \n        transplantation leads to a disproportionately high rate of \n        complications, including graft versus host disease and \n        mortality.\n            (6) Cord blood stem cell banks would provide increased \n        genetic diversity in the supply of donors and increase the \n        opportunity to identify fully matched and partially matched \n        transplant units for qualified candidates. Cord blood stem cell \n        transplants using partially matched units reduce the risk of \n        graft versus host disease with its attending morbidity and \n        mortality as compared to conventional bone marrow \n        transplantation.\n            (7) Identifying and delivering an unrelated bone marrow \n        donor from among the several millions in the National registry \n        typically requires many months, sometimes more than 1 year. An \n        inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, that takes \n        into account the ethnic diversity of the country, would help \n        provide appropriate matches for at least 90 percent of those \n        seeking matched cord blood stem cell transplants, within days \n        of a formal request.\n            (8) Matched donors are more likely within the same ethnic \n        group as the patient's. Some genetic conditions are also more \n        prevalent in members of particular ethnic groups, such as \n        Sickle Cell Anemia, a disease that occurs in one out of 500 \n        African- American newborns. From early infancy, patients with \n        Sickle Cell Anemia have a high risk of severe or fatal \n        bacterial blood infections. Many patients develop painful \n        crises beginning in infancy and occurring up to 20 times per \n        year. Children with recurrent crises, chest syndrome or \n        strokes, are at great risk of dying before the age of 20 years. \n        The median life-span of a patient with Sickle Cell Disease is \n        42 years, but patients with severe disease in childhood rarely \n        live beyond 20 years. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has \n        cured patients with Sickle Cell Anemia: 80 percent of children \n        transplanted with related cord blood to correct Sickle Cell \n        Anemia or thalassemia were cured in a recently published study. \n        The earlier in the course of severe disease, the transplant is \n        performed, the better the outcomes. Unrelated cord blood \n        transplants are especially beneficial for African American and \n        other ethnic minority patients because cord blood does not have \n        to match as closely as bone marrow. For this reason, an African \n        American patient is much more likely to find a suitable \n        unrelated cord blood donor as compared to a matched bone marrow \n        donor. With an ethnically balanced national cord blood bank of \n        at least 150,000 units, some 90 percent of African American \n        patients who suffer from Sickle Cell Anemia or other conditions \n        requiring bone marrow replacement would be able to find \n        appropriately matched cord blood stem cells for successful \n        treatment.\n            (9) Since its inception in 1987, the National Marrow Donor \n        Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants. Cord \n        blood transplantation complements conventional bone marrow \n        transplantation by providing appropriately matched units to \n        patients, especially those of non-caucasoid ethnicity, who have \n        a much lower probability of finding an adequate match through \n        the National Marrow Donor Program. Cord blood is one of the \n        sources of stem cells used in transplantation, however, its \n        collection, preparation, storage and dissemination require \n        specific systems and expertise.\n            (10) Radiation exposure, from accidents or hostile actions \n        could cause bone marrow failure in a portion of those exposed, \n        requiring treatment including bone marrow reconstitution. In \n        these cases the rapid availability of cryopreserved cord blood \n        stem cell units may be important. Years later, those exposed \n        would incur an increased risk of leukemia orlymphoma, which \n        might also require stem cell transplantation.\n            (11) Recent scientific developments suggest that further \n        research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater \n        understanding of certain chronic diseases. This research might \n        improve therapies for, and possibly cure, debilitating diseases \n        such as Parkinson's disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, heart \n        disease, and certain types of cancer. These diseases cause a \n        disproportionately large share of chronic disabilities and \n        account for a large portion of health care expenditures in the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
