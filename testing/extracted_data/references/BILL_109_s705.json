FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The senior population (persons 65 or older) in this \n        country is rapidly growing, and is expected to increase from \n        34,700,000 in 2000 to nearly 40,000,000 by 2010, and then will \n        dramatically increase to over 50,000,000 by 2020.\n            (2) By 2020, the population of ``older'' seniors, those \n        over age 85, is expected to double to 7,000,000, and then \n        double again to 14,000,000 by 2040.\n            (3) As the senior population increases, so does the need \n        for additional safe, decent, affordable, and suitable housing \n        that meets their unique needs.\n            (4) Due to the health care, transportation, and service \n        needs of seniors, issues of providing suitable and affordable \n        housing opportunities differ significantly from the housing \n        needs of other families.\n            (5) Seniors need access to a wide array of housing options, \n        such as affordable assisted living, in-home care, supportive or \n        service-enriched housing, and retrofitted homes and apartments \n        to allow seniors to age in place and to avoid premature \n        placement in institutional settings.\n            (6) While there are many programs in place to assist \n        seniors in finding and affording suitable housing and accessing \n        needed services, these programs are fragmented and spread \n        across many agencies, making it difficult for seniors to access \n        assistance or to receive comprehensive information.\n            (7) Better coordination among Federal agencies is needed, \n        as is better coordination at State and local levels, to ensure \n        that seniors can access government activities, programs, \n        services, and benefits in an effective and efficient manner.\n            (8) Up to date, accurate, and accessible statistics on key \n        characteristics of seniors, including conditions, behaviors, \n        and needs, are required to accurately identify the housing and \n        service needs of seniors.\n\nSEC. 3.
