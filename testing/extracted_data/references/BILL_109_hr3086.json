FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular \n        diseases remain the leading cause of death among females in the \n        United States, killing almost 500,000 women each year.\n            (2) About 1 in 4 females have some form of cardiovascular \n        disease, killing more than the next 6 causes of death combined.\n            (3) In women, cardiovascular disease is frequently \n        undetected and untreated until the disease has become severe, \n        causing 42 percent of women who have heart attacks to die \n        within 1 year.\n            (4) Obesity increases women's risk for some of the leading \n        causes of death: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain \n        cancers.\n            (5) Better nutrition and lifestyle changes can effectively \n        prevent and treat obesity.\n            (6) Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for an \n        estimated 44 million Americans.\n            (7) Women over age 50 accounted for over 75 percent of the \n        total cases of osteoporosis of the hip in 2002.\n            (8) One out of every 2 women over the age of 50 will have \n        an osteoporosis-related fracture in her lifetime.\n            (9) The rate of hip fractures is two to three times higher \n        in women than men.\n            (10) The direct expenditures for osteoporotic fractures \n        alone range from 12-18 billion dollars each year.\n            (11) Physical activity, calcium, and vitamin D are major \n        contributors to bone health for individuals of all ages.\n            (12) Muscular strength and balance may be very significant \n        in future risk reduction for osteoporosis.\n            (13) 18.2 million Americans have diabetes, and over 200,000 \n        people die each year from related complications. Among adults \n        in the United States, diabetes increased 61 percent from 1990 \n        to 2001. Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in \n        America.\n            (14) Approximately 8.7 percent of all women over the age of \n        20 in the United States have diabetes, but about one-third of \n        them are unaware of it.\n            (15) The risk for cardiovascular disease, the most common \n        complication attributable to diabetes, is more serious among \n        women than men. Deaths from heart disease in women with \n        diabetes have increased 23 percent over the past 30 years.\n            (16) The direct and indirect costs of diabetes are over \n        $132 billion a year.\n            (17) Better nutrition, physical activity, control of blood \n        glucose levels, and access to services can delay the \n        progression of diabetes. In fact, recent findings show that \n        modest, consistent physical activity and a healthy diet can cut \n        a person's risk for developing type-2 diabetes by nearly 60 \n        percent.\n            (18) The direct and indirect costs of diabetes are over \n        $130 billion a year.\n            (19) The WISEWOMAN program has--\n                    (A) provided one-stop shopping for preventive \n                health services such as cholesterol and blood pressure \n                screening for more than 12,000 women and identified \n                risk factors for heart disease such as obesity, high \n                cholesterol, high blood pressure, sedentary behavior, \n                and poor diet; and\n                    (B) identified more than 2,700 cases of previously \n                undiagnosed hypertension, 3,000 cases of undiagnosed \n                high cholesterol, and 400 cases of undiagnosed diabetes \n                in women who would have been unaware of their risk \n                factors if not for WISEWOMAN.\n            (20) Research has demonstrated that--\n                    (A) the uninsured often have significantly poorer \n                health than the insured; and\n                    (B) being uninsured is an obstacle to receiving \n                preventive health care services.\n\nSEC. 3. SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS FOR ADDITIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES \n              FOR WOMEN.\n\n    Section 1509 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300n-4a) \nis amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 1509.
