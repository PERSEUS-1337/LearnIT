FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that it is essential to develop, \ndemonstrate, and disseminate innovative technologies to prevent and \ncontrol shoreline erosion because of--\n            (1) the importance and increasing interest in the coastal \n        and estuarine zone of the United States;\n            (2) the deterioration of the shoreline within the zone \n        resulting from erosion;\n            (3) the harm to water quality and marine life from \n        shoreline erosion;\n            (4) the loss of recreational potential resulting from \n        shoreline erosion;\n            (5) the financial loss to private and public landowners \n        resulting from shoreline erosion;\n            (6) the inability of private and public landowners to \n        obtain satisfactory financial and technical assistance to \n        combat shoreline erosion; and\n            (7) the loss of structures or landmarks of historic \n        significance.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to establish a \nprogram to develop, demonstrate, and disseminate information about \ninnovative technologies to combat shoreline erosion.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL SHORELINE EROSION CONTROL DEVELOPMENT AND \n              DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n    The Act of August 13, 1946 (60 Stat. 1056, chapter 960; 33 U.S.C. \n426e et seq.), is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 5.
