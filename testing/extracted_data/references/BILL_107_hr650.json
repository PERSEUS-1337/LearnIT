FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Over the next 10 years, a large percentage of teachers \n        will retire, leaving American classrooms, particularly urban \n        and rural classrooms, facing a serious teacher shortage.\n            (2) The Nation will need 2,000,000 new teachers over the \n        next 10 years. Unfortunately, in the past this need has been \n        met by admitting some unqualified teachers to the classroom.\n            (3) There is also a chronic shortage of fully certified \n        special education teachers, averaging about 27,000 per year. \n        While the demand is ever present, institutes of higher \n        education are graduating fewer teachers qualified in special \n        education.\n            (4) Moreover, the burdensome paperwork and legal \n        requirements are factors which lead special education teachers \n        to leave the profession. More special education teachers move \n        into the general education realm than vice versa.\n            (5) High quality teachers are the first vital step in \n        ensuring students receive a high quality education.\n            (6) Potentially valuable teacher candidates are often lured \n        into different careers by higher compensation.\n            (7) High-quality prospective teachers need to be identified \n        and recruited by presenting to them a career that is respected \n        by their peers, is financially and intellectually rewarding, \n        and contains sufficient opportunities for advancement.\n            (8) Teacher loan forgiveness gives high-poverty schools an \n        effective incentive for recruiting and retaining much-needed \n        high quality teachers.\n            (9) Loan forgiveness for high-need teachers, including \n        special education teachers, can be a critical link in \n        increasing the supply of these essential educators.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage individuals \nto enter and continue in the teaching profession in order to ensure \nthat high quality teachers are recruited and retained in areas where \nthey are most needed so students attending school in such areas receive \na quality education.\n\nSEC. 3.
