FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Agencies of the Government of the United States have \n        information on human rights violations in Guatemala and \n        Honduras.\n            (2) Members of both Houses of Congress have repeatedly \n        asked the Administration for information on Guatemalan and \n        Honduran human rights cases.\n            (3) The Guatemalan peace accords, which the Government of \n        the United States firmly supports, has as an important and \n        vital component the establishment of the Commission for the \n        Historical Clarification of Human Rights Violations and Acts of \n        Violence which have Caused Suffering to the Guatemalan People \n        (referred to in this Act as the ``Clarification Commission''). \n        The Clarification Commission will investigate cases of human \n        rights violations and abuses by both parties to the civil \n        conflict in Guatemala and will need all available information \n        to fulfill its mandate.\n            (4) The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human \n        Rights in the Republic of Honduras has been requesting United \n        States Government documentation on human rights violations in \n        Honduras since November 15, 1993. The Commissioner's request \n        has been partly fulfilled, but is still pending. The request \n        has been supported by national and international human rights \n        nongovernmental organizations as well as members of both Houses \n        of Congress.\n            (5) Victims and survivors of human rights violations, \n        including United States citizens and their relatives, have also \n        been requesting the information referred to in paragraphs (3) \n        and (4). Survivors and the relatives of victims have a right to \n        know what happened. The requests have been supported by \n        national and international human rights nongovernmental \n        organizations as well as members of both Houses of Congress.\n            (6) The United States should make the information it has on \n        human rights abuses available to the public as part of the \n        United States commitment to democracy in Central America.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Human rights record.--The term ``human rights record'' \n        means a record in the possession, custody, or control of the \n        United States Government containing information about gross \n        human rights violations committed after 1944.\n            (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency of the \n        United States Government charged with the conduct of foreign \n        policy or foreign intelligence, including the Department of \n        State, the Agency for International Development, the Department \n        of Defense (and all of its components), the Central \n        Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the \n        Department of Justice (and all of its components), the National \n        Security Council, and the Executive Office of the President.\n\nSEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS \n              RECORDS REGARDING GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nprovision of this Act shall govern the declassification and public \ndisclosure of human rights records by agencies.\n    (b) Identification of Records.--Not later than 120 days after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, each agency shall identify, review, and \norganize all human rights records regarding activities occurring in \nGuatemala and Honduras after 1944 for the purpose of declassifying and \ndisclosing the records to the public. Except as provided in section 5, \nall records described in the preceding sentence shall be made available \nto the public not later than 30 days after a review under this section \nis completed.\n    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 150 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the President shall report to Congress regarding \neach agency's compliance with the provisions of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--An agency may postpone public disclosure of a \nhuman rights record or particular information in a human rights record \nonly if the agency determines that there is clear and convincing \nevidence that--\n            (1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence \n        operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United \n        States raised by public disclosure of the human rights record \n        is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and \n        such public disclosure would reveal--\n                    (A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently \n                requires protection;\n                    (B) an intelligence source or method--\n                            (i) which is being utilized, or reasonably \n                        expected to be utilized, by the United States \n                        Government;\n                            (ii) which has not been officially \n                        disclosed; and\n                            (iii) the disclosure of which would \n                        interfere with the conduct of intelligence \n                        activities; or\n                    (C) any other matter currently relating to the \n                military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct \n                of foreign relations of the United States, the \n                disclosure of which would demonstrably impair the \n                national security of the United States;\n            (2) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \n        reveal the name or identity of a living individual who provided \n        confidential information to the United States and would pose a \n        substantial risk of harm to that individual;\n            (3) the public disclosure of the human rights record could \n        reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of \n        personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so \n        substantial that it outweighs the public interest; or\n            (4) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \n        compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality \n        currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a \n        cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public \n        disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public \n        interest.\n    (b) Special Treatment of Certain Information.--It shall not be \ngrounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights record that an \nindividual named in the human rights record was an intelligence asset \nof the United States Government, although the existence of such \nrelationship may be withheld if the criteria set forth in subsection \n(a) are met. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term an \n``intelligence asset'' means a covert agent as defined in section \n606(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 426(4)).\n\nSEC. 6. REQUEST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS FROM OFFICIAL ENTITIES IN \n              OTHER LATIN AMERICAN CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES.\n\n    In the event that an agency of the United States receives a request \nfor human rights records from an entity created by the United Nations \nor the Organization of American States similar to the Guatemalan \nClarification Commission, or from the principal justice or human rights \nofficial of a Latin American or Caribbean country who is investigating \na pattern of gross human rights violations, the agency shall conduct a \nreview of records as described in section 4 and shall declassify and \npublicly disclose such records in accordance with the standards and \nprocedures set forth in this Act.\n\nSEC. 7.
