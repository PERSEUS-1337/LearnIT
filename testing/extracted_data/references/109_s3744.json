FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to President George W. Bush, ``America's \n        leadership and national security rest on our commitment to \n        educate and prepare our youth for active engagement in the \n        international community.''.\n            (2) According to former President William J. Clinton, \n        ``Today, the defense of United States interests, the effective \n        management of global issues, and even an understanding of our \n        Nation's diversity require ever-greater contact with, and \n        understanding of, people and cultures beyond our borders.''.\n            (3) Congress created the Commission on the Abraham Lincoln \n        Study Abroad Fellowship Program in section 104(a) of Division H \n        of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (Public Law 108-\n        199). Pursuant to its mandate, the Commission has submitted to \n        Congress and the President a report of its recommendations for \n        greatly expanding the opportunity for students at institutions \n        of higher education in the United States to study abroad, with \n        special emphasis on studying in developing nations and \n        nontraditional study abroad destinations.\n            (4) Studies consistently show that United States students \n        score below their counterparts in other advanced countries on \n        indicators of international knowledge. This lack of global \n        literacy is a national liability in an age of global trade and \n        business, global interdependence, and global terror.\n            (5) By numbers ranging from 77 to more than 90 percent, \n        Americans believe that it is important for their children to \n        learn other languages, study abroad, attend a college where \n        they can interact with international students, learn about \n        other countries and cultures, and generally be prepared for the \n        global age, according to a December 2005 national survey \n        conducted by Lake Research Partners and the Tarrance Group.\n            (6) In today's world, it is more important than ever for \n        the United States to be a responsible, constructive leader that \n        other countries are willing to follow. Such leadership cannot \n        be sustained without an informed citizenry with much more \n        knowledge and awareness of the world than most Americans tend \n        to possess.\n            (7) Study abroad has proven to be a very effective means of \n        imparting international and foreign-language competency to \n        students.\n            (8) In the 2003-2004 academic year, an estimated 16,910,000 \n        students were enrolled in United States postsecondary \n        institutions, yet only 191,321, representing approximately 1 \n        percent of those students, studied abroad for academic credit, \n        according to the National Center for Education Statistics and \n        the Institute of International Education, respectively.\n            (9) Less than 10 percent of the students who graduate from \n        United States institutions of higher education with bachelors \n        degrees have studied abroad.\n            (10) Far more study abroad must take place in the \n        developing countries. Ninety-five percent of the world's \n        population growth is anticipated to occur outside of Europe in \n        the future. Yet in the academic year 2003-2004, 61 percent of \n        United States students studying abroad studied in Europe, and \n        46 percent studied in the 4 countries of the United Kingdom, \n        Italy, Spain, and France, according to the Institute of \n        International Education.\n            (11) Study abroad helps to build mutual understanding among \n        nations and serves to promote national leadership in the United \n        States, international effectiveness, and economic \n        competitiveness by helping to create a globally literate \n        citizenry.\n            (12) The Senate designated 2006 as the Year of Study \n        Abroad, raising awareness of the importance of study abroad.\n            (13) To complement such worthwhile Federal programs as the \n        Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program and the \n        National Security Education Program, a broad-based \n        undergraduate study abroad program is needed that will \n        democratize study abroad and make opportunities of study abroad \n        accessible to all undergraduate students, regardless of their \n        field of study, ethnicity, socio-economic status, or gender.\n            (14) A majority of barriers to study abroad are due to \n        institutional policies at the campus level, according to a \n        report of the Strategic Task Force on Education Abroad issued \n        by NAFSA: Association of International Educators.\n            (15) To make study abroad an integral part of undergraduate \n        students' education, regardless of field of study, ethnicity, \n        socio-economic status, or gender, institutions of higher \n        education should address institutional barriers that stand in \n        the way of study abroad.\n            (16) According to the Institute of International Education, \n        the percentages of African-American, Asian-American, and \n        Hispanic-American students among individuals studying abroad \n        are extremely low and underrepresentative of the numbers of \n        those students in the general student population.\n            (17) The majority of students who study abroad are students \n        in the social sciences, humanities, and foreign languages, \n        while students who major in engineering, mathematics, computer \n        science, or education are underrepresented in study abroad \n        programs. Within the total enrolled United States undergraduate \n        population, approximately 10.7 percent of United States \n        students majoring in business have studied abroad, 8 percent of \n        United States students majoring in engineering have studied \n        abroad, and 5.9 percent of United States students majoring in \n        education have studied abroad.\n            (18) Recognizing that the international scope of scientific \n        research in United States institutions of higher education and \n        government facilities is often conducted by foreign-born \n        scientists, the effectiveness of their work will be greatly \n        enhanced by United States researchers who have similarly spent \n        time studying abroad.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to encourage not less than 1,000,000 undergraduate \n        students in United States institutions of higher education to \n        study abroad for academic credit within 10 years of the date of \n        enactment of this Act; and\n            (2) to establish an Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Program \n        that--\n                    (A) reflects the demographics of the United States \n                undergraduate population, including undergraduate \n                students in technical and scientific fields of study;\n                    (B) ensures an increasing portion of study abroad \n                takes place in nontraditional study abroad \n                destinations, with a substantial portion of such \n                increases taking place in developing countries; and\n                    (C) is accessible by students at diverse types of \n                institutions of higher education, including 2-year \n                institutions, minority-serving institutions, and \n                institutions that serve nontraditional students.\n\nSEC. 3.
