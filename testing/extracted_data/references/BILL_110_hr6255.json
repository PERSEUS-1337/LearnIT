FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Haiti is the world's first black-led republic and the \n        first Caribbean country to achieve independence.\n            (2) Since its independence on January 1, 1804, the \n        Government of Haiti has struggled to meet the promise of \n        freedom and democracy expressed in the Preliminary Declaration \n        of its 1805 Constitution, which reads: ``The Citizens of Haiti \n        are brothers at home; equality in the eyes of the law is \n        incontestably acknowledged, and there cannot exist any titles, \n        advantages, or privileges, other than those necessarily \n        resulting from the consideration and reward to liberty and \n        independence.''.\n            (3) According to the United States Agency for International \n        Development (USAID), following the end of the 29-year Duvalier \n        dictatorship in 1986, the people of Haiti have suffered over a \n        dozen government turnovers, including six military regimes, \n        three appointed transition governments, and four elected \n        presidencies.\n            (4) The government changes, accompanied with ongoing \n        violence, have limited the government's capacity to provide \n        security for its citizens as well as an environment conducive \n        for the development of infrastructure to take root.\n            (5) Since the return of Haiti's democracy, the country has \n        taken steps to achieve a relative measure of stability. \n        However, the recent 40 percent rise in global food prices and \n        subsequent 50 percent rise in the cost of Haiti's staple foods \n        since mid-2007 has threatened Haiti's security and the capacity \n        of Haiti's economy to prosper.\n            (6) According to the Department of State, workforce \n        unemployment and underemployment are rampant. Estimates suggest \n        that two-thirds of the country's 3,600,000 workers are without \n        consistent work. The minimum wage of 70 gourdes per day (U.S. \n        $1.70) undermines Haiti's ability to attract the skilled labor \n        necessary to expand its economy. Reports indicate that Haitians \n        are migrating to neighboring countries, mostly to the Dominican \n        Republic to find work. Moreover, the 500,000 Haitians living in \n        New York City and the 380,000 in Miami represent a loss of \n        skills and expertise that Haiti has been unable to replace.\n            (7) Despite a strong social demand for education among \n        Haitian families, the education sector in Haiti is \n        characterized by a weak state capacity to provide and regulate \n        educational services. According to USAID, Haitian families pay \n        15 percent of their household income for schooling. Yet, there \n        is an adult literacy rate of 52 percent and a primary school \n        enrollment rate of 67 percent. Less than 30 percent of the \n        children who enter primary school will reach the 6th grade.\n            (8) According to the World Bank, approximately 500,000 \n        children aged 6-11 do not attend school of any kind, and only \n        about half of all six year olds enroll in first grade. Eighty \n        percent of all primary level students attend nonpublic schools \n        financed by parents, religious associations, NGO's, and other \n        sources. Haiti continues to face severe obstacles in education \n        due to access, equity, quality, and institutional capacity.\n            (9) According to the Department of State, in terms of \n        health, Haiti has poor sanitation systems, poor nutrition, and \n        inadequate health services. Eighty percent of Haiti's \n        population lives below the poverty line. Less than half of the \n        population has access to clean drinking water and 28 percent \n        have access to adequate sanitation.\n            (10) Only 43 percent of the target population receives the \n        recommended immunizations. Haiti, thus, has a life expectancy \n        at birth of 53 years and a mortality rate of 12.2 deaths per \n        1,000 in population.\n            (11) There are 25 physicians and 11 nurses per 100,000 in \n        population. Only one-fourth of births are attended by a skilled \n        health professional.\n            (12) Haiti has the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS outside of \n        Africa, with a national prevalence rate of 4.5 percent of the \n        population.\n            (13) In terms of the environment, USAID reports that Haiti \n        is ill equipped for the aftermath of tropical storms. The \n        country lacks adequate management plans for natural disasters. \n        Severe deforestation has left it vulnerable to flooding from \n        the most moderate rainfall. Over 90 percent of the country's \n        forests have been cleared for fuel, thus flash floods and \n        mudslides across the country have damaged farmland and \n        contributed to increased poverty.\n\nSEC. 3.
