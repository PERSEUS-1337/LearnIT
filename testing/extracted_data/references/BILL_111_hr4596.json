FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Holocaust, an event in which millions of people \n        endured enormous suffering through torture and other violence, \n        including the murder of 6,000,000 Jews and millions of others, \n        the destruction of families and communities, and the theft of \n        their assets, was one of the most heinous crimes in human \n        history.\n            (2) Before and during World War II, millions of people \n        purchased insurance policies to safeguard family assets, plan \n        for retirement, provide for a dowry, or save for their \n        children's education.\n            (3) When Holocaust survivors or heirs of Holocaust victims \n        presented claims to insurance companies after World War II, \n        many were rejected because they did not have death certificates \n        or physical possession of policy documents that had been \n        confiscated by the Nazis or lost in the devastation of the \n        Holocaust.\n            (4) In many instances, insurance company records and \n        records in government archives are the only proof of the \n        existence of insurance policies belonging to Holocaust victims.\n            (5) Holocaust survivors and heirs have been attempting for \n        decades to persuade insurance companies to settle unpaid \n        insurance claims.\n            (6) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \n        Insurance Claims (in this section referred to as ``ICHEIC'') \n        was established by the National Association of Insurance \n        Commissioners in cooperation with several European insurance \n        companies, European regulators, the Government of Israel, and \n        non-governmental organizations with the promise that it would \n        expeditiously address the issue of unpaid insurance policies \n        issued to Holocaust victims.\n            (7) On July 17, 2000, the United States and Germany signed \n        an executive agreement in support of the German Foundation \n        ``Remembrance, Responsibility, and the Future'', which \n        designated ICHEIC to resolve all Holocaust-era insurance \n        policies issued by German companies and their subsidiaries.\n            (8) On January 17, 2001, the United States and Austria \n        signed an executive agreement, which designated ICHEIC to \n        resolve all Holocaust-era insurance policies issued by Austrian \n        companies and their subsidiaries.\n            (9) The ICHEIC process ended in 2007 and companies holding \n        Holocaust-era insurance policies continue to withhold names of \n        owners and beneficiaries of thousands of insurance policies \n        sold to Jewish customers prior to World War II.\n            (10) Experts estimate that only a small fraction of the \n        policies estimated to have been sold to Jews living in Europe \n        at the beginning of World War II have been paid through ICHEIC.\n            (11) In American Insurance Association, Inc., v. Garamendi, \n        the United States Supreme Court held that under the supremacy \n        clause of the Constitution of the United States, executive \n        agreements and Federal Government policy calling for insurance \n        claims against German and Austrian companies to be handled \n        within ICHEIC preempted State laws authorizing State insurance \n        commissioners to subpoena company records and require \n        publication of the names of Holocaust era policy holders.\n            (12) In the Garamendi case, the Supreme Court stated that \n        Congress, which has the power to regulate international \n        commerce and prescribe Federal court jurisdiction, had not \n        addressed disclosure and restitution of insurance policies of \n        Holocaust victims.\n            (13) Subsequent court decisions have dismissed survivors' \n        suits against an Italian insurance company, even though there \n        is no executive agreement between the United States and Italy.\n            (14) Congress supports the rights of Holocaust survivors \n        and the heirs and beneficiaries of Holocaust victims to obtain \n        information from insurers and to bring legal actions in courts, \n        wherever jurisdiction requirements are met, to recover unpaid \n        funds from entities that participated in the theft of family \n        insurance assets or the affiliates of such entities.\n            (15) Congress intends for this Act to be interpreted to \n        allow for State causes of action and disclosure requirement \n        laws regarding Holocaust-era insurance policies to be valid and \n        not preempted.\n            (16) This Act expresses the intent of Congress to deem \n        valid State laws protecting the rights of Holocaust survivors \n        and the heirs and beneficiaries of Holocaust victims to obtain \n        information from insurers and to bring actions in courts of \n        proper jurisdiction to recover unpaid funds from entities that \n        participated in the theft of family insurance assets or the \n        affiliates of such entities.\n            (17) Insurance payments should be expedited to the victims \n        of the most heinous crime of the 20th century to ensure that \n        justice is served.\n            (18) This Act will enable survivors, heirs, and \n        beneficiaries to obtain compensation commensurate with the real \n        monetary value of their losses.\n            (19) Under the circumstances faced by Holocaust victims and \n        their families, courts should be open to Holocaust victims and \n        their families for a reasonable number of years after the \n        enactment of this Act, without regard to any other statutes of \n        limitation.\n\nSEC. 3.
