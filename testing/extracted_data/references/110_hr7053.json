    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Job Corps Act of \n2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are millions of young people ages 16 through 24 \n        who are neither in school nor in the labor force.\n            (2) According to a report issued by the Community Service \n        Society in June 2008, entitled ``Out of Focus: A Snapshot of \n        Public Funding to Reconnect Youth to Education and \n        Employment'', the young people described in paragraph (1), \n        often referred to as disconnected youth, are largely youth of \n        color from poor communities and at risk of becoming permanently \n        disengaged from the labor market which threatens their ability \n        to break out of the cycle of poverty and contribute to our \n        economy and communities.\n            (3) When our young people lack the skills that local \n        industries need and are unable to support themselves, we all \n        bear the financial costs.\n            (4) In the coming years, the combination of public \n        transportation industry growth and an aging workforce will \n        produce sizeable new openings in the transit sector.\n            (5) There is no pipeline of replacements on the horizon, \n        and the transit industry has been limited in its ability to \n        attract, recruit, and retain employees.\n            (6) For the existing workforce, new technology is rapidly \n        changing the way transit agencies function, affecting every \n        sector of the workforce, including executive directors, mid-\n        level managers, bus operators, and mechanics, yet relatively \n        few programs exist to provide training to workers so that they \n        can perform their jobs adequately, move up the career ladder, \n        and help the Nation's transit agencies operate at maximum \n        efficiency.\n\nSEC. 3. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Workforce Development Program.--Title 49, United States Code, \nis amended--\n            (1) by striking section 5322; and\n            (2) by inserting the following:\n\n``SEC. 5322.
