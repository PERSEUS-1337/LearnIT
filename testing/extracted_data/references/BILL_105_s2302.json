AMERICAN INDIAN TORT LIABILITY INSURANCE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, \n        Inc., 523 U.S. ____ (1998), recognized the increasing \n        interaction between tribal governments, tribal corporations, or \n        individual members of Indian tribes with individuals who are \n        not members of an Indian tribe, on and off Indian reservations \n        (including property held in trust for Indian tribes) in the \n        areas of economic development and commerce;\n            (2) the interaction referred to in paragraph (1) may lead \n        to disputes that could include claims by individuals against \n        tribal governments or tribal organizations as a result of \n        injury in tort;\n            (3) as Justice Kennedy stated in his opinion in Kiowa Tribe \n        of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., the doctrine \n        of tribal immunity asserted by the governing bodies of Indian \n        tribes to shield the Indian tribes from court actions that are \n        necessary to recover for the liability of the governing bodies \n        or tribal organizations of Indian tribes, can ``harm those who \n        are unaware that they are dealing with a tribe, who do not know \n        of tribal immunity, or who have no choice in the matter, as in \n        the case of tort victims''; and\n            (4) in order to provide protection for individuals \n        interacting with tribal governments or organizations--\n                    (A) Indian tribes should maintain tort liability \n                insurance; and\n                    (B) tribal immunity should not be used as a basis \n                for the denial of a claim under that tort liability \n                insurance.\n    (b) Definition.--In this section:\n            (1) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n        meaning given that term in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-\n        Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)).\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior.\n            (3) Tribal immunity.--The term ``tribal immunity'' means \n        the immunity of an Indian tribe from--\n                    (A) jurisdiction of the courts; and\n                    (B) judicial review of an action of that Indian \n                tribe and other remedies.\n            (4) Tribal organization.--The term ``tribal organization'' \n        has the meaning given that term in section 4(l) of the Indian \n        Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n        450b(l)).\n            (5) Tribal priority allocation.--The term ``tribal priority \n        allocation'' means an allocation to a tribal priority account \n        of an Indian tribe by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to allow \n        that Indian tribe to establish program priorities and funding \n        levels.\n    (c) Indian Tribes as Defendants in Tort Disputes.--Section 1362 of \ntitle 28, United States Code, is amended by--\n            (1) inserting ``(a)'' before ``The district courts'';\n            (2) inserting ``(referred to in this section as an `Indian \n        tribe')'' after ``Interior''; and\n            (3) adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Subject to the provisions of chapter 171A, the district \ncourts shall have jurisdiction of civil actions in claims against an \nIndian tribe for money damages, accruing on or after the date of \nenactment of this subsection for injury or loss of property, personal \ninjury, or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of \nan Indian tribe (including a tribal organization) under circumstances \nin which the Indian tribe, if a private individual or corporation would \nbe liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the State where \nthe act or omission occurred.\n    ``(c) Subject to the provisions of chapter 171A, to the extent \nnecessary to enforce this section, the tribal immunity of the Indian \ntribe involved is waived.''.\n    (d) Tort Liability Insurance.--\n            (1) In general.--\n                    (A) Insurance.--Except as provided in paragraph \n                (2), not later than 180 days after the enactment of \n                this Act, the Secretary shall obtain or provide tort \n                liability insurance or equivalent coverage, on the most \n                cost-effective basis, for each Indian tribe that \n                receives a tribal priority allocation.\n                    (B) Coverage.--The insurance obtained under \n                subparagraph (A) for an Indian tribe shall cover the \n                governing body of the Indian tribe, each tribal \n                organization, of that Indian tribe and each contractor \n                or employer of that Indian tribe, within the scope of \n                that contractor or employer. The coverage shall become \n                effective on the date on which that coverage is \n                obtained.\n            (2) Exception.--If the Secretary determines that an Indian \n        tribe described in paragraph (1) has obtained liability \n        insurance in an amount and of the type that the Secretary \n        determines to be appropriate (including meeting the requirement \n        of paragraph (4)) by the date specified in paragraph (1), the \n        Secretary shall not be required to provide additional coverage \n        for that Indian tribe.\n            (3) Tribal immunity may not be asserted to deny claims.--\n        Under the liability insurance obtained under paragraph (1) or \n        that the Secretary determines to be appropriate under paragraph \n        (2), tribal immunity may not be asserted by the insurer as a \n        reason for denying a claim for damages resulting from the tort \n        liability of an Indian tribe.\n            (4) Amount of coverage.--In carrying out this subsection, \n        the Secretary shall ensure that each Indian tribe obtains, or \n        is provided, in accordance with this subsection, a sufficient \n        amount of insurance coverage to cover tort liability of the \n        Indian tribe, under chapter 171A of title 28, United States \n        Code.\n    (e) Funding of Tort Liability Insurance.--\n            (1) Initial payment of insurance premiums.--For the initial \n        payment of insurance premiums for insurance obtained or \n        provided by the Secretary under subsection (d), the Secretary \n        shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure the \n        payment of premiums by the Indian tribe, including adjusting \n        the amount of the tribal priority allocation made to the Indian \n        tribe to cover the cost of the initial payments.\n            (2) Subsequent payments.--\n                    (A) In general.--After an initial payment under \n                paragraph (1), and before the Secretary makes a tribal \n                priority allocation for an Indian tribe, the Secretary \n                shall verify that the Indian tribe--\n                            (i) has insurance coverage that meets the \n                        requirements of subsection (d); and\n                            (ii) has made such payments for premiums of \n                        that insurance as are necessary to provide \n                        insurance coverage for the fiscal year for \n                        which the tribal priority allocation is to be \n                        made.\n                    (B) Payment required as a condition to receiving \n                tribal priority allocation.--Notwithstanding any other \n                provision of law, if the Secretary determines under \n                subparagraph (A) that an Indian tribe has not made the \n                payments described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the \n                Secretary shall withhold the tribal priority allocation \n                of that Indian tribe until such time as those payments \n                are made.\n    (f) Jurisdiction of District Courts.--Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, the district courts shall have jurisdiction over any \naction concerning the tort liability of an Indian tribe that is covered \nunder insurance that meets the requirements of subsection (d), and a \ncase to recover damages through an insurer that provides coverage under \nsubsection (d) may be brought without regard to whether remedies under \notherwise applicable tribal law have been exhausted.\n    (g) Regulations.--To carry out this section, as soon as practicable \nafter the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall issue \nregulations that--\n            (1) provide for the amount of insurance coverage or \n        equivalent coverage needed to protect an Indian tribe for the \n        liabilities that may be subject to a claim under chapter 171A \n        if title 28, United States Code;\n            (2) establish a schedule of premiums to be assessed against \n        an Indian tribe that is provided liability insurance under \n        subsection (d); and\n            (3) establish a means to verify the amount, maintenance, \n        and funding of insurance of Indian tribes that obtain and \n        maintain insurance under subsection (d)(3).\n    (h) Indian Tort Claims Procedure.--\n            (1) In general.--Part 6 of title 28, United States Code, is \n        amended by inserting after chapter 171 the following:\n\n              ``CHAPTER 171A--INDIAN TORT CLAIMS PROCEDURE\n\n``Sec.\n``2691.
