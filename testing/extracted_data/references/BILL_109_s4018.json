FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Supreme Court declared in Reynolds v. Sims that \n        ``[i]t has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified voters \n        have a constitutionally protected right to vote . . . and to \n        have their votes counted.''.\n            (2) In the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, voting \n        technology failures and procedural irregularities deprived some \n        Americans of their fundamental right to vote.\n            (3) In 2000, faulty punch card ballots and other equipment \n        failures prevented accurate vote counts nationwide. A report by \n        the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project estimates that \n        approximately 1,500,000 votes for president were intended to be \n        cast but not counted in the 2000 election because of equipment \n        failures.\n            (4) In 2004, software errors, malfunctioning electronic \n        voting systems, and long lines at the polls prevented accurate \n        vote counts and prevented some people from voting. For \n        instance, voters at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio waited in \n        line for up to 12 hours because there were only 2 machines \n        available for 1,300 voters.\n            (5) Under the Oregon Vote by Mail system, election \n        officials mail ballots to all registered voters at least 2 \n        weeks before election day. Voters mark their ballots, seal the \n        ballots in both unmarked secrecy envelopes and signed return \n        envelopes, and return the ballots by mail or to secure drop \n        boxes. Once a ballot is received, election officials scan the \n        bar code on the ballot envelope, which brings up the voter's \n        signature on a computer screen. The election official compares \n        the signature on the screen and the signature on the ballot \n        envelope. Only if the signature on the ballot envelope is \n        determined to be authentic is the ballot forwarded on to be \n        counted.\n            (6) Oregon's Vote by Mail system has resulted in an \n        extremely low rate of voter fraud because the system includes \n        numerous security measures such as the signature authentication \n        system. Potential misconduct is also deterred by the power of \n        the State to punish those who engage in voter fraud with up to \n        five years in prison, $100,000 in fines, and the loss of their \n        vote.\n            (7) Vote by Mail is one factor making voter turnout in \n        Oregon consistently higher than the average national voter \n        turnout. For example, Oregon experienced a record voting-age-\n        eligible population turnout of 70.6 percent in the 2004 \n        presidential election, compared to 58.4 percent nationally. \n        Oregon's turnout of registered voters for that election was \n        86.48 percent.\n            (8) Women, younger voters, and homemakers also report that \n        they vote more often using Vote by Mail.\n            (9) Vote by Mail reduces election costs by eliminating the \n        need to transport equipment to polling stations and to hire and \n        train poll workers. Oregon has reduced its election-related \n        costs by 30 percent since implementing Vote by Mail.\n            (10) Vote by Mail allows voters to educate themselves \n        because they receive ballots well before election day, which \n        provides them with ample time to research issues, study \n        ballots, and deliberate in a way that is not possible at a \n        polling place.\n            (11) Vote by Mail is accurate--at least 2 studies comparing \n        voting technologies show that absentee voting methods, \n        including Vote by Mail systems, result in a more accurate vote \n        count.\n            (12) Vote by Mail results in more up-to-date voter rolls, \n        since election officials use forwarding information from the \n        post office to update voter registration.\n            (13) Vote by Mail allows voters to visually verify that \n        their votes were cast correctly and produces a paper trail for \n        recounts.\n            (14) In a survey taken 5 years after Oregon implemented the \n        Vote by Mail system, more than 8 in 10 Oregon voters said they \n        preferred voting by mail to traditional voting.\n\nSEC. 3.
