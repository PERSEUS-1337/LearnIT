    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Jobs Credit Act of \n2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In many parts of the United States, smaller cities and \n        rural areas are experiencing population loss and low-job growth \n        that hurts the surrounding communities.\n            (2) In areas hurt by low-job growth, people are forced to \n        leave the communities they have lived in their whole life to \n        secure a job.\n            (3) A small business tax credit to promote jobs in areas \n        suffering from low-job growth and population loss would spur \n        the economy and allow businesses to take advantage of an often \n        underutilized well-educated workforce.\n\nSEC. 3.
