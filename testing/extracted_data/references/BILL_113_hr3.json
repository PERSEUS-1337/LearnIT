FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) To maintain our Nation's competitive edge and ensure an \n        economy built to last, the United States must have fast, \n        reliable, resilient, and environmentally sound means of moving \n        energy. In a global economy, we will compete for the world's \n        investments based in significant part on the quality of our \n        infrastructure. Investing in the Nation's infrastructure \n        provides immediate and long-term economic benefits for local \n        communities and the Nation as a whole.\n            (2) The delivery of oil from Canada, a close ally not only \n        in proximity but in shared values and ideals, to domestic \n        markets is in the national interest because of the need to \n        lessen dependence upon insecure foreign sources.\n            (3) The Keystone XL pipeline would provide both short-term \n        and long-term employment opportunities and related labor income \n        benefits, such as government revenues associated with taxes.\n            (4) The State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and \n        approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, concluding \n        that the concerns of Nebraskans have had a major influence on \n        the pipeline reroute and that the reroute will have minimal \n        environmental impacts.\n            (5) The Department of State and other Federal agencies have \n        over a long period of time conducted extensive studies and \n        analysis of the technical aspects and of the environmental, \n        social, and economic impacts of the proposed Keystone XL \n        pipeline, and--\n                    (A) the Department of State assessments found that \n                the Keystone XL pipeline ``is not likely to impact the \n                amount of crude oil produced from the oil sands'' and \n                that ``approval or denial of the proposed project is \n                unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of \n                development in the oil sands'';\n                    (B) the Department of State found that incremental \n                life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the \n                Keystone XL project are estimated in the range of 0.07 \n                to 0.83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide \n                equivalents, with the upper end of this range \n                representing twelve one-thousandths of one percent of \n                the 6,702 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted \n                in the United States in 2011; and\n                    (C) after extensive evaluation of potential impacts \n                to land and water resources along the Keystone XL \n                pipeline's 875 mile proposed route, the Department of \n                State found that ``The analyses of potential impacts \n                associated with construction and normal operation of \n                the proposed Project suggest that there would be no \n                significant impacts to most resources along the \n                proposed Project route (assuming Keystone complies with \n                all laws and required conditions and measures).''.\n            (6) The transportation of oil via pipeline is the safest \n        and most economically and environmentally effective means of \n        doing so, and--\n                    (A) transportation of oil via pipeline has a record \n                of unmatched safety and environmental protection, and \n                the Department of State found that ``Spills associated \n                with the proposed Project that enter the environment \n                expected to be rare and relatively small'', and that \n                ``there is no evidence of increased corrosion or other \n                pipeline threat due to viscosity'' of diluted bitumen \n                oil that will be transported by the Keystone XL \n                pipeline; and\n                    (B) plans to incorporate 57 project-specific \n                special conditions related to the design, construction, \n                and operations of the Keystone XL pipeline led the \n                Department of State to find that the pipeline will have \n                ``a degree of safety over any other typically \n                constructed domestic oil pipeline''.\n            (7) The Keystone XL is in much the same position today as \n        the Alaska Pipeline in 1973 prior to congressional action. Once \n        again, the Federal regulatory process remains an insurmountable \n        obstacle to a project that is likely to reduce oil imports from \n        insecure foreign sources.\n\nSEC. 3. KEYSTONE XL PERMIT APPROVAL.\n\n    Notwithstanding Executive Order No. 13337 (3 U.S.C. 301 note), \nExecutive Order No. 11423 (3 U.S.C. 301 note), section 301 of title 3, \nUnited States Code, and any other Executive order or provision of law, \nno Presidential permit shall be required for the pipeline described in \nthe application filed on May 4, 2012, by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, \nL.P. to the Department of State for the Keystone XL pipeline, as \nsupplemented to include the Nebraska reroute evaluated in the Final \nEvaluation Report issued by the Nebraska Department of Environmental \nQuality in January 2013 and approved by the Nebraska governor. The \nfinal environmental impact statement issued by the Secretary of State \non August 26, 2011, coupled with the Final Evaluation Report described \nin the previous sentence, shall be considered to satisfy all \nrequirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 \nU.S.C. 470 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 4. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n    (a) Exclusive Jurisdiction.--Except for review by the Supreme Court \non writ of certiorari, the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit shall have original and exclusive \njurisdiction to determine--\n            (1) the validity of any final order or action (including a \n        failure to act) of any Federal agency or officer with respect \n        to issuance of a permit relating to the construction or \n        maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline, including any final \n        order or action deemed to be taken, made, granted, or issued;\n            (2) the constitutionality of any provision of this Act, or \n        any decision or action taken, made, granted, or issued, or \n        deemed to be taken, made, granted, or issued under this Act; or\n            (3) the adequacy of any environmental impact statement \n        prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n        (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), or of any analysis under any other \n        Act, with respect to any action taken, made, granted, or \n        issued, or deemed to be taken, made, granted, or issued under \n        this Act.\n    (b) Deadline for Filing Claim.--A claim arising under this Act may \nbe brought not later than 60 days after the date of the decision or \naction giving rise to the claim.\n    (c) Expedited Consideration.--The United States Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit shall set any action brought under \nsubsection (a) for expedited consideration, taking into account the \nnational interest of enhancing national energy security by providing \naccess to the significant oil reserves in Canada that are needed to \nmeet the demand for oil.\n\nSEC. 5. AMERICAN BURYING BEETLE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) environmental reviews performed for the Keystone XL \n        pipeline project satisfy the requirements of section 7 of the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2)) in its \n        entirety; and\n            (2) for purposes of that Act, the Keystone XL pipeline \n        project will not jeopardize the continued existence of the \n        American burying beetle or destroy or adversely modify American \n        burying beetle critical habitat.\n    (b) Biological Opinion.--The Secretary of the Interior is deemed to \nhave issued a written statement setting forth the Secretary's opinion \ncontaining such findings under section 7(b)(1)(A) of the Endangered \nSpecies Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1536(b)(1)(A)) and any taking of the \nAmerican burying beetle that is incidental to the construction or \noperation and maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline as it may be \nultimately defined in its entirety, shall not be considered a \nprohibited taking of such species under such Act.\n\nSEC. 6. RIGHT-OF-WAY AND TEMPORARY USE PERMIT.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior is deemed to have granted or issued a \ngrant of right-of-way and temporary use permit under section 28 of the \nMineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 185) and the Federal Land Policy and \nManagement Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), as set forth in the \napplication tendered to the Bureau of Land Management for the Keystone \nXL pipeline.\n\nSEC. 7. PERMITS FOR ACTIVITIES IN NAVIGABLE WATERS.\n\n    (a) Issuance of Permits.--The Secretary of the Army, not later than \n90 days after receipt of an application therefor, shall issue all \npermits under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n(33 U.S.C. 1344) and section 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. \n403; commonly known as the Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of \n1899), necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of \nthe pipeline described in the May 4, 2012, application referred to in \nsection 3, as supplemented by the Nebraska reroute. The application \nshall be based on the administrative record for the pipeline as of the \ndate of enactment of this Act, which shall be considered complete.\n    (b) Waiver of Procedural Requirements.--The Secretary may waive any \nprocedural requirement of law or regulation that the Secretary \nconsiders desirable to waive in order to accomplish the purposes of \nthis section.\n    (c) Issuance in Absence of Action by the Secretary.--If the \nSecretary has not issued a permit described in subsection (a) on or \nbefore the last day of the 90-day period referred to in subsection (a), \nthe permit shall be deemed issued under section 404 of the Federal \nWater Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) or section 10 of the Act \nof March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403), as appropriate, on the day following \nsuch last day.\n    (d) Limitation.--The Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency may not prohibit or restrict an activity or use of an area that \nis authorized under this section.\n\nSEC. 8. MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT PERMIT.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior is deemed to have issued a special \npurpose permit under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et \nseq.), as described in the application filed with the United States \nFish and Wildlife Service for the Keystone XL pipeline on January 11, \n2013.\n\nSEC. 9. OIL SPILL RESPONSE PLAN DISCLOSURE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Any pipeline owner or operator required under \nFederal law to develop an oil spill response plan for the Keystone XL \npipeline shall make such plan available to the Governor of each State \nin which such pipeline operates to assist with emergency response \npreparedness.\n    (b) Updates.--A pipeline owner or operator required to make \navailable to a Governor a plan under subsection (a) shall make \navailable to such Governor any update of such plan not later than 7 \ndays after the date on which such update is made.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives May 22, 2013.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,\n\n                                                                 Clerk.\n                                                        "
