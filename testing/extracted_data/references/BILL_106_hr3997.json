FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The intent and purpose of Federal securities law is to \n        protect the general investing public and to make the regulation \n        and control required by national public interest reasonably \n        complete and effective.\n            (2) The United States Securities and Exchange Commission \n        has acknowledged that there are millions of lost security \n        holders in the United States, who are, thereby, deprived of the \n        benefit of their investments valued by the Commission in the \n        hundreds of millions of dollars.\n            (3) The Commission's current regulations relating to lost \n        security holders apply only to recordkeeping transfer agents \n        who handle approximately half of all security holders, thereby \n        denying the same benefits to the other half.\n            (4) Available technologies can locate 80 percent or more of \n        corrected addresses for security holders, who have not received \n        the benefit of the dividends and interest earned by their \n        securities and other valuable property rights.\n            (5) The Federal Government, through its agencies, holds \n        large sums of money owed to others, who cannot reasonably \n        obtain their money, because of a lack of information about \n        these sums and how to claim them.\n\n  TITLE I--RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\n\nSEC. 101. ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO SECURE DELIVERY OF DIVIDENDS, \n              INTEREST, AND OTHER VALUABLE PROPERTY RIGHTS.\n\n    Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78q-\n1) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(g) Due Diligence for the Delivery of Dividends, Interest, and \nOther Valuable Property Rights.--\n            ``(1) Due diligence obligation.--Each issuer of any \n        security registered pursuant to section 12 of this title shall \n        exercise due diligence in delivering dividends, interest, and \n        other valuable property rights to their owners, whether such \n        dividends, interest, or other valuable property rights are \n        delivered by any issuer or on behalf of any issuer by any \n        paying agent.\n            ``(2) Revision of regulations required.--The Commission \n        shall amend the provisions of section 240.17Ad-17 of the \n        Commission's regulations (17 C.F.R. 240.17Ad-17) as in effect \n        on December 8, 1997--\n                    ``(A) to extend the application of such section to \n                all such paying agents, including the obligation to use \n                database searches as required of transfer agents;
