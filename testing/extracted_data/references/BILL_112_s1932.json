FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) United States overdependence on oil imports from \n        hostile or unstable regions damages United States national \n        security, endangers the economy of the United States, puts the \n        lives of military and civilian personnel at risk, and ensures \n        that access to oil imports comes at tremendous taxpayer \n        expense;\n            (2) the United States imports more than half of the oil it \n        consumes, much of it from countries that do not have the level \n        of environmental standards of Canada and the United States and \n        that are hostile to United States interests or that have \n        political and economic instability that compromises supply \n        security;\n            (3) while a significant portion of the United States' oil \n        imports are derived from allies such as Canada and Mexico, the \n        United States remains vulnerable to substantial supply \n        disruptions created by geopolitical tumult in major oil-\n        producing nations;\n            (4) strong increases in oil consumption in the developing \n        world outpace growth in oil supplies, bringing tight market \n        conditions and higher oil prices in periods of global economic \n        expansion or when supplies are threatened;\n            (5) the development and delivery of oil from Canada to the \n        United States is in the national interest of the United States \n        by helping to secure reliable oil supplies to meet demand that \n        is otherwise projected to be met by increases in imports from \n        less secure and reliable suppliers;\n            (6) secure and reliable trade with Canada complements \n        United States domestic energy priorities;\n            (7) continued development of North American energy \n        resources, including Canadian oil, increases the access of \n        domestic refiners to stable and reliable sources of crude oil \n        and improves the certainty of fuel supply for the Department of \n        Defense, the largest consumer of petroleum in the United \n        States;\n            (8)(A) Canada and the United States have the largest 2-way \n        trading relationship in the world;\n            (B) for every United States dollar spent on products from \n        Canada, including oil, 90 cents is returned to the United \n        States economy; and\n            (C) when the same metrics are applied to trading \n        relationships with some other major sources of United States \n        crude oil imports, returns are much lower;\n            (9)(A) the principal choice for Canadian oil exporters is \n        between moving increasing crude oil volumes to the United \n        States or Asia, particularly China; and\n            (B) increased Canadian oil exports to China would result in \n        increased crude oil imports to the United States from less \n        secure and reliable foreign sources, many of which do not have \n        the level of environmental standards of Canada and the United \n        States;\n            (10) increased Canadian crude oil imports into the United \n        States correspondingly reduces the scale of wealth transfers to \n        other more distant foreign sources resulting from the greater \n        cost of transporting crude oil from those sources;\n            (11) not only are United States companies major investors \n        in Canadian oil sands, but many United States businesses \n        throughout the United States benefit from supplying goods and \n        services required for ongoing Canadian oil sands operations and \n        expansion;\n            (12) there has been more than 3 years of consideration and \n        a coordinated review by more than a dozen Federal agencies of \n        the technical aspects and of the environmental, social, and \n        economic impacts of the proposed pipeline project known as the \n        Keystone XL from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska, \n        and then on to the United States Gulf Coast through Cushing, \n        Oklahoma;\n            (13) the Keystone XL pipeline represents a high capacity \n        pipeline supply option that could meet near, as well as long-\n        term, market demand for crude oil to United States refineries, \n        and could also potentially bring over 100,000 barrels per day \n        of United States Bakken crude oil to market;\n            (14) completion of the Keystone XL pipeline would increase \n        total Keystone pipeline system capacity by 700,000 barrels per \n        day to 1,290,000 barrels per day;\n            (15) the Keystone XL pipeline would directly create 20,000 \n        jobs and many more long-term jobs and related labor income \n        benefits through the supply chain;\n            (16) the earliest possible construction of the Keystone XL \n        pipeline will increase the quantity of proven and potential \n        reserves of Canadian oil available for United States use and \n        increase United States jobs and will, as a result, serve the \n        national interest;\n            (17) the Keystone XL pipeline would be state-of-the-art and \n        be constructed to meet the highest safety standards; and\n            (18) as a result of the extensive governmental studies \n        already made with respect to the Keystone XL project and the \n        national interest in early delivery of Canadian oil to United \n        States markets, a decision with respect to a Presidential \n        permit for the Keystone XL pipeline should be promptly issued \n        without further administrative delay or impediment.\n\nSEC. 3.

and\n                    (C) no further Federal environmental review shall \n                be required.\n            (5) The construction, operation, and maintenance of the \n        facilities shall be in all material respects similar to that \n        described in the application described in subsection (a) and--\n                    (A) in accordance with the construction, \n                mitigation, and reclamation measures agreed to by the \n                permittee in the Construction Mitigation and \n                Reclamation Plan found in appendix B of the final \n                environmental impact statement issued by the Secretary \n                of State on August 26, 2011, subject to the \n                modification described in subsection (d);\n                    (B) the special conditions agreed to between the \n                permittee and the Administrator of the Pipeline \n                Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the \n                Department of Transportation found in appendix U of the \n                final environmental impact statement described in \n                subparagraph (A);\n                    (C) if the modified route submitted by the Governor \n                of Nebraska under subsection (d)(3)(B) crosses the Sand \n                Hills region, the measures agreed to by the permittee \n                for the Sand Hills region found in appendix H of the \n                final environmental impact statement described in \n                subparagraph (A);
