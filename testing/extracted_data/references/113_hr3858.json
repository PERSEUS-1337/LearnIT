SHORT TITLE; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran-Centered \nAccess to Coordinated Health Care Act of 2014''.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) veterans who are authorized by the Secretary of \n        Veterans Affairs to receive health care in the community must \n        not lose the high quality, safety, care coordination, and other \n        veteran-centric elements that the health care system of the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs provides;\n            (2) many veterans receive health care from both the \n        Department and community providers but the lack of care \n        coordination among the Department and community providers when \n        veterans receive purchased care places veterans at risk for \n        poor health outcomes and results in inefficient use of finite \n        health care resources;\n            (3) veteran-centric care coordination is associated with \n        improved patient outcomes, as Department and non-Department \n        health care teams coordinate and collaborate to provide the \n        best care for veterans; and\n            (4) if the Secretary purchases care for veterans from the \n        private sector, such care must be secured in a cost-effective \n        manner, in a way that complements the larger health care system \n        of the Department by using industry standards for care and \n        costs.\n\nSEC. 2.
