NATIONAL COMMISSION ON AMERICAN INDIAN TRUST HOLDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States has entered into treaties with Indian \n        tribes under which the United States made various commitments \n        to Indian tribes and Indian people;\n            (2) the United States functions, by treaty and statute, as \n        a trustee for Indian tribes and individual Indians;\n            (3) the United States has a fiduciary obligation to Indian \n        tribes and Indian people and, in accordance with that \n        obligation, must use the highest standard of care to protect \n        the assets of Indian tribes and individual Indians;\n            (4) the United States has failed Indian tribes and \n        individual Indians and abridged its treaty and other \n        obligations relating to the handling of trust fund management \n        and historical accounting;\n            (5) mismanagement of Indian trust assets by the United \n        States is a longstanding problem that spans many \n        administrations;\n            (6) the complexity and longevity of that mismanagement \n        neither mitigates the injustice visited on Indian tribes and \n        the 300,000 individual Native Americans whose accounts have \n        been shortchanged nor absolves the United States of its \n        responsibility to correct the situation in a timely manner;\n            (7) in 1996 a civil action, Cobell v. Norton, Civ. No. 96-\n        1285 (RCL), was brought in the United States District Court for \n        the District of Columbia to attempt to obtain an order \n        compelling the United States to account for the trust funds \n        managed by the United States on behalf of individual Indians \n        and take all necessary action to bring the United States into \n        compliance with its fiduciary duties;\n            (8) those funds are generated from Indian trust land \n        royalties resulting from leases of that land to oil, \n        agricultural, timber, mining, and other interests;\n            (9) on April 5, 2004, Mr. Alan L. Balaran, the Special \n        Master in the Cobell case, tendered his resignation to the \n        Honorable Royce C. Lamberth;\n            (10) in his letter of resignation, Mr. Balaran stated \n        that--\n                    (A) there is evidence that energy companies, \n                assisted by the Department of the Interior, routinely \n                pay individual Indians much less than they pay non-\n                Indians for oil and gas pipeline easements;\n                    (B) the Special Master had uncovered evidence that \n                the Department fails to diligently monitor oil and gas \n                leasing activities on Indian land; and\n                    (C) there is evidence that the Department has been \n                putting the interests of private energy companies ahead \n                of the interests of individual Indian beneficiaries, \n                notwithstanding their fiduciary obligation to Indian \n                tribes and Indian beneficiaries; and\n            (11) the Great Plains, Rocky Mountain, and other regions of \n        the United States are rich in other trust assets such as \n        timber, agriculture, mining, and other resources.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Balaran letter.--The term ``Balaran letter'' means the \n        letter dated April 5, 2004, from Special Master Alan L.
