For any such facility, the amount of such payment shall be 1.5 \ncents per kilowatt hour (adjusted as provided in paragraph (2)), \nsubject to the availability of appropriations under subsection (g), \nexcept that no facility may receive more than $1,000,000 in one \ncalendar year.\n            (2) Adjustments.--The amount of the payment made to any \n        person under this section as provided in paragraph (1) shall be \n        adjusted for inflation for each fiscal year beginning after \n        calendar year 2001 in the same manner as provided in the \n        provisions of section 29(d)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code \n        of 1986, except that in applying such provisions the calendar \n        year 2001 shall be substituted for calendar year 1979.\n    (f) Sunset.--No payment may be made under this section to any \nqualified hydroelectric facility after the expiration of the period of \n20 fiscal years beginning with the first full fiscal year occurring \nafter the date of enactment of this Act, and no payment may be made \nunder this section to any such facility after a payment has been made \nwith respect to such facility for a period of 10 fiscal years.\n    (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this section \n$50,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2002 through 2011.\n\nSEC. 4. HYDROELECTRIC EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT.\n\n    (a) Incentive Payments.--The Secretary of Energy shall make \nincentive payments to the owners or operators of hydroelectric \nfacilities at existing dams to be used to make capital improvements in \nthe facilities that are directly related to improving the efficiency of \nsuch facilities by at least 3 percent.\n    (b) Limitations.--Incentive payments under this section shall not \nexceed 10 percent of the costs of the capital improvement concerned and \nnot more than one payment may be made with respect to improvements at a \nsingle facility. No payment in excess of $1,000,000 may be made with \nrespect to improvements at a single facility.\n    (c) Authorization.--There is authorized to be appropriated to carry \nout this section not more than $50,000,000 in each fiscal year after \nthe fiscal year 2001.\n\nSEC. 5.

INCREASED HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION AT EXISTING FEDERAL \n              FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the \nSecretary of the Interior and Secretary of the Army, shall conduct \nstudies of the cost-effective opportunities to increase hydropower \ngeneration at existing federally-owned or operated water regulation, \nstorage, and conveyance facilities. Such studies shall be completed \nwithin two years after the date of enactment of this Act and \ntransmitted to the Committee on Commerce of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \nthe Senate. An individual study shall be prepared for each of the \nNation's principal river basins. Each such study shall identify and \ndescribe with specificity the following matters:\n            (1) Opportunities to improve the efficiency of hydropower \n        generation at such facilities through, but not limited to, \n        mechanical, structural, or operational changes.\n            (2) Opportunities to improve the efficiency of the use of \n        water supplied or regulated by Federal projects where such \n        improvement could, in the absence of legal or administrative \n        constraints, make additional water supplies available for \n        hydropower generation or reduce project energy use.\n            (3) Opportunities to create additional hydropower \n        generating capacity at existing facilities through, but not \n        limited to, the construction of additional generating \n        facilities, the uprating of generators and turbines, and the \n        construction of pumped storage facilities.\n            (4) Preliminary assessment of the costs and the economic \n        and environmental consequences of such measures.\n    (b) Previous Studies.--If studies of the type required by \nsubsection (a) have been prepared by any agency of the United States \nand published within the five years prior to the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary of Energy may choose not to perform new studies \nand incorporate the information in such studies into the studies \nrequired by subsection (a).\n    (c) Authorization.--There is authorized to be appropriated such \nsums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section."
