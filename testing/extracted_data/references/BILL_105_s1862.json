FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Each year more than 2,000,000 poisonings are reported \n        to poison control centers throughout the United States. More \n        than 90 percent of these poisonings happen in the home. 53 \n        percent of poisoning victims are children younger than 6 years \n        of age.\n            (2) Poison centers are life-saving and cost-effective \n        public health services. For every dollar spent on poison \n        control centers, $7 in medical costs are saved. The average \n        cost of a poisoning exposure call is $31.28, while the average \n        cost if other parts of the medical system are involved is $932. \n        Over the last 2 decades, the instability and lack of funding \n        has resulted in a steady decline in the number of poison \n        control centers in the United States. Currently, there are 75 \n        such centers.\n            (3) Stabilizing the funding structure and increasing \n        accessibility to poison control centers will increase the \n        number of United States residents who have access to a \n        certified poison control center, and reduce the inappropriate \n        use of emergency medical services and other more costly health \n        care services.\n\nSEC. 3.
