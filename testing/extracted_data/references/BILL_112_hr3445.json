FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One of America's strengths has always been that it is a \n        great place to start and grow a business.\n            (2) According to the 2010 Small Business Economy: A Report \n        to the President, ``small businesses--those with fewer than 500 \n        employees--are generally the creators of most net new jobs, as \n        well as the employers of about half of the nation's private \n        sector work force, and the providers of a significant share of \n        innovations, as well as half of the nonfarm, private real gross \n        domestic product.''.\n            (3) The April 2009 World Economic Forum Report entitled \n        ``Educating the Next Wave of Entrepreneurs'' recommends that \n        countries transform their educational systems to integrate \n        entrepreneurship education at all levels and across curricula \n        in recognition that ``entrepreneurship education is essential \n        for developing the human capital necessary for the society of \n        the future.''.\n            (4) ``Educating the Next Wave of Entrepreneurs'' argues \n        that the skills and knowledge learned through entrepreneurship \n        education--such as problem solving, economic principles, and \n        negotiation--are critical to success in the 21st century global \n        economy, in which competition is fierce and markets and jobs \n        evolve at a rapid pace.\n            (5) Entrepreneurship education models incorporate lessons \n        in financial literacy, economics, and other business topics \n        such as marketing and accounting which can lead to increased \n        proficiency in mathematics and English Language Arts.\n            (6) When young people learn to see opportunity amid \n        obstacles, to set and achieve high personal goals, and to apply \n        knowledge and skills to real-world scenarios--in short, to \n        think and act like entrepreneurs--they are armed with tools \n        that will increase their success in college and beyond.\n\nSEC. 3.
