FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The possession by hostile states or terrorist groups of \n        nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction, \n        or related materials or means of delivery, represents the \n        greatest threat to the national security of the United States \n        in the 21st century.\n            (2) It is the highest priority of the United States to \n        protect its territory, people, armed forces, allies, and \n        friends from attacks by dangerous regimes or terrorist groups \n        using weapons of mass destruction or related materials or means \n        of delivery.\n            (3) It is the policy of the United States to ensure and \n        strengthen verification and compliance with the Treaty on the \n        Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, \n        London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March \n        5, 1970 (commonly known as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n        Treaty''), the Convention on the Prohibition of the \n        Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical \n        Weapons and on Their Destruction, with Annexes, done at Paris \n        January 13, 1993, and entered into force April 29, 1997 \n        (commonly known as the ``Chemical Weapons Convention''), the \n        Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production \n        and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin \n        Weapons and on Their Destruction, done at Washington, London, \n        and Moscow April 10, 1972, and entered into force March 26, \n        1975 (commonly known as the ``Biological Weapons Convention''), \n        the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency \n        (IAEA), and the commitments and control lists of the Missile \n        Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Australia Group (AG), the \n        Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and the Wassenaar Arrangement on \n        Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and \n        Technologies (WA).\n            (4) The national security interests of the United States \n        have been well-served by the enactment of the Soviet Nuclear \n        Threat Reduction Act of 1991 (title II of Public Law 102-228; \n        22 U.S.C. 2551 note), (commonly known as the ``Nunn-Lugar \n        Act''), its successor law, the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act \n        of 1993 (title XII of Public Law 103-160; 22 U.S.C. 5951 note), \n        and the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996 \n        (title XIV of Public Law 104-201; 50 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.) \n        (commonly known as the ``Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act'').\n            (5) The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program \n        has, as of January 2007--\n                    (A) deactivated 6,934 nuclear warheads;\n                    (B) destroyed 637 intercontinental ballistic \n                missiles;\n                    (C) eliminated 485 intercontinental ballistic \n                missile silos;\n                    (D) destroyed 81 mobile intercontinental ballistic \n                missile launchers;\n                    (E) eliminated 155 bombers;\n                    (F) destroyed 906 nuclear air-to-surface missiles;\n                    (G) eliminated 436 submarine-launched ballistic \n                missile launchers;\n                    (H) eliminated 601 submarine-launched ballistic \n                missiles;\n                    (I) destroyed 30 strategic nuclear submarines; and\n                    (J) sealed 194 nuclear test tunnels or holes.\n            (6) On February 11, 2004, President George W. Bush called \n        for the expansion of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \n        Reduction program, stating: ``I propose to expand our efforts \n        to keep weapons from the Cold War and other dangerous materials \n        out of the wrong hands. In 1991, Congress passed the Nunn-Lugar \n        legislation. Senator Lugar had a clear vision, along with \n        Senator Nunn, about what to do with the old Soviet Union. Under \n        this program, we're helping former Soviet states find \n        productive employment for former weapons scientists. We're \n        dismantling, destroying, and securing weapons and materials \n        left over from the Soviet WMD arsenal. We have more work to do \n        there.''\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) all United States capabilities must be utilized to \n        prevent acts of catastrophic terrorism using weapons of mass \n        destruction or related materials or means of delivery;\n            (2) in order to prevent acts of catastrophic terrorism \n        using weapons of mass destruction or related materials or means \n        of delivery, the United States must pursue a strategy making \n        full and effective use of multilateral and bilateral \n        agreements, missile defense, arms control, threat reduction \n        assistance, interdiction efforts, export controls, and United \n        States proliferation sanctions;\n            (3) the United States must not allow the world's most \n        dangerous weapons to fall into the hands of dangerous regimes \n        and terrorist groups;\n            (4) the United States must hold nations accountable for all \n        violations of international nonproliferation treaties, norms, \n        and standards of conduct, and to the extent that it is \n        consistent with United States law and policy, provide \n        assistance to ensure that such treaties, norms, and standards \n        of conduct are upheld rather than violated; and\n            (5) the President must be provided the authority to use \n        Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction funds in a manner \n        consistent with the high value Congress and the President have \n        placed on Cooperative Threat Reduction programs to reduce the \n        threat posed to the national security of the United States and \n        international peace and security by the proliferation of \n        weapons of mass destruction or related materials or means of \n        delivery.\n\nSEC. 4.
