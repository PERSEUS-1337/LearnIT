FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Current law requires that there be across-the-board \n        cuts, known as a ``sequester'', imposed on January 2, 2013. The \n        sequester will result in a 10 percent reduction in non-military \n        personnel programs of the Department of Defense and an 8 \n        percent reduction in certain domestic programs, such as the \n        National Institutes of Health (NIH) and border security.\n            (2) Intended as a mechanism to force action, there is \n        bipartisan agreement that the sequester going into place would \n        undercut key responsibilities of the Federal Government.\n            (3) As the Administration stated in its fiscal year 2013 \n        budget request, ``[Sequestration] would lead to significant \n        cuts to critical domestic programs such as education and \n        research and cuts to defense programs that could undermine our \n        national security. * * * [C]uts of this magnitude done in an \n        across-the-board fashion would be devastating both to defense \n        and non-defense programs.'' (The Budget of the United States \n        Government, Fiscal Year 2013, p. 24, February 13, 2012).\n            (4) On March 29, 2012, The House of Representatives passed \n        H. Con. Res. 112, the budget resolution for fiscal year 2013, \n        which includes reconciliation instructions directing House \n        Committees to craft legislation that would achieve the savings \n        required to replace the sequestration called for in fiscal year \n        2013, as established by the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n            (5) On May 10, 2012, the House of Representatives passed \n        H.R. 5652, the Sequestration Replacement Reconciliation Act of \n        2012, which would replace the $98 billion sequestration of \n        discretionary spending called for in 2013, as established by \n        the Budget Control Act of 2011, by making changes in law to \n        reduce direct spending by $310 billion through fiscal year \n        2022.\n            (6) An analysis of the impact of the sequestration prepared \n        for the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee found \n        that if left in place, sequestration would cut the military to \n        its smallest size since before the Second World War, all while \n        we are still a nation at war in Afghanistan, facing increased \n        threats from Iran and North Korea, unrest in the Middle East, \n        and a rising China.\n            (7) Major consequences identified by the House Armed \n        Services Committee include the following:\n                    (A) 200,000 soldiers and Marines separated from \n                service, bringing our force well below our pre-9/11 \n                levels.\n                    (B) Ability to respond to contingencies in North \n                Korea or Iran at jeopardy.\n                    (C) The smallest ground force since 1940.\n                    (D) A fleet of fewer than 230 ships, the smallest \n                level since 1915.\n                    (E) The smallest tactical fighter force in the \n                history of the Air Force.\n                    (F) Our nuclear triad that has kept the U.S. and 30 \n                of our allies safe for decades will be in jeopardy.\n                    (G) Reductions of 20 percent in defense civilian \n                personnel.\n                    (H) Two BRAC rounds of base closings. (House Armed \n                Services Committee memo entitled ``Assessment of \n                Impacts of Budget Cuts'', September 22, 2011).\n            (8) Secretary Panetta and the professional military \n        leadership have also looked at the impact of sequestration and \n        reached similar conclusions.\n            (9) Secretary Panetta stated, ``If the maximum \n        sequestration is triggered, the total cut will rise to about $1 \n        trillion compared with the FY 2012 plan. The impacts of these \n        cuts would be devastating for the Department * * * Facing such \n        large reductions, we would have to reduce the size of the \n        military sharply. Rough estimates suggest after ten years of \n        these cuts, we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, \n        the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest Air \n        Force in its history.'' (Secretary Panetta, Letter to Senator \n        John McCain, November 14, 2011).\n            (10) General Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n        Staff, stated, ``[S]equestration leaves me three places to go \n        to find the additional money: operations, maintenance, and \n        training. That's the definition of a hollow force.''.\n            (11) The individual branch service chiefs echoed General \n        Dempsey:\n                    (A) ``Cuts of this magnitude would be catastrophic \n                to the military * * * My assessment is that the nation \n                would incur an unacceptable level of strategic and \n                operational risk.''--General Ray T. Odierno, Chief Of \n                Staff, United States Army.\n                    (B) ``A severe and irreversible impact on the \n                Navy's future''--Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, Chief of \n                Naval Operations.\n                    (C) ``A Marine Corps below the end strength that's \n                necessary to support even one major contingency,''--\n                General James F. Amos, Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n                    (D) ``Even the most thoroughly deliberated strategy \n                may not be able to overcome dire consequences,''--\n                General Norton A. Schwartz, Chief of Staff, United \n                States Air Force (Testimony of Service Chief before \n                House Armed Services Committee, November 2, 2011).\n            (12) According to an analysis by the House Appropriations \n        Committee, the sequester will also have a significant impact on \n        non-defense discretionary programs, including the following:\n                    (A) Automatically reducing Head Start by $650 \n                million, resulting in 75,000 fewer slots for children \n                in the program.\n                    (B) Automatically reducing the National Institutes \n                of Health (NIH) by $2.4 billion, an amount equal to \n                nearly half of total NIH spending on cancer this year.\n                    (C) A reduction of approximately 1,870 Border \n                Patrol Agents (a reduction of nearly 9 percent of the \n                total number of agents).\n            (13) Beyond the negative impacts sequestration will have on \n        defense readiness, it will also undermine the industrial base \n        needed to equip our armed forces with the weapons and \n        technology they need to complete their mission. A study \n        released by the National Association of Manufacturers suggests \n        that 1.1 million workers in the supply chain could be adversely \n        affected, including 3.4 percent of workers in the aerospace \n        industry, 3.3 percent of the workforce in the shipbuilding \n        industry and 10 percent of the workers in the search and \n        navigation equipment industry.\n\nSEC. 3.
