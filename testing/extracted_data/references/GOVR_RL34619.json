    "content": "Both the Capitol Rotunda and the Capitol Grounds have been used as the setting for a variety of events, ranging from memorial ceremonies and the reception of foreign dignitaries to the presentation of awards and the hosting of public competitions. This report identifies and categorizes uses of the Capitol Rotunda and Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolutions since the 101 st Congress. In most cases, use of the Capitol Rotunda requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate. A concurrent resolution for the use of the Rotunda typically identifies the event and date for which use is authorized. Often, the resolution also directs physical preparations to be carried out \"in accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the Capitol may provide.\" Use of the Capitol Grounds requires either the passage of a concurrent resolution or permit approval from the Capitol Police. Events that entail the use of the West Front Steps of the Capitol, electricity on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, require more than 24 hours from setup to cleanup, require vehicles on Capitol Grounds for setup, or will have a large number of Members in attendance typically require a concurrent resolution. All other events can typically be issued permits by the U.S. Capitol Police. Upon the completion and opening of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) during the 110 th Congress, Emancipation Hall of the CVC became available for use in the same manner as the Rotunda and Capitol Grounds. Use of Emancipation Hall requires the passage of a resolution agreed to by both houses of Congress authorizing its use. Additionally, Congress has provided an ongoing authorization for holiday concerts on Capitol Grounds. Held on Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day, these concerts feature the National Symphony Orchestra and are free and open to the public. A database search was conducted using Congress.gov for the 101 st through the 115 th Congresses (1989-2018). The search was conducted by running a query across all agreed-to concurrent resolutions using the subject term \"rotunda.\" The results of the search were then examined individually to differentiate resolutions for the use of the Rotunda from references to it in otherwise unrelated legislation. The search identified a total of 99 concurrent resolutions that were agreed to by the House and Senate. Between the 101 st Congress and the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed to between one and nine concurrent resolutions per Congress that authorized the use of the Rotunda. Table 1 reports the total number of resolutions agreed to in each Congress.  Appendix A , which lists the results of the database search, provides the following information for each concurrent resolution: the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution. Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda can be divided into seven categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies; (2) Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies; (3) artwork unveilings; (4) presidential inauguration activities; (5) receptions or ceremonies honoring living people; (6) persons lying in state or honor; and (7) prayer vigils. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category and examples of activities. Table 2 contains the number of concurrent resolutions agreed to by Congress since 1989, by category. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions (34.3%) authorized the use of the Rotunda for a commemoration ceremony, often of an historical event. For example, concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda for a ceremony as part of the commemoration of the days of remembrance of victims of the Holocaust were passed during each Congress. In recent Congresses, resolutions were also agreed to for Rotunda ceremonies to commemorate the 60 th anniversary of the integration of the U.S. Armed Forces, the 200 th birthday of Constantino Brumidi, the 50 th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's inauguration, and the 50 th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Ceremonies to award Congressional Gold Medals account for 24.2% of the concurrent resolutions for the use of the Rotunda agreed to since the 101 st Congress. These award ceremonies include presentations of Congressional Gold Medals to Rosa Parks, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, the Tuskegee Airmen, and other recipients. Since the 101 st Congress, 15.2% of concurrent resolutions have been agreed to for the use of the Rotunda for ceremonies to unveil artwork. These have included unveiling ceremonies for portrait busts of former Vice Presidents, as well as presentation ceremonies of statues prior to placement in Statuary Hall. In preparation for the quadrennial Presidential inauguration activities that take place at the Capitol, concurrent resolutions were passed during the 102 nd , 104 th , 106 th , 108 th , 110 th , 112 th , 113 th , and 115 th Congresses. These resolutions have authorized the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to use the Rotunda \"in connection with the proceedings and ceremonies conducted for the inauguration of the President-elect and the Vice President-elect of the United States.\" Since the 101 st Congress, 10.1% of concurrent resolutions have authorized the use of the Rotunda for inaugural activities. Since the 101 st Congress, 6.1% of concurrent resolutions have authorized the use of the Rotunda for the purposes of receiving foreign dignitaries or honoring a living person.

On two occasions during the 107 th Congress (2.0%), concurrent resolutions were agreed to for the use of the Rotunda for prayer vigils. H.Con.Res. 233 authorized the use of the Rotunda for a prayer vigil in memory of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. S.Con.Res. 83 authorized the use of the Rotunda for a ceremony as part of a National Day of Reconciliation. A database search was conducted using Congress.gov for the 101 st to the 115 th Congresses (1989-2019). The search was conducted by running a query using the subject term \"Capitol Grounds.\" The results of the search were then examined individually to differentiate resolutions for the use of the Capitol Grounds from references to it in otherwise unrelated legislation. The uses of the Capitol Grounds identified here are restricted to those authorized by concurrent resolution of the House and Senate. The search identified a total 112 concurrent resolutions that were agreed to by the House and Senate. Between the 101 st Congress and the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed to between 3 and 14 concurrent resolutions per Congress that authorized the use of the Capitol Grounds. Table 3 reports the total number of resolutions agreed to in each Congress.  Appendix B , which lists the results of the database search, provides the following information for each concurrent resolution: the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution. Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds can be divided into one of four categories: (1) events sponsored by nonfederal-government groups; (2) memorial services; (3) events sponsored by the federal government; and (4) award and dedication ceremonies. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category with examples of the types of activities concurrent resolutions provided for on the Capitol Grounds. Table 4 contains the number of concurrent resolutions agreed to by Congress since 1989 by category. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions agreed to (65.5%) authorized events that are sponsored by nonfederal-government entities. For example, concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby and the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Relay are typically agreed to each Congress. Memorial services held on the Capitol Grounds account for 23% of the concurrent resolutions passed since the 101 st Congress. Each year since 1989, the House and Senate have agreed to a concurrent resolution allowing the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service to be conducted on Capitol Grounds. The ceremony honors law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty during the previous year. Events sponsored by the federal government compose 8.8% of events on the Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolution. These events have included authorizing the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to hold performances on the East Front of the Capitol, allowing the National Book Festival to run programs on the Capitol Grounds, and authorizing a celebration for the Library of Congress's 200 th birthday. Award and dedication ceremonies account for 2.7% of events authorized by concurrent resolution for the Capitol Grounds. Since 1989, three award and dedication ceremonies have been authorized through concurrent resolution. In the 106 th Congress (1999-2001), Congress authorized the use of the Capitol Grounds for the dedication of the Japanese-American Memorial to Patriotism; in the 108 th Congress (2003-2005), the dedication ceremony for the National World War II Memorial was authorized for the Capitol Grounds; and in the 110 th Congress (2007-2009), the presentation ceremony for the Congressional Gold Medal awarded to Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, took place on the Capitol Grounds. Upon the completion and opening of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) during the 110 th Congress, Emancipation Hall of the CVC became available for use in the same manner as the Rotunda and Capitol Grounds. Use of Emancipation Hall requires the passage of a resolution agreed to by both houses of Congress authorizing its use. The first concurrent resolution authorizing the use of Emancipation Hall was agreed to during the 110 th Congress. It provided for the use of the Hall in connection with \"ceremonies and activities held in connection with the opening of the Capitol Visitor Center to the public.\" Consistent with previous resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda, the concurrent resolution for the use of Emancipation Hall directed that physical preparations be carried out \"in accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the Capitol may provide.\" A database search was conducted using Congress.gov for the 110 th through the 115 th Congresses (2007-2017). The search was conducted by running a query using the subject term \"Emancipation Hall.\" The uses of Emancipation Hall identified here are restricted to those authorized by concurrent resolution of the House and Senate. The search identified a total 43 concurrent resolutions that were agreed to by the House and Senate. Between the 110 th Congress and the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed to between 1 and 15 concurrent resolutions per Congress that authorized the use of Emancipation Hall. Table 5 reports the total number of resolutions agreed to in each Congress.  Appendix C , which lists the results of the database search, provides the following information for each concurrent resolution: the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution. Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of Emancipation Hall can be divided into one of four categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies, (2) congressional gold medal ceremonies, (3) artwork unveilings, and (4) presidential inauguration activities. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category with examples of the types of activities concurrent resolutions provided for on Emancipation Hall. Table 6 contains the number of concurrent resolution agreed to by Congress since 2007 by category. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions agreed to (46.5%) authorized the use of Emancipation Hall for commemoration ceremonies.
