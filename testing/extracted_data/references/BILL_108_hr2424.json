FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Black Americans have served honorably in the Congress, \n        in senior executive branch positions, in the law, the judiciary \n        and other fields, yet their record of service is not well known \n        by the public, is not included in school history lessons, and \n        is not adequately presented in the Nation's museums.\n            (2) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. in Baltimore, \n        Maryland, a nonprofit organization, is the Nation's first wax \n        museum presenting the history of great Black Americans, \n        including those who have served in Congress, in senior \n        executive branch positions, in the law, the judiciary and other \n        fields, as well as others who have made significant \n        contributions to benefit the Nation.\n            (3) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. plans to expand \n        its existing facilities to establish the National Great Blacks \n        in Wax Museum and Justice Learning Center, which is intended to \n        serve as a national museum and center for presentation of wax \n        figures and related interactive educational exhibits portraying \n        the history of great Black Americans.\n            (4) The wax medium has long been recognized as a unique and \n        artistic means to record human history through preservation of \n        the faces and personages of people of prominence, and \n        historically, wax exhibits were used to commemorate noted \n        figures in ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and Rome, in \n        medieval Europe, and in the art of the Italian renaissance.\n            (5) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. was founded in \n        1983 by Drs. Elmer and Joanne Martin, two Baltimore educators \n        who used their personal savings to purchase wax figures, which \n        they displayed in schools, churches, shopping malls, and \n        festivals in the mid-Atlantic region.\n            (6) The goal of the Martins was to test public reaction to \n        the idea of a Black history wax museum and so positive was the \n        response over time that the museum has been heralded by the \n        public and the media as a national treasure.\n            (7) The museum has been the subject of feature stories by \n        CNN, the Wall Street Journal, the Baltimore Sun, the Washington \n        Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Sun Times, the Dallas \n        Morning News, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, the Afro \n        American Newspaper, Crisis, Essence Magazine, and others.\n            (8) More than 300,000 people from across the Nation visit \n        the museum annually.\n            (9) The new museum will carry on the time-honored artistic \n        tradition of the wax medium; in particular, it will recognize \n        the significant value of this medium to commemorate and \n        appreciate great Black Americans whose faces and personages are \n        not widely recognized.\n            (10) The museum will employ the most skilled artisans in \n        the wax medium, use state-of-the-art interactive exhibition \n        technologies, and consult with museum professionals throughout \n        the Nation, and its exhibits will feature the following:\n                    (A) Blacks who have served in the Senate and House \n                of Representatives of the United States, including \n                those who represented constituencies in Alabama, \n                Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North \n                Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia during the 19th \n                century.\n                    (B) Blacks who have served in the judiciary, in the \n                Department of Justice, as prominent attorneys, in law \n                enforcement, and in the struggle for equal rights under \n                the law.\n                    (C) Black veterans of various military engagements, \n                including the Buffalo Soldiers and Tuskegee Airmen, and \n                the role of Blacks in the settlement of the western \n                United States.\n                    (D) Blacks who have served in senior executive \n                branch positions, including members of Presidents' \n                Cabinets, Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries \n                of Federal agencies, and Presidential advisors.\n                    (E) Other Blacks whose accomplishments and \n                contributions to human history during the last \n                millennium and to the Nation through more than 400 \n                years are exemplary, including Black educators, \n                authors, scientists, inventors, athletes, clergy, and \n                civil rights leaders.\n            (11) The museum plans to develop collaborative programs \n        with other museums, serve as a clearinghouse for training, \n        technical assistance, and other resources involving use of the \n        wax medium, and sponsor traveling exhibits to provide enriching \n        museum experiences for communities throughout the Nation.\n            (12) The museum has been recognized by the State of \n        Maryland and the city of Baltimore as a preeminent facility for \n        presenting and interpreting Black history, using the wax medium \n        in its highest artistic form.\n            (13) The museum is located in the heart of an area \n        designated as an empowerment zone, and is considered to be a \n        catalyst for economic and cultural improvements in this \n        economically disadvantaged area.\n\nSEC. 3.
