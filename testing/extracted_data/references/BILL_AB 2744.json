Any referral excepted under this section shall be unlawful if the prosecutor proves that there was no valid medical need for the referral.\n(e) Except as provided in Chapter 2.3 (commencing with Section 1400) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code and in Sections 654.1 and 654.2 of this code, it shall not be unlawful to provide nonmonetary remuneration, in the form of hardware, software, or information technology and training services, as described in subsections (x) and (y) of Section 1001.952 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as amended October 4, 2007, as published in the Federal Register (72 Fed.

The fee paid to the third-party advertiser shall be commensurate with the service provided by the third-party advertiser. If the licensee determines, after consultation with the purchaser of the service, that the service provided by the licensee is not appropriate for the purchaser or if the purchaser elects not to receive the service for any reason and requests a refund, the purchaser shall receive a refund of the full purchase price as determined by the terms of the advertising service agreement between the third-party advertiser and the licensee. The licensee shall disclose in the advertisement that a consultation is required and that the purchaser will receive a refund if not eligible to receive the service.

In any advertisement offering a discount price for a service, the licensee shall also disclose the regular, nondiscounted price for that service.\n(h) A violation of this section is a public offense and is punishable upon a first conviction by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code, or by a fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.
