CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Intellectual property--\n                    (A) represents the ideas, imagination and \n                creativity needed to innovate long before a product is \n                brought to market;\n                    (B) is fundamental to the continued economic, \n                social, and cultural development of society; and\n                    (C) deserves the protection of our laws.\n            (2) Music, film, software, and all other forms of \n        intellectual property represent one of the strongest and most \n        significant sectors of the United States economy, as \n        demonstrated by the fact that these industries--\n                    (A) accounted for more than 5 percent of the United \n                States Gross Domestic Product, or $535,100,000,000 in \n                2001;\n                    (B) represent almost 6 percent of all United States \n                employment; and\n                    (C) led all major industry sectors in foreign sales \n                and exports in 2001.\n            (3) In an attempt to combat the growing use of the Internet \n        and technology for the illegal reproduction and distribution of \n        copyrighted materials, Congress unanimously passed and \n        President Clinton signed the ``No Electronic Theft (NET) Act'' \n        in 1997. The NET Act is designed to strengthen copyright and \n        trademark laws and to permit the prosecution of individuals in \n        cases involving large-scale illegal reproduction or \n        distribution of copyrighted works where the infringers act \n        willfully.\n            (4) Under the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act's economic harm \n        requirement, investigations by law enforcement of copyright \n        infringements are particularly resource intensive and pose \n        significant challenges. In the interest of broader deterrence \n        and in order to facilitate the prosecution of particularly \n        egregious copyright violations, it is important to recognize \n        that a significant level of economic harm can be reached by the \n        distribution of prerelease commercial works.\n            (5) The use of camcorders and other audiovisual recording \n        devices in movie theaters to make illegal copies of films is \n        posing a serious threat to the motion picture industry. \n        According to a recent industry study, 92.4 percent of the first \n        copies of movies available for download on the Internet \n        originate from camcorders.\n            (6) Given the difficulty of enforcement, online theft of \n        music, film, software, and all forms of intellectual property \n        continues to rise. The negative effects on this large segment \n        of the United States economy are significant, as exemplified by \n        almost a 31 percent drop in sales for the music industry from \n        the middle of 2000 to the middle of 2003.\n            (7) Federal legislation is necessary and warranted to \n        combat the most egregious forms of online theft of intellectual \n        property and its significant, negative economic impact on the \n        United States economy because--\n                    (A) Article 1, section 8 of the United States \n                Constitution gives Congress the power ``[t]o promote \n                the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing \n                for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the \n                exclusive Right to their respective Writings and \n                Discoveries,'' as well as the power ``[t]o regulate \n                Commerce with foreign nations, and among the several \n                States.'';\n                    (B) the importance of the music, film, software and \n                other intellectual property-based industries to the \n                overall health of the United States economy is well \n                documented and significant; and\n                    (C) theft and unauthorized distribution of \n                intellectual property across State and international \n                lines occurs on a regular basis.\n\nSEC. 3. CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR UNAUTHORIZED RE-CORDING OF MOTION \n              PICTURES IN A MOTION PICTURE EXHIBITION FACILITY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 113 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding after section 2319A the following new section:\n``Sec. 2319B.
