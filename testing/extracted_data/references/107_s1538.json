FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) a reliable source of groundwater is an essential \n        element of the economy of the communities on the High Plains;\n            (2) the High Plains Aquifer consists largely of the \n        Ogallala Aquifer with small components of other geologic units;\n            (3) the High Plains Aquifer experienced a dramatic decline \n        in water table levels in the latter half of the twentieth \n        century;\n            (4) the decline in water table levels is especially \n        pronounced in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, with areas in the \n        States of Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas experiencing \n        declines of over 100 feet from 1950 to 1997;\n            (5) the saturated thickness of the High Plains Aquifer has \n        declined by over 50 percent in some areas. Furthermore, the \n        percentage of the High Plains Aquifer which has a saturated \n        thickness of 100 feet or more declined from 54 percent to 51 \n        percent in the period from 1980 to 1997;\n            (6) the decreased water levels in the High Plains Aquifer \n        coupled with higher pumping lift costs raise concerns about the \n        long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the High \n        Plains;\n            (7) hydrological modeling by the United States Geological \n        Survey indicates that in the context of sustained high \n        groundwater use in the surrounding region, reductions in \n        groundwater pumping at the single farm level or at a local \n        level of up to 100 square miles, have a very time limited \n        impact on conserving the level of the local water table, thus \n        creating a disincentive for individual water users to invest in \n        water conservation measures;\n            (8) incentives must be created for conservation of \n        groundwater on a regional scale, in order to achieve an \n        agricultural economy on the High Plains that is sustainable; \n        and\n            (9) for water conservation incentives to function, Federal, \n        State, tribal, and local water policy makers, and individual \n        groundwater users must have access to reliable information \n        concerning aquifer recharge rates extraction rates, and water \n        table levels at the local and regional levels on an ongoing \n        basis.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote groundwater \nconservation on the High Plains in order to extend the useable life of \nthe High Plains Aquifer.\n\nSEC. 3. HIGH PLAINS GROUNDWATER CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) High Plains Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Incentives \nProgram.--The Food Security Act of 1985 is amended by inserting after \nsection 1240H the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 1240I.

The process shall be based on--\n                    ``(A) a reasonable estimate of the projected cost \n                of the proposals and other factors identified by the \n                Secretary for determining which applications will \n                result in the least cost to the program authorized by \n                this section; and\n                    ``(B) the priorities established under this section \n                and such other factors determined by the Secretary that \n                maximize groundwater conservation benefits per dollar \n                expended.\n            ``(2) Concurrence of owner.--If the producer making an \n        offer to implement a structural practice is a tenant of the \n        land involved in agricultural production, for the offer to be \n        acceptable, the producer shall obtain the concurrent of the \n        owner of the land with respect to the offer.\n    ``(g) Land Management Practices.--The Secretary shall establish an \napplication and evaluation process for awarding incentive payments to a \nproducer in exchange for the performance of one or more land management \npractices by the producer.\n    ``(h) Payments.--\n            ``(1) Cost-share payments.--The Federal share of cost-share \n        payments to a producer proposing to implement one or more \n        structural practices shall be not more than 50 percent of the \n        projected cost of the practice, as determined by the Secretary, \n        taking into consideration any payment received by the producer \n        from a State or local government.\n            ``(2) Incentive payments.--The Secretary shall make \n        incentive payments in an amount and at a rate determined by the \n        Secretary to be necessary to encourage a producer to perform \n        one or more land management practices.\n            ``(3) Net savings.--Payment may be made to producers only \n        if the Secretary determines that the structural practice or \nland management practice will result in a net savings on lands owned or \noperated by the producer of groundwater resources of the High Plains \nAquifer.\n    ``(i) Modifications or Termination of Contracts.--\n            ``(1) Voluntary modification or termination.--The Secretary \n        may modify or terminate a contract entered into with a producer \n        under this section if--\n                    ``(A) the producer agrees to the modification or \n                termination;\n                    ``(B) the Secretary determines that the \n                modification or termination is in the public interest.\n            ``(2) Involuntary termination.--The Secretary may terminate \n        a contract under this section if the Secretary determines that \n        the producer violated the contract.\n    ``(j) Duties.--\n            ``(1) Duties or producers.--To receive cost-share payments, \n        incentive payments, or technical assistance under this section, \n        a producer shall agree to implement the structural practice or \n        land management practice as agreed to in the contract with the \n        Secretary and to comply with such additional conditions as the \n        Secretary determines are necessary to carry out the intent of \n        this section.\n            ``(2) Duties of the secretary.--The Secretary shall provide \n        cost-share payments or incentive payments for developing and \n        implementing one or more structural practices or one or more \n        land management practices, as agreed to in the contract with \n        the producer.\n    ``(k) Limitation of Payments.--The total amount of cost-share \npayments paid to any one producer under this section may not exceed \n$50,000 for any multi-year contract.
