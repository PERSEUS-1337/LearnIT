FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Trade Adjustment Assistance assists workers and \n        agricultural commodity producers who lose their jobs for trade-\n        related reasons to retrain, gain new skills, and find new jobs \n        in growing sectors of the economy.\n            (2) The total cost of providing adjustment assistance \n        represents a tiny fraction of the gains to the United States \n        economy as a whole that economists attribute to trade \n        liberalization.\n            (3) In circumstances where, due to changes in market \n        conditions caused by the implementation of bilateral or \n        multilateral free trade agreements, unfair trade practices, \n        unforeseen import surges, and other reasons, import competition \n        creates industry-wide effects on domestic workers or \n        agricultural commodity producers, the current process of \n        assessing eligibility for trade adjustment assistance on a \n        plant-by-plant basis is inefficient and can lead to unfair and \n        inconsistent results.\n\nSEC. 3. OTHER METHODS OF REQUESTING INVESTIGATION.\n\n    Section 221 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2271) is amended--\n            (1) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) Other Methods of Initiating a Petition.--Upon the request of \nthe President or the United States Trade Representative, or the \nresolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \nRepresentatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate, the \nSecretary shall promptly initiate an investigation under this chapter \nto determine the eligibility for adjustment assistance of--\n            ``(1) a group of workers (which may include workers from \n        more than one facility or employer); or\n            ``(2) all workers in an occupation as that occupation is \n        defined in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Standard Occupational \n        Classification System.'';\n            (2) in subsection (a)(2), by inserting ``or a request or \n        resolution filed under subsection (c),'' after ``paragraph \n        (1),''; and\n            (3) in subsection (a)(3), by inserting ``, request, or \n        resolution'' after ``petition'' each place it appears.\n\nSEC. 4.
