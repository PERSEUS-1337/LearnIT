SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Federally Impacted \nSchool Improvement Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 1950 Congress recognized its obligation, through the \n        passage of Public Law 81-815, to provide school construction \n        funding for local educational agencies impacted by the presence \n        of Federal activities.\n            (2) The conditions of federally impacted school facilities \n        providing educational programs to children in areas where the \n        Federal Government is present have deteriorated to such an \n        extent that the health and safety of the children served by \n        such agencies is being compromised, and the school conditions \n        have not kept pace with the increase in student population \n        causing classrooms to become severely overcrowded and children \n        to be educated in trailers.\n            (3) Local educational agencies in areas where there exists \n        a significant Federal presence have little if any capacity to \n        raise local funds for purposes of capital construction, \n        renovation and repair due to the nontaxable status of Federal \n        land.\n            (4) The need for renewed support by the Federal Government \n        to help federally connected local educational agencies \n        modernize their school facilities is far greater in 2000 than \n        at any time since 1950.\n            (5) Federally connected local educational agencies and the \n        communities the agencies serve are willing to commit local \n        resources when available to modernize and replace existing \n        facilities, but do not always have the resources available to \n        meet their total facility needs due to the nontaxable presence \n        of the Federal Government.\n            (6) Due to the conditions described in paragraphs (1) \n        through (5) there is in 1999, as there was in 1950, a need for \n        Congress to renew its obligation to assist federally connected \n        local educational agencies with their facility needs.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide matching grants \nto local educational agencies for the modernization of minimum school \nfacilities that are urgently needed because--\n            (1) the existing school facilities of the agency are in \n        such disrepair that the health and safety of the students \n        served by the agency is threatened; and\n            (2) increased enrollment results in a need for additional \n        classroom space.\n\nSEC. 2.
