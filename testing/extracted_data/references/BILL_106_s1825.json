FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Customer bills for telecommunications services are \n        unreasonably complicated, and many Americans are unable to \n        understand the nature of services provided to them and the \n        charges for which they are responsible.\n            (2) One of the purposes of the Telecommunications Act of \n        1996 (Public Law 104-104) was to unleash competitive and market \n        forces for telecommunications services.\n            (3) Unless customers can understand their \n        telecommunications bills they cannot take advantage of the \n        newly competitive market for telecommunications services.\n            (4) Confusing telecommunications bills allow a small \n        minority of providers of telecommunications services to commit \n        fraud more easily. The best defense against telecommunications \n        fraud is a well informed consumer. Consumers cannot be well \n        informed when their telecommunications bills are \n        incomprehensible.\n            (5) Certain providers of telecommunications services have \n        established new, specific charges on customer bills commonly \n        known as ``line-item charges''.\n            (6) These line-item charges have proliferated and are often \n        described with inaccurate and confusing names.\n            (7) These line-item charges have generated significant \n        confusion among customers regarding the nature and scope of \n        universal service and of the fees associated with universal \n        service.\n            (8) The National Association of Regulatory Utility \n        Commissioners adopted a resolution in February 1998 supporting \n        action by the Federal Communications Commission to require \n        interstate telecommunications carriers to provide accurate \n        customer notice regarding the implementation and purpose of \n        end-user charges for telecommunications services.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to require the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to protect \nand empower consumers of telecommunications services by assuring that \ntelecommunications bills, including line-item charges, issued by \ntelecommunications carriers nationwide are both accurate and \ncomprehensible.\n\nSEC. 3. INVESTIGATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER BILLING PRACTICES.\n\n    (a) Investigation.--\n            (1) Requirement.--The Federal Communications Commission and \n        the Federal Trade Commission shall jointly conduct an \n        investigation of the billing practices of telecommunications \n        carriers.\n            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of the investigation is to \n        determine whether the bills sent by telecommunications carriers \n        to their customers accurately assess and correctly characterize \n        the services received and fees charged for such services, \n        including any fees imposed as line-item charges.\n    (b) Determinations.--In carrying out the investigation under \nsubsection (a), the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal \nTrade Commission shall determine the following:\n            (1) The prevalence of incomprehensible or confusing \n        telecommunications bills.\n            (2) The most frequent causes for confusion on \n        telecommunications bills.\n            (3) Whether or not any best practices exist, which, if \n        utilized as an industry standard, would reduce confusion and \n        improve comprehension of telecommunications bills.\n            (4) Whether or not telecommunications bills that impose \n        fees through line-item charges characterize correctly the \n        nature and basis of such fees, including, in particular, \n        whether or not such fees are required by the Federal Government \n        or State governments.\n    (c) Review of Records.--\n            (1) Authority.--For purposes of the investigation under \n        subsection (a), the Federal Communications Commission and the \n        Federal Trade Commission may obtain from any telecommunications \n        carrier any record of such carrier that is relevant to the \n        investigation, including any record supporting such carrier's \n        basis for setting fee levels or percentages.\n            (2) Use.--The Federal Communications Commission and the \n        Federal Trade Commission may use records obtained under this \n        subsection only for purposes of the investigation.\n    (d) Disciplinary Actions.--\n            (1) In general.--If the Federal Communications Commission \n        or the Federal Trade Commission determines as a result of the \n        investigation under subsection (a) that the bills sent by a \n        telecommunications carrier to its customers do not accurately \n        assess or correctly characterize any service or fee contained \n        in such bills, the Federal Communications Commission or the \n        Federal Trade Commission, as the case may be, may take such \n        action against such carrier as such Commission is authorized to \ntake under law.\n            (2) Characterization of fees.--If the Federal \n        Communications Commission or the Federal Trade Commission \n        determines as a result of the investigation under subsection \n        (a) that a telecommunications carrier has characterized a fee \n        on bills sent to its customers as mandated or otherwise \n        required by the Federal Government or a State and that such \n        characterization is incorrect, the Federal Communications \n        Commission or the Federal Trade Commission, as the case may be, \n        may require the carrier to discontinue such characterization.\n            (3) Additional actions.--If the Federal Communications \n        Commission or the Federal Trade Commission determines that such \n        Commission does not have authority under law to take actions \n        under paragraph (1) that would be appropriate in light of a \n        determination described in paragraph (1), the Federal \n        Communications Commission or the Federal Trade Commission, as \n        the case may be, shall notify Congress of the determination \n        under this paragraph in the report under subsection (e).\n    (e) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission and the \nFederal Trade Commissions shall jointly submit to Congress a report on \nthe results of the investigation under subsection (a). The report shall \ninclude the determination, if any, of either Commission under \nsubsection (d)(3) and any recommendations for further legislative \naction that such Commissions consider appropriate.\n\nSEC. 4.
