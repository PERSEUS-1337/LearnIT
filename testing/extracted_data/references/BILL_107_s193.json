FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of Energy and its Office of Science \n        research programs has played an important role in the \n        development of high performance computing, networking, and \n        information technology. These capabilities have been readily \n        accessible to the U.S. scientific community for a diverse set \n        of grand challenge scientific computational problems. \n        Contributions by the Department include pioneering the concept \n        of remote, interactive access to supercomputers (developing the \n        first interactive operating system for supercomputers, \n        establishing the first national supercomputer center); \n        developing the mathematical foundations for high performance \n        computing with numerical linear algebra libraries used \n        worldwide; leading the transition to massively parallel \n        supercomputing by developing software to allow processors to \n        communicate with each other; and contributing to the \n        development of the Internet with software that dramatically \n        speeds up the transmission of messages.\n            (2) The Department of Energy's Office of Science's \n        contributions to networking and information technology have \n        played a key role in its ability to accomplish its statutory \n        mission to promote the basic sciences critical to the Nation's \n        energy future through the development of remote access to its \n        shared computing and experimental facilities. Particular users \n        of the computing facilities have been high energy physicists \n        who model electromagnetic fields and beam dynamics in \n        accelerators, materials scientists who model and design \n        materials using computational techniques, chemists who model \n        the chemical processes involved in combustion, atmospheric \n        scientists who model global climate patterns, geologists who \n        model ground transport of fluids and waste, and biologists who \n        want to predict protein structures. Continued accomplishments \n        in these areas will be needed to continue to carry out future \n        DOE missions.\n            (3) The Department of Energy has unique multi-disciplinary \n        facilities for advancing basic and applied science which \n        include the high energy and nuclear laboratories, neutron \n        sources and synchrotron facilities, and advanced computing and \n        communications facilities such as the National Energy Research \n        Scientific Computing Center, the Advanced Computing Research \n        Facilities, and the Energy Sciences Network. Each facility when \n        networked to share large amounts of scientific data will better \n        be able to advance the fundamental understanding in their \n        respective areas as well as the overall networking and \n        information technology infrastructure for the Nation.\n            (4) Many challenges are associated with modeling complex \n        physical, chemical, and biological phenomena, especially on \n        massively parallel computers with peak speeds in hundreds of \n        teraflops (100 trillion arithmetic operations per second). \n        These challenges include the management and analysis of \n        petabyte-scale data sets. A program to address these challenges \n        will require multi-disciplinary collaborations between \n        theoretical and computational scientists, computer scientists, \n        and applied mathematicians at universities, national \n        laboratories, and industry. Such a program will enhance the \n        ability of DOE to meet its mission goals and advance the state \n        of the art for the U.S. economic and industrial base in the \n        fields of energy, geology, genetics, chemical processing, \n        electronics and transportation.\n            (5) Solving the challenges facing the Department of Energy \n        in developing and using high-performance computing, networking, \n        and information technologies will be of immense value to the \n        Nation. Potential benefits include: reliable prediction of the \n        Earth's climate as well as the performance of energy systems; \n        understanding aging and fatigue effects in materials crucial to \n        energy and transportation systems; promoting energy-efficient \n        chemical production through improved chemical processes, \n        including rational catalyst design; predicting the structure \n        and functions of the proteins coded by DNA and their response \n        to chemical and radiation damage; designing more efficient \n        combustion systems; and understanding turbulent flow in plasmas \n        in energy and advanced materials applications.\n\nSEC. 3.
