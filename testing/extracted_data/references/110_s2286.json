FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which struck the \n        United States in 2005, caused, by some estimates, in excess of \n        $200,000,000,000 in total economic losses;\n            (2) many meteorologists predict that the United States is \n        in a period of increased hurricane activity;\n            (3) the Federal Government and State governments have \n        provided billions of dollars to pay for losses from natural \n        catastrophes, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic \n        eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, droughts, \n        and other natural catastrophes;\n            (4) many Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to \n        obtain and afford property and casualty insurance coverage;\n            (5) some insurers are not renewing insurance policies, are \n        excluding certain risks, such as wind damage, and are \n        increasing rates and deductibles in some markets;\n            (6) the inability of property and business owners in \n        vulnerable areas to obtain and afford property and casualty \n        insurance coverage endangers the national economy and public \n        health and safety;\n            (7) almost every State in the United States is at risk of a \n        natural catastrophe, including hurricanes, earthquakes, \n        volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, \n        droughts, and other natural catastrophes;\n            (8) building codes and land use regulations play an \n        indispensable role in managing catastrophe risks, by preventing \n        building in high risk areas and ensuring that appropriate \n        mitigation efforts are completed where building has taken \n        place;\n            (9) several proposals have been introduced in Congress to \n        address the affordability and availability of natural \n        catastrophe insurance across the United States, but there is no \n        consensus on what, if any, role the Federal Government should \n        play; and\n            (10) an efficient and effective approach to assessing \n        natural catastrophe risk management and insurance is to \n        establish a nonpartisan commission to study the management of \n        natural catastrophe risk, and to require such commission to \n        timely report to Congress on its findings.\n\nSEC. 3.
