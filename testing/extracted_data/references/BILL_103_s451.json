FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) senior citizens are among the most rapidly growing \n        segments of our society;\n            (2) currently, senior citizens comprise 15 percent of our \n        society, and predictions are that by the turn of the century \n        they will constitute 18 percent of our Nation's population;\n            (3) senior citizens find themselves uniquely situated in \n        our society, environmentally and physically;\n            (4) many senior citizens are experiencing increased social \n        isolation due to fragmented and distant familial relations, \n        scattered associations, limited access to transportation, and \n        other insulating factors;\n            (5) physical conditions such as hearing loss, poor \n        eyesight, lessened agility, and chronic and debilitating \n        illnesses often contribute to an older person's susceptibility \n        to criminal victimization;\n            (6) senior citizens are too frequently the victims of abuse \n        and neglect, violent crime, property crime, consumer fraud, \n        medical quackery, and confidence games;\n            (7) studies have found that senior citizens that are \n        victims of violent crime are more likely to be injured and \n        require medical attention than are younger victims;\n            (8) victimization data on crimes against senior citizens \n        are incomplete and out of date, and data sources are partial, \n        scattered, and not easily obtained;\n            (9) although a few studies have attempted to define and \n        estimate the extent of abuse and neglect of senior citizens, \n        both in their homes and in institutional settings, many experts \n        believe that this crime is substantially underreported and \n        undetected;\n            (10) similarly, while some evidence suggests that senior \n        citizens may be targeted in a range of fraudulent schemes, \n        neither the Uniform Crime Report nor the National Crime Survey \n        collects data on individual- or household-level fraud;\n            (11) many law enforcement agencies do not have model \n        practices for responding to the criminal abuse of senior \n        citizens;\n            (12) law enforcement officers and social service providers \n        come from different disciplines and frequently bring different \n        perspectives to the problem of crimes against senior citizens;\n            (13) those differences, in turn, can contribute to \n        inconsistent approaches to the problem and inhibit a genuinely \n        effective response;\n            (14) there are, however, a few efforts currently under way \n        that seek to forge partnerships to coordinate criminal justice \n        and social service approaches to victimization of senior \n        citizens;\n            (15) the Triad program, sponsored by the National Sheriffs' \n        Association (NSA), the International Association of Chiefs of \n        Police (IACP), and the American Association of Retired Persons \n        (AARP), is one such effort; and\n            (16) recognizing that senior citizens have the same \n        fundamental desire as other members of our society to live \n        freely, without fear or restriction due to the criminal \n        element, the Federal Government should seek to expand efforts \n        to reduce crime against this growing and uniquely vulnerable \n        segment of our population.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to support a coordinated effort among law enforcement \n        and social service agencies to stem the tide of violence \n        against senior citizens and support media and nonmedia \n        strategies aimed at increasing both public understanding of the \n        problem and the senior citizens' skills in preventing crime \n        against themselves and their property; and\n            (2) to address the problem of crime against senior citizens \n        in a systematic and effective manner by promoting and expanding \n        collaborative crime prevention programs, such as the Triad \n        model, that assist law enforcement agencies and senior citizens \n        in implementing specific strategies for crime prevention, \n        victim assistance, citizen involvement, and public education.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND DISSEMINATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Director of the National Institute of Justice \nshall conduct a qualitative and quantitative national assessment of--\n            (1) the nature and extent of crimes committed against \n        senior citizens and the effect of such crimes on the victims;\n            (2) the numbers, extent, and impact of violent crimes and \n        nonviolent crimes (such as frauds and ``scams'') against senior \n        citizens and the extent of unreported crime;\n            (3) the collaborative needs of law enforcement, health, and \n        social service organizations, focusing on prevention of crimes \n        against senior citizens, to identify, investigate, and provide \n        assistance to victims of those crimes; and\n            (4) the development and growth of strategies to respond \n        effectively to the matters described in paragraphs (1), (2), \n        and (3).\n    (b) Matters To Be Addressed.--The national assessment made pursuant \nto subsection (a) shall address--\n            (1) the analysis and synthesis of data from a broad range \n        of sources in order to develop accurate information on the \n        nature and extent of crimes against senior citizens, including \n        identifying and conducting such survey and other data \n        collection efforts as are needed and designing a strategy to \n        keep such information current over time;\n            (2) institutional and community responses to elderly \n        victims of crime, focusing on the problems associated with fear \n        of victimization, abuse of senior citizens, and hard-to-reach \n        senior citizens who are in poor health, are living alone or \n        without family nearby, or living in high crime areas;\n            (3) special services and responses required by elderly \n        victims;\n            (4) whether the experience of senior citizens with some \n        service organizations differs markedly from that of younger \n        populations;\n            (5) the kinds of programs that have proven useful in \n        reducing victimization of senior citizens through crime \n        prevention activities and programs;\n            (6) the kinds of programs that contribute to successful \n        coordination among public sector agencies and community \n        organizations in reducing victimization of senior citizens; and\n            (7) the research agenda needed to develop a comprehensive \n        understanding of the problems of crimes against senior \n        citizens, including the changes that can be anticipated in the \n        crimes themselves and appropriate responses as the society \n        increasingly ages.\n    (c) Avoidance of Duplication.--In conducting the assessment under \nsubsection (a), the Director of the National Institute of Justice shall \ndraw upon the findings of existing studies and avoid duplication of \nefforts that have previously been made.\n    (d) Dissemination.--Based on the results of the national assessment \nand analysis of successful or promising strategies in dealing with the \nproblems described in subsection (b) and other problems, including \ncoalition efforts such as the Triad programs described in sections 2 \nand 3, the Director of the National Institute of Justice shall \ndisseminate the results through reports, publications, clearinghouse \nservices, public service announcements, and programs of evaluation, \ndemonstration, training, and technical assistance.\n\nSEC. 5.
