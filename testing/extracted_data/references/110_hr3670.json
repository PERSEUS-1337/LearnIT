FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has experienced a 17 percent decline \n        in overseas visitors since September 11, 2001.\n            (2) Business travel to the United States fell 10 percent \n        from 2004 to 2005 while Europe witnessed an 8 percent increase \n        over this same time period.\n            (3) The United States market share of international travel \n        has declined from 7.5 percent before September 11, 2001, to \n        about 6 percent in 2007.\n            (4) The economic impact of declining United States market \n        share has resulted in 60 million fewer travelers, 194,000 lost \n        jobs, $94 billion in lost spending, and $15.6 billion in lost \n        tax receipts.\n            (5) While in 2007 the United States will spend less than $4 \n        million on international travel promotion, currently Greece \n        spends $151 million, Mexico spends $149 million, Australia \n        spends $113 million, the United Kingdom spends $80 million, and \n        Canada spends $60 million.\n            (6) In a recent survey by the Discover America Partnership, \n        international travelers ranked the United States as having the \n        ``world's worst'' entry process, and 66 percent of travelers in \n        the survey feared that a simple mistake could lead to being \n        detained for hours or worse.\n            (7) The perception around the world is that the United \n        States does not welcome international visitors, but that \n        perception could be changed by adopting an international travel \n        promotion program.\n            (8) An international travel promotion program can expect a \n        6:1 return on investment.\n            (9) An international travel promotion program can be an \n        effective tool to enhance the United States public diplomacy \n        efforts.\n\nSEC. 3.
