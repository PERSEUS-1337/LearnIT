FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the quality of our Nation's transportation \n        infrastructure and the efficient movement of people and goods \n        are directly linked to our Nation's economic productivity and \n        competitiveness;\n            (2) our Nation's trading partners, with whom we compete in \n        the global economy, have invested substantial amounts of their \n        resources into capital infrastructure investment and currently \n        enjoy productivity growth rates that are more than triple the \n        United States growth rate;\n            (3) to compete in the global marketplace of the 1990's, the \n        United States must substantially increase its level of \n        infrastructure investment as soon as possible;\n            (4) by allowing infrastructure investment to drop from 2.4 \n        percent of the gross national product in the late 1960's to \n        less than 0.3 percent in the 1980's, our Nation has neglected \n        the foundation of economic growth; and\n            (5) without a substantial influx of new capital, \n        infrastructure investment will not be able to keep pace with \n        the rapid rate of infrastructure decay that will result in \n        crumbling roads, increasing traffic congestion, higher costs, \n        and inadequate transit systems.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) Issuance of bonds to finance massive capital \n        infrastructure reinvestment immediately.\n            (2) Creation of thousands of productive new jobs by \n        initiating new rehabilitation and construction projects.\n            (3) Stimulation of the economy and creation of economic \n        growth by increasing the efficiency of our Nation's \n        infrastructure and investment in its long-term maintenance.\n            (4) Complementing the purposes of the Intermodal Surface \n        Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 by creating a new \n        financing mechanism to provide a more immediate source of \n        funds.\n\nSEC. 3. INFRASTRUCTURE REINVESTMENT FUND.\n\n    (a) Revenues From Highway Trust Fund.--Subsection (c) of section \n9503 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to Highway Trust \nFund) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new \nparagraph:\n            ``(7) Infrastructure reinvestment fund.--The Secretary \n        shall pay from time to time from the Highway Trust Fund into \n        the Infrastructure Reinvestment Fund amounts (as determined by \n        him) equivalent to 2.5 cents per gallon of the taxes imposed by \n        sections 4041(a) and 4081 which are received after September \n        30, 1994, and before October 1, 2024.''.\n    (b) Infrastructure Reinvestment Fund.--\n            (1) In general.--Subchapter A of chapter 98 of such Code \n        (relating to trust fund code) is amended by adding at the end \n        thereof the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 9512.
