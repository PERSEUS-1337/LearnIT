FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Langston Golf Course, Rock Creek Golf Course, and East \n        Potomac Golf Course are owned by the United States and are \n        under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park \n        Service, and each golf course has a long history of service to \n        the general public as an integral part of the nation's capital, \n        including services to local and regional residents, visitors, \n        and tourists.\n            (2) East Potomac Golf Course was opened in 1920 with three \n        courses to accommodate all levels of play, including an 18-hole \n        tournament level course and two 9-hole practice courses, and \n        was initially segregated, with African-Americans only permitted \n        to play on Mondays.\n            (3) Rock Creek Golf Course opened in 1923 as a 9-hole \n        course, and in 1925 the course was completed as an 18-hole \n        tournament level course. This course was located in Rock Creek \n        Park, a major recreation and picnic facility for residents.\n            (4) Langston Golf Course opened in 1939 as a segregated \n        golf facility for African-Americans, is listed in the National \n        Register of Historic Places, and has been the home course of \n        both the Royal Golf Club and the Wake Robin Golf Club, the \n        nation's first clubs for African-American men and women, \n        respectively. The golf course was named for John Mercer \n        Langston, the first African-American Congressman from Virginia, \n        elected in 1888.\n            (5) Unlike other National Park Service facilities, golf \n        courses require unique capital investments to keep them \n        maintained and operational.\n            (6) The National Park Service has continuously struggled to \n        manage and maintain each of these three courses.\n            (7) Concession restrictions do not generate sufficient \n        revenue for the National Park Service or concessionaires to \n        provide affordable recreation while properly maintaining and \n        making the capital investments required for golf courses today.\n            (8) Each of the three courses contains valuable historic \n        components that must be maintained.\n            (9) Concessions restrictions will continue to cause \n        deterioration, disrepair, and limited public use, reducing the \n        quality of play and jeopardizing the historic preservation of \n        the courses.\n            (10) These courses together constitute an undervalued and \n        underused asset that can be maintained and modernized as \n        affordable facilities for use by the general public if an \n        appropriate lease arrangement is used that encourages private \n        investment in keeping with the existing Federal procedures.\n            (11) The National Park Service recently issued a request \n        for bids for continued concession operation of the Langston and \n        Rock Creek Golf Courses under one concession contract for seven \n        years; however, the capital improvement necessary to maintain \n        and modernize the courses and to prevent their deterioration is \n        not possible using a traditional concession contract.\n            (12) A long-term lease for the three courses together, \n        designed outside of the constraints of concession law, will \n        encourage private investment in these courses, improve and \n        modernize the courses, ensure affordable play, and preserve the \n        historic nature of them.\n\nSEC. 3.
