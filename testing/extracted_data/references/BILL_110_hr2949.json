FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There has been established in the District of Columbia \n        a private, nonprofit corporation known as the Eurasia \n        Foundation (hereafter in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Foundation''), which is not an agency or establishment of the \n        United States Government.\n            (2) In recognition of the valuable contributions of the \n        Foundation to long-range United States foreign policy \n        interests, the United States Government has, through the United \n        States Agency for International Development and the Department \n        of State, provided financial support for the Foundation.\n            (3) It is in the interest of the United States, and the \n        further strengthening of cooperation with the countries of \n        Eurasia, to establish a more permanent mechanism for United \n        States Government financial support for the ongoing activities \n        of the Foundation, while preserving the independent character \n        of the Foundation.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Foundation are--\n            (1) to promote civil society, private enterprise, and sound \n        public administration and policy in the countries of Eurasia \n        and in lending encouragement and assistance to citizens of such \n        countries in their own efforts to develop more open, just, and \n        democratic societies;\n            (2) to strengthen indigenous institutions that foster \n        national development, constructive social change, equitable \n        economic growth, and cooperative international relationships \n        that are fully consistent with and supportive of long-term \n        United States interests with respect to the countries of \n        Eurasia; and\n            (3) to conduct programs in response to initiatives in the \n        countries of Eurasia that would be difficult or impossible for \n        an official United States entity, and, as a result of its \n        position in the countries of Eurasia, to respond quickly and \n        flexibly to meet new opportunities.\n\nSEC. 3.
