FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Significant quantities of rare earths are used in the \n        production of clean energy technologies, including advanced \n        automotive propulsion batteries, electric motors, high-\n        efficiency light bulbs, solar panels, and wind turbines. These \n        technologies are used to advance the United States energy \n        policy of reducing dependence on foreign oil and decreasing \n        greenhouse gas emissions through expansion of cleaner sources \n        of energy.\n            (2) Many modern defense technologies such as radar and \n        sonar systems, precision-guided weapons, cruise missiles, and \n        lasers cannot be built, as designed and specified, without the \n        use of rare earths and materials produced from them.\n            (3) Rare earths also provide core functionality to a \n        variety of high technology applications in computing, pollution \n        abatement, power generation, water treatment, oil refining, \n        metal alloying, communications, health care, agriculture, and \n        other sectors.\n            (4) Though at least 15 percent of the world's rare earth \n        reserves are located within the United States, the country now \n        depends upon imports for nearly 100 percent of its rare earth \n        needs because there are virtually no active rare earth \n        producers in the United States. More than 97 percent of all \n        rare earths for world consumption are produced in China.\n            (5) The ability--and willingness--of China to export rare \n        earths is eroding due to its growing domestic demand, its \n        enforcement of environmental law on current producers, and its \n        mandate to consolidate the industry by decreasing its number of \n        mining permits. The Chinese Ministry of Industry and \n        Information Technology draft rare earths plan for 2009 to 2015 \n        proposes an immediate ban on the export of dysprosium, terbium, \n        thulium, lutetium, and yttrium, the so-called ``heavy'' rare \n        earths, and a restriction on the exports of all other, light, \n        rare earth metals to a level well below that sufficient to \n        satisfy the demand of Japan in 2008 alone for such metals.\n            (6) Furthermore, the United States has limited rare earth \n        production, remains entirely dependent on overseas refineries \n        for further elemental and alloy processing, and does not \n        currently maintain a ``strategic reserve'' of rare earth \n        compounds, metals, or alloys.\n            (7) Rare earths should qualify as materials either \n        strategic or critical to national security. The United States \n        Government should facilitate the domestic reintroduction of a \n        globally competitive rare earth industry that is self-\n        sufficient in the United States domestic market with multiple \n        sources of mining, processing, alloying, and manufacturing.\n            (8) This self-sufficiency requires an uninterrupted supply \n        of strategic materials critical to national security and \n        innovative commercial product development, including rare \n        earths, to support the clean energy and defense supply chains.\n            (9) The United States currently cannot reclaim valuable \n        rare earths and permanent magnets from scrapped military or \n        consumer products, industrial materials or equipment, which \n        allows entities in other countries to identify and recover such \n        materials for resale to United States manufacturers at \n        considerable cost.\n            (10) There is an urgent need to identify the current global \n        market situation regarding rare earths, the strategic value \n        placed on them by foreign nations including China, and the \n        supply-chain vulnerabilities related to rare earths and \n        products containing rare earths.\n\nSEC. 3.
