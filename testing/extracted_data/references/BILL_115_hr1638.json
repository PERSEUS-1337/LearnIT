FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Iran is characterized by high levels of official and \n        institutional corruption, and substantial involvement by Iran's \n        security forces, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard \n        Corps (IRGC), in the economy.\n            (2) Many members of Iran's senior political and military \n        leadership have acquired significant personal and institutional \n        wealth by using their positions to secure control of \n        significant portions of Iran's national economy.\n            (3) Sanctions relief provided through the Joint \n        Comprehensive Plan of Action has resulted in the removal of \n        many Iranian entities that are tied to governmental corruption \n        from the list of entities sanctioned by the United States.\n            (4) The Department of Treasury in 2011 designated the \n        Islamic Republic of Iran's financial sector as a jurisdiction \n        of primary money laundering concern under section 311 of the \n        USA PATRIOT Act, stating ``Treasury has for the first time \n        identified the entire Iranian financial sector; including \n        Iran's Central Bank, private Iranian banks, and branches, and \n        subsidiaries of Iranian banks operating outside of Iran as \n        posing illicit finance risks for the global financial \n        system.''.\n            (5) Iran continues to be listed by the Financial Action \n        Task Force (FATF) among the ``Non-Cooperative Countries or \n        Territories''--countries which it perceived to be non-\n        cooperative in the global fight against terror finance and \n        money laundering.\n            (6) Iran and North Korea are the only countries listed by \n        the FATF as ``Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories'' \n        against which FATF countries should take measures.\n            (7) The Transparency International index of perceived \n        public corruption ranks Iran 130th out of 168 countries \n        surveyed.\n            (8) The State Department identified Iran as a ``major \n        money-laundering country'' in its International Narcotics \n        Control Strategy Report (INCSR) for 2016.\n            (9) The State Department currently identifies Iran, along \n        with Sudan and Syria, as a state sponsor of terrorism, ``having \n        repeatedly provided support for acts of international \n        terrorism''.\n            (10) The State Department's ``Country Reports on \n        Terrorism'', published last in July 2017, noted that ``Iran \n        continued to sponsor terrorist groups around the world, \n        principally through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods \n        Force (IRGC-QF). These groups included Lebanese Hizballah, \n        several Iraqi Shia militant groups, Hamas, and Palestine \n        Islamic Jihad. Iran, Hizballah, and other Shia militia \n        continued to provide support to the Asad regime, dramatically \n        bolstering its capabilities, prolonging the civil war in Syria, \n        and worsening the human rights and refugee crisis there.''.\n            (11) The Iranian Government's tolerance of corruption and \n        nepotism in business limits opportunities for foreign and \n        domestic investment, particularly given the significant \n        involvement of the IRGC in many sectors of Iran's economy.\n            (12) The IRGC and the leadership-controlled bonyads \n        (foundations) control an estimated one-third of Iran's total \n        economy, including large portions of Iran's telecommunications, \n        construction, and airport and port operations. These operations \n        give the IRGC and bonyads vast funds to support terrorist \n        organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas.\n            (13) By gaining control of major economic sectors, the IRGC \n        and bonyads have also served to further disadvantage the \n        average Iranian.\n\nSEC. 3.
