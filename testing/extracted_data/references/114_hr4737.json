FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The people of the States created the national \n        government when they delegated to it those enumerated \n        governmental powers relating to matters beyond the competence \n        of the individual States. All other sovereign powers, save \n        those expressly prohibited the States by the Constitution, are \n        reserved to the States or the people.\n            (2) In most areas of governmental concern, the States \n        uniquely possess the constitutional authority, the resources, \n        and the competence to discern the sentiments of the people and \n        to govern accordingly.\n            (3) Our constitutional system encourages a healthy \n        diversity in the public policies adopted by the people of the \n        several States according to their own conditions, needs, and \n        desires. Individual States and communities are free to \n        experiment with a variety of approaches to public issues. One-\n        size-fits-all approaches to public policy problems can inhibit \n        the creation of effective solutions to problems.\n            (4) Federal action limiting the policymaking discretion of \n        the States should be taken only where constitutional and \n        statutory authority for the action is clear and certain and the \n        national activity is necessitated by the presence of a problem \n        of national scope.\n            (5) Federal agencies must recognize the distinction between \n        problems of national scope (which may justify Federal action) \n        and problems that are merely common to the States (which will \n        not justify Federal action because individual States, acting \n        individually or together, can effectively deal with them).\n            (6) On March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Consumer Financial \n        Protection released an outline of proposals under consideration \n        for potential rulemakings for ``payday, vehicle title, and \n        similar loans''.\n            (7) The Bureau acknowledged that ``markets for payday, \n        vehicle title, and similar loans are regulated by a variety of \n        state laws, as well as some tribal and municipal laws''. The \n        Bureau specifically acknowledged that ``Some jurisdictions have \n        imposed usury limits that prohibit lenders from offering high-\n        cost credit. In other jurisdictions, certain products are \n        specifically authorized by state laws, often crafted as \n        exceptions to general state credit regulation, including \n        consumer loan laws and general usury limits. Some of the states \n        authorizing these products have sought to regulate loan \n        structures and lender practices in a variety of ways, including \n        limiting permissible costs, restricting reborrowing in certain \n        circumstances, or setting a maximum ratio for the amount of \n        debt on such loans to gross monthly income. States, tribes, and \n        local governments also impose a variety of licensure \n        requirements on lenders engaged in payday and vehicle title \n        lending.''. This variation in State, local, and tribal law \n        suggests a healthy, dynamic, legal environment in which the \n        democratically elected representatives in each jurisdiction \n        respond appropriately to the particular conditions, needs, and \n        desires of their constituents.\n            (8) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Director of the \n        Bureau seeks to ``establish a federal floor for consumer \n        protection for covered loans'', thus substituting the \n        Director's own judgment for that of State, tribal, and local \n        governments.\n            (9) The Bureau made no showing that any State or tribal \n        government lacks the legal authority to enact laws or \n        regulations that are substantially similar to the Bureau's \n        outline of proposals.\n            (10) The Bureau made no showing that any State or tribal \n        government is incapable of protecting its citizens from \n        potential risks associated with using payday, vehicle title, \n        and similar loans.\n            (11) The Bureau's proposals, if implemented, would be an \n        unwarranted infringement of State and tribal sovereignty and a \n        violation of fundamental federalist principles designed to \n        secure the liberty of the American people.\n\nSEC. 3. MORATORIUM.\n\n    (a) Prohibition on Payday Loans, Vehicle Title Loans, and Other \nSimilar Loan Regulations.--The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection \nmay not issue or enforce any rule or regulation with respect to payday \nloans, vehicle title loans, or other similar loans during the 24-month \nperiod beginning on the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Payday Loan.--For purposes of this section the term ``payday \nloan'' means a loan described under section 1024(a)(1)(E) of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1)(E)).\n\nSEC. 4. PROTECTING STATE AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENT SOVEREIGNTY.\n\n    Section 1022(b) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 \n(12 U.S.C. 5512(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(5) Protecting state and tribal government sovereignty \n        with respect to payday loans, vehicle title loans, and other \n        similar loans.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other \n                provision of law, the Bureau may not issue any final \n                rule or regulation to regulate payday loans, vehicle \n                title loans, or other similar loans, unless the Bureau \n                first--\n                            ``(i) consults with appropriate State, \n                        tribal, and local officials in each \n                        jurisdiction that may be affected by the rule \n                        regarding the effect of the rule on State, \n                        tribal, or local sovereignty, laws, \n                        regulations, and citizens;\n                            ``(ii) carries out a study that--\n                                    ``(I) examines the Bureau's \n                                constitutional and statutory authority \n                                to preempt State, tribal, and local \n                                laws and regulations;\n                                    ``(II) examines the effect the rule \n                                or regulation will have on the laws and \n                                regulations of individual States, \n                                federally recognized Indian tribes, and \n                                municipalities;
