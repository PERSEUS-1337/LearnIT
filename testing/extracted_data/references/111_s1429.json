FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since October 2001, approximately 1,640,000 members of \n        the Armed Forces have been deployed as part of Operation \n        Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n            (2) 300,000 members of the Armed Forces are suffering from \n        major depression or post traumatic stress because of service in \n        Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n            (3) 320,000 of the members of the Armed Forces who served \n        in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom, or 19 \n        percent of such members, have received brain injuries from such \n        service.\n            (4) Only 43 percent of members of the Armed Forces with a \n        probable traumatic brain injury have reported receiving a \n        medical evaluation for their head injury.\n            (5) Records of the Department of Veterans Affairs show that \n        120,000 members of the Armed Forces who are no longer on active \n        duty have been diagnosed with mental health problems, \n        approximately half of whom suffer from post traumatic stress \n        disorder (PTSD).\n            (6) In the last year, only 53 percent of those members of \n        the Armed Forces with post traumatic stress disorder or \n        depression have sought professional help from a mental health \n        care provider.\n            (7) Rates of post traumatic stress disorder and depression \n        are highest among members of the Armed Forces who are women or \n        members of the Reserves.\n            (8) Efforts to improve access to quality mental health care \n        are integral to supporting and treating both active duty \n        members of the Armed Forces and veterans.\n            (9) Without quality mental health care, members of the \n        Armed Forces and veterans may experience lower work \n        productivity, which negatively affects their physical health, \n        mental health, and family and social relationships.\n            (10) Cultural and personal stigmas are factors that \n        contribute to low rates of veterans of Operation Enduring \n        Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom who seek mental health care \n        from qualified mental health care providers.\n            (11) The capacity of mental health care providers and \n        access to such providers must be improved to meet the needs of \n        members of the Armed Forces who are returning from deployment \n        in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n            (12) Community-based providers of mental health care are \n        invaluable assets in addressing the needs of such members and \n        should not be overlooked.\n            (13) Coordination of care among government agencies as well \n        as nongovernmental agencies is integral to the successful \n        treatment of members of the Armed Forces returning from \n        deployment.\n\nSEC. 3.
