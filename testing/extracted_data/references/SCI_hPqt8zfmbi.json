    "content": "This paper presents a system for immersive visualization of Non-Euclidean spaces using real-time ray tracing. It exploits the capabilities of the new generation of GPU\u2019s based on the NVIDIA\u2019s Turing architecture in order to develop new methods for intuitive exploration of landscapes featuring non-trivial geometry and topology in virtual reality."
