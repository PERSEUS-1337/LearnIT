    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Jefferson National Expansion Memorial was conceived \n        in the 1930s to preserve St. Louis's role as the ``Gateway to \n        the West''. Land was acquired, competitions were held, the \n        renowned Arch was completed on October 28, 1965, and the Arch \n        itself was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 28, \n        1987.\n            (2) The original purpose of the Memorial, as described in \n        President Roosevelt's 1935 Executive Order and later in the \n        Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Act of 1954, was to \n        commemorate the past, and especially, to keep alive the daring \n        and spirit that moved pioneers to press westward before and \n        after the consummation of the Louisiana Purchase and the \n        historic role of the rivers and St. Louis in westward \n        expansion.\n            (3) To fully realize the true promise and significance of \n        the Memorial and its Landmark, the Arch, the Memorial should \n        connect with and be more accessible to the urban population and \n        the river and commemorate the pioneering spirit of migration \n        throughout the Nation by providing a visitor experience that \n        includes educational, instructional, and research programs, \n        facilities, and technology demonstrating--\n                    (A) the broad diversity of migrants;\n                    (B) the policies and conditions that produced \n                migration;\n                    (C) the impact of migration on the political, \n                economic, social, and architectural development of the \n                Nation; and\n                    (D) a focus on African-American migration patterns \n                from slavery to the underground railroad, and \n                especially the migration of African-Americans from the \n                south to northern industrial cities.\n            (4) The project described in paragraph (3) should be \n        completed by October 28, 2015, the 50th anniversary of the \n        completion of the Arch, so that the area will be available to \n        better engage the American public when the Centennial of the \n        National Park Service is celebrated in 2016.\n            (5) The Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Act of 1954, \n        which authorized the construction of the Jefferson National \n        Expansion Memorial and directed the Secretary to construct the \n        Memorial in accordance with the Eero Saarinen's winning design \n        for the development and construction of the Memorial, \n        recognized the importance of highly visible cultural facilities \n        and other attractions on the grounds of the Memorial to its \n        central purpose of promoting the connection and significance of \n        the historic St. Louis riverfront to the rest of the region, \n        and in turn, the region to the Nation.\n            (6) The Museum of Westward Expansion should be \n        significantly improved before the Centennial of the National \n        Park Service is celebrated in 2016.\n\nSEC. 2.
