FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) the framers of our Constitution, recognizing \n        participation in government and freedom of speech as \n        inalienable rights essential to the survival of democracy, \n        secured their protection through the First Amendment to the \n        United States Constitution;\n            (2) the communications, information, opinions, reports, \n        testimony, claims and arguments that individuals, organizations \n        and businesses provide to the government are essential to wise \n        government decisions and public policy, the public health, \n        safety, and welfare, effective law enforcement, the efficient \n        operation of government programs, the credibility and trust \n        afforded government, and the continuation of America's \n        representative democracy;\n            (3) civil lawsuits and counterclaims, often claiming \n        millions of dollars in damages, have been and are being filed \n        against thousands of individuals, organizations, and businesses \n        based upon their valid exercise of the rights to petition or \n        free speech, including seeking relief, influencing action, \n        informing, communicating, and otherwise participating with \n        government, the electorate, or in matters of public interest;\n            (4) such lawsuits, called Strategic Lawsuits Against Public \n        Participation or SLAPPs, are often ultimately dismissed as \n        groundless or unconstitutional, but not before the defendants \n        are put to great expense, harassment, and interruption of their \n        productive activities;\n            (5) it is in the public interest for individuals, \n        organizations and businesses to participate in matters of \n        public concern and provide information to public entities and \n        other citizens on public issues that affect them without fear \n        of reprisal through abuse of the judicial process;\n            (6) the threat of financial liability, litigation costs, \n        destruction of one's business, loss of one's home, and other \n        personal losses from groundless lawsuits seriously impacts \n        government, interstate commerce, and individual rights by \n        significantly chilling public participation in government, \n        public issues, and in voluntary service;\n            (7) SLAPPs are an abuse of the judicial process that waste \n        judicial resources and clog the already over-burdened court \n        dockets;\n            (8) while some courts and State legislatures have \n        recognized and discouraged SLAPPs, protection against SLAPPs \n        has not been uniform or comprehensive; and\n            (9) some SLAPP victims are deprived of the relief to which \n        they are entitled because the current bankruptcy law allows for \n        the discharge of fees, costs and damages awarded against a \n        party for maintaining a SLAPP.\n\nSEC. 3. IMMUNITY FOR PETITION ACTIVITY.\n\n    (a) Immunity.--Any act of petitioning the government made without \nknowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of falsity shall be immune \nfrom civil liability.\n    (b) Burden and Standard of Proof.--A plaintiff must prove knowledge \nof falsity or reckless disregard of falsity by clear and convincing \nevidence.\n\nSEC. 4.

If the moving \nparty meets this burden, the burden shifts to the responding party to \ndemonstrate that the claim is both legally sufficient and supported by \na sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable \njudgment.\n    (c) Stay of Discovery.--Upon the filing of a special motion to \ndismiss, discovery proceedings in the action shall be stayed until \nnotice of entry of an order disposing of the motion, except that the \ncourt, on noticed motion and for good cause shown, may order that \nspecified discovery be conducted.\n    (d) Expedited Hearing.--The court shall hold an expedited hearing \non the special motion to dismiss, and issue a ruling as soon as \npracticable after the hearing. The parties may submit the pleadings and \naffidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is \nbased. The court shall explain the reasons for its grant or denial of \nthe motion in a statement for the record. If the special motion to \ndismiss is granted, dismissal shall be with prejudice.\n    (e) Immediate Appeal.--The defendant shall have a right of \nimmediate appeal from a district court order denying a special motion \nto dismiss in whole or in part.\n\nSEC. 6. FEDERAL REMOVAL JURISDICTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--A civil action commenced in a State court against \nany person who asserts as a defense the immunity provided for in \nsection 3 of this Act, or asserts that the action arises from an act in \nfurtherance of the constitutional right of petition or free speech, may \nbe removed by the defendant to the district court of the United States \nfor the district and division embracing the place wherein it is \npending.\n    (b) Remand of Remaining Claims.--A court exercising jurisdiction \nunder this section shall remand any claims against which the special \nmotion to dismiss has been denied, as well as any remaining claims \nagainst which a special motion to dismiss was not brought, to the State \ncourt from which it was removed.\n    (c) Timing.--A court exercising jurisdiction under this section \nshall remand an action if a special motion to dismiss is not filed \nwithin 15 days after removal.\n\nSEC. 7.

If this burden is met, \nthe burden shifts to the plaintiff in the underlying action to \ndemonstrate that the underlying claim is both legally sufficient and \nsupported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a \nfavorable judgment. This standard shall apply only to a special motion \nto quash brought under this section.\n\nSEC. 8.
