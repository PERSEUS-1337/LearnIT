FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The American Hospital Association reported in July 2007 \n        that United States hospitals need approximately 116,000 \n        registered nurses to fill vacant positions nationwide.\n            (2) To address the shortage of qualified nurses, schools of \n        nursing have developed accelerated, second-baccalaureate degree \n        programs in nursing. In 2005, these programs graduated 3,769 \n        students. The number of accelerated degree graduates in 2006 \n        was 5,236. This is an additional 1,467 nursing graduates in 1 \n        year.\n            (3) Despite the nurse shortage and efforts to increase the \n        pool of qualified nurses, schools of nursing struggle to \n        increase student capacity. According to the American \n        Association of Colleges of Nursing (referred to in this Act as \n        the ``AACN''), United States nursing schools turned away nearly \n        43,000 qualified applicants in 2006 primarily due to an \n        insufficient number of faculty.\n            (4) The AACN reported in July 2006, a total of 637 faculty \n        vacancies at 329 nursing schools with baccalaureate or graduate \n        programs, or both, across the Nation. Besides the vacancies, \n        schools cited the need to create an additional 55 faculty \n        positions to accommodate student demand. Most of the vacancies \n        (53.7 percent) were faculty positions requiring a doctoral \n        degree.\n            (5) In 2007, the Association of Academic Health Centers \n        surveyed chief executive officers (CEOs) from academic health \n        centers regarding faculty shortages across various health \n        professions. The CEOs rated the nursing faculty shortage as the \n        most severe of all health professions with 81 percent noting \n        the nursing faculty shortage as a problem.\n            (6) The average ages of doctorally-prepared nurse faculty \n        holding the ranks of professor, associate professor, and \n        assistant professor are 58.6, 55.8, and 51.6 years, \n        respectively. Considering the average age of nurse faculty at \n        retirement is 62.5 years, a wave of nurse faculty retirements \n        is expected in the next decade.\n            (7) Master's and doctoral programs in nursing are not \n        producing a large enough pool of potential nurse educators to \n        meet the demand. In 2006, the AACN found that graduations from \n        doctoral nursing programs were up by only 1.4 percent from the \n        previous academic year.\n            (8) Nurses are vital to the Nation's health care delivery \n        system. Due to the nurse shortage, patient safety and quality \n        of care are at risk. Given the findings described in paragraphs \n        (1) through (7), measures must be taken to address the nurse \n        shortage and nursing faculty shortage.\n\nSEC. 3. NURSING STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM.\n\n    Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 296 et seq.) \nis amended--\n            (1) in section 835(b)(4), by inserting ``(including a \n        student in an accelerated nursing degree program who is \n        pursuing a second baccalaureate degree or a master's degree as \n        an entry level nursing degree)'' after ``graduate degree in \n        nursing''; and\n            (2) in section 836--\n                    (A) in subsection (a)--\n                            (i) by striking ``$2,500'' and inserting \n                        ``$4,400'';\n                            (ii) by striking ``$4,000'' and inserting \n                        ``$7,000''; and\n                            (iii) by striking ``$13,000'' and inserting \n                        ``$22,900''; and\n                    (B) in subsection (b)--\n                            (i) in paragraph (1), by inserting \n                        ``(including a student in an accelerated \n                        nursing degree program who is pursuing a second \n                        baccalaureate degree or a master's degree as an \n                        entry level nursing degree)'' after ``graduate \n                        degree in nursing''; and\n                            (ii) in paragraph (2), by inserting \n                        ``(including a student in an accelerated \n                        nursing degree program who is pursuing a second \n                        baccalaureate degree)'' after ``equivalent \n                        degree''.\n\nSEC. 4. ACCELERATED NURSING DEGREE PROGRAMS.\n\n    Section 801(3) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 296(3)) \nis amended by inserting ``(including an accelerated nursing degree \nprogram)'' before ``and including''.\n\nSEC. 5. ADVANCED EDUCATION NURSING GRANTS.\n\n    Section 811(f)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n296j(f)(2)) is amended by striking the period at the end and inserting \n``, except in the case of a nurse faculty shortage, the Secretary may, \nin the Secretary's discretion, obligate more than 10 percent of such \ntraineeships for individuals in doctoral degree programs.''.\n\nSEC. 6.
