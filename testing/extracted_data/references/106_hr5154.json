FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) in an interview with ABC News on September 3, 2000, \n        Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater stated that he thinks \n        there should be a law requiring that the United States be \n        immediately notified of a foreign recall, ``especially in the \n        global economy when you've got U.S. goods really being used by \n        individuals around the world. We should know when there's a \n        problem someplace else.'';\n            (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, there is no \n        legal requirement for manufacturers of motor vehicles and their \n        components to notify United States agencies of a recall issued \n        in a foreign country;\n            (3) between August 1999 and spring 2000, Ford Motor Company \n        replaced Firestone tires on 46,912 vehicles in Saudi Arabia, \n        Thailand, Malaysia, and South America;\n            (4)(A) on May 2, 2000, the National Highway Traffic Safety \n        Administration opened a preliminary evaluation into Firestone \n        ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness AT tires after receiving 90 \n        complaints, primarily from consumers in the Southeast and \n        Southwest, about tread separations or blowouts;\n            (B) as of September 2000, the National Highway Traffic \n        Safety Administration has received over 1,400 complaints, \n        including reports of more than 250 injuries and 88 deaths; and\n            (C) some of the complaints date back to the early 1990s, \n        and 797 of the complaints report that a tire failure took place \n        between August 1, 1999, and August 9, 2000; and\n            (5)(A) on August 9, 2000, Bridgestone/Firestone announced a \n        United States recall of 6,500,000 ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness \n        AT tires; and\n            (B) that date was 3 months after the National Highway \n        Traffic Safety Administration commenced its investigation and \n        nearly 9 months after Ford Motor Company initiated the \n        replacement of the tires in foreign countries.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that defects in \nmotor vehicles or replacement equipment in foreign countries are \nquickly, accurately, and truthfully reported to the United States \nSecretary of Transportation in cases in which--\n            (1) the motor vehicles or replacement equipment is \n        manufactured for export to the United States; or\n            (2) the motor vehicles or replacement equipment is \n        manufactured in the United States using a manufacturing process \n        that is the same as, or similar to, the manufacturing process \n        used in the foreign country, with the result that the motor \n        vehicles or replacement equipment manufactured in the United \n        States may also be defective.\n\nSEC. 3. CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES IN CONNECTION WITH REPORTING OF \n              DEFECTS IN FOREIGN MOTOR VEHICLE PRODUCTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 47 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 1036.
