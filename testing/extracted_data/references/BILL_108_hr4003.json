FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Recent studies by the Center for the Study of Social \n        Policy, Casey Family Programs, and the Packard Foundation \n        demonstrate that many of the 20,000 children aging out of \n        foster care each year face unique challenges as they enter the \n        adult world: a greater likelihood of becoming teen parents, \n        dependence on public assistance, participation in substance \n        abuse, homelessness, and involvement with the criminal justice \n        system compared to youth in the general population.\n            (2) According to a study of foster care children in \n        Washington State, a child who enters foster care is likely to \n        have poorer academic outcomes than children not in foster care, \n        even after controlling for a variety of factors such as \n        poverty.\n            (3) A follow-up study in Wisconsin found that 37 percent of \n        youth had not completed their high school education when \n        interviewed 12 to 18 months after discharge from foster care.\n            (4) A study of African American males in the Ohio foster \n        care system found that in the sixth grade, African American \n        males in foster care had significantly lower scores than 1 or \n        more of the 4 comparison groups (all students, all African \n        American students, all male students, all African American male \n        students).\n            (5) By the ninth grade, the African American males in \n        foster care had significantly lower scores than all of the \n        comparison groups.\n            (6) These youth in foster care are less likely to be \n        enrolled in college preparatory classes and are more than twice \n        as likely as non-foster care youth (37 percent vs. 16 percent) \n        to have dropped out of high school.\n            (7) A 2002 report issued by the Child Welfare League of \n        America (CWLA) found that more than 26 percent of foster \n        children have repeated a grade at least once since the seventh \n        grade; 60 percent have failed a class in the previous year; \n        over a third were below grade level in written language, math \n        and readings; foster youth have higher absentee and tardy rates \n        than their non-foster peers.\n            (8) A report from Casey Family Programs indicated that, \n        nationwide, fewer than 27 percent of foster youth who graduated \n        high school went on to college as compared to 52 percent of the \n        general population.\n            (9) A May 2002, report issued by the University of \n        California at Berkeley found that of more than 3200 foster care \n        youth who attended a community college from 1992 through 2000, \n        39 percent earned between 1 and 17 credits. Forty percent of \n        the foster care youth earned no credits. Many did not attempt \n        to take classes for credit, but rather were enrolled in \n        remedial or other non-credit classes.\n\nSEC. 3.
