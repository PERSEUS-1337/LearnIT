FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the growth of commerce in northern New England is \n        hampered by a decaying rail infrastructure;\n            (2) during the 5-year period beginning on the date of \n        enactment of this Act, international trade shipping is \n        projected to increase by more than 20 percent;\n            (3) in the shipping industry, there is a widespread \n        international trend for shippers to use only ports with double-\n        stack rail access;\n            (4) aging rail lines and constricted passage in older \n        industrial States are--\n                    (A) limiting the movement of cargo and individuals \n                throughout that area; and\n                    (B) restricting access to deepwater ports; and\n            (5) improving rail lines and double-stack freight rail \n        passage to allow rail connections to and through other States \n        and provinces will enable the economy of the older industrial \n        region to grow and prosper by bringing new industry into the \n        region that will result in growth in high wage jobs.\n\nSEC. 3.
