FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In 2000, the Secretary of Commerce declared the Pacific \n        Coast Groundfish Fishery a Federal fisheries disaster due to \n        low stock abundance of groundfish and an overcapitalized fleet.\n            (2) In 2003, section 212 of the Department of Commerce and \n        Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003 (title II of division \n        B of Public Law 108-7; 117 Stat. 80) was enacted to require \n        establishment of a Pacific Coast groundfish fishery buyback \n        program to remove excess fishing capacity from the groundfish, \n        crab, and shrimp fisheries.\n            (3) In 2003, a $35,700,000 buyback loan was authorized by \n        Congress, creating the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishing \n        capacity reduction program through the National Marine \n        Fisheries Service Fisheries Finance Program with a term of 30 \n        years. The interest rate of the buyback loan was fixed at 6.97 \n        percent and is paid back based on an ex-vessel fee landing rate \n        of 5 percent for the loan.\n            (4) The buyback program resulted in the removal of limited \n        entry trawl Federal fishing permits from the fishery, \n        representing approximately 46 percent of total landings at the \n        time.\n            (5) Because of an absence of a repayment mechanism, \n        $4,243,730 in interest was accrued before fee collection \n        procedures were established in 2005, over 18 months after the \n        fishing capacity reduction program was initiated.\n            (6) In 2011, the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery \n        transitioned to a catch share program.\n            (7) By 2015, Pacific Coast groundfish fishermen's expenses \n        are expected to include fees of approximately $450 per day for \n        observers, a 3-percent cost recovery fee as authorized by the \n        Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act for \n        catch share programs, and a 5-percent ex-vessel landings rate \n        for the loan repayment, which could reach 18 percent of their \n        total gross revenue.\n            (8) In the period covering 2006 through 2011, the annual \n        average Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery ex-vessel revenue was \n        $85,945,847, which included revenue of at-sea catcher \n        processors, at-sea mothership catcher vessels, trawls, open \n        access, and tribal fishing and all other groundfish revenue. Of \n        that revenue, an average of $45,000,000 was generated by the \n        limited entry trawl fishery.\n            (9) Currently, National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration Fisheries administers industry-funded capacity \n        reduction programs in the Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands crab, \n        Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands non-pollock groundfish, and \n        American Fisheries Act pollock fisheries, along with the \n        Pacific Coast groundfish fishery. Each program has a 30-year, \n        long-term loan repayment period based on fees for future \n        landings in the fisheries.\n            (10) A fifth reduction buyback program was implemented in \n        2012 for the Alaska Purse Seine Salmon Fishery, which has a 40-\n        year, long-term repayment period based on fees for future \n        landings in the fishery with an ex-vessel landing rate of 3 \n        percent.\n            (11) In the past when fishery disasters have been declared, \n        some fisheries have been issued Federal disaster assistance \n        grants to provide short-term economic assistance to fishermen \n        leaving the industry, increased profitability for remaining \n        fishermen, and conservation of fish stocks.\n            (12) In 1996 and 1997, a $23,000,000 Federal disaster \n        assistance grant was issued for the New England Groundfish \n        Fishery, which was used to remove 68 multi-species permits and \n        scrap 58 vessels associated with those permits. No loan \n        repayments were required for this grant.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Act is to refinance the Pacific \nCoast Groundfish Fishery Fishing Capacity Reduction Program to protect \nand conserve the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery, fishermen's economic \nlivelihood, and jobs of associated industries.\n\nSEC. 3. REFINANCING OF WEST COAST GROUNDFISH FISHERY FISHING CAPACITY \n              REDUCTION LOAN.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce shall, upon receipt of \nsuch assurances as the Secretary considers appropriate to protect the \ninterests of the United States, issue a loan to refinance the existing \ndebt obligation funding the fishing capacity reduction program for the \nPacific Coast Groundfish Fishery implemented under section 212 of the \nDepartment of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003 \n(title II of division B of Public Law 108-7; 117 Stat. 80).\n    (b) Applicable Law.--Except as otherwise provided in this section, \nthe Secretary shall issue such loan in accordance with subsections (b) \nthrough (e) of section 312 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1861a) and sections 53702 and 53735 of \ntitle 46, United States Code.\n    (c) Loan Term.--Notwithstanding section 53735(c)(4) of title 46, \nUnited States Code, a loan under this section must have a maturity that \nexpires at the end of the 45-year period beginning on the date of \nissuance of such loan.\n    (d) Limitation on Fee Amount.--Notwithstanding section 312(d)(2)(B) \nof the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 \nU.S.C. 1861(d)(2)(B)), the fee established by the Secretary with \nrespect to a loan under this section shall not exceed 3 percent of the \nex-vessel value of all fish harvested from each fishery for which the \nloan is issued.\n    (e) Funding.--To implement this section there is authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary an amount equal to 1 percent of the \namount of the loan authorized under this section."
