FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Creating the appropriate infrastructure to move \n        renewable fuels is a necessary energy and transportation \n        objective for the United States.\n            (2) Currently more than 70 percent of the gasoline supply \n        of the United States is delivered to local terminals through \n        pipelines.\n            (3) Pipelines are the most cost-effective, efficient, and \n        safe transportation mode in use today to deliver large volumes \n        of liquid fuels.\n            (4) Renewable fuels are currently transported by truck, \n        barge, and rail, and the volume requirements of the Energy \n        Independence and Security Act of 2007 may overwhelm the \n        renewable fuels infrastructure, a problem that would be \n        alleviated by the transportation of renewable fuels through \n        pipelines.\n            (5) The production and use of renewable fuels is supported \n        by Federal policy and a corresponding Federal policy is \n        necessary to support the construction of an appropriate \n        infrastructure to transport such fuels.\n\nSEC. 3. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR PROJECTS TO CONSTRUCT RENEWABLE FUEL \n              PIPELINES.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--Section 1701 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 \nU.S.C. 16511) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(6) Renewable fuel.--The term `renewable fuel' has the \n        meaning given the term in section 211(o)(1) of the Clean Air \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)), except that the term shall include \n        all ethanol and biodiesel.\n            ``(7) Renewable fuel pipeline.--The term `renewable fuel \n        pipeline' means a common carrier pipeline for transporting \n        renewable fuel.''.\n    (b) Terms and Conditions.--\n            (1) Specific appropriation or contribution.--Subsection (b) \n        of section 1702 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. \n        16512) is amended--\n                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as \n                subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively, and by moving \n                such subparagraphs 2 ems to the right;\n                    (B) by striking ``(b) Specific Appropriation or \n                Contribution.--No guarantee'' and inserting the \n                following:\n    ``(b) Specific Appropriation or Contribution.--\n            ``(1) In general.--No guarantee''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(2) Renewable fuel pipelines.--The Secretary may waive \n        the application of paragraph (1) with respect to a guarantee \n        for a project described in section 1703(f)(1).''.\n            (2) Amount.--Subsection (c) of such section is amended--\n                    (A) by striking ``(c) Amount.--Unless'' and \n                inserting the following:\n    ``(c) Amount.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Unless''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(2) Renewable fuel pipelines.--With respect to a project \n        described in section 1703(f)(1)--\n                    ``(A) a guarantee by the Secretary shall not exceed \n                an amount equal to 90 percent of the project cost of \n                the renewable fuel pipeline that is the subject of the \n                guarantee, as estimated at the time at which the \n                guarantee is issued;
