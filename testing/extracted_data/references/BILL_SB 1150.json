    "title": "SB 1150",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature hereby declares all of the following:\n(a) Beginning in 2008, California faced a foreclosure crisis, with rapidly dropping home values and skyrocketing job losses. Indiscriminate foreclosure practices of major mortgage servicers compounded the problem as they created a labyrinth of red tape, lost documents, and erroneous information, and then they started foreclosure proceedings while borrowers and their families were in the middle of applying for a loan modification.\n(b) The California Legislature responded with a first-in-the-nation Homeowner Bill of Rights (HBOR), which requires mortgage servicers to provide borrowers a fair and transparent process, a single point of contact, and the opportunity to finish applying for a loan modification before foreclosure proceedings can start. HBOR stabilized families, neighborhoods, and local communities by slowing down indiscriminate foreclosures.\n(c) Now, however, district attorneys and legal aid organizations are reporting an increasing number of cases in which mortgage servicers use a loophole in HBOR to foreclose on certain homeowners\u2014people who survive the death of a borrower and have an ownership interest in the home but are not named on the mortgage loan. Most often, the \u201csurvivor\u201d is the borrower\u2019s spouse and is over 65 years of age.\n(d) When the surviving widow or widower, domestic partner, children, or other heirs attempt to obtain basic information about the loan from the servicer, they face the same kind of barriers and abuses\u2014and, finally foreclosure\u2014that convinced the Legislature to pass HBOR.\n(e) Home ownership is the primary avenue for most Americans to build generational wealth. Indiscriminate foreclosures on surviving heirs destroy a family\u2019s ability to build for its financial future. Foreclosures also exacerbate the racial wealth gap\u2014and overall wealth inequality\u2014in society, and force seniors who want to \u201cage in place\u201d into the overheated rental market instead, with devastating health impacts.\n(f) Surviving heirs deserve the same transparency and opportunity to save their home as HBOR gave the original borrower. This act would stem a disturbing nationwide trend and help keep widows and widowers, children, and other survivors in their homes\u2014without requiring mortgage servicers to do anything more than they already do for other homeowners.\n(g) It is the intent of the Legislature that this act work in conjunction with federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau servicing guidelines.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 2920.7 is added to the Civil Code, to read:\n2920.7.\n(a) Upon notification by someone claiming to be a successor in interest that a borrower has died, and where that claimant is not a party to the loan or promissory note, a mortgage servicer shall not record a notice of default pursuant to Section 2924 until the mortgage servicer does both of the following:\n(1) Requests reasonable documentation of the death of the borrower from the claimant, including, but not limited to, a death certificate or other written evidence of the death of the borrower. A reasonable period of time shall be provided for the claimant to present this documentation, but no less than 30 days from the date of a written request by the mortgage servicer.\n(2) Requests reasonable documentation from the claimant demonstrating the ownership interest of that claimant in the real property. A reasonable period of time shall be provided for the claimant to present this documentation, but no less than 90 days from the date of a written request by the mortgage servicer.\n(b) (1) Upon receipt by the mortgage servicer of the reasonable documentation of the status of a claimant as successor in interest and that claimant\u2019s ownership interest in the real property, that claimant shall be deemed a \u201csuccessor in interest.\u201d\n(2) There may be more than one successor in interest. A mortgage servicer shall apply the provisions of this section to multiple successors in interest in accordance with the terms of the loan and federal and state laws and regulations. When there are multiple successors in interest who do not wish to proceed as coborrowers or coapplicants, a mortgage servicer may require any nonapplicant successor in interest to consent in writing to the application for loan assumption.\n(3) Being a successor in interest under this section does not impose an affirmative duty on a mortgage servicer or alter any obligation the mortgage servicer has to provide a loan modification to the successor in interest. If a successor in interest assumes the loan, he or she may be required to otherwise qualify for available foreclosure prevention alternatives offered by the mortgage servicer.\n(c) Within 10 days of a claimant being deemed a successor in interest pursuant to subdivision (b), a mortgage servicer shall provide the successor in interest with information in writing about the loan. This information shall include, at a minimum, loan balance, interest rate and interest reset dates and amounts, balloon payments if any, prepayment penalties if any, default or delinquency status, the monthly payment amount, and payoff amounts.\n(d) A mortgage servicer shall allow a successor in interest to either:\n(1) Apply to assume the deceased borrower\u2019s loan. The mortgage servicer may evaluate the creditworthiness of the successor in interest, subject to applicable investor requirements and guidelines.\n(2) If a successor in interest of an assumable loan also seeks a foreclosure prevention alternative, simultaneously apply to assume the loan and for a foreclosure prevention alternative that may be offered by, or available through, the mortgage loan servicer. If the successor in interest qualifies for the foreclosure prevention alternative, assume the loan. The mortgage servicer may evaluate the creditworthiness of the successor in interest subject to applicable investor requirements and guidelines.\n(e) (1) A successor in interest shall have all the same rights and remedies as a borrower under subdivision (a) of Section 2923.4 and under Sections 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, 2924.12, 2924.15, 2924.17, 2924.18, and 2924.19. For the purposes of Section 2924.15, \u201cowner-occupied\u201d means that the property was the principal residence of the deceased borrower and is security for a loan made for personal, family, or household purposes.\n(2) If a trustee\u2019s deed upon sale has not been recorded, a successor in interest may bring an action for injunctive relief to enjoin a material violation of subdivision (a), (b), (c), or (d). Any injunction shall remain in place and any trustee\u2019s sale shall be enjoined until the court determines that the mortgage servicer has corrected and remedied the violation or violations giving rise to the action for injunctive relief. An enjoined entity may move to dissolve an injunction based on a showing that the material violation has been corrected and remedied.\n(3) After a trustee\u2019s deed upon sale has been recorded, a mortgage servicer shall be liable to a successor in interest for actual economic damages pursuant to Section 3281 resulting from a material violation of subdivision (a), (b), (c), or (d) by that mortgage servicer if the violation was not corrected and remedied prior to the recordation of the trustee\u2019s deed upon sale. If the court finds that the material violation was intentional or reckless, or resulted from willful misconduct by a mortgage servicer, the court may award the successor in interest the greater of treble actual damages or statutory damages of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).\n(4) A court may award a prevailing successor in interest reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs in an action brought pursuant to this section. A successor in interest shall be deemed to have prevailed for purposes of this subdivision if the successor in interest obtained injunctive relief or damages pursuant to this section.\n(5) A mortgage servicer shall not be liable for any violation that it has corrected and remedied prior to the recordation of the trustee\u2019s deed upon sale or that has been corrected and remedied by third parties working on its behalf prior to the recordation of the trustee\u2019s deed upon sale.\n(f) Consistent with their general regulatory authority, and notwithstanding subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 2924.18, the Department of Business Oversight and the Bureau of Real Estate may adopt regulations applicable to any entity or person under their respective jurisdictions that are necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.\n(g) The rights and remedies provided by this section are in addition to and independent of any other rights, remedies, or procedures under any other law. This section shall not be construed to alter, limit, or negate any other rights, remedies, or procedures provided by law.\n(h) Except as otherwise provided, this act does not affect the obligations arising from a mortgage or deed of trust.\n(i) For purposes of this section, all of the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u201cNotification of the death of the mortgagor or trustor\u201d means provision to the mortgage servicer of a death certificate or, if a death certificate is not available, of other written evidence of the death of the mortgagor or trustor deemed sufficient by the mortgage servicer.\n(2) \u201cMortgage servicer\u201d shall have the same meaning as provided in Section 2920.5.\n(3) \u201cReasonable documentation\u201d means copies of the following documents, as may be applicable, or, if the relevant documentation listed is not available, other written evidence of the person\u2019s status as successor in interest to the real property that secures the mortgage or deed of trust deemed sufficient by the mortgage servicer:\n(A) In the case of a personal representative, letters as defined in Section 52 of the Probate Code.\n(B) In the case of devisee or an heir, a copy of the relevant will or trust document.\n(C) In the case of a beneficiary of a revocable transfer on death deed, a copy of that deed.\n(D) In the case of a surviving joint tenant, an affidavit of death of the joint tenant or a grant deed showing joint tenancy.\n(E) In the case of a surviving spouse where the real property was held as community property with right of survivorship, an affidavit of death of the spouse or a deed showing community property with right of survivorship.\n(F) In the case of a trustee of a trust, a certification of trust pursuant to Section 18100.5 of the Probate Code.\n(G) In the case of a beneficiary of a trust, relevant trust documents related to the beneficiary\u2019s interest.\n(4) \u201cSuccessor in interest\u201d means a natural person who provides the mortgage servicer with notification of the death of the mortgagor or trustor and reasonable documentation showing that the person is the spouse, domestic partner, joint tenant as evidenced by grant deed, parent, grandparent, adult child, adult grandchild, or adult sibling of the deceased borrower, who occupied the property as his or her principal residence within the last six continuous months prior to the deceased borrower\u2019s death and who currently resides in the property.\n(j) This section shall apply to first lien mortgages or deeds of trust that are secured by owner-occupied residential real property containing no more than four dwelling units. \u201cOwner-occupied\u201d means that the property was the principal residence of the deceased borrower.\n(k) (1) Any mortgage servicer, mortgagee, or beneficiary of the deed of trust, or an authorized agent thereof, who, with respect to the successor in interest or person claiming to be a successor in interest, complies with the relevant provisions regarding successors in interest of Part 1024 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations (12 C.F.R.
