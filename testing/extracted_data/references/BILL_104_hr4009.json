The standards shall include requirements \nrelated to adverse geologic settings such as flood plains and seismic \nimpact zones; unstable terrain such as karst terrain; ecological \nresources such as wetlands and wildlife habitat; proximity to \nresidences, schools, hospitals, churches and synagogues; complex \nhydrogeology; and vulnerable significant ground water resources. If a \nState does not promulgate such siting standards sufficient to protect \nhuman health and the environment, the Administrator shall promulgate \nsuch standards with respect to the State.\n    ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `complex \nhydrogeology' means an area where 1 or more of the following activities \ncannot be performed fully and adequately:\n            ``(i) Sufficient ground water characterization to determine \n        ground water and surface water flow and ascertain upgradient \n        and downgradient directions.\n            ``(ii) The installation of a ground water monitoring \n        network which will detect releases into ground water from a \n        monitored unit at the earliest opportunity.\n            ``(iii) Characterization of the nature and extent of \n        potential releases from a monitored unit.\n            ``(iv) Determination of what corrective actions are \n        appropriate in response to a release, and conducting the \n        corrective actions that may be required.''.\n\nSEC. 3.

The Administrator shall publish such \ndetermination in the Federal Register, after notice and opportunity for \npublic comment.\n    ``(4) If the Administrator determines, pursuant to paragraph (2), \nthat the fee provisions of a State program do not meet the requirements \nof this subsection, or if the Administrator determines that the State \nis not adequately administering or enforcing an approved program, the \nAdministrator may, in addition to taking any other action authorized \nunder this subtitle, collect reasonable fees from the owner or operator \nof the facilities identified in paragraph (1). The fees shall be \ndesigned solely to cover the Administrator's costs of administering the \nprovisions of the permit program promulgated by the Administrator.\n    ``(5) In addition to any penalties that may be imposed under other \nlaw, any owner or operator that fails to pay fees imposed by the \nAdministrator under paragraph (4), within a reasonable time to be \ndetermined by the Administrator, shall pay a penalty of 50 percent of \nthe fee amount to the Administrator, plus interest on the fee amount \ncomputed in accordance with section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 (relating to computation of interest on underpayment of \nFederal taxes).\n    ``(6) To carry out activities of the Administrator for which fees \nare collected under this subsection, an amount equal to the total \namount of any fees, penalties, and interest collected by the \nAdministrator during any fiscal year under this subsection is \nauthorized to be appropriated to the Administrator.

QUALIFICATIONS OF PERMITTEES.\n\n    Section 3005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6925) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(k) Qualifications of Permittees.--A person may not obtain a \npermit for any facility under this title or renew any such permit, \nobtain authorization to expand the facility, or transfer ownership of \nthe facility to any other person, unless the person demonstrates the \nfollowing with respect to the person, any firm engaged to operate the \nfacility, the parent firm of the person and any firm engaged to operate \nthe facility, and any firms controlled by the parent firm or the \noperating firm of the person:\n            ``(1) Each such entity is in compliance with Federal and \n        State environmental and public health statutes and regulations.\n            ``(2) Each such entity has paid all outstanding fines or \n        penalties imposed on the entity for violations of such statutes \n        and regulations.\n            ``(3) Each such entity has made available a disclosure \n        statement to the public at the site, and at local public \n        libraries in the jurisdiction where the facility would be sited \n        if a permit were obtained.
