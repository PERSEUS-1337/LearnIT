FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In May 2015, over 123,400 individuals were on the \n        official waiting list for organ donation managed by the Organ \n        Procurement and Transplantation Network.\n            (2) In 2014, the most recent year for which complete data \n        are available, 14,413 individuals became organ donors leading \n        to 29,531 transplants, while 6,198 individuals died while \n        waiting for a transplant.\n            (3) On average, 21 people die every day of every year while \n        waiting for an organ donation.\n            (4) Over 100,000,000 people in the United States are \n        registered to be organ and tissue donors, yet the demand for \n        donated organs still outweighs the supply of organs made \n        available each day.\n            (5) Many people do not know about their options for organ \n        and tissue donation, or have not made their wishes clear to \n        their families.\n            (6) Organ and tissue donation can give meaning to the \n        tragic loss of a loved one by enabling up to eight people to \n        receive the gift of life from a single deceased donor.\n            (7) Living donors can donate a kidney or a portion of a \n        lung or liver to save the life of another individual.\n\nSEC. 3.
