FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1)(A) Tuberculosis is one of the greatest infectious \n        causes of death of adults worldwide, killing 2,000,000 people \n        per year--one person every 15 seconds.\n            (B) Globally, tuberculosis is the leading cause of death of \n        young women and the leading cause of death of people with HIV/\n        AIDS.\n            (2) An estimated 8,000,000 individuals develop active \n        tuberculosis each year.\n            (3) Tuberculosis is spreading as a result of inadequate \n        treatment and it is a disease that knows no national borders.\n            (4) With over 40 percent of tuberculosis cases in the \n        United States attributable to foreign-born individuals and with \n        the increase in international travel, commerce, and migration, \n        elimination of tuberculosis in the United States depends on \n        efforts to control the disease in developing countries.\n            (5) The threat that tuberculosis poses for Americans \n        derives from the global spread of tuberculosis and the \n        emergence and spread of strains of multi-drug resistant \n        tuberculosis (MDR-TB).\n            (6) Up to 50,000,000 individuals may be infected with \n        multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.\n            (7) In the United States, tuberculosis treatment, normally \n        about $2,000 per patient, skyrockets to as much as $250,000 per \n        patient to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and \n        treatment may not even be successful.\n            (8) Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis kills more than one-\n        half of those individuals infected in the United States and \n        other industrialized nations and without access to treatment it \n        is a virtual death sentence in the developing world.\n            (9) There is a highly effective and inexpensive treatment \n        for tuberculosis. Recommended by the World Health Organization \n        as the best curative method for tuberculosis, this strategy, \n        known as directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS), \n        includes low-cost effective diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, \n        and recordkeeping, as well as a reliable drug supply. A \n        centerpiece of DOTS is observing patients to ensure that they \n        take their medication and complete treatment.\n\nSEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND CONTROL.\n\n    (a) Additional Prevention, Treatment, and Control.--Section \n104(c)(7)(A) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n2151b(c)(7)(A)) is amended--\n            (1) in clause (i), by adding at the end before the \n        semicolon the following: ``, by expanding the use of the \n        strategy known as directly observed treatment, short course \n        (DOTS) and strategies to address multi-drug resistant \n        tuberculosis (MDR-TB) where appropriate at the local level, \n        particularly in countries with the highest rate of \n        tuberculosis''; and\n            (2) in clause (ii)--\n                    (A) by inserting after ``the cure of at least 95 \n                percent of the cases detected'' the following: ``by \n                focusing efforts on the use of the directly observed \n                treatment, short course (DOTS) strategy or other \n                internationally accepted primary tuberculosis control \n                strategies''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``and the cure'' and inserting \n                ``the cure''.\n    (b) Funding Requirement.--Section 104(c)(7) of the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(c)(7)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C); \n        and\n            (2) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:\n    ``(B) In carrying out this paragraph, not less than 75 percent of \nthe amount appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations \nunder subparagraph (D) shall be used for the diagnosis and treatment of \ntuberculosis for at-risk and affected populations utilizing directly \nobserved treatment, short course (DOTS) strategy or other \ninternationally accepted primary tuberculosis control strategies \ndeveloped in consultation with the World Health Organization (WHO), \nincluding funding for the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility of WHO's \nStop TB Partnership.''.\n    (c) Annual Report.--Section 104(c)(7) of the Foreign Assistance Act \nof 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(c)(7)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) (as redesignated by \n        this Act) as subparagraph (D); and\n            (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following:\n    ``(C) In conjunction with the transmission of the annual request \nfor enactment of authorizations and appropriations for foreign \nassistance programs for each fiscal year, the President shall transmit \nto Congress a report that contains a summary of all programs, projects, \nand activities carried out under this paragraph for the preceding \nfiscal year, including a description of the extent to which such \nprograms, projects, and activities have made progress to achieve the \ngoals described in subparagraph (A)(ii).''.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--Subparagraph (D) of section \n104(c)(7) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n2151b(c)(7)), as redesignated by this Act, is amended by striking \n``$60,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2001 and 2002'' and \ninserting ``$60,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and $200,000,000 for \nfiscal year 2002''."
