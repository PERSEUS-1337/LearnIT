FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) National randomized controlled trials have found that \n        replacing the brief summary of drug advertisements with a drug \n        facts box improved consumer knowledge and judgments. In such \n        trials, consumers who were presented with a drug facts box more \n        accurately perceived the side effects and benefits of a drug, \n        and were more than twice as likely to choose the superior drug.\n            (2)(A) In 2007, the Institute of Medicine conducted a \n        workshop that highlighted that the public has a limited \n        understanding of the benefits and risks of drugs. The workshop \n        also highlighted that it is important to--\n                    (i) provide patients and physicians with the best \n                possible information for making informed decisions \n                about the use of pharmaceuticals;\n                    (ii) employ quantitative and standardized \n                approaches when trying to evaluate pharmaceutical \n                benefit-risk; and\n                    (iii) develop and validate improved tools for \n                communicating pharmaceutical benefit-risk information \n                to patients and physicians.\n            (B) The general agreement of the workshop was that the Food \n        and Drug Administration should pilot test a drug facts box.\n            (3) On February 27, 2009, the Food and Drug \n        Administration's Risk Communication Advisory Committee made the \n        following unanimous recommendations:\n                    (A) The Food and Drug Administration should adopt a \n                single standard document for communicating essential \n                information about pharmaceuticals.\n                    (B) That standard document should include \n                quantitative summaries of risks and benefits, along \n                with use and precaution information.\n                    (C) The Food and Drug Administration should adopt \n                the drug facts box format as its standard.\n\nSEC. 3. PRESENTATION OF DRUG BENEFIT AND RISK INFORMATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n(referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary''), acting through the \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs, shall determine whether standardized, \nquantitative summaries of the benefits and risks of drugs in a tabular \nor drug facts box format, or any alternative format, in the labeling \nand print advertising of such drugs would improve health care \ndecisionmaking by clinicians and patients and consumers.\n    (b) Review and Consultation.--In making the determination under \nsubsection (a), the Secretary shall review all available scientific \nevidence and consult with drug manufacturers, clinicians, patients and \nconsumers, experts in health literacy, and representatives of racial \nand ethnic minorities.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report that \nprovides--\n            (1) the determination by the Secretary under subsection \n        (a); and\n            (2) the reasoning and analysis underlying that \n        determination.\n    (d) Authority.--\n            (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines under \n        subsection (a) that standardized, quantitative summaries of the \n        benefits and risks of drugs in a tabular or drug facts box \n        format, or any alternative format, in the labeling and print \n        advertising of such drugs would improve health care \n        decisionmaking by clinicians and patients and consumers, then \n        the Secretary, not later than 1 year after the date of \n        submission of the report under subsection (c), shall promulgate \n        regulations as necessary to implement such format.\n            (2) Objective and up-to-date information.--In carrying out \n        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall ensure that the information \n        presented in a summary described under such paragraph is \n        objective and up-to-date, and is the result of a review process \n        that considers the totality of published and unpublished data.\n            (3) Posting of information.--In carrying out paragraph (1), \n        the Secretary shall post the information presented in a summary \n        described under such paragraph on the Internet Web site of the \n        Food and Drug Administration.\n\nSEC. 4.
