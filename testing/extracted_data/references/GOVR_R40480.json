    "content": "The budget reconciliation process is an optional procedure that operates as an adjunct to the budget resolution process established by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The chief purpose of the reconciliation process is to enhance Congress's ability to change current law in order to bring revenue, spending, and debt-limit levels into conformity with the policies of the annual budget resolution. Reconciliation is a two-stage process. First, reconciliation directives are included in the budget resolution, instructing the appropriate committees to develop legislation achieving the desired budgetary outcomes. Reconciliation directives instruct specified committees to develop legislation changing existing law in order to alter revenue, spending, or debt-limit levels to conform with budget resolution policies. Over the years, compliance with reconciliation directives has been determined on the basis of the net revenue or spending effects of all changes in the legislation. A particular reconciliation measure, therefore, may have included changes that raised spending as well as changes that reduced spending, changes that raised revenue as well as changes that reduced revenue, or both, and still adhered to the overall budgetary goals. If the budget resolution instructs more than one committee in a chamber, then the instructed committees submit their legislative recommendations to their respective Budget Committees by the deadline prescribed in the budget resolution; the Budget Committees incorporate them into an omnibus budget reconciliation bill without making any substantive revisions. In cases where only one committee has been instructed, the process allows that committee to report its reconciliation legislation directly to its parent chamber, thus bypassing the Budget Committee. The second step involves consideration of the resultant reconciliation legislation by the House and Senate under expedited procedures. Among other things, debate in the Senate on any reconciliation measure is limited to 20 hours (and 10 hours on a conference report) and amendments must be germane and not include extraneous matter. The House Rules Committee typically recommends a special rule for the consideration of a reconciliation measure in the House that places restrictions on debate time and the offering of amendments. If the House and Senate do not reach final agreement on a budget resolution, then the reconciliation process is not triggered. As an optional procedure, reconciliation has not been used in every year that the congressional budget process has been in effect. Reconciliation was not used during the first several years of the congressional budget process and, more recently, was not used in years immediately following successful action on a budget summit agreement. In 1990, for example, the George H. W. Bush Administration successfully negotiated a budget summit agreement with Congress that was reflected in the FY1991 budget resolution. Pursuant to reconciliation directives in that resolution, Congress and the President enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Reconciliation was not used in the following two years, involving budget resolutions for FY1992 and FY1993. In nine years, 1998 (for FY1999), 2002 (for FY2003), 2004 (for FY2005), 2006 (for FY2007), 2011-2014 (for FY2012-2015), and 2016 (for FY2017), the House and Senate did not agree on a budget resolution. Beginning with the first use of reconciliation by both the House and Senate in 1980, reconciliation has been used in a majority of years. Congress has sent the President 25 reconciliation acts over the years: 21 were signed into law, President Clinton vetoed three, and President Obama vetoed one (and the vetoes were not overridden). The 25 reconciliation measures sent to the President are shown in Table 1 . Reconciliation practices in the House and Senate vary and change over time. In earlier years, spending and revenue changes were incorporated into a single measure. In the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, for example, about $8 billion in deficit reduction for FY1981 was split fairly evenly between spending reductions and revenue increases. In more recent years, revenue and spending changes have often been segregated into separate reconciliation measures. For the FY2006 budget cycle, for example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was a spending reconciliation bill, and the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 was a revenue reconciliation bill. Most recently, however, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 included significant changes in both spending and revenues. Reconciliation directives in a single budget resolution sometimes lead to more than one reconciliation measure, as indicated above for the FY2006 budget cycle. Multiple reconciliation measures also were considered in calendar years 1982 and 1997. Finally, the consideration of reconciliation measures sometimes extends into a succeeding year. Action on reconciliation measures initiated in 1983, 1985, and 2005 was not completed until the following year. Although in these instances legislative action spilled over into the following year, the initial year was retained in the titles of the acts (e.g., the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was enacted in 2006). In the FY2010 budget cycle, the budget resolution containing reconciliation directives was adopted in 2009 but the reconciliation legislation was not considered until 2010. A brief description of each of the 21 reconciliation measures enacted into law is provided in the Appendix . The laws are presented in chronological order. For each reconciliation law listed in the Appendix , some of the major subject areas affected by the revenue or spending changes are identified, but no determination is made as to whether the specific changes involved increases or decreases. The subject areas identified range from fairly specific (e.g., Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees) to quite broad (e.g., Medicare), with broad subject areas sometimes encompassing dozens or hundreds of separate provisions. Some of the reconciliation measures included in the listing were very lengthy and complicated, involving the legislative proposals of many different House and Senate committees. Accordingly, the subject areas identified in the listing should be regarded as illustrative and not comprehensive. The source from which the summary information was drawn is indicated for each law by a bracketed reference at the end of the summary. 1.Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 P.L. 96-499 (December 5, 1980) This act, signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, was the first reconciliation bill to pass the House and Senate.

An estimated $11.7 billion in deficit reduction contributed to the avoidance of a sequester (i.e., across-the-board spending cuts in nonexempt programs to eliminate a violation of the applicable deficit target under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act) for FY1987. Major spending changes affected such areas as Medicare, Medicaid, agricultural income support payments, loan asset sales, federal employee retirement programs, federal subsidy for reduced-rate postage, federal financing for fishing vessels or facilities, retirement age limits, and elimination of the trigger for Social Security COLAs.

Bush, was estimated to contain $14.7 billion in deficit reduction, which represented about half of the deficit reduction envisioned in a budget summit agreement reached earlier in the year (the remaining savings were expected to occur largely in annual appropriations acts). Major spending changes affected such areas as Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' housing loans, agricultural deficiency payments and dairy price supports, the Supplemental Loans for Students program, Federal Communications Commission and Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees, vaccine injury compensation amendments, and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program.

According to the Senate Budget Committee, revenue reductions, together with outlay increases for refundable tax credits, reduced the projected surplus by $1.349 trillion over FY2001\u2013FY2011. The tax cuts were scheduled to sunset in 10 years in order to comply with the Senate's ''Byrd rule'' against extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation (Section 313 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974).

College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 P.L. 110-84 (September 27, 2007) This six-year reconciliation act, covering FY2007-FY2012, was estimated to reduce the deficit over that period by $752 million. Major spending changes affected provisions relating to lenders and borrowers involved with the Federal Family Education Loan program and the William D. Ford Direct Loan program. [CRS Report RL34077, Student Loans, Student Aid, and FY2008 Budget Reconciliation , by Adam Stoll, David P. Smole, and Charmaine Mercer] 20. Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 P.L. 111-152 (March 30, 2010) This reconciliation act, which resulted from reconciliation directives in the FY2010 budget resolution (adopted in 2009) for the five-year period encompassing FY2010-FY2014, modified the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 , March 23, 2010) and also contained changes in federal postsecondary education programs.  According to the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the changes made by the reconciliation act, combined with the changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, were estimated to reduce the deficit by $109 billion over five years (FY2010-FY2014) and by $143 billion over 10 years (FY2010-FY2019). 21. An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018 P.L. 115-97 (December 22, 2017) This reconciliation act resulted from reconciliation directives in the FY2018 budget resolution (adopted in October 2017) for the 10-year period encompassing FY2018-FY2027. The reconciliation act includes permanent and temporary changes to the tax code and directs the Secretary of the Interior to implement a certain oil and gas leasing program.  More specifically, the act temporarily reduces most individual income tax rates, modifies tax brackets for individuals, increases the standard deduction and the child tax credit, repeals deductions for personal exemptions, repeals or limits certain itemized deductions, and increases the exemption amounts for the individual alternative minimum tax. (These temporary changes take effect on January 1, 2018, and are scheduled to expire after 2025.) The act permanently repeals the penalties associated with the \"individual mandate\" (which requires that most people obtain health insurance coverage). The act makes permanent modifications to business taxation. Most notably, the law replaces the graduated corporate tax rate structure (with a maximum rate of 35%) with a flat 21% tax rate. The law also provides a reduction from qualified business income of up to 20% for pass-through businesses. The act also significantly alters the tax treatment of U.S. multinational corporations.  Lastly, the act directs the Secretary of the Interior to implement an oil and gas leasing program for the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and would affect oil and gas leases and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the legislation to reduce revenue by about $1.65 trillion and decrease outlays by $194 billion over the 2018-2027 period. The bill is therefore estimated to increase the deficit by $1.46 trillion over that period, excluding effects from macroeconomic feedback."
