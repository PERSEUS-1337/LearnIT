FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As a Member of Congress from the Tenth Congressional \n        District of Texas, as Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate, Vice-\n        President and President of the United States, Lyndon Baines \n        Johnson's accomplishments in the fields of civil rights, \n        education, and economic opportunity rank among the greatest \n        achievements of the past half century.\n            (2) As President, Lyndon Johnson proposed, championed, led \n        to passage, and signed into law on August 6, 1965, the Voting \n        Rights Act of 1965, which swept away barriers impeding millions \n        of Americans from meaningful participation in American \n        political life.\n            (3) On July 30, 1965, President Johnson signed into law the \n        Social Security Amendments Act of 1965, popularly known as \n        Medicare, which has transformed the delivery of health care in \n        the United States and which, along with Social Security, \n        reduced the rate of poverty among the elderly from 28.5 percent \n        in 1966 to 9.1 percent in 2012.\n            (4) On July 2, 1964, President Johnson secured passage and \n        signed into law the most sweeping civil rights legislation \n        since Reconstruction, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which \n        prohibits discrimination in employment, education, and public \n        accommodations based on race, color, religion, or national \n        origin.\n            (5) On November 8, 1965, President Johnson signed into law \n        the Higher Education Act, which provided need-based financial \n        aid to students in the form of scholarships, work-study grants, \n        and loans, and thus made higher education more accessible to \n        populations of persons who were previously unable to attend \n        college because of economic circumstances.\n            (6) On October 3, 1965, President Johnson signed into law \n        the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which \n        transformed the Nation's immigration system by abolishing the \n        racially based quota system that had defined American \n        immigration policy for four decades and replaced it with a \n        policy whose central purpose was family reunification, with a \n        preference for immigrants with specific skill sets.\n            (7) According to Robert A. Caro, the preeminent biographer \n        of Lyndon Baines Johnson, with the single exception of Lincoln, \n        President Johnson was the greatest champion of the poor and \n        underprivileged in the history of the Republic and was the \n        President ``who wrote mercy and justice into the statute books \n        by which America was governed''.\n\nSEC. 2.
