FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) both wholesale and retail motor fuel prices are the \n        result of a number of complex factors, including those related \n        to supply, refining, consumer demand, and oil company cost, \n        pricing, and marketing practices;\n            (2) certain cost, pricing, and marketing practices employed \n        by the oil companies are unfair and anticompetitive, and \n        contribute to the unjustified price of retail motor fuel \n        charged the American consumer;\n            (3) among the unfair and anticompetitive oil company \n        practices are price zoning, redlining, discriminatory wholesale \n        motor fuel pricing, and a complex system of cost allocation \n        that hides the factors on which wholesale costs are based;\n            (4) the oil companies' practice known as price zoning is \n        one by which prices for motor fuel are set solely because of \n        the retail station's geographic location unrelated to cost-of-\n        business factors;\n            (5) price zoning allows an oil company to artificially \n        increase or depress retail motor fuel prices in order to secure \n        an unfair market advantage against competitors;\n            (6) the oil companies engage in a practice known as \n        redlining, whereby a refiner refuses to sell motor fuel to \n        distributors or particular geographic markets;\n            (7) redlining allows an oil company to force concessions \n        from a distributor and affords the company the opportunity to \n        exert undue influence in a particular area or region;\n            (8) the oil companies engage in a practice of \n        discriminatory wholesale pricing of motor fuel based on the \n        relationship of the purchaser to the oil company and the degree \n        of competition they provide;\n            (9) discriminatory pricing allows oil companies to charge \n        different wholesale prices to company owned and operated retail \n        stations, franchisees, and independent retailers though all may \n        be situated in the same community and face the same competitive \n        and operating factors;\n            (10) the oil companies engage in a complex system of cost \n        allocations by which they employ rebates, incentives, credits, \n        and market enhancement allowances that hide the factors on \n        which wholesale prices are based or published;\n            (11) the complex system of cost allocation allows oil \n        companies to post a ``wholesale price'' that is far different \n        from the actual wholesale price that would be revealed if the \n        cost factors were publicly identified and appropriately \n        allocated; and\n            (12) it is appropriate for the Federal Government to \n        prohibit these unfair oil company cost, pricing, and marketing \n        practices, to restore fair and competitive practices to the \n        wholesale sale of motor fuel, and to allow American consumers \n        to assess for themselves the factors that contribute to the \n        price changes they pay at the retail pump.\n\nSEC. 3. PRICE DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITION.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--\n            (1) In general.--It shall be a violation of this Act for an \n        owner or operator of a terminal facility to sell motor fuel \n        from the terminal facility to a distributor or retailer at a \n        price in excess of the price it charges any other distributor \n        or retailer, including a distributor or retailer which it owns \n        or with which it is affiliated.\n            (2) Price determination.--For purposes of this subsection, \n        the price an owner or operator of a terminal facility charges a \n        distributor or retailer which it owns or with which it is \n        affiliated shall be the price determined pursuant to the \n        regulations issued under section 4(a).\n            (3) Exception.--A sale shall not be in violation of this \n        subsection if it is made pursuant to the terms of a franchise \n        or sales contract entered into before October 17, 2000.\n    (b) Civil Penalty.--The Federal Trade Commission may assess a civil \npenalty, not to exceed $1,000,000, for each violation described in \nsubsection (a).\n    (c) Criminal Penalty.--Whoever knowingly violates subsection (a) \nshall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not \nmore than 5 years.\n    (d) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect 6 months after \nthe date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. FULL DISCLOSURE.\n\n    (a) Requirement.--The Federal Trade Commission, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of Energy, shall issue regulations requiring full \ndisclosure by refiners and distributors of their wholesale motor fuel \npricing policies, including rebates, incentives, and market enhancement \nallowances. Such regulations shall establish procedures for determining \nthe price an owner or operator of a terminal facility charges a \ndistributor or retailer which it owns or with which it is affiliated.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The regulations issued under subsection (a) \nshall take effect 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Public Dissemination.--The Federal Trade Commission shall \nensure that all information acquired pursuant to the regulations issued \nunder subsection (a) are made available to the public, except trade \nsecrets and commercial or financial information protected from \ndisclosure under subsection (b)(4) of section 552 of title 5, United \nStates Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act). \nSuch information may be disseminated through the Energy Information \nAdministration.\n\nSEC. 5. OWNERSHIP STUDY AND REPORT.\n\n    Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, the Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Energy, shall transmit to the Congress a report containing the \nresults of a study of whether ownership or operation by a refiner of a \nfacility for the retail sale of motor fuel has anticompetitive effects \non the price of motor fuel. Such report shall include any \nrecommendations for legislative or administrative actions the Federal \nTrade Commission, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, \nconsiders appropriate.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act, any term defined in section 101 of the \nPetroleum Marketing Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 2801) shall have the \nmeaning given the term in that Act."
