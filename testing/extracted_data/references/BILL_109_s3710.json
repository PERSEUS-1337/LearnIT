FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) There are not enough qualified teachers in the Nation's \n        classrooms, and an unprecedented number of teachers will retire \n        over the next 5 years. Over the next decade, the Nation will \n        need to bring 2,000,000 new teachers into public schools.\n            (2) Too many teachers do not receive adequate preparation \n        for their jobs.\n            (3) More than one-third of children in grades 7 through 12 \n        are taught by a teacher who lacks both a college major and \n        certification in the subject being taught. Rates of ``out-of-\n        field teaching'' are especially high in high-poverty schools.\n            (4) Teacher turnover is a serious problem, particularly in \n        urban and rural areas. Over one-third of new teachers leave the \n        profession within their first 3 years of teaching, and 14 \n        percent of new teachers leave the field within the first year. \n        After 5 years--the average time it takes for teachers to \n        maximize students' learning--half of all new teachers will have \n        exited the profession. Rates of teacher attrition are highest \n        in high-poverty schools. Between 2000 and 2001, 1 out of 5 \n        teachers in the Nation's high-poverty schools either left to \n        teach in another school or dropped out of teaching altogether.\n            (5) African-American, Latino, and low-income students are \n        much less likely than other students to have highly-qualified \n        teachers.\n            (6) Research shows that individual teachers have a great \n        impact on how well their students learn. The most effective \n        teachers have been shown to be able to boost their pupils' \n        learning by a full grade level relative to students taught by \n        less effective teachers.\n            (7) Only 16 States finance new teacher induction programs, \n        and fewer still require inductees to be matched with mentors \n        who teach the same subject.\n            (8) Large-scale studies of effective professional \n        development have documented that student achievement and \n        teacher learning increases when professional development is \n        teacher-led, ongoing, and collaborative.\n            (9) Research shows that the characteristics of successful \n        professional development include a focus on concrete classroom \n        applications and practice, and opportunities for teacher \n        observation, critique, reflection, group support, and \n        collaboration.\n            (10) Data on school reform shows that teachers are \n        attracted to and continue to teach in academically challenged \n        schools when appropriate supports are in place to help them \n        succeed. Appropriate supports include high-quality induction \n        programs, job-embedded professional development, and small \n        classes which allow teachers to tailor instruction to meet the \n        needs of individual students.\n\nSEC. 3. IMPROVING RETENTION OF AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR PUBLIC \n              ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n\n                      ``PART E--TEACHER RETENTION\n\n``SEC. 2501.
