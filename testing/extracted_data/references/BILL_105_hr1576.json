FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) California's rapid population growth and the lack of \n        understanding about the environmental impacts of this growth \n        have caused a number of serious present and potential barriers \n        to future economic development of California.\n            (2) California has great environmental complexity and \n        diversity and a great variety of human interventions in its \n        ecosystem.\n            (3) Future environmental policies for California must be \n        informed by careful cost-benefit analysis that considers the \n        serious risks, and the benefits, of environmental policy.\n            (4) The California Urban Environmental Research and \n        Education Center promotes coordination of and collaboration on \n        environmentally sound economic development in California and \n        ensures that continued sustainable economic development can \n        occur.\n            (5) Due to the closing of many military facilities and \n        installations in California, such Center can provide important \n        assistance to the process of converting defense resources to \n        non-defense uses.\n            (6) The Center is in a position to develop model incentives \n        and remove market barriers so as to motivate greater private \n        sector involvement and investment in the solution of \n        environmental problems.\n\nSEC. 2.
