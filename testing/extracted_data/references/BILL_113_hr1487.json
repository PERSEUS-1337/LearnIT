Based on the knowledge gained from such demonstration \n        projects, the Department is capable of developing and applying \n        standards for permitting such arrangements more generally \n        without the use of such authority.\n            (2) The Inspector General of the Department of Health and \n        Human Services has issued a special advisory bulletin in July \n        1999 that indicates that there is no general authority for \n        waiving sanctions for any gain-sharing arrangements between \n        physicians and hospitals.\n            (3) Due to lack of capitalization, size limitations, risk \n        characteristics, and other factors, many hospitals and \n        physicians have been unable or unwilling to enter into gain-\n        sharing types of arrangements that meet the requirements of the \n        shared savings program.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish general \nstatutory authority within the Department of Health and Human Services \nto recognize gain-sharing and other incentive payment programs, other \nthan the shared savings program, that align incentives among hospitals \nand physicians to improve efficiency and decrease costs while \nmaintaining or improving quality care.\n    (c) Exception From Physician Self-Referral Prohibition.--Section \n1877(e) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395nn(e)) is amended by \nadding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(9) Payments under certain incentive payment programs \n        between hospitals and physicians.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--In the case of a monetary \n                incentive payment which is made by a hospital to a \n                physician under an incentive payment program (as \n                defined in subparagraph (B)) that meets requirements \n                established by the Secretary in consultation with the \n                Attorney General and the Inspector General of the \n                Department of Health and Human Services for purposes of \n                this paragraph.\n                    ``(B) Incentive payment program defined.--In this \n                paragraph, the term `incentive payment program' means a \n                program that is designed to align incentives among \n                hospitals and physicians (through techniques such as \n                product standardization, the substitution of lower cost \n                products, and care coordination initiatives that \n                encourage medically appropriate decreases in length of \n                stay) to improve efficiency and decrease costs while \n                maintaining or improving quality.''.\n    (d) Safe Harbor From Antikickback and Other Federal Sanctions.--\n            (1) Section 1128B(b)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)(3)) is amended--\n                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph \n                (I);\n                    (B) in subparagraph (J), by moving the indentation \n                2 ems to the left and by striking the period at the end \n                and inserting ``;
