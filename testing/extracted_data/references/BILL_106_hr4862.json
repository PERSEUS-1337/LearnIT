RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    (a) Religious Belief Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall be \nconstrued to authorize any government to burden any religious belief.\n    (b) Religious Exercise Not Regulated.--Nothing in this Act shall \ncreate any basis for restricting or burdening religious exercise or for \nclaims against a religious organization, including any religiously \naffiliated school or university, not acting under color of law.\n    (c) Claims to Funding Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall create \nor preclude a right of any religious organization to receive funding or \nother assistance from a government, or of any person to receive \ngovernment funding for a religious activity, but this Act may require a \ngovernment to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a \nsubstantial burden on religious exercise.\n    (d) Other Authority To Impose Conditions on Funding Unaffected.--\nNothing in this Act shall--\n            (1) authorize a government to regulate or affect, directly \n        or indirectly, the activities or policies of a person other \n        than a government as a condition of receiving funding or other \n        assistance; or\n            (2) restrict any authority that may exist under other law \n        to so regulate or affect, except as provided in this Act.\n    (e) Governmental Discretion in Alleviating Burdens on Religious \nExercise.--A government may avoid the preemptive force of any provision \nof this Act by changing the policy or practice that results in a \nsubstantial burden on religious exercise, by retaining the policy or \npractice and exempting the substantially burdened religious exercise, \nby providing exemptions from the policy or practice for applications \nthat substantially burden religious exercise, or by any other means \nthat eliminates the substantial burden.\n    (f) Effect on Other Law.--With respect to a claim brought under \nthis Act, proof that a substantial burden on a person's religious \nexercise affects, or removal of that burden would affect, commerce with \nforeign nations, among the several States, or with Indian tribes, shall \nnot establish any inference or presumption that Congress intends that \nany religious exercise is, or is not, subject to any law other than \nthis Act.\n    (g) Broad Construction.--This Act shall be construed in favor of a \nbroad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted \nby the terms of this Act and the Constitution.\n    (h) No Preemption or Repeal.--Nothing in this Act shall be \nconstrued to preempt State law, or repeal Federal law, that is equally \nas protective of religious exercise as, or more protective of religious \nexercise than, this Act.\n    (i) Severability.--If any provision of this Act or of an amendment \nmade by this Act, or any application of such provision to any person or \ncircumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this \nAct, the amendments made by this Act, and the application of the \nprovision to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\nSEC. 6. ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE UNAFFECTED.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect, interpret, or in \nany way address that portion of the first amendment to the Constitution \nprohibiting laws respecting an establishment of religion (referred to \nin this section as the ``Establishment Clause''). Granting government \nfunding, benefits, or exemptions, to the extent permissible under the \nEstablishment Clause, shall not constitute a violation of this Act. In \nthis section, the term ``granting'', used with respect to government \nfunding, benefits, or exemptions, does not include the denial of \ngovernment funding, benefits, or exemptions.\n\nSEC. 7.
