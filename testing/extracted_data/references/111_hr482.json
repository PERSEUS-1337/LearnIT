    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Frank Buckles World War I Memorial \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2017, the United States will commemorate the \n        centennial of its entry into World War I, which introduced the \n        American soldier to the world in what would become a familiar \n        role as defender, liberator, and promoter of peace and \n        democracy.\n            (2) The support provided by the United States to Great \n        Britain, France, and other allies in World War I marked the \n        first time in the history of the United States that American \n        soldiers went overseas to defend foreign soil against \n        aggression, and it marked the true beginning of ``the American \n        century''.\n            (3) Although World War I was called the ``Great War'' and \n        the ``War to End All Wars'', in fact, the United States would \n        commit its troops to the defense of foreign lands several more \n        times in the 20th century.\n            (4) While three of these subsequent conflicts, World War \n        II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, rightfully have \n        commemorative memorials on the National Mall in the District of \n        Columbia, there is no memorial to World War I on the Mall, even \n        though more Americans gave their lives in World War I than in \n        either the Korean War or the Vietnam War.\n            (5) While a memorial to General John Pershing and the \n        American Expeditionary Forces that he led during World War I is \n        located in the District of Columbia, that memorial is not \n        located on the Mall and does not commemorate the total \n        participation of the United States and its Armed Forces in \n        World War I.\n            (6) The District of Columbia War Memorial is located on the \n        Mall, adjacent to the Lincoln Reflecting Pool between the World \n        War II and Korean War memorials, and was erected in memory of \n        the 499 residents of the District of Columbia who died in World \n        War I.\n            (7) The District of Columbia War Memorial is in extreme \n        disrepair and is often overlooked by residents and visitors to \n        Washington.\n            (8) In recognition of the upcoming anniversaries of \n        America's entry into World War I, and of the armistice that \n        concluded World War I on November 11, 1918, and in order to \n        honor the members of the United States Armed Forces who served \n        in World War I and to ensure that future generations of \n        Americans will know the complete history of America's 20th-\n        century struggle against aggression and totalitarianism, it is \n        timely and proper to rededicate the site of the District of \n        Columbia War Memorial on the National Mall as a ``National and \n        District of Columbia World War I Memorial''.\n            (9) Because this Act authorizes the rededication and \n        related enhancement of a commemorative work that already \n        exists, and that is already sited within the Reserve as defined \n        in Commemorative Works Act, the provisions of the Commemorative \n        Works Act regarding site approval and location of commemorative \n        works do not apply to this Act.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.\n\n    The World War I Memorial Foundation is authorized to establish a \ncommemorative work rededicating the District of Columbia War Memorial \nas a National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial, \nincluding--\n            (1) full restoration of the existing District of Columbia \n        War Memorial; and\n            (2) the addition of an appropriate sculptural or other \n        commemorative element, which shall complement and preserve the \n        existing memorial and its landscape, at the site of the \n        existing memorial to make it a national memorial.\n\nSEC. 4. COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS FOR COMMEMORATIVE WORKS; LOCATION OF \n              MEMORIAL.\n\n    (a) In General.--Except as provided by subsection (b), the \nrededication of the District of Columbia War Memorial shall be in \naccordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United States Code (popularly \nknown as the Commemorative Works Act).\n    (b) Exception.--Sections 8908 and 8905 of title 40, United States \nCode shall not apply to this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\n    The Foundation shall solicit and accept private contributions for \nthe memorial.\n\nSEC. 6. DEPOSIT OF EXCESS FUNDS.\n\n    If, upon payment of all expenses of the rededication (including the \nmaintenance and preservation amount provided for in chapter 89 of title \n40, United States Code, or upon expiration of the authority for the \ncommemorative work under such chapter), there remains a balance of \nfunds received for the establishment of the commemorative work, the \nWorld War I Memorial Foundation shall transmit the amount of the \nbalance to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the account \nprovided for in section 8906(b) of title 40, United States Code."
