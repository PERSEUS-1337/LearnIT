STUDIES AND REPORTS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE \n              NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ON FOOD PRODUCTS FROM CLONED \n              ANIMALS.\n\n    (a) Study by the Department of Agriculture.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Agriculture (referred to \n        in this section as the ``Secretary''), in coordination with the \n        Economic Research Service, and after consultation with the \n        Secretary of Health and Human Services (acting through the \n        Commissioner of Food and Drugs), shall conduct a study on the \n        economic and trade impact of agricultural exports of food \n        products from cloned animals.\n            (2) Content of study.--The study under paragraph (1) shall \n        include--\n                    (A) an analysis of the domestic agricultural and \n                international trade economic implications of permitting \n                commercialization of milk and meat from cloned animals \n                and their progeny into the food supply, with special \n                attention to--\n                            (i) the impact on Federal agricultural \n                        expenditures; and\n                            (ii) meat and milk exports shifts that \n                        would take place as other countries react to \n                        that commercialization, including the potential \n                        for other countries to ban exports from the \n                        United States; and\n                    (B) estimates of the consumer and exporter \n                behavioral responses that must be factored into both \n                the economic impact analysis and the health impact \n                analysis required under this section.\n    (b) Study With the Government Accountability Office on Monitoring \nFood Products From Cloned Animals.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary, in coordination with \n        Comptroller General of the United States, shall conduct a study \n        on the programs in place at the Department of Agriculture to \n        monitor food products from cloned animals if such products \n        enter the food supply.\n            (2) Content of study.--The study under paragraph (1) shall \n        include an evaluation of the processes in place at the \n        Department of Agriculture to monitor food products from cloned \n        animals throughout the food supply. The study shall also \n        include a review of existing studies and literature, from the \n        United States and other countries and organizations, that \n        relate to the evaluation of the safety of food products from \n        cloned animals and methods for monitoring such products in the \n        food supply.\n    (c) Study With the Government Accountability Office on the Health \nEffects and Costs Attributable to Milk From Cloned Animals in the Food \nSupply.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with the \n        Secretary of Health and Human Services (acting through the \n        Commissioner of Food and Drugs), and in coordination with \n        Comptroller General of the United States, shall conduct a study \n        on the health effects and costs attributable to milk from \n        cloned animals in the food supply.\n            (2) Content of study.--The study under paragraph (1) shall \n        include an evaluation and measurement of the potential public \n        health effects and associated health care costs, including any \n        consumer behavior changes and negative impacts on nutrition, \n        and prevention of osteoporosis and other chronic disease that \n        result from any decrease in milk consumption, attributable to \n        the commercialization of milk from cloned animals and their \n        progeny.\n    (d) Study With the National Academy of Sciences.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall contract with the \n        National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study and report to \n        Congress regarding the safety of food products derived from \n        cloned animals.\n            (2) Content of study.--The study under paragraph (1) shall \n        include a review and an assessment of whether the studies \n        (including peer review studies), data, and analysis used in the \n        draft risk assessment issued by the Food and Drug \n        Administration entitled Animal Cloning: A Draft Risk Assessment \n        (issued on December 28, 2006) supported the conclusions drawn \n        by such draft risk assessment and--\n                    (A) whether there were a sufficient number of \n                studies to support such conclusions; and\n                    (B) whether additional pertinent studies and data \n                exist which were not considered in the draft risk \n                assessment and how this additional information affects \n                the conclusions drawn in such draft risk assessment.\n    (e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to impede ongoing scientific research in artificial \nreproductive health technologies.\n    (f) Timeframe for Studies.--The Secretary shall complete the \nstudies required under this section prior to issuance by the \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs of the final risk assessment on the \nsafety of cloned animals and food products derived from cloned animals.\n    (g) Continuance of Moratorium.--The voluntary moratorium on \nintroducing food from cloned animals or their progeny into the food \nsupply, as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act, shall remain \nin effect at least until the date that the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services (acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs) \nissues the final risk assessment described in subsection (f)."
