FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) As of 2013, more than 43,000,000 Americans are age 65 \n        or older. More than 75 percent of such individuals live with \n        chronic conditions which require assistance that helps them to \n        live in a home- or community-based setting. In 2012, almost \n        38,000,000 Americans of all ages reported having one or more \n        disabilities.\n            (2) As of 2012, there were over 800,000 home health aides \n        assisting older adults in their homes with activities of daily \n        living and some light housekeeping tasks such as changing \n        linens and preparing food. Direct care workers are critical as \n        families and friends strive to provide quality care for \n        individuals in the community.\n            (3) Estimates suggest that there are 52,000,000 to \n        65,000,000 informal caregivers helping to provide care to \n        adults with disabilities and illnesses. These caregivers help \n        with a range of tasks but more time is spent on tasks such as \n        shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, and laundry, and less \n        time is spent on activities of daily living such as feeding, \n        dressing, grooming, walking, bathing, and assistance toileting.\n            (4) Over 60 percent of all informal caregivers work either \n        full- or part-time. Even with the growing number of direct care \n        workers available, there is a shortage in the number of people \n        available to help support individuals who need extra assistance \n        to remain in the community.\n            (5) Only 12 percent of informal caregivers report having \n        used a respite service. Respite is a means of giving the \n        caregiver a break from their caregiving duties. Respite comes \n        in many forms and may include having the individual attend an \n        adult day program outside the home or having a friendly visitor \n        serve as a companion and provide light assistance while the \n        caregiver takes a break.\n            (6) Respite volunteer programs exist in many communities. \n        There is a range of ways that these programs offer incentives \n        to the volunteers. Some programs use a time-banking or service-\n        exchange approach as an incentive to engage volunteers, while \n        other programs access funds from private and public sources to \n        offer modest stipends to volunteers.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a \nCaregiver Corps program to foster the creation of community-based Corps \nprograms that provide for volunteer community service opportunities to \naddress the shortage of assistance available for older adults and \nindividuals with disabilities.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF CAREGIVER CORPS PROGRAM.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 399V-6.
