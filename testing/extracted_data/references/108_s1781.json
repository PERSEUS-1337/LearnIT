    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of \n2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Americans unjustly pay up to 1000 percent more to fill \n        their prescriptions than consumers in other countries;\n            (2) the United States is the largest market for \n        pharmaceuticals in the world, yet American consumers pay the \n        highest prices for pharmaceuticals in the world;\n            (3) an unaffordable drug is neither safe nor effective;\n            (4) allowing and structuring the importation of \n        prescription drugs ensures access to affordable drugs, thus \n        providing a level of safety to American consumers that \n        consumers do not currently enjoy;\n            (5) according to the Congressional Budget Office, American \n        seniors alone will spend $1,800,000,000,000 on pharmaceuticals \n        over the next 10 years; and\n            (6) allowing open pharmaceutical markets could save \n        American consumers at least $635,000,000,000 each year.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to give all Americans immediate relief from the \n        outrageously high cost of pharmaceuticals;\n            (2) to reverse the perverse economics of American \n        pharmaceutical markets;\n            (3) to allow the importation of drugs (excluding \n        pharmaceutical narcotics) only if the drugs and the facilities \n        in which the drugs are manufactured are approved by the Food \n        and Drug Administration; and\n            (4) to require that imported prescription drugs be packaged \n        and shipped using counterfeit-resistant technologies approved \n        by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, similar to the \n        technologies used to secure United States currency.\n\nSEC. 4. IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n    Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n384) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)--\n                    (A) by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting \n                ``Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment \n                of the Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of 2003, the \n                Secretary'';
