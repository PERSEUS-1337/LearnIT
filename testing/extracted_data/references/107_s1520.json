FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) State governments are viewed as strong partners in the \n        United States' national security efforts, particularly as \n        related to domestic terrorism.\n            (2) Information sharing is a critical part of terrorism \n        preparedness activities.\n            (3) Coordination efforts with public, private, nonprofit, \n        and for-profit hospitals and medical providers are essential to \n        the success of preventing the spread of a biological terrorist \n        attack.\n            (4) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have \n        implemented a solid structure with which to combat terrorism. \n        However, additional resources and direction are needed to \n        expand upon the program and accelerate its results.\n            (5) There are hundreds of infectious agents and toxins, but \n        only a small subgroup has the physical and biological \n        properties needed for a mass casualty producing biological \n        weapon.\n            (6) Most biological weapons programs concentrate on between \n        10 and 15 agents sharing the common characteristics of ease of \n        production, infectivity or toxicity, stability during \n        processing, storage and in the environment, and the ability to \n        effectively cause illness or death to an exposed population \n        with anthrax and small pox common to most lists.\n            (7) A comprehensive strategy that involves preventing an \n        attack from occurring and preparing the Federal, State, local \n        and private sectors in case such an attack were to occur is \n        critical to reducing the incidence of fatality if such an \n        attack were to occur.\n            (8) The intelligence community must make far greater use of \n        the biomedical communities in and out of government and the \n        United States national security community should include the \n        medical, public health and human service communities, which all \n        are critical to bioterrorism preparedness and response.\n            (9) Enhancing domestic preparedness by developing a \n        national bioterrorism surveillance and detection capacity, \n        developing and distributing rapid and more reliable diagnostic \n        capabilities and systems, developing a comprehensive strategy \n        for assuring surge capacity for health care, streamlining \n        national pharmaceutical stockpiling efforts, and increasing \n        research and development for new pharmaceuticals, vaccines and \n        antidotes are essential endeavors.\n            (10) Developing a clear strategy for working with the media \n        to help manage public apprehension and panic and to reexamine \n        and modernize the legal framework for epidemic control measures \n        and civil liberties, including working with States to achieve \n        greater harmony at the State and local level with management of \n        new threats must be done.\n            (11) The Administration of President Clinton took the \n        initiative to strengthen the public health infrastructure by \n        creating a pharmaceutical stockpile for civilian use, awarding \n        contracts for new small pox vaccine, researching the \n        development of new and improved diagnostics, drugs and \n        vaccines, helping to train first responders (police, fire \n        fighters and public health officials) and investing in new \n        technologies to help with detection of biological agents, but \n        this effort must be dramatically accelerated and far more money \n        and energy is needed to address the today's threats.\n\nSEC. 3.
