FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the ocean Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) fishery \n        adjacent to the States of Washington, Oregon, and California \n        has been successfully conserved and managed by those States \n        since the 19th century;\n            (2) in recognition of the need for coastwide conservation \n        of Dungeness crab, the States of Washington, Oregon, and \n        California have--\n                    (A) enacted certain laws that promote conservation \n                of the resource;\n                    (B) signed a memorandum of understanding declaring \n                the intent of those States to take mutually supportive \n                actions to further the management of Dungeness crab; \n                and\n                    (C) through the Pacific States Marine Fisheries \n                Commission, formed the Tri-State Dungeness Crab \n                Committee to provide a public forum for coordinating \n                conservation and management actions;\n            (3) tribal treaty rights to crab under the subproceeding \n        numbered 89-3 in United States v. Washington, D.C. No. CV-70-\n        09213, are being implemented by the State of Washington through \n        annual preseason negotiations with the affected Indian tribes;\n            (4) the expiration of interim authority referred to in \n        paragraph (7) will jeopardize the ability of the State to \n        effectively provide for State-tribal harvest agreements that \n        include restrictions on nontreaty fishers in the exclusive \n        economic zone;\n            (5) the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n        Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) requires that Federal \n        fishery management plans be established for fisheries that \n        require conservation and management;\n            (6) under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n        Management Act, several fisheries in the Atlantic and Pacific \n        Oceans, including king crab in the Gulf of Alaska, have \n        remained under the jurisdiction of individual States or \n        interstate organizations because conservation and management \n        can be better achieved without the implementation of a Federal \n        fishery management plan;\n            (7) section 112(d) of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (Public \n        Law 104-297; 110 Stat. 3596 though 3597) provided interim \n        authority for the States of Washington, Oregon, and California \n        to exercise limited jurisdiction over the ocean Dungeness crab \n        fishery in the exclusive economic zone and required the Pacific \n        Fishery Management Council to report to Congress on progress in \n        developing a fishery management plan for ocean Dungeness crab \n        and any impediments to that progress;\n            (8) the Pacific Fishery Management Council diligently \n        carried out the responsibilities referred to in paragraph (7) \n        by holding public hearings, requesting recommendations from a \n        committee of that Council and the Tri-State Dungeness Crab \n        Committee;\n            (9) representatives from the Indian tribes involved, the \n        west coast Dungeness crab industry, and the fishery management \n        agencies of the States of Washington, Oregon, and California \n        were consulted by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, and \n        the Council voted in public session on its final report; and\n            (10) by a unanimous vote, the Pacific Fishery Management \n        Council found that amending section 112 of the Sustainable \n        Fisheries Act and providing for permanent authority to the \n        States of Washington, Oregon, and California to manage, with \n        certain limitations, the ocean Dungeness crab fishery in that \n        portion of the exclusive economic zone adjacent to each of the \n        States, respectively, and continued participation by fishermen \n        and the Indian tribes subject to the tribal treaty rights \nreferred to in paragraph (3) would--\n                    (A) best accomplish the conservation and management \n                of the ocean Dungeness crab fishery; and\n                    (B) best serve the public interest.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide for the continued conservation and \n        management of ocean Dungeness crab in a manner that recognizes \n        the contributions of the States of Washington, Oregon, and \n        California and the needs of the Indian tribes that are subject \n        to the tribal treaty rights to crab described in subsection \n        (a)(3); and\n            (2) to carry out the recommendations that the Pacific \n        Fishery Management Council made in accordance with requirements \n        established by Congress.\n\nSEC. 3.
