FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The ability to diagnose, service, and repair a motor \n        vehicle in a timely, reliable, and affordable manner is \n        essential to the safety and well-being of automotive consumers \n        in the United States.\n            (2) Consumers are entitled to choose among competing repair \n        facilities for the convenient, reliable, and affordable repair \n        of their motor vehicles.\n            (3) Increased competition among repair facilities will \n        benefit vehicle owners in the United States.\n            (4) Computers of various kinds are increasingly being used \n        in motor vehicle systems, such as pollution control, \n        transmission, anti-lock brakes, electronic and mechanical \n        systems, heating and air-conditioning, mobile electronics, \n        airbags, and steering.\n            (5) The diagnosis, service, and repair of these vehicle \n        systems are essential to the safety and proper operation of \n        modern motor vehicles.\n            (6) In many instances, access codes prevent owners from \n        making, or having made, the necessary diagnosis, service, and \n        repair of their motor vehicles in a timely, convenient, \n        reliable, and affordable manner.\n            (7) Automobile manufacturers have restricted access to the \n        information motor vehicle owners need in order to diagnose, \n        service, and repair their vehicles, in a manner that has \n        hindered open competition among repair facilities.\n            (8) Consumers in the United States have benefited from the \n        availability of a competitive aftermarket industry, or parts \n        and accessories used in the repair, maintenance, or enhancement \n        of a motor vehicle. The American economy has also benefited \n        from the availability of a competitive aftermarket industry \n        that provides jobs to over 5 million workers in over 495,000 \n        businesses, and generates $200 billion in annual sales.\n            (9) Vehicle owners in the United States should have the \n        right--\n                    (A) to all information necessary to allow the \n                diagnosis, service, and repair of their vehicles;\n                    (B) to choose between original parts and \n                aftermarket parts when repairing their motor vehicles; \n                and\n                    (C) to make, or have made, repairs necessary to \n                keep their vehicles in reasonably good and serviceable \n                condition during the life of the vehicle.\n            (10) The restriction of vehicle repair information and \n        tools limits who can repair motor vehicles and what parts may \n        be used to repair those vehicles, which limits consumer choice, \n        impedes competition, and increases the costs of vehicle repair \n        for consumers.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are:\n            (1) To ensure the safety of all vehicle owners by requiring \n        disclosure of all information necessary for the proper \n        diagnosis, service, and repair of a vehicle in a timely, \n        affordable, and reliable manner.\n            (2) To encourage competition in the diagnosis, service, and \n        repair of motor vehicles.\n\nSEC. 3. MANUFACTURER DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Duty to Disclose.--The manufacturer of a motor vehicle sold or \nintroduced into commerce in the United States shall promptly provide to \nthe vehicle owner, or to a repair facility of the motor vehicle owner's \nchoosing, the information necessary to diagnose, service, or repair the \nvehicle. The motor vehicle manufacturer shall make available all non-\nemission-related service information, training information, and \ndiagnostic tools on a non-discriminatory basis to any repair facility \nof the owner's choosing, and shall not not limit such information to \nthose repair facilities within the manufacturers' approved network. The \ninformation to be made available shall include the following:\n            (1) The same service and training information related to \n        vehicle repair shall be made available to all independent \n        repair facilities in the same manner and extent as it is made \n        available to franchised dealerships, and shall include all \n        information needed to activate all controls that can be \n        activated by a franchised dealership.\n            (2) The same diagnostic tools and capabilities related to \n        vehicle repair that are made available to franchised \n        dealerships shall be made available to independent repair \n        facilities. These diagnostic tools and capabilities shall be \n        made available for purchase by motor vehicle owners or their \n        agents through reasonable business means. The service and \n        training information and manufacturer diagnostic capabilities \n        shall be available to independent repair facilities, and to the \n        companies from which they normally purchase diagnostic tools, \n        without the need for the motor vehicle owner to return to a \n        franchised dealership.\n    (b) Protection of Trade Secrets.--Nothing in this Act shall be \ndeemed to require the disclosure of trade secrets, nor the public \ndisclosure of any information related exclusively to the design and \nmanufacture of motor vehicle parts. No information necessary to repair \na vehicle shall be withheld by a manufacturer if such information is \nprovided (directly or indirectly) to franchised dealerships or other \nrepair facilities.\n\nSEC. 4.

The regulations shall take effect upon final \nissuance of such regulations and shall apply to vehicles manufactured \nafter model year 1994.\n    (b) Limitation.--The Federal Trade Commission may not prescribe \nrules that interfere with the authority of, or conflict with rules \nprescribed by, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \nunder section 202(m) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521(m)) with \nregard to motor vehicle emissions control diagnostics systems.\n\nSEC. 5.
