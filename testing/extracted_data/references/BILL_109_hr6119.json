FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Tribes have established treaty rights to take \n        shellfish from public and private tidelands in Washington \n        State, including from some lands owned, leased, or otherwise \n        subject to harvest by commercial shellfish Growers;\n            (2) the district court that adjudicated the Tribes' treaty \n        rights to take shellfish found that the Growers are innocent \n        purchasers who had no notice of the Tribes' fishing right when \n        they acquired their properties;\n            (3) numerous unresolved issues remain outstanding regarding \n        implementation of the Tribes' treaty right to take shellfish \n        from lands owned, leased, or otherwise subject to harvest by \n        the Growers;\n            (4) the Tribes, the Growers, the State of Washington, and \n        the United States Department of the Interior have resolved by a \n        Settlement Agreement many of the disputes between and among \n        them regarding implementation of the Tribes' treaty right to \n        take shellfish from covered tidelands owned or leased by the \n        Growers;\n            (5) the Settlement Agreement does not provide for \n        resolution of any claims to take shellfish from lands owned or \n        leased by the Growers that potentially may be brought in the \n        future by ``Other Tribes'';\n            (6) in the absence of congressional actions, the prospect \n        of ``Other Tribes'' claims to take shellfish from lands owned \n        or leased by the Growers could be pursued through the courts, a \n        process which in all likelihood could consume many years and \n        thereby promote uncertainty in the State of Washington and the \n        Growers and to the ultimate detriment of both the Tribes and \n        Other Tribes and their members;\n            (7) in order to avoid this uncertainty, it is the intent of \n        Congress that Other Tribes have the option of resolving their \n        claims, if any, to a treaty right to take shellfish from \n        covered tidelands owned or leased by the Growers; and\n            (8) this Act represents a good faith effort on the part of \n        Congress to extend to Other Tribes the same fair and just \n        option of resolving their claims to take shellfish from covered \n        tidelands owned or leased by the Growers that the Tribes have \n        agreed to in the Settlement Agreement.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to approve, ratify, and confirm the Settlement \n        Agreement entered into by and among the Tribes, commercial \n        shellfish growers, the State of Washington and the United \n        States on _____, 2006;\n            (2) to provide Other Tribes with a fair and just resolution \n        of any claims to take shellfish from ``covered tidelands'', as \n        that term is defined in the Settlement Agreement, that \n        potentially could be brought in the future by Other Tribes; and\n            (3) to authorize the Secretary to implement the terms and \n        conditions of the Settlement Agreement and this Act.\n\nSEC. 3.

The \n        Secretary shall deposit funds in the amount of $1,500,000 into \n        the Special Holding Account in fiscal year 2011 at such time as \n        appropriated pursuant to section 5.\n            (2) The Special Holding Account shall be maintained and \n        invested by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Act \n        of June 24, 1938 as amended (25 U.S.C. 162a) until such time \n        that all monies are transferred from the Special Holding \n        Account.\n            (3) If a court of competent jurisdiction renders a final \n        decision declaring that any of the Other Tribes has an \n        established treaty right to take or harvest shellfish in \n        covered tidelands, as that term is defined in the Settlement \n        Agreement, and such tribe opts to accept a share of the Special \n        Holding Account, rather than litigate this claim against the \n        Growers, the Secretary shall transfer the appropriate share of \n        the monies held in the Special Holding Account to each such \n        tribe of the Other Tribes in the amounts appropriate to \n        compensate the Other Tribes in the same manner and for the same \n        purposes as the Tribes who are signatory to the Settlement \n        Agreement.

However, the \n        Secretary may continue to maintain the Special Holding Account \n        in order to resolve the claim of an Other Tribe that has \n        notified the Secretary in writing within the 20-year term of \n        that Tribe's interest in resolving its claim in the manner \n        provided for in this Act.\n            (7) It is the intent of Congress that the Other Tribes, if \n        any, shall have the option of agreeing to similar rights and \n        responsibilities as the Tribes that are signatories to the \n        Settlement Agreement, if they opt not to litigate against the \n        Growers.\n    (c) Annual Report.--Each tribe of the Tribes, or any of the Other \nTribes accepting a settlement of its claims to shellfish on covered \nlands pursuant to (b)(3), shall submit to the Secretary an annual \nreport that describes all expenditures made with monies withdrawn from \nthe Fund or Special Holding Account during the year covered by the \nreport.\n    (d) Judicial and Administrative Action.--The Secretary may take \njudicial or administrative action to ensure that any monies withdrawn \nfrom the Fund or Special Holding Account are used in accordance with \nthe purposes described in the Settlement Agreement and this Act.\n    (e) Clarification of Trust Responsibility.--Beginning on the date \nthat monies are transferred to a tribe of the Tribes or a tribe of the \nOther Tribes pursuant to this Act, any trust responsibility or \nliability of the United States with respect to the expenditure or \ninvestment of the monies withdrawn shall cease.\n\nSEC. 7.

Washington, Civ. No. 9213 (Western District \nof Washington).\n    (b) Certain Rights Governed by This Act.--If a tribe falling within \nthe category Other Tribes opts to resolve its claims to take shellfish \nfrom covered tidelands owned or leased by the Growers pursuant to \nsection 6(b)(3) of this Act, that tribe's rights shall be governed by \nthis Act, as well as by the decisions of the Courts in United States v. \nWashington, Civ. No. 9213.\n    (c) No Breach of Trust.--Notwithstanding whether the United States \nhas a duty to initiate such an action, the failure or declination by \nthe United States to initiate any action to enforce any Other Tribe(s) \ntreaty rights to take shellfish from public and private tidelands in \nWashington State, including from covered tidelands owned, leased, or \notherwise subject to harvest by any and all Growers shall not \nconstitute a breach of trust by the United States or be compensable to \nOther Tribes.\n\nSEC. 9.
