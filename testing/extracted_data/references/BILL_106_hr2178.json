In \n        implementing this paragraph, the Secretary shall not establish \n        any restrictions on the activities that would prevent the \n        occurrence of such necessary activities or that would reduce \n        the water supply provided by the Colorado-Big Thompson Project \n        or the Windy Gap Project.\n            (3) Relation to authority in act establishing park.--\n        Nothing in the first section of the Act of January 26, 1915 (16 \n        U.S.C. 191; 38 Stat. 798), shall be construed to permit \n        development within the lands designated as wilderness by \n        section 2(a) of any reclamation project not in existence as of \n        the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (e) Exclusions.--\n            (1) Exclusion of certain lands.--Boundaries for the Rocky \n        Mountain National Park Wilderness and the potential wilderness \n        lands specifically exclude the following:\n                    (A) The Grand Ditch (including both the main canal \n                of the Grand Ditch and a branch thereof known as the \n                specimen Ditch) and its right-of-way as well as \n                associated appurtenances, structures, buildings, camps, \n                and work sites in existence as of June 1, 1998.\n                    (B) Lands owned by the St. Vrain & Left Hand Water \n                Conservancy District, including Copeland Reservoir and \n                the inlet ditch to such reservoir from the North St. \n                Vrain Creek, amounting to approximately 35.38 acres.\n            (2) Relation to lands outside wilderness.--Nothing in this \n        Act shall affect the management or use of any lands not \n        included within the boundaries of the Rocky Mountain National \n        Park Wilderness or the potential wilderness lands.\n    (f) No Buffer Zones.--Congress does not intend that the designation \nby this Act of the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness creates or \nimplies the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around \nthe wilderness area.
