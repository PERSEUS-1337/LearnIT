FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Advances in scientific knowledge reveal that our \n        nearest living relatives, great apes (including chimpanzees, \n        bonobos, gorillas, orangutans and gibbons), bear an exceedingly \n        close genetic relationship to humans.\n            (2) Great apes are highly intelligent and social animals \n        and research laboratory environments involving invasive \n        research cannot meet their complex social and psychological \n        needs.\n            (3) Confinement of great apes for purposes of invasive \n        research causes these intelligent and sentient animals to \n        experience harmful stress and suffering, such as profound \n        depression and withdrawal, self mutilation that can result in \n        physical wounding, hair pulling, rocking, and other traumatized \n        or psychotic behaviors.\n            (4) Invasive research performed on great apes, and the \n        breeding of great apes for these purposes, are economic in \n        nature and substantially affect interstate commerce.\n            (5) The majority of invasive research and testing conducted \n        on great apes in the United States is for the end purpose of \n        developing drugs, pharmaceuticals, and other products to be \n        sold in the interstate market.\n            (6) The total costs associated with great ape research have \n        a direct economic impact on interstate commerce.\n            (7) Care in a research laboratory for a single great ape \n        over the lifespan of the great ape of more than 50 years can \n        cost between $300,000 and $500,000, compared to an approximate \n        cost of $275,000 for high quality care in a sanctuary.\n            (8) An overwhelming majority of invasive research \n        procedures performed on great apes involve some element of \n        interstate commerce, such that great apes, equipment, and \n        researchers have traveled across state lines.\n            (9) The regulation of animals and activities as provided in \n        this Act are necessary to effectively regulate interstate and \n        foreign commerce.\n            (10) Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, New \n        Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have banned or severely \n        limited experiments on great apes and several other countries \n        and the European Union are considering similar bans as well.\n            (11) The National Research Council (NRC) report entitled \n        ``Chimpanzees in Research and Strategies for their Ethical \n        Care, Management, and Use,'' concluded that--\n                    (A) there is a ``moral responsibility'' for the \n                long-term care of chimpanzees used for scientific \n                research;\n                    (B) there should be a moratorium on further \n                chimpanzee breeding;\n                    (C) euthanasia as a means of general chimpanzee \n                population control is unacceptable; and\n                    (D) sanctuaries should be created to house \n                chimpanzees in a manner consistent with high standards \n                of lifetime care, social enrichment, and cognitive \n                development.\n            (12) In December 2000, the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, \n        Maintenance, and Protection (CHIMP) Act was signed into law, \n        requiring the Federal Government to provide for permanent \n        ``retirement'' of chimpanzees who are identified ``as no longer \n        being needed in research''.\n            (13) In May 2007, the National Institutes of Health's \n        National Center for Research Resources' (NCRR) decided to \n        permanently end funding for the breeding of Government-owned \n        chimpanzees for research.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purpose of this Act is to--\n            (1) prohibit invasive research and the funding of such \n        research both within and outside of the United States on great \n        apes;\n            (2) prohibit the transport of great apes for purposes of \n        invasive research;\n            (3) prohibit the breeding of great apes for purposes of \n        invasive research; and\n            (4) require the permanent retirement of federally owned \n        great apes.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITIONS.\n\n    (a) Invasive Research Prohibition.--No person shall conduct \ninvasive research on a great ape.\n    (b) Federal Funding Prohibition.--No Federal funds may be used to \nconduct invasive research on a great ape.\n    (c) Transport Prohibition.--No person shall knowingly import, \nexport, transport, move, deliver, receive, possess, rent, loan, \npurchase, or sell a great ape for the purpose of conducting invasive \nresearch on such great ape.\n    (d) Breeding Prohibition.--No person shall breed a great ape for \nuse in invasive research.\n    (e) Exemption.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit or \nprevent individualized medical care performed on a great ape by a \nlicensed veterinarian for the benefit of the great ape.\n\nSEC. 4. RETIREMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services shall provide for the permanent retirement of all \ngreat apes owned or under the control of the Federal Government that \nhave been used for invasive research.\n    (b) Exception.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services may \nprovide for the euthanizing of a great ape owned or under the control \nof the Federal Government that has been used for invasive research if \neuthanasia is in the best interests of such great ape, as determined by \nan attending veterinarian and endorsed by a second, unaffiliated \nveterinarian.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n     (a) Great Ape.--The term ``great ape'' includes a chimpanzee, \ngorilla, bonobo, orangutan, or gibbon.\n    (b) Invasive Research.--The term ``invasive research''--\n            (1) means any experimental research that may cause death, \n        bodily injury, pain, distress, fear, injury, or trauma to a \n        great ape, including--\n                    (A) the testing of any drug or intentional exposure \n                to a substance that may be detrimental to the health of \n                a great ape;\n                    (B) research that involves penetrating or cutting \n                the body or removing body parts, restraining, \n                tranquilizing, or anesthetizing a great ape; or\n                    (C) isolation, social deprivation, or other \n                experimental physical manipulations that may be \n                detrimental to the health or psychological well-being \n                of a great ape; and\n            (2) does not include--\n                    (A) close observation of natural or voluntary \n                behavior of a great ape, provided that the research \n                does not require removal of the great ape from the \n                social group or environment of such great ape or \n                require an anesthetic or sedation event to collect data \n                or record observations; or\n                    (B) post-mortem examination of a great ape \n                following the natural death of such great ape.\n    (c) Permanent Retirement.--The term ``permanent retirement''--\n            (1) means that a great ape is placed in a suitable \n        sanctuary that will provide for the lifetime care of the great \n        ape and such great ape will not be used in further invasive \n        research; and\n            (2) does not include euthanasia.\n    (d) Person.--The term ``person'' means--\n            (1) an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, \n        association, or any other private entity,\n            (2) any officer, employee, agent, department, or \n        instrumentality of the Federal Government, a State, \n        municipality, or political subdivision of a State; or\n            (3) any other entity subject to the jurisdiction of the \n        United States.\n    (e) Suitable Sanctuary.--The term ``suitable sanctuary'' means--\n            (1) the system referred to in section 481C(a) of the Public \n        Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 287a-3a(a)); or\n            (2) a comparable privately funded sanctuary approved by the \n        Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nSEC. 6.
