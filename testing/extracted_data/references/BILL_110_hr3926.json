FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds that--\n            (1) mitigation planning is the foundation for saving lives, \n        protecting residential and commercial properties, and \n        developing disaster resistant communities;\n            (2) recent studies of the performance of building \n        structures during disasters have demonstrated that the adoption \n        and active enforcement of State building codes have greatly \n        reduced residential and commercial property damage and personal \n        injury resulting from major disasters;\n            (3) modern building codes govern all aspects of \n        construction and are designed to ensure that single-family \n        residential dwellings and commercial structures are protected \n        from natural disasters;\n            (4) the people of the United States rely on active \n        enforcement of modern building codes for assurance that minimum \n        standards for reducing personal injuries and property damages \n        have been met in the buildings they live in, work in, and visit \n        everyday;\n            (5) active enforcement of building codes plays an \n        increasingly important role in public safety and loss \n        prevention of residential and commercial property;\n            (6) active enforcement of building codes based on \n        nationally recognized models reduces the need for public \n        disaster aid, creates sustainable communities, promotes a level \n        and consistent playing field for design professionals, \n        suppliers, and builders, and can contribute to the durability \n        of residential and commercial structures;\n            (7) under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n        Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), the Federal \n        Emergency Management Agency provides Federal assistance to \n        States for mitigation efforts;\n            (8) it is beneficial and appropriate to expand Federal \n        mitigation assistance to encourage States to take a \n        comprehensive and integrated approach to disaster loss \n        reduction; and\n            (9) it is beneficial to the Federal Government and \n        appropriate that Federal mitigation assistance be used to \n        encourage the adoption and active enforcement of State building \n        codes as a disaster mitigation strategy under the auspices of a \n        comprehensive disaster loss reduction plan.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n     The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) substantially mitigate the occurrence of loss to \n        residential and commercial property, reduce and minimize damage \n        when losses to residential and commercial property occur, \n        improve the quality and value of residential and commercial \n        property, and reduce the need for public disaster aid;\n            (2) provide incentives for the adoption and active \n        enforcement of State building codes;\n            (3) encourage States to continue their key responsibility \n        to coordinate all State and local activities relating to hazard \n        evaluation and mitigation, as specified in section 201.3(c) of \n        title 44, Code of Federal Regulations, through the adoption and \n        active enforcement of State building codes; and\n            (4) encourage States to require that local governments use \n        a current version of a nationally applicable model building \n        code that address natural hazards as a basis for design and \n        construction of State-sponsored mitigation projects described \n        in section 201.5(b)(4)(iv) of title 44, Code of Federal \n        Regulations.\n\nSEC. 4. ADDITIONAL MITIGATION ASSISTANCE.\n\n    Section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \nAssistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(d) Additional Mitigation Assistance.--\n            ``(1) In general.--If, at the time of a declaration of a \n        major disaster, the affected State has in effect and is \n        actively enforcing throughout the State an approved State \n        building code, the President may increase the maximum total of \n        contributions under this section for the major disaster, as \n        specified in subsection (a) and section 322(e), by an amount \n        equal to 4 percent of the estimated aggregate amount of grants \n        to be made (less any associated administrative costs) under \n        this Act with respect to the major disaster.\n            ``(2) Submission.--To be eligible for an increased Federal \n        share under paragraph (1), a State, at least once every 6 \n        years, shall submit its State building code to the President \n        for approval.\n            ``(3) Approval.--The President shall approve a State \n        building code submitted under paragraph (2) if the President \n        determines that the building code--\n                    ``(A) is consistent with the most recent version of \n                a nationally recognized model building code;\n                    ``(B) has been adopted by the State within 6 years \n                of the most recent version of the nationally recognized \n                model building code; and\n                    ``(C) uses the nationally recognized model building \n                code as a minimum standard.\n            ``(4) Definitions.--In this subsection, the following \n        definitions apply:\n                    ``(A) Actively enforcing.--The term `actively \n                enforcing' means effective jurisdictional execution of \n                all phases of a State building code in the process of \n                examination and approval of construction plans, \n                specifications, and technical data and the inspection \n                of new construction or renovation.\n                    ``(B) Nationally recognized model building code.--\n                The term `nationally recognized model building code' \n                means a building code for residential and commercial \n                construction and construction materials that--\n                            ``(i) has been developed and published by a \n                        code organization in an open consensus type \n                        forum with input from national experts; and\n                            ``(ii) is based on national structural \n                        design standards that establish minimum \n                        acceptable criteria for the design, \n                        construction, and maintenance of residential \n                        and commercial buildings for the purpose of \n                        protecting the health, safety, and general \n                        welfare of the building's users against natural \n                        disasters.\n                    ``(C) State building code.--The term `State \n                building code' means requirements and associated \n                standards for residential and commercial construction \n                and construction materials that are implemented on a \n                statewide basis by ordinance, resolution, law, housing \n                or building code, or zoning ordinance.
