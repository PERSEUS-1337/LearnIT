FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the historical significance of the 52-mile Going-to-\n        the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park, Montana, is recognized \n        by its--\n                    (A) listing on the National Register of Historic \n                Places in 1983;\n                    (B) designation as a National Historic Engineering \n                Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in \n                1985; and\n                    (C) designation as a National Historic Landmark in \n                1997;\n            (2) in 1997, recommendations of the Federal Highway \n        Administration concerning, and an engineering study of, the \n        Road verified significant structural damage to the Road has \n        occurred since the Road opened in 1932;\n            (3) infrastructure at most of the developed areas in the \n        Park is inadequate for cold-season (fall, winter, and spring) \n        operation, and maintenance backlog needs exist for normal \n        summer operation;\n            (4) the Many Glacier Hotel and Lake McDonald Lodge are on \n        the National Register of Historic Places and are National \n        Historic Landmarks;\n            (5) other accommodations operated by the concessionaire \n        that have possessory interest and are listed on the National \n        Register of Historic Places are the Rising Sun Motor Inn and \n        Swiftcurrent Motel;\n            (6) the historic hotels in the Park, operated under \n        concession agreements with the National Park Service, are \n        essential for public use and enjoyment of the Park;\n            (7) visitors to the Park deserve safe hotels in the Park \n        that meet basic needs and expectations;\n            (8) the historic hotels in the Park have deteriorated \n        significantly and need substantial repair;\n            (9) repairs of the hotels in the Park have been deferred \n        for so long that, absent any changes to the Federal law \n        governing concessionaires and the availability of historic tax \n        credits for up to 39.5 years, the remodeling costs for the \n        hotels exceed the capacity of the hotel concessionaire to \n        finance the repairs with hotel revenues;\n            (10) the remodeling costs of Park hotels are so high that \n        the concessionaire will need to finance the cost of those \n        repairs by borrowing the remodeling expenses and repaying them \n        over time out of net hotel income, which by current law is \n        limited to 20-year concession agreements;\n            (11) the season of operation for hotels is about 4 months \n        because the developed areas of the Park lack--\n                    (A) water, sewer, and fire protection systems that \n                can operate in freezing conditions;\n                    (B) building insulation; and\n                    (C) heating systems;\n            (12) because of many factors, including the high projected \n        costs of remodeling, the relatively short tourist season in the \n        Park, and the requirement that concession agreements may not \n        exceed 20 years, concessionaires are unable to carry out the \n        scope of remodeling that is needed for the hotels in the Park;\n            (13) the National Park Service Concessions Management \n        Improvement Act of 1998 (16 U.S.C. 5951 et seq.) is based on \n        sound principles and is achieving its basic purposes, but there \n        appear to be selected instances in which the National Park \n        Service needs additional authority to conduct demonstration \n        projects; and\n            (14) a demonstration project is needed to carry out repairs \n        of the historic hotels in the Park.\n\nSEC. 2.
