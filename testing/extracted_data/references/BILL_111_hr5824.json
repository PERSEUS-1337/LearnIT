FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The average family spends about half of its income on \n        transportation and housing costs.\n            (2) Housing affordability has traditionally been measured \n        as the extent to which a household's income can cover the \n        purchase price of a home or the monthly rent.\n            (3) Households in location-efficient communities can \n        experience substantial savings on transportation costs as a \n        result of lower car ownership, higher transit usage, and more \n        accessible amenities such as stores and restaurants within \n        walking distance.\n            (4) In certain auto-dependent areas, transportation costs \n        can be very high, leaving families with less money for housing, \n        food, healthcare, and other important expenses.\n            (5) Currently, transportation costs and savings are not \n        taken into account in government affordability measures and \n        standards, and information is not generally available to \n        consumers looking to purchase homes.\n            (6) Low-income housing tax credits, downpayment assistance \n        grants, and rental assistance under section 8 of the United \n        States Housing Act of 1937, for example, are all awarded and \n        used without regard to this transportation cost burden.\n            (7) A community's location, character, and design can \n        contribute to overall affordability of the community more than \n        household size and income.\n            (8) Households with annual incomes between $20,000 and \n        $35,000 and located far from job centers spend 70 percent of \n        their incomes on housing and transportation combined.\n            (9) Studies have shown that 63 percent of federally \n        assisted housing units located within one-half mile of public \n        transit may no longer be affordable to low- and moderate-income \n        families by 2012. At the same time, of the more than 250,000 \n        affordable apartments within one-half mile of public transit in \n        20 metropolitan areas studied, more than two-thirds of the \n        Federal subsidies that keep these apartments affordable will \n        expire within the next 5 years.\n            (10) Existing and future affordable housing stock should be \n        taken into account by local agencies when planning economic \n        development and transit projects, to ensure that the combined \n        housing and transportation costs remain affordable.\n            (11) The preservation of existing affordable housing stock, \n        particularly if it is located within one-half mile of public \n        transit or other neighborhood amenities, should be a priority \n        for local, State, and Federal agencies.\n            (12) Potential homebuyers should have information about the \n        transportation costs associated with their housing choices to \n        enable fully informed decisionmaking.\n            (13) Incorporating transportation costs into affordability \n        measures can enable stakeholders, citizens, and decisionmakers \n        at all levels of government coordinate and target investment \n        decisions, strategies, and plans to lower transportation \n        burdens.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To provide consumers with information about the costs \n        of housing based on its location.\n            (2) To recognize transportation costs as a key element of \n        housing affordability.\n            (3) To ensure transparency in housing and transportation \n        costs for consumers, housing providers, local and regional \n        planning agencies, Federal agencies, and other stakeholders.\n            (4) To enable the Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development, as appropriate, to incorporate transportation \n        costs associated with the location of housing, including \n        neighborhood characteristics such as density, walkability, the \n        availability of quality transit service, and convenient access \n        to amenities, into affordability measures and standards.\n            (5) To help communities recognize the importance of \n        providing transportation and housing choices for their \n        residents.\n\nSEC. 3. TRANSPORTATION AFFORDABILITY INDEX.\n\n    (a) Development.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban \n        Development shall, through a public process, develop a \n        transportation affordability index that measures the \n        transportation costs associated with the location of a home, \n        both on a neighborhood and regional basis.\n            (2) Agreements.--In developing the index, the Secretary may \n        enter into agreements with existing entities for access to, and \n        may rely upon, previously developed databases, consistent with \n        Federal procurement guidelines.\n            (3) Additional location-specific costs.--The Secretary \n        shall conduct research and analysis as to other location-\n        specific costs associated with a home and determine the \n        feasibility of including such costs into the index to be \n        developed under this subsection.\n    (b) Participation.--In developing the transportation affordability \nindex, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of \nTransportation, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture, \nreal estate, development, housing, and transportation professionals, \nlocal and State governments, low-income housing advocates, researchers, \nand other appropriate parties.\n    (c) Factors.--The transportation affordability index developed \nunder this section for a household, property, community, or region \nshall take into consideration appropriate factors, including at least \nthe following factors:\n            (1) Location and, to the extent practicable, frequency of \n        service for bus, rail, light rail, streetcar, ferry service, \n        and other public transportation options within \\1/4\\, \\1/2\\, \n        and 1 mile of the property. The Secretary shall consult with \n        the Secretary of Transportation on ways to better incorporate \n        the frequency of bus, transit and other public transportation \n        options into the index.\n            (2) If available, the average daily vehicle miles traveled \n        for the census block group in which the property is located.\n            (3) The availability within, and accessibility to, services \n        within \\1/2\\ mile of the property, including grocery stores, \n        parks, bicycle lanes or paths or other bicycle facilities, \n        community centers, restaurants, coffee shops, medical \n        facilities, laundry/cleaners, libraries, schools, plazas/town \n        squares, banks, and day care facilities, and other services.\n            (4) Proximity of the property to local and regional \n        employment centers.\n            (5) Net residential density, as measured by households per \n        residential acre.\n            (6) Any other factor that the Secretary determines would \n        help improve the availability of information about \n        transportation costs of housing\n    (d) Availability.--Upon development of the transportation \naffordability index under this section, the Secretary shall make the \nindex--\n            (1) publicly available through the Internet;\n            (2) available to Multiple Listing Services for real estate \n        in a format that provides for incorporation into such Services;\n            (3) available to regional and metropolitan planning \n        organizations for use in regional transportation plans and \n        models;\n            (4) available to local housing and planning agencies for \n        possible use in developing Consolidated Plans for formula grant \n        programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n            (5) available to States, local governments, nonprofit \n        organizations, and other entities that provide financial \n        literacy counseling to households; and\n            (6) available to transportation management agencies and \n        other entities that engage in transportation demand management \n        programs.\n    (e) Report to Congress; Workshops; Pilot Projects.--The Secretary \nshall--\n            (1) provide a report to the Congress, not later than 120 \n        days of the date of the enactment of this Act, that identifies \n        in detail--\n                    (A) the opportunities for, and the barriers to, the \n                development of the transportation affordability index \n                and related housing affordability measures;\n                    (B) the means and methods the Secretary intends to \n                adopt for overcoming such barriers;\n                    (C) an implementation plan for developing, \n                piloting, and adopting alternative housing \n                affordability measures; and\n                    (D) the potential uses of the index established \n                pursuant to section 3 to guide housing programs;\n            (2) convene public workshops or other suitable events to \n        solicit input into the process from the public and \n        stakeholders;\n            (3) conduct one or more pilot projects as may be necessary \n        to test the feasibility of incorporating transportation costs \n        into current definitions of affordability; and\n            (4) collect and publicly disseminate information about \n        which public housing projects and other HUD-assisted housing \n        projects are located within \\1/2\\ mile of bus, rail, light \n        rail, street car, or ferry service.\n    (f) Periodic Updates.--The Secretary shall update the \ntransportation affordability index under this section at least once \nevery five years, or more frequently if feasible.\n\nSEC. 4.
