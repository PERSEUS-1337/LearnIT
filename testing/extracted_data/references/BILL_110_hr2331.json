FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in the periods before, during, and after major \n        disasters that occurred not long before the date of enactment \n        of this Act (including Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and \n        the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001), local media \n        organizations (including newspapers, public and private \n        broadcasters, and online publications) provided a valuable \n        public service by transmitting and publishing disaster-related \n        information, guidance, and assistance;\n            (2) local broadcasters, public and private, provided a \n        particularly valuable public service by transmitting evacuation \n        instructions, warnings of impending threats, timely response \n        status updates, and other essential information related to such \n        major disasters to listeners and viewers to whom other forms of \n        media were often unavailable or inaccessible;\n            (3) an inability to access a disaster area may impede the \n        ability of local media organizations to provide such public \n        services;\n            (4) according to the report by the Committee on Homeland \n        Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, titled \n        ``Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared'', dated May \n        2006, ``It is essential that the news media receive accurate \n        disaster information to circulate to the public. News media can \n        also help inform the public by reporting on rumors and \n        soliciting evidence and comment on their plausibility, if \n        any'';\n            (5) according to testimony provided on September 22, 2005, \n        to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of \n        the Senate, an estimated 100 Gulf Coast broadcast stations were \n        unable to broadcast as a result of Hurricane Katrina, with \n        approximately 28 percent of television stations and \n        approximately 35 percent of radio stations unable to broadcast \n        in the area affected by Hurricane Katrina;\n            (6) according to testimony provided on September 7, 2005, \n        to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of \n        Representatives, following Hurricane Katrina only 4 of the 41 \n        radio broadcast stations in the New Orleans metropolitan area \n        remained on the air in the immediate aftermath of that \n        hurricane;\n            (7) the only television station in New Orleans to continue \n        transmitting its over-the-air signal uninterrupted during and \n        after Hurricane Katrina was able to do so only as a direct \n        result of steps taken to better protect its transmitter and \n        provide redundant production facilities in the region;\n            (8) fuel and other supply shortages inhibit the ability of \n        a broadcaster to stay on the air and provide essential public \n        information following a major disaster;\n            (9) according to the report by the Committee on Homeland \n        Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, titled \n        ``Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared'', dated May \n        2006, there were instances of Federal authorities confiscating \n        privately-purchased fuel supplies in the area affected by \n        Hurricane Katrina;\n            (10) the ability of several broadcasters in Mississippi to \n        remain on the air was unduly compromised by the confiscation of \n        their privately-purchased fuel supplies;\n            (11) practices put in place following Hurricane Andrew to \n        involve broadcasters in disaster response and expedite access \n        by broadcast engineers to disaster areas for the purpose of \n        repairing critical-to-air facilities and infrastructure has \n        significantly increased the ability of broadcasters in Florida \n        to continue transmitting essential public information during \n        subsequent major disasters;\n            (12) a June 12, 2006, report to the Federal Communications \n        Commission from the Independent Panel Reviewing the Impact of \n        Hurricane Katrina on Communications Networks recommends that \n        cable and broadcasting infrastructure providers, and their \n        contracted workers, be afforded emergency responder status \n        under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n        Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) and that this \n        designation would remedy many of the access and fuel sharing \n        issues that hampered industry efforts to quickly repair \n        infrastructure following Hurricane Katrina;\n            (13) the partnership of competing radio broadcasters in the \n        wake of Hurricane Katrina, casting aside commercial interests \n        to provide uninterrupted, redundant public information \n        programming from multiple transmission facilities, served the \n        public well and for many hurricane victims was the only source \n        of disaster-related information for many days;\n            (14) other similar models for regional broadcaster \n        cooperation nationwide, such as the initiative by 3 public and \n        private radio groups to cooperatively produce essential \n        disaster-related programming in eastern and central Maine, will \n        further prepare the industry to effectively respond to major \n        disasters;\n            (15) following Hurricane Katrina, a Primary Entry Point \n        station in Louisiana, operating only on generator power until \n        commercial power was restored 2 weeks after the disaster, was \n        instrumental in providing life-saving information to the \n        general public throughout the area as battery-operated radios \n        were the only source of official news and information;\n            (16) as of April 18, 2007, there were 24 States with 1 \n        Primary Entry Point station, 4 States with 2 Primary Entry \n        point stations, 2 Primary Entry Point stations located in \n        territories of the United States, and 2 Primary Entry Point \n        stations under development in Alabama and Mississippi;\n            (17) in the event of a man-made or natural disaster, it is \n        essential to provide for Primary Entry Point stations in any \n        State or territory where there is not a facility, meaning an \n        additional 23 stations are required, located in--\n                    (A) Arkansas;\n                    (B) Connecticut;\n                    (C) Delaware;\n                    (D) the District of Columbia;\n                    (E) Indiana;\n                    (F) Iowa;\n                    (G) Kentucky;\n                    (H) Maine;\n                    (I) Michigan;\n                    (J) Nebraska;\n                    (K) New Hampshire;\n                    (L) New Jersey;\n                    (M) Oklahoma;\n                    (N) Oregon;\n                    (O) Pennsylvania;\n                    (P) Rhode Island;\n                    (Q) South Dakota;\n                    (R) Vermont;\n                    (S) West Virginia;\n                    (T) Wisconsin;\n                    (U) American Samoa;\n                    (V) the Northern Mariana Islands; and\n                    (W) Guam; and\n            (18) in the event of a man-made or natural disaster, it is \n        essential to provide for the Primary Entry Point stations in \n        larger States where there is currently a facility, but an \n        additional station is required to ensure full sufficient \n        geographic coverage, meaning 2 stations are required, located \n        in--\n                    (A) Kansas; and\n                    (B) Florida.\n\nSEC. 3.
