MANAGEMENT.\n\n    (a) Federal Role.--(1) The Secretary of the Interior acting through \nthe Director of the National Park Service, shall carry out the Lower \nDelaware River Management Plan and the provisions of this Act and the \nWild and Scenic Rivers Act with respect to each of the segments \ndesignated by section 3, including the review of proposed federally \nassisted water resources projects that could have a direct and adverse \neffect on the values for which the segment is established, as \nauthorized under section 7(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 \nU.S.C. 1278(a)). In determining whether a proposed water \nresources project would have a direct and adverse effect on the values \nfor which the segments are designated were included in the National \nWild and Scenic Rivers System, the Secretary, acting through the \nDirector, shall specifically consider the extent to which the project \nis consistent with the Lower Delaware River Management Plan.\n    (2) Pursuant to sections 10(e) and 11(b) of the Wild and Scenic \nRivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1281(e), 1282(b)(1)), the Secretary of the \nInterior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, may \nenter into cooperative agreements with the States of New Jersey and \nPennsylvania and other organizations as appropriate. Such cooperative \nagreements shall be consistent with the Lower Delaware River Management \nPlan and may include provisions for financial or other assistance from \nthe United States to facilitate the long-term protection, conservation, \nand enhancement of each of the segments designated by section 3 of this \nAct.\n    (3) The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director, may \nprovide technical assistance, staff support, and funding to assist in \nthe implementation of the Lower Delaware River Management Plan.\n    (b) Land Management.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting through \nthe Director of the National Park Service, may provide planning, \nfinancial, and technical assistance to municipalities through which \ndesignated river segments flow to assist in their implementation of \nactions to protect the natural, economic, and historic resources of the \nLower Delaware River corridor. After adoption of recommendations made \nin section III of the management plan, the zoning ordinances of the \nmunicipalities bordering the segments shall be considered to satisfy \nthe standards and requirements under section 6(c) prohibiting the \nSecretary from acquiring lands through condemnation for the purposes of \nincluding the lands in the designated segments of the river area where \nsuch lands are located within any incorporated municipality which has \nin force and applicable to such lands duly adopted, valid zoning \nordinances that conform with the purposes of the Wild and Scenic Rivers \nAct (16 U.S.C. 1221 and following).\n    (c) Segment Additions.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Director of the National Park Service, is encouraged to \ncontinue to work with the local municipalities to negotiate agreement \nand support for designating those segments of the Delaware River and \nits tributaries which were found eligible for designation pursuant to \nPublic Law 102-460 and were not designated pursuant to this Act. If \nwithin 3 years of enactment of this Act, 1 or more of such additional \nriver segments are certified by the Secretary of the Interior as \nsuitable for designation into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \nSystem, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of \nthe designation of the segment, and upon such publication the segment \nshall thereby be designated as a recreational river or scenic river, as \nthe case may be, under section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic River Act \n(16 U.S.C. 1274(a)).\n\nSEC. 5.
