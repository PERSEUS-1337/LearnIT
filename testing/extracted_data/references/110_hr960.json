    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing America's Security through \nRedeployment from Iraq Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The men and women of the United States Armed Forces \n        have performed brilliantly in Iraq and served the Nation \n        courageously.\n            (2) The worsening situation in Iraq is a product of ongoing \n        sectarian violence in which the United States Armed Forces have \n        been asked to take sides and referee an ongoing civil war.\n            (3) Sending more United States troops to Iraq, and \n        remaining there indefinitely, will only further increase the \n        dependence of the people of Iraq on the United States, both \n        politically and militarily, at a time when Iraqis should be \n        shouldering increased responsibility for their country.\n            (4) The failure to confidently engage diplomatically with \n        all countries in the region, including Iran and Syria, has \n        foreclosed opportunities to further the stability of Iraq.\n            (5) The loss of national treasure--with billions of dollars \n        in reconstruction aid unaccounted for, and billions of dollars \n        being spent for a conflict with elusive, ever-changing goals, \n        while United States ground forces are strained almost to the \n        breaking point--has negatively impacted United States military \n        readiness and hindered the ability of the United States to \n        focus on other security priorities both at home and abroad.\n            (6) As a result, continuing in the current direction in \n        Iraq means less security and a greater strategic security risk \n        for the United States by diverting the attention and resources \n        needed to advance more significant United States security goals \n        in the Global War on Terror and to address regional challenges \n        from Afghanistan, North Korea, and Iran to the Western Pacific \n        and Middle East regions.\n            (7) Maintaining a strong United States military presence in \n        the Middle East and Southwest Asia regions is necessary to \n        ensure the protection and advancement of United States and \n        allied interests.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress makes the following declarations of policy:\n            (1) The United States must communicate unequivocally to the \n        political leaders in Iraq that they must take the difficult \n        political steps necessary to cease the sectarian violence in \n        Iraq, including building coalitions among competing sects, \n        ensuring minority rights, balancing power between provincial \n        and central governments, and sharing oil revenues among all \n        regions of Iraq.\n            (2) The United States must create strong incentives for \n        countries in the region to engage constructively with Iraq.\n            (3) The policy goals of paragraphs (1) and (2) cannot be \n        accomplished by continuing an open-ended United States military \n        commitment to Iraq. Rather, only by setting a deliberate \n        timetable for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces \n        from Iraq will the United States be able to ensure that the \n        political leaders of Iraq acknowledge and accept that they must \n        take the difficult political steps necessary to cease the \n        sectarian violence in Iraq, understanding that they would \n        otherwise bear the consequences of not assuming responsibility \n        for their country.\n\nSEC. 4. REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES MILITARY FORCES FROM IRAQ.\n\n    (a) Redeployment Required.--\n            (1) Requirement.--Except as provided in subsection (b), not \n        later than December 31, 2007, all United States Armed Forces \n        serving in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom shall be \n        redeployed outside of Iraq, to locations within the Middle East \n        or Southwest Asia regions or to other regions or nations, or \n        returned to the United States.\n            (2) Purpose and pace of redeployment.--The redeployment \n        required by this subsection shall be carried out for purposes \n        of both enhancing the global security interests of the United \n        States and improving the military readiness of the United \n        States. The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the \n        redeployment is carried out at deliberate, orderly pace that \n        allows for the full security of members of the Armed Forces.\n    (b) Exceptions to Redeployment Requirement.--The redeployment \nrequired by subsection (a) shall not apply to the following:\n            (1) Special operations forces.--Special operations forces \n        assigned outside of Iraq that conduct either targeted counter-\n        terrorism operations or periodic support operations of the \n        Iraqi security forces in Iraq.\n            (2) Military liaison teams.--Military or civilian personnel \n        on military liaison teams involved in military-to-military \n        contacts and comparable activities between the United States \n        and Iraq, as authorized under section 168 of title 10, United \n        States Code.\n            (3) Air support.--Members of the Air Force, Navy, and \n        Marine Corps assigned to locations outside Iraq for purposes of \n        conducting air operations in Iraq (including air operations in \n        support of combat operations) to support the Iraqi security \n        forces.\n            (4) Counter-terrorism operations.--Members of the Armed \n        Forces conducting targeted counter-terrorism operations in \n        Iraq.\n            (5) Security for united states diplomatic missions in \n        iraq.--Members of the Armed Forces providing security for the \n        United States Embassy and other United States diplomatic \n        missions in Iraq.\n            (6) Defense attache.--Personnel conducting routine \n        functions of the Office of Defense Attache.\n\nSEC. 5. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS.\n\n    Funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of \nDefense under any provision of law for Operation Iraqi Freedom may be \nobligated or expended after December 31, 2007, only for personnel \ndescribed in and activities carried out pursuant to section 4(b).\n\nSEC. 6. DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the United States should take a leadership role in \n        diplomatic efforts and negotiations necessary for countries in \n        the region, including Iran and Syria, to work together to \n        ensure the long-term stability of Iraq, which is in the best \n        interests of such countries and the United States; and\n            (2) the United States should convene an international \n        conference to bring together countries throughout the world to \n        provide economic aid for rebuilding the infrastructure of Iraq \n        and other reconstruction efforts in Iraq that are essential to \n        ensure the long-term stability of Iraq."
