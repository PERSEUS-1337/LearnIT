A vote on final passage of the \nresolution shall be taken in each House on or before the close of the \n15th day after the resolution is reported by the committee of that \nHouse to which it was referred, or after such committee has been \ndischarged from further consideration of the resolution.\n    ``(D)(i) On or after the third day after the date on which the \ncommittee to which the approval resolution is referred has reported, or \nhas been discharged from further consideration of, such resolution, it \nis in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been \ndisagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to move to proceed \nto the consideration of the resolution. A Member may make the motion \nonly on the day after the calendar day on which the Member announces to \nthe respective House the Member's intention to make the motion, except \nthat, in the case of the House of Representatives, the motion may be \nmade without such prior announcement if the motion is made by direction \nof the Committee on Ways and Means.

The motion is highly privileged in the House of Representatives \nand is privileged in the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not \nsubject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \nproceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider \nthe vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be \nin order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution \nis agreed to, the respective House shall immediately proceed to \nconsideration of the approval resolution without intervening motion, \norder, or other business, and the resolution shall remain the \nunfinished business of the respective House until disposed of.\n    ``(ii) Debate on the approval resolution, and on all debatable \nmotions and appeals in connection with the resolution, shall be limited \nto not more than 20 hours, which shall be divided equally between those \nfavoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the \nresolution is not in order. A motion further to limit debate is in \norder and not debatable. A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed \nto the consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the \nresolution is not in order.\n    ``(iii) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate in the \nrespective House on the approval resolution and a single quorum call at \nthe conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with the rules \nof the respective House, the vote on final passage of the resolution \nshall occur.\n    ``(iv) Appeals from the decisions of the Presiding Officer relating \nto the application of the rules of the respective House to the \nprocedure relating to the approval resolution shall be decided without \ndebate.\n    ``(v) A motion to reconsider the vote by which the approval \nresolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n    ``(E) For purposes of this paragraph, in computing a number of days \nin either House, there shall be excluded any day on which that House is \nnot in session.\n    ``(7)(A) If, before the passage by one House of an approval \nresolution of that House, that House receives an approval resolution \nfrom the other House, then the following procedures shall apply:\n            ``(i) The approval resolution of the other House shall not \n        be referred to a committee and may not be considred in the \n        House receiving it except in the case of final passage as \n        provided in clause (ii)(II).\n            ``(ii) With respect to an approval resolution of the House \n        receiving the resolution--\n                    ``(I) the procedure in that House shall be the same \n                as if no resolution had been received from the other \n                House, and\n                    ``(II) the vote on final passage shall be on the \n                resolution of the other House.\n    ``(B) Upon disposition of the resolution received from the other \nHouse, it shall no longer be in order to consider the resolution that \noriginated in the receiving House.''.\n    (b) Additional Reports and Evaluations.--Section 233 of such Act is \namended further by adding at the end the following new subsections:\n    ``(f) Biennial SSA Report on Impact of Totalization Agreements.--\nNot later than 2 years after the effective date of each totalization \nagreement that is transmitted to the Congress pursuant to subsection \n(e), and biennially thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Security \nshall submit to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller \nGeneral a report relating to such agreement.
