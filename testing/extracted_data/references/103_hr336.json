FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) a significant proportion of youth in the United States \n        lack the necessary skills to meet employer requirements for \n        entry level positions;\n            (2) significant numbers of our youth are doing poorly in \n        school and will eventually drop out because school seems \n        irrelevant to them;\n            (3) the American workplace is changing in response to new \n        technology and heightened international competition, and the \n        jobs of the future will demand different and higher level \n        skills for which too many of our youth are not currently \n        trained;\n            (4) in contrast to many competitor nations, the United \n        States has virtually no programs to provide support for youth \n        in making the transition from school to gainful employment;\n            (5) the vast majority of American workers who do not attend \n        or complete college lack the skills necessary to secure \n        satisfying and gainful employment;\n            (6) work-based learning models are effective approaches to \n        preparing youth, beginning at the secondary school level, for \n        high-wage, high-skilled employment;\n            (7) three-fourths of American youth do not earn college \n        degrees, and many of those who do not could benefit from a more \n        structured method of attaining job skills, knowledge and \n        abilities;\n            (8) the United States lacks a comprehensive approach \n        towards helping youth make the transition from school to the \n        workplace;\n            (9) as a consequence of these policies, real wages have \n        declined and there is rising inequality in wages between those \n        who are well-trained and those who are not;\n            (10) since global economic competition is making it \n        impossible for the United States to maintain a high standard of \n        living for the majority of its people without changes in human \n        capital policy, the choice facing the United States is either \n        to become a Nation of high skills or one of declining living \n        standards;\n            (11) if the United States is to become a Nation of high \n        skills and high performance work organization, there must be a \n        fundamental change in the approach of the United States to \n        work, education, and training; and\n            (12) to accomplish that change, American business, labor, \n        Federal, State, and local governments, and the education \n        community must join together and invest the time, talent, and \n        resources necessary to provide American youth the opportunity \n        to participate in high quality youth apprenticeships that will \n        lead to satisfying and gainful employment opportunities.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) establish a nationally recognized system for the youth \n        apprenticeship approach to learning, while allowing States to \n        customize the model to economic, demographic, and other local \n        conditions;\n            (2) establish a process that engages the business community \n        in partnerships with education to develop the capacity of \n        workplaces to serve as learning sites in order to ensure that \n        youth apprentices acquire academic and work-based competencies \n        and become skilled, flexible entry-level workers;\n            (3) encourage businesses and labor organizations to \n        participate in youth apprenticeship programs;\n            (4) encourage the public sector to participate in youth \n        apprenticeship programs;\n            (5) motivate the nation's young people to remain in school, \n        improve their basic skills, and become productive citizens by \n        providing the opportunity to gain marketable skills while \n        establishing a relationship with a prospective employer;\n            (6) prepare the youth of the United States for employment \n        in high-wage, high-skilled occupations;\n            (7) provide for high achievement standards in order to \n        instill pride, self-esteem, and purpose in youth apprentices;\n            (8) establish a systematic transition for youth apprentice \n        students from school to work by linking the academic curriculum \n        with a curriculum of work-site experience and learning; and\n            (9) enhance the youth apprentice's prospects for immediate \n        employment after leaving school in positions that provide \n        significant opportunity for continued education and career \n        development.\n\nSEC. 3.
