FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The full protection of American workers from job-\n        related injury or death requires an adequate, prompt, and \n        equitable system of workers' compensation as well as an \n        effective program of occupational health and safety regulation.\n            (2) The vast majority of American workers and their \n        families are dependent on workers' compensation for their basic \n        economic security in the event such workers suffer injury or \n        death in the course of employment.\n            (3) In 1972, the National Commission on State Workmen's \n        Compensation Laws found that the system of State workers' \n        compensation laws was ``inequitable and inadequate''. Since \n        that time, changes in reductions in State workers' compensation \n        laws have increased the inadequacy and inequitable levels of \n        workers' compensation benefits. Serious questions exist \n        concerning the fairness and adequacy of present workers' \n        compensation laws in light of the growth of the economy, \n        changing nature of the labor force, misclassification of \n        workers as independent contractors, and as leased employees, as \n        well as erosion of remedies for the bad faith handling and \n        delay in payment of benefits and medical care to workers and \n        their families, increases in medical knowledge, changes in the \n        hazards associated with various employment, new risks to health \n        and safety created by new technology, and increases in the \n        general level of wages and in the cost of living.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``National \nCommission on State Workers' Compensation Laws'' (hereinafter in this \nAct referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.
