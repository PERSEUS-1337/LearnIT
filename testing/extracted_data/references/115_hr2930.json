    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Drone Innovation Act of 2017''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Civil aircraft.--The term ``civil aircraft'', with \n        respect to an unmanned aircraft system, means that the unmanned \n        aircraft is not a public aircraft as defined in section 40102 \n        of title 49, United States Code.\n            (2) Local government.--The term ``local government'' means \n        a unit of government that is a subdivision of a State, such as \n        city, county, or parish.\n            (3) Local operation.--The terms ``local operation'' and \n        ``local in nature'' refer to flights or portions of civil \n        unmanned aircraft that occur in airspace--\n                    (A) up to 200 feet above ground level; and\n                    (B) the lateral boundaries of a State, local, or \n                Tribal government's jurisdiction.\n            (4) Small unmanned aircraft.--The term ``small unmanned \n        aircraft'' has the same meaning as such term is defined in \n        section 331(6) of the FAA Reform and Modernization Act of 2012.\n            (5) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n        States, the District of Columbia, and the territories and \n        possessions of the United States.\n            (6) Tribal government.--The term ``Tribal Government'' \n        means the governing body of an Indian Tribe (as defined in \n        section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n        Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304)).\n\nSEC. 3. CIVIL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT POLICY FRAMEWORK.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall, after \nconsultation with State, local, and Tribal officials, and other \nappropriate stakeholders, publish a civil unmanned aircraft local \noperation policy framework in the Federal Register.\n    (b) Contents.--The policy framework required pursuant to subsection \n(a) shall--\n            (1) provide guidelines to aid States, local, and Tribal \n        governments in harmonizing and, to the degree possible, \n        standardizing reasonable time, manner, and place limitations \n        and other restrictions on operations of civil and small \n        unmanned aircraft that are local in nature;\n            (2) take into account the economic and non-economic \n        benefits, such as civic or educational uses, of small or civil \n        unmanned aircraft operations;\n            (3) provide guidelines to aid States, local, and Tribal \n        governments in creating an environment that is hospitable to \n        innovation and fosters the rapid integration of unmanned \n        aircraft into the national airspace system; and\n            (4) aid States, local, and Tribal governments in adopting \n        technologies, such as unmanned traffic management systems, that \n        will enable notification to operators regarding reasonable \n        time, manner, and place limitations on operations of civil and \n        small unmanned aircraft that are local in nature.\n    (c) Analysis.--In crafting the policy framework and in prescribing \nany future regulations or standards related to civil unmanned aircraft \nsystems, the Secretary of Transportation shall define the scope of the \npreemptive effect of any civil unmanned aircraft regulations or \nstandards pursuant to section 40103 or 41713 of title 49, United States \nCode. Such regulations or standards shall be limited to the extent \nnecessary to ensure the safety and efficiency of the national airspace \nsystem for interstate commerce, and shall preserve the legitimate \ninterests of State, local, and Tribal governments, including--\n            (1) protecting public safety;\n            (2) protecting personal privacy;\n            (3) protecting property rights;\n            (4) managing land use; and\n            (5) restricting nuisances and noise pollution.\n    (d) Limitations.--In formulating and implementing the policy \nframework required pursuant to subsection (a) and any future \nregulations, policies or standards related to civil unmanned aircraft \nsystems, the Secretary shall abide by and be guided by the following \nfundamental principles:\n            (1) Any limitation on small or civil unmanned aircraft \n        should be consistent with maintaining the safe use of the \n        navigable airspace and the legitimate interests of State, \n        local, and Tribal governments.\n            (2) Innovation and competition are best served by a diverse \n        and competitive small and civil unmanned aircraft systems \n        industry.\n            (3) Any limitation on small or civil unmanned aircraft \n        should not create an unreasonable burden on interstate or \n        foreign commerce.\n            (4) The operation of small and civil unmanned aircraft \n        systems that are local in nature have more in common with \n        terrestrial transportation than traditional aviation.\n            (5) As it relates to the time, manner, and place of \n        unmanned aircraft local operations, and the need to foster \n        innovation, States, local, and Tribal governments uniquely \n        possess the constitutional authority, the resources, and the \n        competence to discern the sentiments of the people and to \n        govern accordingly.\n            (6) Relying upon technology solutions, such as unmanned \n        traffic management, provided by private industry, will \n        effectively solve policy challenges.\n            (7) State, local and Tribal officials are best positioned \n        to make judgments and issue dynamic limitations around events, \n        including, fires, accidents and other first responder activity, \n        public gatherings, community events, pedestrian thoroughfares, \n        recreational activities, cultural activities, heritage sites, \n        schools, parks and other inherently local events and locations, \n        which may justify limiting unmanned aircraft activity that is \n        local in nature while balancing the activities or events \n        against the need for innovation.\n            (8) The economic and non-economic benefits, of small and \n        civil unmanned aircraft operations may be best achieved by \n        empowering the State, local, and Tribal governments to create a \n        hospitable environment to welcome innovation.\n            (9) Innovation and competition in the unmanned aircraft \n        industry are best served enabling State, local, and Tribal \n        governments to experiment with a variety of approaches to \n        policies related to unmanned aircraft.\n            (10) The Department of Transportation shall, when making \n        policy related to small or civil unmanned aircraft systems, \n        recognize that problems that are merely common to the State, \n        local, and Tribal governments will not justify Federal action \n        because individual State, local, and Tribal governments, acting \n        individually or together, can effectively deal with such \n        problems and may find and implement more innovation friendly \n        policies than Federal agencies.\n            (11) The Department shall, when making policy related to \n        small or civil unmanned aircraft systems, provide timely \n        information and assistance to State, local, and Tribal \n        governments that will ensure collaboration.\n\nSEC. 4. PILOT PROGRAM ON FEDERAL PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 9 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall enter into \nagreements with not less than 20 and not more than 30 State, local, or \nTribal governments to establish pilot programs under which the \nSecretary shall provide technical assistance to such governments in \nregulating the operation of small and civil unmanned aircraft systems, \nincluding through the use of the latest available technologies for \nunmanned traffic management, notice, authorization, and situational \nawareness with respect to reasonable time, manner, and place \nlimitations and restrictions pursuant to section 3.\n    (b) Selection.--In selecting among State, local and Tribal \ngovernments for purposes of establishing pilot programs under \nsubsection (a), the Secretary shall seek to enter into agreements \nwith--\n            (1) governments that vary their size and intended approach \n        to regulation of small and civil unmanned aircraft systems;\n            (2) governments that demonstrate a willingness to partner \n        with technology providers and small and civil unmanned aircraft \n        operators; and\n            (3) at least two of each of the following: State \n        governments, county governments, city governments, and Tribal \n        Governments.\n    (c) Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management System.--The \nSecretary shall coordinate with the Administrator of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration to ensure that participants in \npilot programs established under subsection (a) are consulted in the \ndevelopment of the unmanned aircraft systems traffic management system \nunder section 2208 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of \n2016 (Public Law 114-190, 49 U.S.C. 40101 note) and the pilot program \nunder section (b) of such section.\n    (d) Report Required.--Not later than 18 months after establishment \nof the pilot programs required by subsection (a), the Secretary shall \ncoordinate with pilot program participants to submit to Congress, and \nmake available to the public, a report identifying best practices for \nState, local, and Tribal governments to regulate the operation of small \nand civil unmanned aircraft systems and to collaborate with the Federal \nAviation Administration with respect to the regulation of such systems.\n\nSEC. 5. PRESERVATION.\n\n    (a) Rights to Privacy.--In prescribing regulations or standards \nrelated to civil or small unmanned aircraft systems, the Secretary \nshall not authorize the operation of a small or civil unmanned aircraft \nin airspace local in nature above property where there is a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy without permission of the property owner.\n    (b) Causes of Action, Claims, and Remedies.--\n            (1) In general.--Nothing in this section shall be construed \n        to preempt, displace, or supplant any Federal, State, or Tribal \n        common law rights or any Federal, State, or Tribal statute or \n        common law right creating a remedy for civil relief, including \n        those for civil damages, or a penalty for a criminal law.\n            (2) Cause of actions upheld.--Nothing in this section shall \n        preempt or preclude any cause of action for personal injury, \n        wrongful death, property damage, inverse condemnation, \n        trespass, nuisance or other injury based on negligence, strict \n        liability, products liability, failure to warn, or any other \n        legal theory of liability under any maritime law, or any \n        Federal, State, or Tribal common law or statutory theory, \n        except that no cause of action, claim or remedy may be made \n        solely because of the transit of an unmanned aircraft through \n        airspace local in nature over private property in the absence \n        of proof that such transit substantially interfered with the \n        owner or lessee's use or enjoyment of the property or \n        repeatedly transited the airspace local in nature above the \n        owner's property.\n    (c) Private Airspace.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nthe Secretary shall not issue any rule or regulation that impedes or \noperates contrary to the authority of a State, local, or Tribal \ngovernment to define private property rights as it applies to unmanned \naircraft in the airspace above property that is local in nature.\n    (d) Rights to Operate.--A State or local government may not \nunreasonably or substantially impede the ability of a civil unmanned \naircraft, from reaching the navigable airspace. Unreasonable or \nsubstantial impeding of a civil unmanned aircraft from reaching the \nnavigable airspace includes--\n            (1) outright bans on overflights of the entirety of the \n        lateral boundaries of a State or local government's \n        jurisdiction;\n            (2) excessively large prohibitions on overflights of areas \n        of local significance such that access to airspace is so \n        impeded as to make flight within the lateral boundaries of a \n        State or local government's jurisdiction nearly impossible; and\n            (3) a combination of restrictions intended to unreasonably \n        impede or having the practical effect of unreasonably impeding \n        the ability of a civil unmanned aircraft from reaching the \n        navigable airspace.\n    (e) Right-of-Way.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to \nprevent an operator or pilot from operating a small or civil unmanned \naircraft over their own property, right of way, easement, lands, or \nwaters.\n\nSEC. 6. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    (a) Judicial Review.--An action taken by the Secretary of \nTransportation under any of sections 4XXXW-4XXXY is subject to judicial \nreview as provided under section 46110 of title 49, United States Code.\n    (b) Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction.--Nothing in this Act \n(including the amendments made by this Act) may be construed to \ndiminish or expand the civil or criminal jurisdiction of--\n            (1) any Tribal Government relative to any State or local \n        government; or\n            (2) any State or local government relative to any Tribal \n        Government.\n    (c) Limitation.--Nothing in this Act (including the amendments made \nby this Act) may be construed to--\n            (1) affect manned aircraft operations or the authority of \n        the Federal Aviation Authority (in this section referred to as \n        ``FAA'') with respect to manned aviation;\n            (2) affect the right of the FAA to take emergency action, \n        including the right to issue temporary flight restrictions;\n            (3) affect the right of the FAA to pursue enforcement \n        action against unsafe unmanned aircraft operators; and\n            (4) affect the right of first responders to access airspace \n        in the event of an emergency."
