FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2008, during a year of record-high gas prices, \n        people in the United States took more than 10,500,000,000 trips \n        using public transportation, the highest level in 50 years.\n            (2) Public transportation use in the United States is up 31 \n        percent since 1995, a figure that is more than double the \n        growth rate of the Nation's population and is substantially \n        greater than the growth rate for vehicle miles traveled on the \n        Nation's highways for that same period.\n            (3) High gas prices in 2011 are expected to drive the \n        demand for transit services even higher, with some estimates \n        showing that $5-per-gallon gas could result in a nearly 15 \n        percent jump in transit ridership.\n            (4) Based on the price of gas in March 2011, riding public \n        transportation saves households an average of $825 per month, \n        or nearly $10,000 per year.\n            (5) Despite increasing demand for transit services, \n        widespread cuts in State and local funding have caused 59 \n        percent of public transit systems in the United States to raise \n        fares or cut service since January 2009.\n            (6) Although under existing laws Federal employees in the \n        National Capital Region receive transit benefits, transit \n        benefits should be available to all Federal employees in the \n        United States so that the Federal Government sets a leading \n        example of greater public transportation use.\n            (7) Public transportation stakeholders should engage and \n        involve local communities in the education and promotion of the \n        importance of utilizing public transportation.\n            (8) Increasing public transportation use is a national \n        priority.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS TO IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SERVICES.\n\n    (a) Authorizations of Appropriations.--\n            (1) Urbanized area formula grants.--In addition to amounts \n        allocated under section 5338(b)(2)(B) of title 49, United \n        States Code, to carry out section 5307 of such title, there is \n        authorized to be appropriated $750,000,000 for each of fiscal \n        years 2011 and 2012 to carry out such section.
