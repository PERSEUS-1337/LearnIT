However, \nnothing in this subsection shall be construed to deny, impair, or \notherwise affect any right or authority of the Attorney General or the \nUnited States or any agency, officer, or employee thereof under other \nlaw, including section 4(d) of this Act, to institute or intervene in \nany action or proceeding.\n\nSEC. 3.

RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    (a) Religious Belief Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall be \nconstrued to authorize any government to burden any religious belief.\n    (b) Religious Exercise Not Regulated.--Nothing in this Act shall \ncreate any basis for restricting or burdening religious exercise or for \nclaims against a religious organization, including any religiously \naffiliated school or university, not acting under color of law.\n    (c) Claims to Funding Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall create \nor preclude a right of any religious organization to receive funding or \nother assistance from a government, or of any person to receive \ngovernment funding for a religious activity, but this Act may require \ngovernment to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a \nburden or a substantial burden on religious exercise.\n    (d) Other Authority To Impose Conditions on Funding Unaffected.--\nNothing in this Act shall--\n            (1) authorize a government to regulate or affect, directly \n        or indirectly, the activities or policies of a person other \n        than a government as a condition of receiving funding or other \n        assistance; or\n            (2) restrict any authority that may exist under other law \n        to so regulate or affect, except as provided in this Act.\n    (e) Governmental Discretion in Alleviating Burdens on Religious \nExercise.--A government may avoid the preemptive force of any provision \nof this Act by changing the policy that results in the substantial \nburden on religious exercise, by retaining the policy and exempting the \nburdened religious exercise, by providing exemptions from the policy \nfor applications that substantially burden religious exercise, or by \nany other means that eliminates the substantial burden.\n    (f) Effect on Other Law.--In a claim under section 2(a)(2) of this \nAct, proof that a substantial burden on a person's religious exercise, \nor removal of that burden, affects or would affect commerce, shall not \nestablish any inference or presumption that Congress intends that any \nreligious exercise is, or is not, subject to any other law.\n    (g) Broad Construction.--This Act should be construed in favor of a \nbroad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted \nby its terms and the Constitution.\n    (h) Severability.--If any provision of this Act or of an amendment \nmade by this Act, or any application of such provision to any person or \ncircumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this \nAct, the amendments made by this Act, and the application of the \nprovision to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\nSEC. 6. ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE UNAFFECTED.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect, interpret, or in \nany way address that portion of the first amendment to the Constitution \nprohibiting laws respecting an establishment of religion (referred to \nin this section as the ``Establishment Clause''). Granting government \nfunding, benefits, or exemptions, to the extent permissible under the \nEstablishment Clause, shall not constitute a violation of this Act.
