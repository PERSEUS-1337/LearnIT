FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant \n        ecological and public health concern.\n            (2) It is estimated that more than 410,000 children born \n        each year in the United States are exposed to levels of mercury \n        in the womb that are high enough to impair neurological \n        development.\n            (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n        found that 6 percent of women in the United States of \n        childbearing age have blood mercury levels in excess of values \n        determined to be safe by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (4) Exposure to mercury occurs largely by consumption of \n        contaminated fish. At the same time, fish and shellfish are an \n        important source of dietary protein, and a healthy fishing \n        resource is important to the economy of the United States.\n            (5) Fish and shellfish contain high-quality protein and \n        other essential nutrients, are low in saturated fat, and \n        contain omega-3 fatty acids. A well-balanced diet that includes \n        a variety of fish and shellfish can contribute to heart health \n        and children's proper growth and development. A national \n        mercury monitoring network will provide consistent scientific \n        data on the status of this vital nutritional and commercial \n        resource.\n            (6) In many locations, the primary route for mercury input \n        to aquatic ecosystems is atmospheric emissions, transport, and \n        deposition. Computer models and other assessment tools provide \n        varying effectiveness in predicting mercury concentrations in \n        fish and existing broad-scale data sets are insufficient to \n        test model predictions.\n            (7) As the Federal Government and State governments advance \n        regulations to curb mercury emissions, such regulations should \n        be evaluated by a nationwide monitoring network that can \n        document whether such regulations are effective.\n\nSEC. 3. MONITORING PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) In general.--The Administrator, in consultation with \n        the heads of applicable Federal agencies, shall establish a \n        long-term national-scale mercury monitoring program to track--\n                    (A) long-term trends in atmospheric mercury \n                concentrations and deposition; and\n                    (B) in response to changing mercury emissions over \n                time, mercury levels in--\n                            (i) watersheds and surface waters; and\n                            (ii) fish and wildlife in terrestrial, \n                        freshwater, and coastal ecosystems.\n            (2) Monitoring sites.--\n                    (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the \n                date of enactment of this Act and in coordination the \n                Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee, the \n                Administrator, in consultation with the heads of the \n                applicable Federal agencies, shall select multiple \n                monitoring sites for the mercury monitoring program \n                established under this section representing different \n                ecoregions of the United States.\n                    (B) Locations.--Locations of monitoring sites for \n                the mercury monitoring program established under this \n                section shall include, national parks, national \n                wildlife refuges, national estuarine reserves, and \n                sensitive ecological areas in which substantive changes \n                are expected from reductions in domestic mercury \n                emissions.
