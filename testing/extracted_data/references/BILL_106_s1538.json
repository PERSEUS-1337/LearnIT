FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The placement of telecommunications facilities near \n        residential properties can greatly reduce the value of such \n        properties, destroy the views from such properties, and reduce \n        substantially the desire to live in the area.\n            (2) States and local governments should be able to exercise \n        control over the placement, construction, and modification of \n        such facilities through the use of zoning, planned growth, and \n        other land use regulations relating to the protection of the \n        environment and public health, safety, and welfare of the \n        community.\n            (3) There are alternatives to the construction of \n        facilities to meet telecommunications and broadcast needs, \n        including, but not limited to, alternative locations, \n        colocation of antennas on existing towers or structures, \n        towerless PCS-Over-Cable or PCS-Over-Fiber telephone service, \n        satellite television systems, low-Earth orbit satellite \n        communication networks, and other alternative technologies.\n            (4) There are alternative methods of designing towers to \n        meet telecommunications and broadcast needs, including the use \n        of small towers that do not require blinking aircraft safety \n        lights, break skylines, or protrude above tree canopies and \n        that are camouflaged or disguised to blend with their \n        surroundings, or both.\n            (5) On August 19, 1997, the Federal Communications \n        Commission issued a proposed rule, MM Docket No. 97-182, which \n        would preempt the application of State and local zoning and \n        land use ordinances regarding the placement, construction, and \n        modification of broadcast transmission facilities. It is in the \n        interest of the Nation that the Commission not adopt this rule.\n            (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the memoranda \n        opinions and orders and proposed rules of the Commission with \n        respect to application of certain ordinances to the placement \n        of such towers (WT Docket No. 97-192, ET Docket No. 93-62, RM-\n        8577, and FCC 97-303, 62 F.R. 47960) be modified in order to \n        permit State and local governments to exercise their zoning and \n        land use authorities, and their power to protect public health \n        and safety, to regulate the placement of telecommunications or \n        broadcast facilities and to place the burden of proof in civil \n        actions, and in actions before the Commission and State and \n        local authorities relating to the placement, construction, and \n        modification of such facilities, on the person or entity that \n        seeks to place, construct, or modify such facilities.\n            (7) PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber, and satellite \n        telecommunications systems, including low-Earth orbit \n        satellites, offer a significant opportunity to provide so-\n        called ``911'' emergency telephone service throughout much of \n        the United States.\n            (8) According to the Comptroller General, the Commission \n        does not consider itself a health agency and turns to health \n        and radiation experts outside the Commission for guidance on \n        the issue of health and safety effects of radio frequency \n        exposure.\n            (9) The Federal Aviation Administration does not have \n        adequate authority to regulate the placement, construction, and \n        modification of telecommunications facilities near airports or \n        high-volume air traffic areas such as corridors of airspace or \n        commonly used flyways. The Commission's proposed rules to \n        preempt State and local zoning and land-use regulations for the \n        siting of such facilities will have a serious negative impact \n        on aviation safety, airport capacity and investment, and the \n        efficient use of navigable airspace.\n            (10) The telecommunications industry and its experts should \n        be expected to have access to the best and most recent \n        technical information and should therefore be held to the \n        highest standards in terms of their representations, \n        assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.\n            (11) There has been a substantial effort by the Federal \n        Government to determine the effects of electric and magnetic \n        fields on biological systems, as is evidenced by the Electric \n        and Magnetic Fields Research and Public Information \n        Dissemination (RAPID) Program, which was established by section \n        2118 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486; 42 \n        U.S.C. 13478). This five-year program, which was coordinated by \n        the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the \n        Department of Energy, examined the possible effects of electric \n        and magnetic fields on human health. Despite the success of \n        this program, there has been no similar effort by the Federal \n        Government to determine the possible effects on human health of \n        radio frequency emissions associated with telecommunications \n        facilities. The RAPID program could serve as the excellent \n        model for a Federally-sponsored research project.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To repeal certain limitations on State and local \n        authority regarding the placement, construction, and \n        modification of personal wireless service facilities and \n        related facilities as such limitations arise under section \n        332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n        332(c)(7)).\n            (2) To permit State and local governments--\n                    (A) in cases where the placement, construction, or \n                modification of telecommunications facilities and other \nfacilities is inconsistent with State and local regulations, laws, or \ndecisions, to require the use of alternative telecommunication or \nbroadcast technologies when such alternative technologies are \navailable;\n                    (B) to regulate the placement, modification, and \n                construction of such facilities so that their \n                placement, construction, or modification will not \n                interfere with the safe and efficient use of public \n                airspace or otherwise compromise or endanger public \n                safety; and\n                    (C) to hold applicants for permits for the \n                placement, construction, or modification of such \n                telecommunications facilities, and providers of \n                services using such towers and facilities, accountable \n                for the truthfulness and accuracy of representations \n                and statements placed in the record of hearings for \n                such permits, licenses, or approvals.\n\nSEC. 2. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND \n              MODIFICATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) Repeal of Limitations on Regulation of Personal Wireless \nFacilities.--Section 332(c)(7)(B) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \nU.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)) is amended--\n            (1) in clause (i), by striking ``thereof--'' and all that \n        follows through the end and inserting ``thereof shall not \n        unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally \n        equivalent services.'';\n            (2) by striking clause (iv);\n            (3) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and\n            (4) in clause (iv), as so redesignated--\n                    (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``30 days \n                after such action or failure to act'' and inserting \n                ``30 days after exhaustion of any administrative \n                remedies with respect to such action or failure to \n                act''; and\n                    (B) by striking the third sentence and inserting \n                the following: ``In any such action in which a person \n                seeking to place, construct, or modify a \n                telecommunications facility is a party, such person \n                shall bear the burden of proof, regardless of who \n                commences the action.''.\n    (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule Regarding Preemption of State \nand Local Authority Over Broadcast Transmission Facilities.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal Communications \nCommission may not adopt as a final rule or otherwise the proposed rule \nset forth in ``Preemption of State and Local Zoning and Land Use \nRestrictions on Siting, Placement and Construction of Broadcast Station \nTransmission Facilities'', MM Docket No. 97-182, released August 19, \n1997.\n    (c) Authority Over Placement, Construction, and Modification of \nOther Transmission Facilities.--Part I of title III of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 337. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND \n              MODIFICATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \nno provision of this Act may be interpreted to authorize any person or \nentity to place, construct, or modify telecommunications facilities in \na manner that is inconsistent with State or local law, or contrary to \nan official decision of the appropriate State or local government \nentity having authority to approve, permit, license, modify, or deny an \napplication to place, construct, or modify a tower, if alternate \ntechnology is capable of delivering the broadcast or telecommunications \nsignals without the use of a tower.\n    ``(b) Authority Regarding Production of Safety and Interference \nStudies.--No provision of this Act may be interpreted to prohibit a \nState or local government from--\n            ``(1) requiring a person or entity seeking authority to \n        place, construct, or modify telecommunications facilities or \n        broadcast transmission facilities within the jurisdiction of \n        such government to produce--\n                    ``(A) environmental studies, engineering reports, \n                or other documentation of the compliance of such \n                facilities with radio frequency exposure limits \n                established by the Commission and compliance with \n                applicable laws and regulations governing the effects \n                of the proposed facility on the health, safety, and \n                welfare of local residents in the community; and\n                    ``(B) documentation of the compliance of such \n                facilities with applicable Federal, State, and local \n                aviation safety standards or aviation obstruction \n                standards regarding objects effecting navigable \n                airspace; or\n            ``(2) refusing to grant authority to such person to locate \n        such facilities within the jurisdiction of such government if \n        such person fails to produce any studies, reports, or \n        documentation required under paragraph (1).\n    ``(c) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed to \nprohibit or otherwise limit the authority of a State or local \ngovernment to ensure compliance with or otherwise enforce any \nstatements, assertions, or representations filed or submitted by or on \nbehalf of an applicant with the State or local government for authority \nto place, construct, or modify telecommunications facilities or \nbroadcast transmission facilities within the jurisdiction of the State \nor local government.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
