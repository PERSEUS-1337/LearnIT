SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Paycheck Fairness \nAct ''.\n    (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act (other than in section 8) an \namendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal \nof, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to \nbe made to a section or other provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act \nof 1938.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Women have entered the workforce in record numbers.\n            (2) Even in the 1990's, women earn significantly lower pay \n        than men for work on jobs that require equal skill, effort, and \n        responsibility and that are performed under similar working \n        conditions. These pay disparities exist in both the private and \n        governmental sectors. In many instances, the pay disparities \n        can only be due to continued intentional discrimination or the \n        lingering effects of past discrimination.\n            (3) The existence of such pay disparities--\n                    (A) depresses the wages of working families who \n                rely on the wages of all members of the family to make \n                ends meet;\n                    (B) prevents the optimum utilization of available \n                labor resources;\n                    (C) has been spread and perpetuated, through \n                commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of \n                commerce, among the workers of the several States;\n                    (D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n                commerce;\n                    (E) constitutes an unfair method of competition in \n                commerce;\n                    (F) leads to labor disputes burdening and \n                obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in \n                commerce;\n                    (G) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing \n                of goods in commerce; and\n                    (H) in many instances, may deprive workers of equal \n                protection on the basis of sex in violation of the 5th \n                and 14th amendments.\n            (4)(A) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n        discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex \n        continue to exist more than 3 decades after the enactment of \n        the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) \n        and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.).\n            (B) Elimination of such barriers would have positive \n        effects, including--\n                    (i) providing a solution to problems in the economy \n                created by unfair pay disparities;\n                    (ii) substantially reducing the number of working \n                women earning unfairly low wages, thereby reducing the \n                dependence on public assistance; and\n                    (iii) promoting stable families by enabling all \n                family members to earn a fair rate of pay;\n                    (iv) remedying the effects of past discrimination \n                on the basis of sex and ensuring that in the future \n                workers are afforded equal protection on the basis of \n                sex; and\n                    (v) in the private sector, ensuring equal \n                protection pursuant to Congress' power to enforce the \n                5th and 14th amendments.\n            (5) With increased information about the provisions added \n        by the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and generalized wage data, along \n        with more effective remedies, women will be better able to \n        recognize and enforce their rights to equal pay for work on \n        jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility and \n        that are performed under similar working conditions.\n            (6) Certain employers have already made great strides in \n        eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace and their \nachievements should be recognized.\n\nSEC. 3. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EQUAL PAY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Required Demonstration for Affirmative Defense.--Section \n6(d)(1) (29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) is amended by striking ``(iv) a \ndifferential'' and all that follows through the period and inserting \nthe following: ``(iv) a differential based on a bona fide factor other \nthan sex, such as education, training, or experience, except that this \nclause shall apply only if--\n            ``(I) the employer demonstrates that--\n                    ``(aa) such factor--\n                            ``(AA) is job-related with respect to the \n                        position in question; or\n                            ``(BB) furthers a legitimate business \n                        purpose, except that this item shall not apply \n                        where the employee demonstrates that an \n                        alternative employment practice exists that \n                        would serve the same business purpose without \n                        producing such differential and that the \n                        employer has refused to adopt such alternative \n                        practice; and\n                    ``(bb) such factor was actually applied and used \n                reasonably in light of the asserted justification; and\n            ``(II) if the employer makes the demonstration described in \n        subclause (I), the employee fails to demonstrate that the \n        differential produced by the reliance of the employer on the \n        factor described in such subclause is the result of \n        discrimination on the basis of sex by the employer.\nAn employer that is not otherwise in compliance with this paragraph may \nnot reduce the wages of any employee in order to achieve such \ncompliance.''.\n    (b) Application of Provisions.--Section 6(d) (29 U.S.C. 206(d)) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(5) The provisions of this subsection shall apply to applicants \nfor employment if such applicants, upon employment by the employer \napplied to, would be subject to any other subsection of this \nsection.''.\n    (c) Elimination of Establishment Requirement.--Section 6(d)(1) (29 \nU.S.C. 206(d)(1)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``, within any establishment in which such \n        employees are employed,''; and\n            (2) by striking ``such establishment'' each place it \n        appears.\n    (d) Nonretaliation Provision.--Section 15(a)(3) (29 U.S.C. \n215(a)(3)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``employee'' the first place it appears and \n        inserting ``employee (or applicant for employment in the case \n        of an applicant described in section 6(d)(5))'';\n            (2) by inserting ``(or applicant)'' after ``employee'' the \n        second place it appears;\n            (3) by striking ``or has'' each place it appears and \n        inserting ``has'';
