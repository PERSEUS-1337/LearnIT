FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are systems of public school finance within \n        States which subject American children to educations of \n        radically varying and grossly unequal quality solely on the \n        basis of where they live.\n            (2) In its unanimous decision in the case of Brown v. Board \n        of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954), the Supreme Court \n        stated: ``In these days, it is doubtful that any child may \n        reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the \n        opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the \n        state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be \n        made available to all on equal terms.''\n            (3) Education is a fundamental right under the equal \n        protection clause of the United States Constitution.\n            (4) The provision of education to all children within a \n        State on an equal basis, including equality of financial \n        resources, is fundamental to the equal protection of laws.\n\nSEC. 3. EQUALIZATION SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (c), beginning 5 years after \nthe date of enactment of this Act, a State shall be ineligible to \nreceive Federal funds as specified in section 4(c) if such State does \nnot maintain a coefficient of variation of at least 10 percent for per-\npupil expenditures in local educational agencies statewide, for \nelementary and secondary education in such State.\n    (b) Coefficient of Variation Defined.--In this section, the term \n``coefficient of variation'' means the standard deviation of local \neducational agency expenditures divided by the mean per-student \nexpenditure, calculated--\n            (1) based on intrastate expenditures for current \n        operations, as determined by the State, without regard to \n        Federal contributions; and\n            (2) excluding--\n                    (A) local educational agencies with fewer than 250 \n                students;\n                    (B) capital expenditures; and\n                    (C) funds targeted to address a specific need (such \n                as educationally disadvantaged, handicapped, gifted, or \n                language-deficient students), without regard to the \n                source of such funds, but nothing in this Act shall \n                preclude a State or the Federal Government from \n                providing additional resources to local educational \n                agencies to address any such specific need.\n    (c) Waiver.--The Secretary may provide a single waiver of \nsubsection (a) and provide continued funding for elementary and \nsecondary education to a State which has not complied with the \nrequirements of such subsection, if such State submits to the Secretary \na plan for compliance which the Secretary determines will bring the \nState into compliance within 5 years. A waiver under this subsection \nmay not be granted for a duration of more than five years after the \ndate the Secretary approves such a plan for compliance.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORT, CERTIFICATION, AND CHALLENGE.\n\n    (a) Annual Report.--Not later than January 1 of each year, a State \nshall submit to the Secretary a report describing--\n            (1) the manner in which the State has complied with section \n        3(a) or whether such State has received a waiver under section \n        3(c); and\n            (2) such additional information as the Secretary may \n        require.\n    (b) Annual Certification.--The report required by subsection (a) \nshall include a certification that the State has complied with the \nprovisions of section 3(a) or has been granted a waiver under section \n3(c). Such certification shall be prima facie evidence that the State \nhas complied with section 3 unless such certification is challenged \nunder subsection (c).\n    (c) Certification Challenge.--Not later than 90 days after the date \non which a State certification is due under subsection (b), a local \neducational agency in a State may file a complaint with the Secretary \nchallenging such certification.\n\nSEC. 5. CONSEQUENCES OF NONCOMPLIANCE.\n\n    (a) Ineligibility for Federal Education Funds.--If the Secretary \ndetermines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that a State \nfails to comply with section 3(a) and has not obtained a waiver under \nsection 3(c), such State shall be ineligible to receive Federal funds \nadministered by the Secretary to support elementary and secondary \neducation, beginning on the first day of the first fiscal year after \nsuch finding.\n    (b) Restoration of Eligibility.--Eligibility for funds identified \nunder subsections (a) shall be restored at the beginning of the next \nfiscal year after the Secretary determines that the State has complied \nwith section 3(a) or grants a waiver under section 3(c), whichever \noccurs first.\n    (c) Redistribution of Funds.--Funds for elementary and secondary \neducation made ineligible for a State under subsection (a) shall be \nreallocated by the Secretary among States that--\n            (1) are in compliance with the requirements of section \n        3(a); or\n            (2) are implementing compliance plans pursuant to section \n        3(c).\n\nSEC. 6. RULEMAKING.\n\n    The Secretary may make rules to carry out this Act.\n\nSEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``local educational agency'' has the meaning \n        given such term in section 14101(18) of the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801(18)).\n            (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Education."
