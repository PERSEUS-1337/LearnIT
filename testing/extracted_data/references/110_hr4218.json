    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Diabetes Self-Management \nTraining Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the top public \n        health threats currently facing the United States. \n        Approximately 21,000,000 people in the United States are \n        currently living with diabetes, and another 54,000,000 people \n        in the United States have pre-diabetes, dramatically raising \n        their risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. \n        Diabetes is the 6th leading cause of death in the United \n        States, causing at least 224,000 deaths annually. The \n        prevalence of the most common type of diabetes has tripled in \n        the last 30 years, and approximately 2,200 people are diagnosed \n        with diabetes each day.\n            (2) Diabetes self-management training, also called diabetes \n        education, provides critical knowledge and skills training to \n        patients with diabetes, helping them identify barriers, \n        facilitate problem solving, and develop coping skills to \n        effectively manage their diabetes. A certified diabetes \n        educator is a health care professional, often a nurse, \n        dietitian, or pharmacist, who specializes in helping people \n        with diabetes develop the self-management skills needed to stay \n        healthy and avoid costly acute complications and emergency \n        care, as well as debilitating secondary conditions caused by \n        diabetes.\n            (3) Diabetes self-management training has been proven \n        effective in helping to reduce the risks and complications of \n        diabetes. In 2002, the Diabetes Prevention Program study \n        conducted by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers \n        for Disease Control and Prevention found that participants (all \n        of whom were at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes) \n        who made lifestyle changes reduced their risk of getting type 2 \n        diabetes by 58 percent. Lifestyle intervention worked in all of \n        the groups but it worked particularly well in people aged 60 \n        and older, reducing the development of diabetes by 71 percent. \n        Similarly, studies have found that patients under the care of a \n        certified diabetes educator are better able to control their \n        diabetes and report improvement in their health status.\n            (4) Lifestyle changes, such as those taught by certified \n        diabetes educators, directly contribute to better glycemic \n        control and reduced complications from diabetes. Evidence shows \n        that the potential for prevention of the most serious medical \n        complications caused by diabetes to be as high as 90 percent \n        (blindness), 85 percent (amputations), and 50 percent (heart \n        disease and stroke) with proper medical treatment and active \n        self-management.\n            (5) There are currently more than 20,000 diabetes educators \n        in the United States, most of whom are certified diabetes \n        educators credentialed by the National Certification Board for \n        Diabetes Educators. Eligibility for certification as a diabetes \n        educator by the National Certification Board for Diabetes \n        Educators requires prerequisite qualifying professional \n        credentials in specific health care professions and \n        professional practice experience that includes a minimum number \n        of hours and years of experience in diabetes self-management \n        training. Diabetes educators certified by the National \n        Certification Board for Diabetes Educators must also pass a \n        rigorous national examination and periodically renew their \n        credentials. Diabetes educators certified by the National \n        Certification Board for Diabetes Educators, and licensed by a \n        State as a health professional, are uniquely qualified to \n        provide diabetes self-management training under the Medicare \n        program.\n\nSEC. 3.
