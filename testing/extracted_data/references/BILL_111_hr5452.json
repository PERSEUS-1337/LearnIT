FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds--\n            (1) the United States has a special political and legal \n        relationship and responsibility to promote the welfare of the \n        Native American people of the United States;\n            (2) evaluations of indicators and criteria of social well-\n        being, education, health, unemployment, housing, income, rates \n        of poverty, justice systems, and nutrition by agencies of \n        Government and others have consistently found that Native \n        American communities rank below other groups of United States \n        citizens and many are at or near the bottom in those \n        evaluations;\n            (3) Native Americans, like other people in the United \n        States, have been hit hard by the deepest recession of the \n        United States economy in over 50 years, causing a significant \n        decline in employment and economic activity across the United \n        States;\n            (4) Native American communities have been described as \n        ``emerging economies'' and consequently have been stalled in \n        the efforts of the communities to build sustainable growing \n        economies for the people of the communities and are being \n        adversely affected faster than the rest of the United States;\n            (5) economic stimulus programs to help Native American \n        communities generate jobs and stronger economic performance \n        will require United States financial and tax incentives to \n        increase both local and expanded investment that is tailored to \n        the unique needs and circumstances of Native American \n        communities;\n            (6) the impacts of the ongoing recession and the near \n        collapse of the financial and banking systems require a review \n        of assumptions about the future, the need for new growth \n        strategies, and a focus on laying the groundwork for economic \n        success in the 21st century;\n            (7) there is a continuing need for direct economic \n        stimulus, including needs for improving rural infrastructure \n        and alternative energy in rural and Native American communities \n        of the United States and providing Native Americans leaders \n        with the tools to create jobs and improve economic conditions;\n            (8) in light of the role of Native American communities as \n        emerging markets within the United States, there are \n        opportunities and needs that should be addressed, including \n        consideration of United States support for the pooling of \n        resources to create an Indigenous Sovereign Wealth Fund that is \n        similar to those Funds created around the world to diversify \n        revenue streams, attract more resources, invest more wisely, \n        and create jobs;\n            (9) Native Americans should be participants when major \n        economic decisions are made that affect the property, lives, \n        and future of Native Americans; and\n            (10) Native Americans should fully participate in \n        rebuilding Native American communities and have necessary tools \n        and resources.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to authorize and establish a Native \nAmerican Economic Advisory Council to consult, coordinate with, and \nmake recommendations to the Executive Office of the President, Cabinet \nofficers, and Federal agencies--\n            (1) to improve the focus, effectiveness, and delivery of \n        Federal economic aid and development programs to Native \n        Americans and, as a result, improve substandard economic \n        conditions in Native American communities;\n            (2) to build and expand on the capacity of leaders in \n        Native American organizations and communities to take positive \n        and innovative steps--\n                    (A) to create jobs;\n                    (B) to establish stable and profitable business \n                enterprises;\n                    (C) to enhance economic conditions; and\n                    (D) to use Native American-owned resources for the \n                benefit of members; and\n            (3) to achieve the long-term goal of improving the quality \n        of Native American life and living conditions and access to \n        basic public services to the levels enjoyed by the average \n        citizen and community of the United States by the year 2025.\n\nSEC. 4.
