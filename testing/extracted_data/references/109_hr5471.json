FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Transit Mixed Concrete Corporation holds two valid \n        Federal leases for the extraction of sand and gravel from the \n        Federal mineral estate in lands located in Soledad Canyon \n        adjacent to the City of Santa Clarita, California, numbered CA-\n        20139 and CA-22901. Such lands contain approximately 56 million \n        tons of sand and gravel.\n            (2) Mining 56 million tons of sand and gravel under the \n        terms of the leases would produce harm to the environment and \n        cause major transportation problems for the City of Santa \n        Clarita, surrounding areas, and other users of the \n        transportation systems in the vicinity.\n            (3) It is in the best interest of the citizens of \n        California and the Federal Government to cancel those leases \n        and make available new leases for those resources that reflect \n        the level of mining that has historically occurred in the \n        Soledad Canyon area of California.\n            (4) TMC should be offered resources extraction \n        opportunities of similar economic value in other areas of \n        California that would not impact the environment and \n        transportation systems to the degree that they would have been \n        impacted in the Soledad Canyon.\n            (5) TMC should receive credit for reasonable and customary \n        costs associated with their efforts to develop leases CA-20139 \n        and CA-22901.\n            (6) A site-specific solution that is fair to TMC, protects \n        the environment, and has minimal impact on local transportation \n        system is in the best interest of the Nation.\n            (7) Considerable sums of money have been expended by all \n        parties trying to insure their interests are protected with \n        respect to leases CA-20139 and CA-22901, with no conclusion \n        foreseen at this time.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To provide to the Bureau of Land Management a mechanism \n        that is not available under existing law to cancel leases CA-\n        20139 and CA-22901 and provide new leasing opportunities in the \n        Soledad Canyon that reflect the historical production levels.\n            (2) To provide a means for TMC to recover and transfer to \n        other Federal resources the amounts expended trying to develop \n        leases CA-20139 and CA-22901.\n            (3) To provide the Bureau of Land Management tools to \n        evaluate expenses incurred by TMC and provide relief.\n\nSEC. 3.
