FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Sexual harassment in employment persists widely in the \n        workplace, although it violates title VII of the Civil Rights \n        Act of 1964 and adversely affects employees.\n            (2) According to guidelines issued by the Equal Employment \n        Opportunity Commission in 1980, the most effective tool for \n        eliminating sexual harassment is prevention.\n            (3) The United States Merit Systems Protection Board found \n        in 1981 and 1988 surveys of Federal Government employees that \n        42 percent of female employees and 14 percent of male employees \n        questioned had experienced some kind of harassment in \n        employment. The American Psychological Association estimates \n        that at least \\1/2\\ of all working women have been sexually \n        harassed at the workplace during their careers.\n            (4) The vast majority of sexual harassment episodes go \n        unreported to a supervisory employee or other individual \n        designated by the employer. Only 5 percent of the Government \n        employees who indicated in the 1988 Merit Systems Protection \n        Board survey that they had been harassed filed a formal \n        complaint or requested an investigation of the harassment.\n            (5) Sexual harassment has a significant cost for employees \n        and employers. A 1988 study by Working Woman Magazine shows \n        that sexual harassment costs a typical ``Fortune 500'' employer \n        $6,000,000, or $292.53 per employee, each year. The same study \n        estimates that it is 34 times more expensive for such an \n        employer to ignore the problem than it is to establish \n        effective programs and policies to address the problem.\n            (6) Most job growth over the next decade is expected to \n        occur in employment by small employers. Sixty-six percent of \n        the individuals who will enter the work force during this \n        period are expected to be female. The establishment of programs \n        and policies in small-business environments, at a low cost to \n        employers, will be a key prevention priority to reduce sexual \n        harassment in employment.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish workplace requirements that will reduce \n        the incidence of sexual harassment in employment,\n            (2) to provide a low-cost system to assist employers to \n        establish programs and policies to prevent sexual harassment in \n        employment,\n            (3) to raise the awareness of employees of the definition \n        of sexual harassment and of available avenues of redress, and\n            (4) to increase the authority and capacity of the Equal \n        Employment Opportunity Commission to assist in preventing \n        sexual harassment in employment.\n\nSEC. 3. EMPLOYER REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Posting of Notice in the Workplace.--Each employer shall post \nand keep posted in conspicuous places upon its premises where notices \nto employees and applicants for employment are customarily posted, a \nnotice that shall be prepared or approved by the Commission and shall \nset forth--\n            (1) the definition of sexual harassment found in section \n        1604.11(a) of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (July \n        1, 1992),\n            (2) the fact that sexual harassment in employment is a \n        violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n            (3) information describing how to file with the Commission \n        a complaint alleging such harassment, including information on \n        the time periods within which an alleged victim of \n        discrimination (including sexual harassment) must file a charge \n        with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or a State or \n        local fair employment agency, in order to satisfy the statute \n        of limitations applicable to claims under title VII,\n            (4) an address, and the toll-free telephone number, to be \n        used to contact the Commission regarding such harassment or \n        compliance with the requirements of this Act, and\n            (5) such other information as the Commission may require.\n    (b) Separate Notice to Individual Employees.--Each employer shall \nprovide annually to each employee separately a written notice that \nincludes--\n            (1) the matters specified in paragraphs (1) through (4) of \n        subsection (a),\n            (2) a description of the procedures established by such \n        employer to resolve allegations of sexual harassment in \n        employment, and\n            (3) such other information as the Commission may require.\nSuch notice shall be provided in a manner that ensures that such \nemployee actually receives such notice.\n    (c) Management Information for Supervisory Employees.--Not later \nthan 60 days after an employer places an individual in a supervisory \nemployment position or 1 year after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, whichever occurs later, such employer shall provide to the \nsupervisory employee information specifying the responsibilities of, \nand the methods to be used by, such employee to ensure that immediate \nand corrective action is taken to address allegations of sexual \nharassment in employment.\n    (d) Civil Penalty.--A willful violation of this section shall be \npunishable by a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each separate \nviolation.\n\nSEC. 4.
