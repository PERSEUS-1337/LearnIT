FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) a significant number of small businesses in the United \n        States, non-farm as well as agricultural producers, use heating \n        oil, natural gas, propane, kerosene, or electricity to heat \n        their facilities and for other purposes;\n            (2) a significant number of small businesses in the United \n        States sell, distribute, market, or otherwise engage in \n        commerce directly related to heating oil, natural gas, propane, \n        and kerosene; and\n            (3) sharp and significant increases in the price of heating \n        oil, natural gas, propane, or kerosene--\n                    (A) disproportionately harm small businesses \n                dependent on those fuels or that use, sell, or \n                distribute those fuels in the ordinary course of their \n                business, and can cause them substantial economic \n                injury;\n                    (B) can negatively affect the national economy and \n                regional economies;\n                    (C) have occurred in the winters of 1983-1984, \n                1988-1989, 1996-1997, and 1999-2000; and\n                    (D) can be caused by a host of factors, including \n                global or regional supply difficulties, weather \n                conditions, insufficient inventories, refinery \n                capacity, transportation, and competitive structures in \n                the markets, causes that are often unforeseeable to \n                those who own and operate small businesses.\n\nSEC. 3.
