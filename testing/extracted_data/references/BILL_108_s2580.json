FINDINGS\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Access to high-speed Internet is as important to 21st \n        Century businesses as access to the railroads and interstate \n        highways was to businesses of the last century.\n            (2) Up to one-third of the United States population lacks \n        access to high-speed Internet.\n            (3) Companies without access to high-speed Internet are \n        unable to meet their market potential, just as a community \n        cannot prosper if it doesn't have high quality roads and \n        bridges.\n            (4) Technology bonds would provide incentives to State and \n        local governments to partner with the private sector to expand \n        broadband deployment in their communities, especially \n        underserved urban and rural areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
