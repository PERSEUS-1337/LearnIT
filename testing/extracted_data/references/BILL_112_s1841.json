FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The father of modern genetics, Dr. Jerome Lejeune, \n        discovered the extra chromosome 21 responsible for the \n        condition, known as Down syndrome, which he called Trisomy 21 \n        in January 1959. His discovery has opened the doors of genetics \n        to new generations of researchers.\n            (2) Down syndrome was named after Dr. John Langdon Down, \n        the first physician to describe the syndrome.\n            (3) Down syndrome is the most frequent genetic cause of \n        intellectual and developmental disabilities and associated \n        medical problems and occurs in one out of 691 live births, in \n        all races and economic groups. Intellectual disability, \n        formerly mental retardation, is a disability characterized by \n        significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in \n        adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and \n        practical skills. This disability originates before birth and \n        lasts a lifetime.\n            (4) Chromosomes are cell structures that hold our genes. \n        Genes are the instructions that cells give that determine \n        things such as eye color, blood type, and susceptibility to \n        disease. Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, \n        one pair from the mother and one pair from the father.\n            (5) Down syndrome occurs when, because of cell division \n        error, there are 3 partial or total copies of chromosome 21 \n        rather than the normal 2. Because of the extra copy of \n        chromosome 21, people with Down syndrome are more susceptible \n        to diseases including Alzheimer's disease, leukemia, congenital \n        heart disease, seizures, and diabetes. However, people with \n        Down syndrome may be protected from other common diseases \n        including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and solid tumors such \n        as brain, gastrointestinal, and breast tumors. Therefore, the \n        study of Down syndrome may lead to novel treatments of common \n        diseases that affect millions of Americans. Lead researcher, \n        Dr. Bill Mobely is quoted as saying ``We're not just asking \n        what our country can do for people with Down syndrome, we're \n        asking what studies of people can do for our country and the \n        world.''.\n            (6) There are more than 400,000 people living with Down \n        syndrome in the United States.\n            (7) Down syndrome incidence increases with the age of the \n        mother, but due to higher fertility rates in younger women, the \n        majority of children with Down syndrome are born to women under \n        35 years of age.\n            (8) Life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has \n        increased dramatically in recent decades, but varies \n        significantly across various ethnic groups. People with Down \n        syndrome attend school, work, participate in decisions that \n        concern them, and contribute to society in many meaningful \n        ways.\n            (9) The Children's Health Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-310) \n        amended the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) \n        and included a number of provisions that addressed the research \n        and surveillance needs of many disabilities such as autism, \n        traumatic brain injury, Fragile X syndrome, juvenile diabetes, \n        asthma, epilepsy, and others. However, this landmark \n        legislation did not address the significant research, \n        surveillance, and clinical care needs of Down syndrome and thus \n        has been an impediment to progress in the Down syndrome \n        research community over the last decade. This Act attempts to \n        incorporate Down syndrome as an area of permissible research \n        and surveillance at the National Institutes of Health and the \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and will foster a \n        better understanding of Down syndrome.\n\nSEC. 3.
