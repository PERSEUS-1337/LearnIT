FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The law of copyright is often described as a \n        ``difficult balance between the interests of authors . . . in \n        the control and exploitation of their writings . . . on the one \n        hand, and society's competing interest in the free flow of \n        ideas, information, and commerce on the other hand.'' Sony \n        Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 429 \n        (1984).\n            (2) Copyright seeks to encourage and reward creative \n        efforts by securing a fair return for an author's labor. \n        Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 156 \n        (1975). At the same time, ``[f]rom the infancy of copyright \n        protection, some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted \n        materials has been thought necessary to fulfill copyright's \n        very purpose, `[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful \n        Arts . . .''' Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, \n        575 (1994).\n            (3) ``[P]rivate motivation must ultimately serve the cause \n        of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, \n        and the other arts . . . When technological change has rendered \n        its literal terms ambiguous, the Copyright Act must be \n        construed in light of this basic purpose.'' Twentieth Century \n        Music Corp., 422 U.S. at 156.\n            (4) Advances in technology have often prompted changes to \n        the copyright laws to maintain the balance. For example, the \n        development of player pianos preceded the enactment of the \n        Copyright Act of 1909. The development of cable television \n        prompted complex reforms to section 111 of title 17, United \n        States Code. Sony, 464 U.S. at 430-31.\n            (5) The development of digital technology and the rise of \n        the Internet have once again altered the balance. On the one \n        hand, digital technology threatens the rights of copyright \n        holders. Perfect digital copies of songs and movies can be \n        publicly transmitted, without authorization, to thousands of \n        people at little or no cost. On the other hand, technological \n        control measures give copyright holders the capacity to limit \n        nonpublic performances and threaten society's interests in the \n        free flow of ideas, information, and commerce.\n            (6) The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (``DMCA'') was \n        enacted as an attempt to safeguard the traditional balance in \n        the face of these new challenges. It gave copyright holders the \n        ability to fight digital piracy by employing technical \n        restrictions that prevent unlawful access and copying. In \n        practice, however, the DMCA also endangered the rights and \n        expectations of legitimate consumers.\n            (7) Contrary to the intent of Congress, section 1201 of \n        title 17, United States Code, has been interpreted to prohibit \n        all users--even lawful ones--from circumventing technical \n        restrictions for any reason. As a result, the lawful consumer \n        cannot legally circumvent technological restrictions, even if \n        he or she is simply trying to exercise a fair use or to utilize \n        the work on a different digital media device. See, e.g., \n        Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d 294, \n        321-24 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (DMCA failed to give consumers the \n        technical means to make fair uses of encrypted copyrighted \n        works).\n            (8) The authors of the DMCA never intended to create such a \n        dramatic shift in the balance. As the report of the Committee \n        of the Judiciary of the House of Representatives accompanying \n        the DMCA stated: ``[A]n individual [should] not be able to \n        circumvent in order to gain unauthorized access to a work, but \n        [should] be able to do so in order to make fair use of a work \n        which he or she has acquired lawfully.'' House Report 105-551, \n        Part I, Section-by-Section Analysis of section 1201(a)(1).\n            (9) It is now necessary to restore the traditional balance \n        between copyright holders and society, as intended by the 105th \n        Congress. Copyright laws in the digital age must prevent and \n        punish digital pirates without treating every consumer as one.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTING FAIR USE AND CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS IN THE DIGITAL \n              WORLD.\n\n    (a) Fair Use.--The first sentence of section 107 of title 17, \nUnited States Code, is amended by inserting after ``or by any other \nmeans specified in that section,'' the following: ``including by analog \nor digital transmissions,''.\n    (b) Permissible Uses of Digital Works.--\n            (1) In general.--Chapter 1 of title 17, United States Code, \n        is amended by adding after section 122 the following:\n``Sec. 123.

DIGITAL FIRST SALE.\n\n    Section 109 of title 17, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(f) The privileges prescribed by subsections (a) and (c) apply in \na case in which the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord of a work \nin a digital or other nonanalog format, or any person authorized by \nsuch owner, sells or otherwise disposes of the work by means of a \ntransmission to a single recipient, if the owner does not retain the \ncopy or phonorecord in a retrievable form and the work is so sold or \notherwise disposed of in its original format.''.\n\nSEC. 5. PERMISSIBLE CIRCUMVENTION TO ENABLE FAIR USE AND CONSUMER \n              EXPECTATIONS.\n\n    Section 1201 of title 17, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (c) through (k) as \n        subsections (d) through (l), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n    ``(c) Circumvention for Noninfringing Uses.--(1) Notwithstanding \nany other provision in this title, a person who lawfully obtains a copy \nor phonorecord of a work, or who lawfully receives a transmission of a \nwork, may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls \naccess to the work or protects a right of the copyright holder under \nthis title if--\n            ``(A) such act is necessary to make a noninfringing use of \n        the work under this title; and\n            ``(B) the copyright owner fails to make publicly available \n        the necessary means to make such noninfringing use without \n        additional cost or burden to such person.\n    ``(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), \nany person may manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or \notherwise make available technological means to circumvent a \ntechnological measure that effectively controls access to a work \nprotected under this title or protects a right of a copyright holder \nunder this title, if--\n            ``(A) such means are necessary to make a noninfringing use \n        under paragraph (1)(A);\n            ``(B) such means are designed, produced, and marketed to \n        make a noninfringing use under paragraph (1)(A); and\n            ``(C) the copyright owner fails to make available the \n        necessary means referred to in paragraph (1)(B).''."
