    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Low Emissions Energy \nPlan 2020 Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) President Obama has stated a goal of deploying \n        1,000,000 plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles by 2015;\n            (2) the United States needs to develop--\n                    (A) the electric recharging infrastructure to fuel \n                those vehicles; and\n                    (B) uniform standards and protocols for deployment \n                and integration of recharging infrastructure to serve \n                commercial vehicles as well as consumer vehicles; and\n            (3) plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles offer a number of \n        benefits, including emissions reductions, decreasing dependence \n        on imported oil, and advanced energy storage for the electric \n        grid.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Plan.--The term ``Plan'' means the national \n        transportation low emissions energy plan developed under \n        section 4.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Transportation, acting in coordination with the Secretary of \n        Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION LOW EMISSIONS ENERGY PLAN.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a stakeholder-driven \nprocess to develop, not later than 18 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, a national transportation low emissions energy \nplan.\n    (b) Requirements.--The Plan shall--\n            (1) project the near- and long-term need for and location \n        of electric drive vehicle refueling infrastructure at strategic \n        locations across all major national highways, roads, and \n        corridors;\n            (2) identify infrastructure and standardization needs for \n        electricity providers, infrastructure providers, vehicle \n        manufacturers, and electricity purchasers; and\n            (3) establish an aspirational goal of achieving strategic \n        deployment of electric vehicle infrastructure by 2020.\n    (c) Stakeholders.--In developing the Plan, the Secretary shall \ninvolve, on a voluntary basis, stakeholders that include--\n            (1) the heads of other Federal agencies;\n            (2) State and local officials;\n            (3) representatives of--\n                    (A) energy utilities;\n                    (B) the vehicles industry;\n                    (C) the freight and shipping industry;\n                    (D) clean technology firms;\n                    (E) the hospitality industry;\n                    (F) the restaurant industry; and\n                    (G) highway rest stop vendors; and\n            (4) such other stakeholders as the Secretary may determine \n        to be necessary.\n    (d) Public Charge Access Ports.--The Plan shall--\n            (1) prioritize the development of--\n                    (A) standardized public charge access ports with \n                wireless or smart card billing capability; and\n                    (B) level I and level II charge port systems (that \n                charge an electric vehicle over a period of 8 to 14 \n                hours and 4 to 8 hours, respectively) that will meet \n                the energy requirements of the majority of plug-in \n                hybrid and battery electric vehicles;\n            (2) examine the feasibility of level III charge port \n        systems that can charge an electric vehicle over a period of 10 \n        to 20 minutes; and\n            (3) focus on infrastructure that provides consumers with \n        the lowest cost while providing convenient charge system \n        access.\n    (e) LEEP Coordinator.--The Secretary may designate 1 full-time \nposition within the Department of Transportation to be known as the \n``LEEP coordinator'' with responsibility to oversee--\n            (1) the development of the Plan; and\n            (2) the implementation of the regional pilot projects under \n        section 5.\n\nSEC. 5. PILOT PROJECTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary may establish 4 pilot projects to \ndemonstrate electric drive vehicles and infrastructure--\n            (1) in rural locations; and\n            (2) in commercial use.\n    (b) Requirements.--The Secretary shall--\n            (1) establish the pilot projects after the publication of \n        the Plan;\n            (2) use the Plan to determine which regions of the United \n        States are most ready to demonstrate electric vehicle \n        infrastructure;\n            (3) carry out the pilot projects in different regions of \n        the United States; and\n            (4) ensure that--\n                    (A) at least 1 pilot project is carried out in a \n                rural region of the United States; and\n                    (B) at least 1 pilot project is focused on freight \n                issues.\n    (c) Financial Resources.--In carrying out the regional pilot \nprojects, the Secretary shall coordinate the use of appropriate \nfinancial incentives, grant programs, and other Federal financial \nresources to ensure that electric infrastructure delivery entities are \nable to participate in the regional pilot projects.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums \nas are necessary--\n            (1) to develop the Plan;\n            (2) to pay the salary and expenses of the LEEP coordinator \n        described in section 4(e); and\n            (3) to carry out the regional pilot projects under section \n        5."
