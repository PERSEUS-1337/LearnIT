FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 1877, the United States forcibly relocated members \n        of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe from the Montana Territory to \n        Oklahoma;\n            (2) soon thereafter, in the face of great hardship and \n        suffering significant loss of life, the Tribe walked back to \n        the Montana Territory to reclaim the ancestral homeland of the \n        Tribe;\n            (3) in 1884, President Arthur established a 371,200-acre \n        reservation for the Tribe extending eastward from the eastern \n        boundary of the Crow Indian Reservation to approximately 12 \n        miles east of Rosebud Creek in Montana;\n            (4) the Tongue River Indian Reservation, as the reservation \n        was known as at the time of establishment, included within the \n        boundaries of the Reservation--\n                    (A) tracts occupied legally and illegally by non-\n                Indian settlers; and\n                    (B) tracts (including the subsurface rights) owned \n                by the Northern Pacific Railway;\n            (5) in addition to the Northern Cheyenne individuals living \n        on the Tongue River Indian Reservation, Northern Cheyenne \n        families, with encouragement and assistance from the United \n        States military, settled on land to the east of the Reservation \n        and on both sides of the Tongue River;\n            (6) in 1898, at the direction of Congress, the Secretary of \n        the Interior dispatched Indian Inspector James McLaughlin to \n        southeastern Montana to report on opportunities for reducing \n        hostilities between the Northern Cheyenne and non-Indian \n        settlers;\n            (7) in 1900, in accordance with the recommendations of \n        McLaughlin--\n                    (A) President McKinley expanded the Tongue River \n                Indian Reservation from the Crow Indian Reservation on \n                the west to the middle of the Tongue River on the east; \n                and\n                    (B) Congress appropriated funds--\n                            (i) to purchase settler land and claims and \n                        the Northern Pacific Railway land within the \n                        expanded Reservation; and\n                            (ii) to relocate to the expanded \n                        reservation 46 Northern Cheyenne families who \n                        had settled on land to the east of the Tongue \n                        River;\n            (8) however, when McLaughlin negotiated to purchase the \n        tracts held by the Northern Pacific Railway within the expanded \n        Northern Cheyenne Reservation, McLaughlin neglected to purchase \n        the subsurface rights of the Railway in 8 sections totaling \n        approximately 5,000 acres;\n            (9) the subsurface rights described in paragraph (8)--\n                    (A) are currently owned by Great Northern \n                Properties; and\n                    (B) constitute the only subsurface within the \n                Reservation not owned by the Tribe;\n            (10) the Tribe asserts that the Tribe retains claims \n        against the United States arising from the continuing failure \n        of the United States to acquire the subsurface rights described \n        in paragraph (8) as directed by Congress;\n            (11) in 2002, the Tribe brought suit against the Secretary, \n        asserting that the proposed conveyances of the extensive \n        Federal coal tracts to the State under the Department of the \n        Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public \n        Law 105-83; 111 Stat. 1543) would violate--\n                    (A) the Federal trust responsibility to the Tribe; \n                and\n                    (B) several Federal laws;\n            (12) although the Northern Cheyenne tribal community \n        chronically suffers harsh economic conditions and severe \n        deficits in public services and facilities, the community does \n        not share in any significant portion of the public revenues \n        generated by surrounding energy development;\n            (13) subsequently, the Tribe withdrew the 2002 suit against \n        the United States, with prejudice, based in large part on \n        commitments that legislation substantially in the form of this \n        Act (and further legislation providing funding to the Tribe to \n        address the impacts of coal development in areas adjoining the \n        Reservation) would be introduced and pursued with support from \n        the State, Great Northern Properties, and others; and\n            (14) if the conveyances of mineral rights authorized by \n        this Act are carried out, the Tribe will waive all legal claims \n        against the United States arising from the longstanding and \n        continuing loss to the Tribe of the Reservation mineral rights \n        owned by Great Northern Properties.\n\nSEC. 3.
