FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) section 4 of article IV of the Constitution provides \n        that the United States shall guarantee a republican form of \n        government to the States;\n            (2) organized criminal actions are an increasing threat to \n        the republican form of government in some States;\n            (3) people who are responsible for upholding the laws of \n        the United States and the several States, and people who assist \n        them, have been threatened, harassed, and assaulted because of \n        these activities;\n            (4) this violence is having a chilling effect on the \n        democratic process because Americans are afraid to participate \n        in town hall meetings, express their views publicly, or take \n        part in the political process;\n            (5) most victims are targeted solely because of their views \n        or activism on controversial political issues such as gun \n        control, abortion, environmental matters, or the role of \n        government in society;\n            (6) this violence is causing a breakdown of law and order \n        in many parts of the United States;\n            (7) this violence has increased in part because of \n        unfounded exaggerations about the impact of recent firearms \n        laws such as the Brady Law and the ban on assault weapons, as \n        well as baseless conspiracy theories regarding the government; \n        and\n            (8) the climate of violence created by these criminals \n        threatens to undermine republican government in some States.\n\nSEC. 3.
