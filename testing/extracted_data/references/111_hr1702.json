FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Approximately 51 percent of the world's population \n        currently lives in cities of all sizes and produces the \n        majority of the world's economic output.\n            (2) Approximately one billion people currently live in \n        slums, and more than half of this population is under the age \n        of 25.\n            (3) It is estimated that by 2030 the number of people \n        living in slums will double.\n            (4) Slums are characterized by inadequate access to safe \n        water, sanitation, and other essential infrastructure, \n        overcrowding, poorly structured housing, and insecure \n        residential and property ownership status.\n            (5) Eighty-eight percent of all disease is caused by unsafe \n        drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene and \n        almost 50 percent of all people in developing countries suffer \n        health problems caused by water and sanitation deficits.\n            (6) Over 1.1 billion people lack adequate access to safe \n        water and nearly 2.5 billion lack access to sanitation \n        services.\n            (7) The costs of diseases and productivity losses linked to \n        water and sanitation in less developed countries amount to two \n        percent of gross domestic product and up to five percent in \n        sub-Saharan Africa.\n            (8) Insecure lease and real property ownership tenure often \n        subject slum dwellers to arbitrary, often supra-market rents, \n        forced evictions, threats, and harassment.\n            (9) In 2007, approximately five million people were subject \n        to forced evictions, and projections show that the number of \n        forced evictions are likely to increase to between 40 million \n        and 70 million in the next 20 years.\n            (10) Insecurity of tenure severely inhibits economic \n        development by undermining investment incentives and \n        constraining the growth of credit markets, imperils the ability \n        of families to achieve sustainable livelihoods and assured \n        access to shelter, and often contributes to conflict over \n        property rights.\n            (11) Women make up 66 percent of the world's work force, \n        but own less than 15 percent of the property globally.\n            (12) Women are affected disproportionally by forced \n        evictions and insecure tenure as a result of gender \n        discrimination, often including gender-biased laws that define \n        women as legal minors or otherwise prevent them from acquiring \n        and securing land, property, and housing lease or ownership \n        rights, making them more vulnerable to poverty, violence, and \n        sexual abuse.\n            (13) Adequate housing and universal access to basic shelter \n        serve as catalysts for social and democratic development.\n            (14) The 2006 National Security Strategy states, \n        ``America's national interests and moral values drive us in the \n        same direction: to assist the world's poor citizens and least \n        developed nations and help integrate them into the global \n        economy.''.\n            (15) Goal 7 Target 11 of the Millennium Development Goals \n        sets the target that ``By 2020, to have achieved a significant \n        improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-\n        dwellers.''.\n            (16) The United States formerly provided significant levels \n        of overseas development assistance for shelter and affordable \n        housing, but in recent years this amount has declined.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It should be the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to establish and implement, as a major objective of \n        United States overseas development assistance strategy, \n        particularly in developing countries, programs that foster \n        improved urban management, that foster sustainable urban \n        development, that increase the security of real property \n        tenure, and that expand access to basic shelter, affordable \n        urban housing, and essential urban services and infrastructure, \n        particularly by the poor and others who lack such access in \n        whole or in part;\n            (2) to allocate increased levels of United States bilateral \n        assistance for programs described in paragraph (1); and\n            (3) in order to prevent waste and duplication in the use of \n        United States overseas development assistance with respect to \n        the programs described in paragraph (1) and in order to foster \n        cooperative relations with foreign governments, \n        intergovernmental organizations, and private business and \n        nonprofit entities that singly or jointly support or implement \n        programs similar to those described in paragraph (1), to seek \n        and actively support innovative international mechanisms \n        designed to increase coordination and mutual complementarity in \n        the planning, financing, and implementation of sustainable \n        urban development policies and programs implemented by the \n        United States and other donors described in this paragraph.\n\nSEC. 4.
