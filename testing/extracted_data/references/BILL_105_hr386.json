FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) cohort default rates alone do not indicate the quality \n        of an educational institution;\n            (2) for the purpose of evaluating performance of an \n        institution of higher education, the population which that \n        institution serves should be taken into account;\n            (3) schools whose students are from less affluent \n        backgrounds have more difficulty with cohort default rate \n        standards;\n            (4) use of the cohort default rates as a determinant for \n        participation in Federal student loan programs has kept \n        technical and vocational school operators from opening schools \n        in impoverished areas;\n            (5) many individuals living in impoverished areas have been \n        effectively denied an opportunity to access technical and \n        vocational higher education; and\n            (6) the performance of a technical or vocational \n        institution of higher education can be measured by objective \n        data concerning the outcome from the perspective of the \n        student.\n\nSEC. 3. USE OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY IN INSTITUTIONAL ELIGIBILITY FOR \n              GUARANTEED STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM.\n\n      Section 435(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n1085(a)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``paragraph (2)'' and \n        inserting ``paragraphs (2) and (4)'';\n            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``An institution'' and \n        inserting ``Except as provided in paragraph (4), an \n        institution'';\n            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(4) Ineligibility based on educational quality index.--\n                    ``(A) Use of index in place of cohort default \n                rate.--A proprietary institution of higher education \n                (as such term is defined in section 481(b)) shall not \n                be subject to ineligibility determinations under \n                paragraph (2), but shall be subject to such \n                determinations on the basis of the educational quality \n                index prescribed under this paragraph.\n                    ``(B) Prescription of index.--The Secretary of \n                Education shall by regulation prescribe an educational \n                quality index for the purpose of evaluating the \n                programs of proprietary institutions of higher \n                education.
