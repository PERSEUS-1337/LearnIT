FINDINGS POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) fishing is an important and traditional recreational \n        activity in which 36,000,000 Americans 16-years-old and older \n        participate;\n            (2) hunting is an important and traditional recreational \n        activity in which 14,000,000 Americans 16-years-old and older \n        participate;\n            (3) survey data from a recent comprehensive 3-year study \n        entitled ``Factors Related to Hunting and Fishing Participation \n        in the United States'' suggest that 95 percent of Americans \n        agreed fishing should remain legal and 81 percent agreed \n        hunting should remain legal;\n            (4) anglers and hunters have been and continue to be among \n        the foremost supporters of sound wildlife management and \n        conservation practices in the United States;\n            (5) persons who hunt or fish and organizations related to \n        those activities provide direct assistance to wildlife managers \n        and enforcement officers of Federal, State, and local \n        Governments;\n            (6) funds raised through license, permit, and stamp \n        purchases as well as through excise taxes on goods used by \n        anglers and hunters have generated more than $6,000,000,000 for \n        wildlife research and management; and\n            (7) fishing and hunting are essential components of \n        effective wildlife management in that they tend to reduce \n        conflicts between people and wildlife and by providing \n        incentives for the conservation of wildlife and the habitats \n        and ecosystems on which wildlife depends.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that each \nFederal agency that manages a natural resource or the land and water on \nwhich a natural resource depends shall support, promote, and enhance \nopportunities for fishing and hunting.\n\nSEC. 3. TAKING OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ON FEDERAL LANDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Federal land shall be open to access and for use \nfor fishing and hunting unless--\n            (1) the responsible agency of the State in which the \n        Federal land is located limits access to and use of the land as \n        part of wildlife management by the State; or\n            (2) the Federal agency responsible for Federal public land \n        limits access and use--\n                    (A) for reasons of national security; or\n                    (B) for reasons related to specific statutory \n                requirements regarding the management and use of the \n                land, if the requirements are clearly and directly \n                incompatible with fishing or hunting.\n    (b) No Priority.--This section does not require a Federal agency to \ngive preference to fishing or hunting over other uses of Federal land \nor land management priorities established in Federal law.\n    (c) Authority of the States.--\n            (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act impairs the primacy of \n        State authority in regulating the taking of fish and wildlife \n        on land within the State, including Federal land.\n            (2) Federal authority.--Except as expressly provided by Act \n        of Congress, the authority of a Federal agency regarding the \n        taking of fish and wildlife on Federal land managed by the \n        Federal agency shall be no greater than the rights of a private \n        owner of land.\n\nSEC. 4.
