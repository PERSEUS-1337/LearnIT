    "content": "On September 5, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama Administration initiative, was being rescinded. A related memorandum released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that same day rescinded the 2012 memorandum that established the DACA process. DACA was created to provide temporary relief from removal from the United States for individuals without a lawful immigration status who were brought to the United States as children and met other criteria. Under the DACA process, both initial grants of deferred action and renewals are issued for a period of two years.  In addition to rescinding the 2012 DACA memorandum, the September 2017 memorandum states that DHS will \"execute a wind-down\" of DACA, during which it will \"adjudicate certain requests for DACA and associated applications meeting certain parameters.\" These requests include initial and renewal requests for DACA accepted by DHS by September 5, 2017, and renewal requests from current DACA beneficiaries whose benefits will expire between September 5, 2017, and March 5, 2018, and whose renewal requests are accepted by DHS by October 5, 2017. The memorandum also states that DHS will not terminate previously issued grants of deferred action or employment authorization \"solely based on the directives in this memorandum.\"  To provide context for the Trump Administration's rescission of DACA and possible congressional action, this report addresses frequently asked questions about the DACA initiative.  The DACA initiative was announced by former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano in a June 15, 2012, DHS memorandum entitled, \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children.\" The DACA initiative was not established by executive order. The eligibility criteria are under age 16 at the time of entry into the United States; under age 31 on June 15, 2012; continuous residence in the United States for at least five years before June 15, 2012 (that is, since June 15, 2007); physical presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making the request for consideration of deferred action; not in lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012; not convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and not otherwise a threat to national security or public safety; and in school, graduated from high school or obtained general education development certificate, or honorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces or the Coast Guard. In addition, an individual must be at least age 15 to request DACA, unless he or she is in removal proceedings or has a final removal order or voluntary departure order. An individual must have filed the following three forms with DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS): Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization Form I-765WS, Worksheet The individual also should have submitted evidence that he or she met the DACA eligibility requirements (see \" What are the eligibility requirements for consideration of DACA? \").  Yes. The fees, which most recently totaled $495, consisted of a Form I-765 filing fee of $410 and biometric services fee of $85. There were limited fee exemptions available. An individual must have requested and received a fee exemption before submitting a DACA request without a fee. Yes. The biographic and biometric information submitted by applicants is checked against databases maintained by DHS and other federal agencies.  According to DHS, information provided in a DACA request generally \"will not be proactively provided to other law enforcement entities (including ICE and CBP) for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless the requestor poses a risk to national security or public safety\" or meets certain criteria. At the same time, DHS maintains the following: This policy, which may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter. No. USCIS's decision on a DACA request is discretionary.  The period has closed. USCIS stopped accepting initial DACA requests as of September 5, 2017. However, the agency will reportedly adjudicate initial requests for DACA accepted by that date.  Individuals granted deferred action may receive work authorization if they can demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Previously, an individual granted deferred action under DACA who wanted to travel outside the United States could apply to USCIS for advance parole. Advance parole is permission for a foreign national to re-enter the United States after temporarily traveling abroad. USCIS, however, is no longer approving advance parole requests associated with DACA. At the same time, the September 2017 DHS memorandum stated that DHS \"will generally honor the validity period for previously approved applications for advance parole.\" DACA recipients, like other foreign nationals without lawful immigration status, are barred from receiving federal public benefits with the exception of certain forms of short-term, emergency assistance.  No. DACA recipients are not granted a lawful immigration status and are not put on a pathway to a lawful immigration status. During the period of deferred action, however, the DACA recipient is in a period of stay authorized by DHS. Presumably, yes. According to DHS, the agency \"will continue to exercise its discretionary authority to terminate or deny deferred action at any time when immigration officials determine termination or denial of deferred action is appropriate.\"  The DACA recipient must satisfy the following criteria: the individual did not depart from the United States on or after August 15, 2012, without first obtaining advance parole (see \" Are DACA recipients allowed to travel outside the United States? \"); the individual has continuously resided in the United States since submitting his or her latest approved DACA request; and the individual has not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and is not a threat to national security or public safety. According to DHS, it will accept renewal requests from eligible DACA recipients until October 5, 2017 (see \" Introduction \"). To request a renewal of deferred action under DACA, an individual must file the following three forms with DHS/USCIS: Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization Form I-765WS, Worksheet The forms are available on the USCIS website, http://www.uscis.gov . An individual requesting a DACA renewal does not have to submit any documents that he or she previously provided to USCIS in connection with an approved DACA request. However, the individual does have to submit any new documents related to removal proceedings or criminal history. USCIS will request additional documentation from the individual, if needed. There is a total fee of $495, consisting of a Form I-765 filing fee of $410 and biometric services fee of $85. No. The decision on a request to renew DACA is discretionary, as it is on an initial DACA request.  No. An individual granted deferred action (an initial grant or a renewal) is not given a lawful immigration status and is not put on a pathway to a lawful immigration status (see \" Are DACA recipients granted lawful immigration status? \").  An individual who loses DACA would no longer have the protection from removal that DACA provides. Whether or not the U.S. government would take steps to remove that individual from the country is a separate issue. As of March 31, 2017, a total of 787,580 initial DACA requests and 799,077 renewal requests had been approved.  Of all the initial DACA requests accepted by USCIS for consideration and decided by March 31, 2017 , approximately 92% were approved and 8% were denied, terminated, or withdrawn. For renewal requests accepted and decided by March 31, 2017, the approval rate was approximately 99% and the denial/termination/withdrawal rate was 1%. No legislation on DACA has been enacted. During the 113 th Congress, however, the House of Representatives passed a bill ( H.R. 5272 ) to prohibit using federal funds to process DACA applications. That bill read, in part: No agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government may use Federal funding or resources after July 30, 2014\u2014 (1) to consider or adjudicate any new or previously denied application of any alien requesting consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals, as authorized by Executive memorandum dated June 15, 2012 and effective on August 15, 2012 (or by any other succeeding Executive memorandum or policy authorizing a similar program)....  Several bills have been introduced in the 115 th Congress to provide different forms of immigration protection to unauthorized childhood arrivals who satisfy specified eligibility criteria. Some of these bills, including the Bar Removal of Individuals who Dream and Grow our Economy (BRIDGE) Act ( S. 128 / H.R. 496 ) and the Securing Active and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Act ( S. 127 ), would provide temporary protection from removal and employment authorization to eligible individuals. Other measures, including the Encourage New Legalized Immigrants to Start Training (ENLIST) Act ( H.R. 60 ), the Recognizing America's Children Act ( H.R. 1468 ), the American Hope Act of 2017 ( H.R. 3591 ), and the Dream Act of 2017 ( S. 1615 / H.R. 3440 ), would establish pathways for eligible individuals to become U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPRs). (These measures bear similarities to Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act bills introduced in past Congresses.) Legislation known as the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act was introduced in past Congresses. This legislation sought to establish a process for eligible unauthorized individuals who entered the United States as children to obtain LPR status. DREAM Act provisions were introduced both as stand-alone bills and as parts of larger immigration reform bills. Although DREAM Act legislation has never been enacted, some measures have seen legislative action. For example, in the 111 th Congress, the House approved DREAM Act language as part of an unrelated bill, the Removal Clarification Act of 2010 ( H.R. 5281 ). In the 113 th Congress, the Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act ( S. 744 ), which incorporated DREAM Act language in its legalization provisions."
