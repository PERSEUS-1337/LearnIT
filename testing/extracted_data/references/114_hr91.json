VETERANS IDENTIFICATION CARD.\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Effective on the day before the date of the enactment of \n    this Act, veteran identification cards were issued to veterans who \n    have either completed the statutory time-in-service requirement for \n    retirement from the Armed Forces or who have received a medical-\n    related discharge from the Armed Forces.\n        (2) Effective on the day before the date of the enactment of \n    this Act, a veteran who served a minimum obligated time in service, \n    but who did not meet the criteria described in paragraph (1), did \n    not receive a means of identifying the veteran's status as a \n    veteran other than using the Department of Defense form DD-214 \n    discharge papers of the veteran.\n        (3) Goods, services, and promotional activities are often \n    offered by public and private institutions to veterans who \n    demonstrate proof of service in the military, but it is impractical \n    for a veteran to always carry Department of Defense form DD-214 \n    discharge papers to demonstrate such proof.\n        (4) A general purpose veteran identification card made \n    available to veterans would be useful to demonstrate the status of \n    the veterans without having to carry and use official Department of \n    Defense form DD-214 discharge papers.\n        (5) On the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, \n    the Department of Veterans Affairs had the infrastructure in place \n    across the United States to produce photographic identification \n    cards and accept a small payment to cover the cost of these cards.\n    (b) Provision of Veteran Identification Cards.--Chapter 57 of title \n38, United States Code, is amended by adding after section 5705 the \nfollowing new section:\n``Sec. 5706.
