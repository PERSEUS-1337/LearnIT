REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Bloodborne Pathogens Standard.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n        Secretary of Labor, acting through the Occupational Safety and \n        Health Administration, shall amend the bloodborne pathogens \n        standard to require that--\n                    (A) employers utilize needleless systems and sharps \n                with engineered sharps injury protections in their work \n                sites to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens; \n                and\n                    (B) to assist employers in meeting the requirement \n                of subparagraph (A), non-managerial direct care health \n                care workers of employers participate in the \n                identification and evaluation of needleless systems and \n                sharps with engineered sharps injury protections.\n            (2) Exception.--The bloodborne pathogens standard \n        requirements of paragraph (1) shall apply to any employer, \n        except where the employer demonstrates, to the Secretary's \n        satisfaction, that--\n                    (A) there are circumstances in the employer's work \n                facility in which the needleless systems and sharps \n                with engineered sharps injury protections do not \n                promote employee safety, interfere with patient safety, \n                or interfere with the success of a medical procedure;
