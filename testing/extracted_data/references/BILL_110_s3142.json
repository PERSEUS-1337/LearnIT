FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Every year, more than 25,000 women in the United States \n        experience stillbirth.\n            (2) Common diagnosable causes for stillbirth include \n        genetic abnormalities, umbilical cord accidents, infections, \n        and placental problems, however, more than half of all \n        stillbirths remain unexplained.\n            (3) A number of risk factors for stillbirth have been \n        described in pregnant women such as maternal age, obesity, \n        smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and previous stillbirth.\n            (4) Good prenatal care, not smoking, and not drinking \n        alcohol are helpful strategies for pregnant women to reduce the \n        risk of stillbirth, however, researchers continue to perform \n        studies into other effective modes of reducing the risk, \n        including monitoring fetal activity or ``in utero'' movement \n        starting at approximately 28 weeks.\n            (5) Half of the more than 4,500 sudden, unexpected infant \n        deaths (SUID) that occur each year in the United States are due \n        to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is the leading \n        cause of SUID and of all deaths among infants aged 1 to 12 \n        months.\n            (6) Sudden infant death syndrome is a diagnosis of \n        exclusion and is only determined after all known causes are \n        excluded by a thorough examination of the death scene, a review \n        of the clinical history, and performance of an autopsy. \n        However, some SUID are not investigated and, even when they \n        are, cause-of-death data are not collected and reported \n        consistently.\n            (7) Inaccurate classification of cause and manner of death \n        impedes prevention efforts and complicates our ability to \n        understand risk factors related to these deaths.\n            (8) Death certificate data cannot fully characterize the \n        sudden, unexpected infant deaths nor identify potential risk \n        factors amenable to prevention.\n\nSEC. 3.
