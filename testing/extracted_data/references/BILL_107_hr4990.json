FINDINGS.\n\n  The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Legitimate Internet sellers of prescription drugs can \n        offer substantial benefits to consumers. These potential \n        benefits include convenience, privacy, valuable information, \n        competitive prices, and personalized services.\n            (2) Unlawful Internet sellers of prescription drugs may \n        dispense inappropriate, contaminated, counterfeit, or subpotent \n        prescription drugs that could put at risk the health and safety \n        of consumers.\n            (3) Unlawful Internet sellers have exposed consumers to \n        significant health risks by knowingly filling invalid \n        prescriptions, such as prescriptions based solely on an online \n        questionnaire, or by dispensing prescription drugs without any \n        prescription.\n            (4) Consumers may have difficulty distinguishing legitimate \n        from unlawful Internet sellers, as well as foreign from \n        domestic Internet sellers, of prescription drugs.\n\nSEC. 912.
