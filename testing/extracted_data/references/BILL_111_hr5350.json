FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) North Korean negotiators in the Six-Party diplomatic \n        process did not act in good faith by their refusal to agree to \n        a transparent verification process for denuclearization \n        consistent with ``international standards'', including \n        provisions for nuclear sampling, following North Korea's \n        removal on October 11, 2008, from the list of state sponsors of \n        terrorism maintained by the Department of State.\n            (2) International press reports indicate that North Korea \n        has continued to provide support to Iran in the areas of \n        missile technology and nuclear development and has provided \n        Iran's surrogates, Hezbollah and Hamas, with both missile \n        technology and training in tunneling techniques with which to \n        attack Israel, an ally of the United States.\n            (3) International press reports indicate that North Korea \n        was engaged for a number of years in assistance to Syria in the \n        construction of a nuclear reactor in the Syrian desert which \n        was destroyed in a strike by Israeli forces on September 6, \n        2007.\n            (4) North Korean negotiators continue to refuse to address \n        in a humane and sincere manner the issue of the abduction of \n        civilians of Japan and the Republic of Korea, both allies of \n        the United States, as well as the abductions of citizens from a \n        number of other countries, including France, Lebanon, Romania, \n        and Thailand.\n            (5) Defectors coming out of North Korea have provided \n        testimony that United States permanent resident, Reverend Kim \n        Dong-shik, the spouse and father of United States citizens, was \n        tortured and murdered inside North Korea after his abduction by \n        Pyongyang's agents on the Chinese border in January 2000 and \n        that his remains are currently being held at a military \n        facility inside North Korea.\n            (6) Congress authoritatively expressed its view, in section \n        202(b)(2) of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public \n        Law 108-333; 22 U.S.C. 7832(b)(2)) that ``United States \n        nonhumanitarian assistance to North Korea shall be contingent \n        on North Korea's substantial progress'' on human rights \n        improvements, release of and accounting for abductees, family \n        reunification, reform of North Korea's labor camp system, and \n        the decriminalization of political expression, none of which \n        has occurred.\n            (7) Congress further authoritatively expressed its view, in \n        section 2 of the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act \n        of 2008 (Public Law 110-346) that ``human rights and \n        humanitarian conditions inside North Korea are deplorable'' and \n        that ``North Korean refugees remain acutely vulnerable''.\n            (8) Congress has determined that any missile test or launch \n        conducted by North Korea would be in direct violation of United \n        Nations Security Council resolution 1695, adopted on July 16, \n        2006, which ``condemns the multiple launches by the DPRK (North \n        Korea) of ballistic missiles on July 5 2006 local time'', and \n        United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, adopted on \n        October 9, 2006, which ``demands that the DPRK (North Korea) \n        not conduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic \n        missile'' and ``decides that the DPRK shall suspend all \n        activities related to its ballistic missile programme and in \n        this context re-establish its pre-existing commitments to a \n        moratorium on missile launching'', and further determines that \n        the resulting sanctions imposed under such resolution 1718 \n        would again come into full effect following a missile test or \n        launch.\n            (9) Congress has further determined that a return by North \n        Korea to the Six-Party diplomatic process following any missile \n        test or launch by Pyongyang must include a firm and transparent \n        commitment to the complete, verifiable and irreversible \n        dismantlement of all of North Korea's nuclear programs, \n        including those derived both from plutonium as well as highly \n        enriched uranium.\n            (10) Japanese press reports have indicated that a \n        delegation of approximately fifteen Iranian missile experts \n        arrived in North Korea in March 2009 ``to help Pyongyang \n        prepare for a rocket launch'', including senior officials with \n        the Iranian rocket and satellite producer Shahid Hemmat \n        Industrial Group, and that they brought with them a letter from \n        their President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to North Korean leader Kim \n        Jong-Il stressing the importance of cooperating on space \n        technology.\n            (11) North Korea, in defiance of the international \n        community's efforts to end nuclear proliferation and in \n        violation of its international obligations, conducted a second \n        underground nuclear test on May 25, 2009 (local time), in \n        violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, \n        which resulted in the passage of United Nations Security \n        Council Resolution 1874 on June 12, 2009, which imposed \n        additional sanctions and inspection requirements with regard to \n        North Korea.\n\nSEC. 3. CONTINUATION OF RESTRICTIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTH \n              KOREA.\n\n    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that subsequent to the decision of the \nSecretary of State on October 11, 2008, to rescind the designation of \nNorth Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, North Korea has committed \nacts that can be defined as international terrorism or as highly \nprovocative, including--\n            (1) the dispatch of a covert team of two North Korean \n        military-trained agents to South Korea with orders to \n        assassinate North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop who were \n        apprehended by South Korean officials in April 2010;\n            (2) complicity in the sinking of the South Korean naval \n        vessel Cheonan on March 26, 2010, which resulted in the deaths \n        of 46 South Korean naval personnel;
