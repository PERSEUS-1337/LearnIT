FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n        perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n        sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a serious \n        national problem.\n            (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n        communities and is deeply divisive.\n            (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n        to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of \n        violent crimes in the United States, including violent crimes \n        motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out their \n        responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n        assistance.\n            (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n        problem.\n            (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime \n        motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \n        victim and the family and friends of the victim, but frequently \n        savages the community sharing the traits that caused the victim \n        to be selected.\n            (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n        in many ways, including--\n                    (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted \n                groups and forcing such members to move across State \n                lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence; \n                and\n                    (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n                purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n                employment, or participating in other commercial \n                activity.\n            (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n            (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n        interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n        such violence.\n            (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n        traveled in interstate commerce.\n            (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n        involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n        ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n        servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n        of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, \n        through widespread public and private violence directed at \n        persons because of their race, color, or ancestry, or perceived \n        race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, eliminating racially \n        motivated violence is an important means of eliminating, to the \n        extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery \n        and involuntary servitude.\n            (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n        amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n        adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n        and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n        distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the extent \n        possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery, it is \n        necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of real or \n        perceived religions or national origins, at least to the extent \n        such religions or national origins were regarded as races at \n        the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments \n        to the Constitution of the United States.\n            (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n        motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local authorities \n        to work together as partners in the investigation and \n        prosecution of such crimes.\n            (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n        sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n        to warrant Federal assistance to States and local \n        jurisdictions.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning as in \nsection 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \nof 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\nSEC. 4. SUPPORT FOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS BY STATE \n              AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.\n\n    (a) Assistance Other Than Financial Assistance.--\n            (1) In general.--At the request of a law enforcement \n        official of a State or Indian tribe, the Attorney General may \n        provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form \n        of assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of \n        any crime that--\n                    (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as defined in \n                section 16 of title 18, United States Code);\n                    (B) constitutes a felony under the laws of the \n                State or Indian tribe; and\n                    (C) is motivated by prejudice based on the race, \n                color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual \n                orientation, or disability of the victim, or is a \n                violation of the hate crime laws of the State or Indian \n                tribe.\n            (2) Priority.--In providing assistance under paragraph (1), \n        the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes committed by \n        offenders who have committed crimes in more than 1 State and to \n        rural jurisdictions that have difficulty covering the \n        extraordinary expenses relating to the investigation or \n        prosecution of the crime.\n    (b) Grants.--\n            (1) In general.--The Attorney General may award grants to \n        assist State, local, and Indian law enforcement officials with \n        the extraordinary expenses associated with the investigation \n        and prosecution of hate crimes.\n            (2) Office of justice programs.--In implementing the grant \n        program, the Office of Justice Programs shall work closely with \n        the funded jurisdictions to ensure that the concerns and needs \n        of all affected parties, including community groups and \n        schools, colleges, and universities, are addressed through the \n        local infrastructure developed under the grants.\n            (3)  Application.--\n                    (A) In general.--Each State that desires a grant \n                under this subsection shall submit an application to \n                the Attorney General at such time, in such manner, and \n                accompanied by or containing such information as the \n                Attorney General shall reasonably require.\n                    (B) Date for submission.--Applications submitted \n                pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be submitted during \n                the 60-day period beginning on a date that the Attorney \n                General shall prescribe.\n                    (C) Requirements.--A State or political subdivision \n                of a State or tribal official applying for assistance \n                under this subsection shall--\n                            (i) describe the extraordinary purposes for \n                        which the grant is needed;\n                            (ii) certify that the State, political \n                        subdivision, or Indian tribe lacks the \n                        resources necessary to investigate or prosecute \n                        the hate crime;\n                            (iii) demonstrate that, in developing a \n                        plan to implement the grant, the State, \n                        political subdivision, or tribal official has \n                        consulted and coordinated with nonprofit, \n                        nongovernmental victim services programs that \n                        have experience in providing services to \n                        victims of hate crimes;
