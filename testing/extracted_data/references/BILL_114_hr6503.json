PURPOSE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--This Act seeks to achieve a consistent standard of \ninforming newly pregnant women of all services and support that are \navailable to them and to ensure that such women are not abandoned. \nWomen at the point of learning about an unplanned pregnancy often ask \nthemselves what society will to do support them. A myriad of services \nand support is available, but often pregnant women, and even providers, \nare unaware of such services and support. The purpose of this Act is to \nensure that newly pregnant women are aware of all the services and \nsupport that are available to them and this Act furthers the authority \nto make specialized grants in this regard.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Many women do not know where to turn for available \n        assistance during pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing, \n        particularly when facing financial, social, emotional, and \n        other life challenges.\n            (2) Women who are pregnant and in fear of being abandoned \n        during pregnancy should have access to available local, State, \n        and Federal governmental, as well as civil society, pregnancy \n        and parenting resources.\n            (3) In a study of how women in the United States face \n        challenging circumstances during pregnancy that affect a \n        woman's willingness to carry a child to term, research shows \n        that of women who do not carry their child to term--\n                    (A) 44 percent are college-aged;\n                    (B) 61 percent have at least one child;\n                    (C) 69 percent are facing economic challenges;\n                    (D) 75 percent feel they cannot afford a child; and\n                    (E) 75 percent say that having a baby would \n                interfere with work, school, or the ability to care for \n                other dependents.\n            (4) When a woman discovers she is pregnant while facing \n        physical, financial, social, emotional, and other life \n        challenges, the people around her can help to mitigate anxiety \n        in the face of uncertainty by providing practical support with \n        day-to-day needs associated with pregnancy, birth, and \n        motherhood, particularly in the context of her concerns about--\n                    (A) family, paternity, and community support during \n                pregnancy and following the birth of a child or \n                children;\n                    (B) securing opportunities that a woman may \n                require, including the completion of education that \n                leads to employment; and\n                    (C) workplaces that accommodate pregnant and \n                parenting women.\n            (5) Often pregnant women are unaware of the support that \n        may be available to them from private and public sources at the \n        local, State, and national levels.\n\n           TITLE I--PREGNANCY AND PARENTING SUPPORT SERVICES\n\nSEC. 101. PREGNANCY AND PARENTING SUPPORT SERVICES.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that women \nwho are pregnant and fear being abandoned under difficult life \ncircumstances, and recipients of care funded through title X of the \nPublic Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.), title XX of the \nSocial Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397 et seq.), and other Federal, State, \nand local health care programs, should be aware of the services \navailable, during and after pregnancy, that will support them while \ncarrying their children to live birth as well as supporting women who \nare raising their children following birth or giving their children up \nfor adoption.\n    (b) Support Services.--Part D of title III of the Public Health \nService Act (42 U.S.C. 254b et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating section 330F as section 330F-1; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 330E the following:\n\n``SEC. 330F.
