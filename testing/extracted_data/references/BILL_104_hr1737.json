FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) spaceport development is a national economic interest \n        that should be pursued as part of a national transportation \n        policy;\n            (2) many nations around the world, including France, China, \n        Russia, Japan, Canada, and Australia, have embarked on \n        aggressive commercial space development programs;\n            (3) the United States, once the leader in the commercial \n        space market, is in danger of falling behind in the \n        international commercial space market;\n            (4) the Government must clearly demonstrate its commitment \n        to support commercial space activity in America, thereby \n        encouraging greater financial support from private industry;\n            (5) the United States must develop a long-term, \n        comprehensive, and aggressive policy to successfully compete in \n        the international commercial space market, to return the United \n        States to its position of primary world supplier of launch \n        services; and\n            (6) spaceport development is the key component in this \n        endeavor because it provides the final piece--launch \n        facilities--to the existing parts of the United States \n        commercial space market.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n    For purposes of this Act, the term ``spaceport'' means a space \nlaunch or recovery facility, or a supporting educational or research \nfacility providing space industry worker training or commercial \napplication research, designated by a State in an application approved \nunder section 5.\n\nSEC. 4.
