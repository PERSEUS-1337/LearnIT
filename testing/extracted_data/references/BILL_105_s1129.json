PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect children from the trauma of witnessing or \n        experiencing violence, sexual abuse, neglect, abduction, rape, \n        or death during parent-child visitation and visitation \n        exchanges;\n            (2) to protect victims of domestic violence from \n        experiencing further violence during child visitation and \n        visitation exchanges; and\n            (3) to provide safe havens for parents and children during \n        visitation and visitation exchanges, to promote continuity and \n        stability.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Family violence does not necessarily cease when family \n        victims are legally separated by divorce or otherwise not \n        sharing a household.\n            (2) According to a 1996 report by the American \n        Psychological Association, custody and visitation disputes are \n        more frequent when there is a history of domestic violence.\n            (3) Family violence often escalates following separation \n        and divorce, and child custody and visitation arrangements \n        become the new forum for the continuation of abuse.\n            (4) According to a 1996 report by the American \n        Psychological Association, fathers who batter mothers are twice \n        as likely to seek sole custody of their children. In these \n        circumstances, if the abusive father loses custody he is more \n        likely to continue the threats to the mother through other \n        legal actions.\n            (5) Some perpetrators of violence use the children as pawns \n        to control the abused party and to commit more violence during \n        separation or divorce. In one study, 34 percent of women in \n        shelters and callers to hotlines reported threats of \n        kidnapping, 11 percent reported that the batterer had kidnapped \n        the child for some period, and 21 percent reported that threats \n        of kidnapping forced the victim to return to the batterer.\n            (6) Approximately 90 percent of children in homes in which \n        their mothers are abused witness the abuse. Children who \n        witness domestic violence may themselves become victims and \n        exhibit more aggressive, antisocial, fearful, and inhibited \n        behaviors. Such children display more anxiety, aggression and \n        temperamental problems.\n            (7) Women and children are at an elevated risk of violence \n        during the process of separation or divorce.\n            (8) Fifty to 70 percent of men who abuse their spouses or \n        partners also abuse their children.\n            (9) Up to 75 percent of all domestic assaults reported to \n        law enforcement agencies were inflicted after the separation of \n        the couple.\n            (10) In one study of spousal homicide, over \\1/2\\ of the \n        male defendants were separated from their victims.\n            (11) Seventy-three percent of battered women seeking \n        emergency medical services do so after separation.\n            (12) The National Council of Juvenile and Family Court \n        Judges includes the option of visitation centers in their Model \n        Code on Domestic and Family Violence.\n\nSEC. 4.
