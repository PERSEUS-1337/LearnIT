FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) Ukraine has adopted administrative procedures that \n        accord its citizens the right to emigrate, travel freely, and \n        to return to their country without restriction, and has been \n        found to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration \n        requirements under title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 since \n        1997;\n            (2) since reestablishing independence in 1991, Ukraine has \n        taken important steps toward the establishment of a genuine \n        democracy, and the people of Ukraine deserve praise for \n        demonstrating a deep commitment to democracy through peaceful \n        civil action;\n            (3) Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to adopting the \n        full range of internationally recognized core labor standards \n        and to continue to improve the effective enforcement of its \n        laws reflecting such standards;\n            (4) as a participating state of the Organization for \n        Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Ukraine has \n        committed to developing a system of governance in accordance \n        with the provisions of the Final Act of the Conference on \n        Security and Cooperation in Europe (also known as the \n        ``Helsinki Final Act'') and successive documents regarding \n        human rights and humanitarian affairs, including respect for \n        freedom of the media;\n            (5) Ukraine has endeavored to address issues related to its \n        national and religious minorities and, as a member state of the \n        OSCE, has committed to adopting special measures for ensuring \n        that persons belonging to national minorities have full \n        equality both individually and communally;\n            (6) Ukraine has enacted legislation providing protection \n        against incitement to violence against persons or groups based \n        on national, racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination, \n        including anti-Semitism, and has committed itself, including \n        through a letter to the President of the United States, to \n        ensuring freedom of religion and combating racial and ethnic \n        intolerance and hatred;\n            (7) Ukraine has continued to return communal properties \n        confiscated from national and religious minorities during the \n        Soviet era, facilitating the reemergence of these communities \n        in the national life of Ukraine, and remains committed, through \n        a letter to the President of the United States, to establishing \n        the legal framework for completion of this process in the \n        future;\n            (8) Ukraine has taken important steps toward the creation \n        of a free market economic system and has received normal trade \n        relations treatment since concluding a bilateral trade \n        agreement with the United States that entered into force on \n        June 23, 1992; and\n            (9) Ukraine is seeking admission to the World Trade \n        Organization, which would be a welcome step, recognizing that \n        many issues remain to be resolved, including protection of \n        intellectual property rights, access for United States \n        agricultural products, tariff and excise tax reductions for \n        goods (including automobiles), access for financial services \n        providers of the United States, elimination of export \n        incentives for industrial goods, and reform of customs \n        procedures and other nontariff barriers.\n\nSEC. 2.

CONTINUED ENJOYMENT OF RIGHTS UNDER THE JUNE 23, 1992, \n              BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT.\n\n    The Congress finds that the trade agreement between the United \nStates and Ukraine that entered into force on June 23, 1992, remains in \nforce between the 2 countries and provides the United States with \nimportant rights, including the right to use specific safeguard rules \nto respond to import surges from Ukraine, recognizing that these rights \nmay terminate upon Ukraine's accession to the WTO.\n\nSEC. 4.
