FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n        (1) A secure domestic food supply is a national security \n    imperative for the United States.\n        (2) A competitive specialty crop industry in the United States \n    is necessary for the production of an abundant, affordable supply \n    of highly nutritious fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops, \n    which are vital to the health and well-being of all Americans.\n        (3) Increased consumption of specialty crops will provide \n    tremendous health and economic benefits to both consumers and \n    specialty crop growers.\n        (4) Specialty crop growers believe that there are numerous \n    areas of Federal agriculture policy that could be improved to \n    promote increased consumption of specialty crops and increase the \n    competitiveness of producers in the efficient production of \n    affordable specialty crops in the United States.\n        (5) As the globalization of markets continues, it is becoming \n    increasingly difficult for United States producers to compete \n    against heavily subsidized foreign producers in both the domestic \n    and foreign markets.\n        (6) United States specialty crop producers also continue to \n    face serious tariff and non-tariff trade barriers in many export \n    markets.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to make necessary \nchanges in Federal agriculture policy to accomplish the goals of \nincreasing fruit, vegetable, and nut consumption and improving the \ncompetitiveness of United States specialty crop producers.\n\nSEC. 3.
