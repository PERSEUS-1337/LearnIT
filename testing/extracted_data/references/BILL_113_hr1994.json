SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Election \nAssistance Commission Termination Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) authorized \n        annual appropriations of not more than $10,000,000 for the \n        Election Assistance Commission (EAC) for fiscal years 2003, \n        2004, and 2005. Funding for additional years has not been \n        authorized, and in fiscal year 2011 the EAC's budget grew to \n        nearly $18,000,000.\n            (2) Between 2007 and 2011, the number of staff at the EAC \n        grew from 26 to 48 without an increase in statutory \n        responsibility.\n            (3) 55 percent of the EAC's fiscal year 2014 budget request \n        is devoted to management costs, the third consecutive year for \n        which management costs have exceeded one-half of the EAC's \n        budget.\n            (4) The EAC has distributed more than $3.2 billion in \n        election reform grants to the States. The most recent year for \n        which appropriations for these grants were enacted or were \n        requested in the President's annual budget was fiscal year \n        2010.\n            (5) The EAC last issued voluntary voting system guidelines \n        in 2005. A total of 11 voting systems currently hold a \n        certification from the EAC.\n            (6) The research division of the EAC has substantially \n        completed the reports required by HAVA.\n            (7) The National Association of Secretaries of State \n        adopted resolutions calling for the dissolution of the EAC in \n        2005 and 2010.\n            (8) The EAC has not had a quorum of commissioners since \n        December 2010, and has not had any commissioners since December \n        2011. The EAC has not had an Executive Director since December \n        2011, and has not had a General Counsel since May 2012.\n            (9) The existence of the EAC is not necessary to the \n        conduct of Federal elections and is an unnecessary expenditure \n        of taxpayer funds. Any functions of the EAC worth continuing \n        can be performed by other government entities, consortia of \n        government entities, or private associations.\n\nSEC. 2.
