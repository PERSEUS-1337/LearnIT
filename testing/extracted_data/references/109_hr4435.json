    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States faces a range of energy challenges \n        that affect our economy, security, and environment. \n        Fundamentally, these challenges involve science and technology.\n            (2) The Department of Energy already has some of the \n        mechanisms necessary to promote long-term research, but it \n        lacks the mechanisms for quickly transforming the results into \n        technology that meets national needs.\n            (3) A recent report of the Secretary of Energy's Advisory \n        Board's Task Force on the Future of Science Programs at the \n        Department of Energy concluded that ``America can meet its \n        energy needs only if we make a strong and sustained investment \n        in research in physical science, engineering, and applicable \n        life sciences and if we translate advancing scientific \n        knowledge into practice''.\n            (4) The Department of Defense, since 1958, has used its \n        Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA) for \n        aggressively addressing real-time defense problems through \n        targeted programs of research and technology development that \n        have improved our national defense through transformation \n        technologies.\n            (5) The National Academy of Sciences' report entitled \n        ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing \n        America for a Brighter Economic Future'' recommends creating a \n        new agency within the Department of Energy to sponsor \n        ``creative, out-of-the-box, transformational, generic energy \n        research in those areas where industry by itself cannot or will \n        not undertake such sponsorship, where risks and pay-offs are \n        high''. Such an organization would be able to accelerate the \n        process by which research is transformed to address energy-\n        related economic, environmental, and security issues to \n        decrease dependence on foreign energy through targeted research \n        and technology development.\n\nSEC. 2. ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY-ENERGY.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established the Advanced Research \nProjects Agency-Energy (in this Act referred to as ``ARPA-E'') within \nthe Department of Energy.\n    (b) Goal.--The goal of ARPA-E is to reduce the amount of energy the \nUnited States imports from foreign sources by 20 percent over the next \n10 years by--\n            (1) promoting revolutionary changes in the critical \n        technologies that would promote energy independence;\n            (2) turning cutting-edge science and engineering into \n        technologies for energy and environmental application; and\n            (3) accelerating innovation in energy and the environment \n        for both traditional and alternative energy sources and in \n        energy efficiency mechanisms to decrease the Nation's reliance \n        on foreign energy sources.\n    (c) Director.--ARPA-E shall be headed by a Director who shall be \nappointed by the Secretary of Energy.
