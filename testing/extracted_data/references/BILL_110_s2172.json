FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Beginning on August 19, 2007, hundreds of thousands of \n        citizens of Burma, including thousands of Buddhist monks and \n        students, participated in peaceful demonstrations against \n        rapidly deteriorating living conditions and the violent and \n        repressive policies of the State Peace and Development Council \n        (SPDC), the ruling military junta in Burma, to--\n                    (A) demand the release of all political prisoners, \n                including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi; \n                and\n                    (B) urge the SPDC to engage in meaningful dialogue \n                to pursue national reconciliation.\n            (2) The SPDC, in a display of brutal barbarism, violently \n        confronted unarmed demonstrators, killing, injuring, and \n        imprisoning citizens, including several thousand Buddhist \n        monks, and continued to forcefully restrict peaceful forms of \n        public expression.\n            (3) The Department of State's 2006 Reports on Human Rights \n        Practices found that the SPDC--\n                    (A) routinely restricts freedoms of speech, press, \n                assembly, association, religion, and movement;\n                    (B) traffics in persons;\n                    (C) discriminates against women and ethnic \n                minorities;\n                    (D) forcibly recruits child soldiers and child \n                labor; and\n                    (E) commits other serious violations of human \n                rights, including extrajudicial killings, custodial \n                deaths, disappearances, rape, torture, abuse of \n                prisoners and detainees, and the imprisonment of \n                citizens arbitrarily for political motives.\n            (4) Aung San Suu Kyi has been arbitrarily imprisoned or \n        held under house arrest for more than 12 years.\n            (5) The President announced on September 25, 2007, that the \n        United States would tighten economic sanctions against Burma, \n        and block property and interests in property of certain senior \n        leaders of the SPDC, individuals who provide financial backing \n        for the SPDC, and individuals responsible for violations of \n        human rights and for impeding the transition to democracy in \n        Burma.\n            (6) The President also announced on September 25, 2007, \n        that the United States would impose an expanded visa ban on \n        individuals--\n                    (A) responsible for violations of human rights; and\n                    (B) who aid, abet, or benefit from the SPDC's \n                efforts to impede the efforts of the people of Burma to \n                transition to democracy and ensure respect for human \n                dignity.\n            (7) The Total Oil Corporation of France and the Chevron \n        Corporation of the United States own a significant stake in \n        Burma's Yadana natural gas field and pipeline and generate \n        millions of dollars in revenue that help the repressive junta \n        government maintain its grasp on power.\n            (8) Burma is home to approximately 60 percent of the \n        world's native teak reserves. More than one quarter of the \n        world's internationally traded teak originates from Burma, and \n        hardwood sales, mainly of teak, represent more than 11 percent \n        of Burma's official foreign exchange earnings.\n            (9) Burma officially exports tens of millions of dollars \n        worth of rubies, sapphires, pearls, jade, and other precious \n        stones each year and the SPDC owns a majority stake in all \n        mining operations within the borders of Burma.\n            (10) On October 11, 2007, the United Nations Security \n        Council, with the consent of China, issued a statement \n        condemning the violence in Burma, urging the release of all \n        political prisoners, and calling on the SPDC to enter into a \n        United Nations-mediated dialogue with its political opposition.\n            (11) The leaders of the SPDC will have a greater incentive \n        to cooperate with diplomatic efforts by the United Nations, the \n        Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and China if they come \n        under targeted economic pressure that denies them access to \n        personal wealth and sources of revenue.\n\nSEC. 3.
