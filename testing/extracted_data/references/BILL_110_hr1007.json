FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The goal of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 \n        (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) is to maintain marine mammal species \n        and population stocks at their optimum sustainable populations.\n            (2) If the annual removals of individuals of a species or \n        population stock of marine mammals do not exceed the potential \n        biological removal level, the species or population stock will \n        be maintained at, or reach, its optimum sustainable population.\n            (3) Requiring that commercial fishermen achieve a zero \n        mortality rate goal for a species or population stock of marine \n        mammals that is equal to or less than 10 percent of the \n        potential biological removal of a given marine mammal species \n        or population stock is unnecessary to achieve that Act's goal \n        of maintaining species and stocks at their optimum sustainable \n        population and penalizes commercial fishermen.\n            (4) The Congress intended that the zero mortality rate goal \n        under that Act would be met if fishermen use the best \n        technology that is economically and technologically feasible.\n            (5) Species and populations stocks of marine mammal that \n        have reached historic levels are impeding the recovery of \n        endangered species and threatened species through predation or \n        competition in the ecosystem.\n            (6) The fundamental principles of ecosystem management are \n        defeated by giving one species a preeminent position in the \n        ecosystem through, imposition of a zero mortality rate goal.\n            (7) All persons that interact with marine mammals should \n        seek to reduce and eliminate marine mammal injuries and \n        mortalities through the use of the best equipment and \n        techniques that are economically and technologically feasible.\n\nSEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF GOALS FOR REDUCING INCIDENTAL TAKE OF MARINE \n              MAMMALS IN COMMERCIAL FISHING.\n\n    (a) Repeal of Zero Mortality Goal.--Section 118 of the Marine \nMammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1387) is amended by striking \nsubsection (b), and by redesignating subsections (c) through (l) in \norder as subsections (b) through (k).\n    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Such Act is further amended as follows:\n            (1) In section 101(a)(2) (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(2)) by striking \n        the third sentence.\n            (2) In section 101(a)(5)(E)(i)(III) (16 U.S.C. \n        1371(a)(5)(E)(i)(III) by striking ``subsection (d)'' and \n        inserting ``subsection (c)''.\n            (3) In section 115(b)(4) (16 U.S.C. 1384(b)(4)) by striking \n        ``section 118(f)(1)'' and inserting ``section 118(e)(1)''.\n            (4) In section 117(a)(4) (16 U.S.C. 1386(a)(4)) in \n        subparagraph (D) by striking ``, and an analysis'' and all that \n        follows through the end of the subparagraph and inserting a \n        semicolon.\n            (5) In section 118 (16 U.S.C. 1387) by striking \n        ``subsection (c)(1)(A) (i)'' each place it appears and \n        inserting ``subsection (b)(1)(A)(i)''.\n            (6) In section 118 (16 U.S.C. 1387) by striking \n        ``subsection (c)(1)(A)(i)'' each place it appears and inserting \n        ``subsection (b)(1)(A)(i)''.\n            (7) In section 118(a)(1) (16 U.S.C. 1387(a)(1)) by striking \n        the last sentence.\n            (8) In section 118(b), as redesignated by subsection (a) of \n        this section 16 U.S.C. 1387(c)(1)(B)), by striking ``subsection \n        (e)'' each place it appears and inserting ``subsection (d)''.\n            (9) In section 118(c)(1)(B), as redesignated by subsection \n        (a) of this section (16 U.S.C. 1387(d)(1)(B)), by striking \n        ``subsection (e)'' and inserting ``subsection (d)''.\n            (10) In section 118(e)(9)(D), as redesignated by subsection \n        (a) of this section (16 U.S.C. 1387(f)(9)(D)), by striking \n        ``subsection (d)'' and inserting ``subsection (c)''.\n            (11) In section 118(f)(1), as redesignated by subsection \n        (a) of this section (16 U.S.C. 1387(g)(1)), by striking \n        ``subsection (c)(1)(A)(iii)'' each place it appears and \n        inserting ``subsection (b)(1)(A)(iii)''.\n            (12) In section 118(g), as redesignated by subsection (a) \n        of this section (16 U.S.C. 1387(h)), by striking ``subsection \n        (c)'' and inserting ``subsection (b)''.\n            (13) In section 120(j)(2) (16 U.S.C. 1389(j)(2)) by \n        striking ``118(f)(5)(A)'' and inserting ``118(e)(5)(A)''.\n    (c) Modification of Goal of Take Reduction Plans.--Section \n118(e)(2) of such Act, as redesignated by subsection (a) of this \nsection (16 U.S.C. 1387(f)(2)), is amended by striking the last \nsentence and inserting the following: ``The long-term goal of the plan \nshall be to reduce, within 5 years after its implementation, the \nincidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals incidentally \ntaken in the course of fishing operations taking into account the \neconomics of the fishery, the availability of existing technology, and \nexisting State or regional fishery management plans.''."
