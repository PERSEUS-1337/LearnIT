FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress must enact a comprehensive, deficit reduction \n        plan to solve the country's fiscal challenges and to promote \n        national security, economic stability, and the continued growth \n        and prosperity of the United States.\n            (2) The keys to a comprehensive, deficit reduction solution \n        are increased revenues and changes in mandatory spending.\n            (3) The Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted to avert a \n        default on Federal debt obligations, and it reduced \n        discretionary spending by approximately $1 trillion through \n        fiscal year 2021.\n            (4) Because the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction \n        failed to recommend legislation providing an additional $1.2 \n        trillion in deficit reduction, Federal law mandates that the \n        additional savings be sequestered.\n            (5) Sequestration was designed as a forcing mechanism for \n        an agreement on a comprehensive, deficit reduction plan. It has \n        failed to produce the intended results.\n            (6) It no longer makes sense to rely on sequestration as a \n        forcing mechanism for a balanced solution. The costs to our \n        government and to the economy are too great.\n            (7) Under sequestration, automatic, indiscriminate cuts \n        would be applied, through fiscal year 2021, to a wide variety \n        of discretionary spending programs to achieve $1.2 trillion in \n        savings, forestalling the sound planning needed for prudent and \n        meaningful investments in national security, the workforce, \n        transportation infrastructure, education, health care, public \n        safety, housing, innovation, small business development, and \n        many other facets of enduring national strength.\n            (8) Even the prospect of sequestration is disruptive to \n        regular order and to the congressional appropriations process, \n        and it fosters damaging economic uncertainty, while short-term \n        solutions only suspend the prospect and continue to undermine \n        the certainty needed for economic recovery.\n            (9) Therefore, Congress must eliminate the threat of \n        sequestration.\n            (10) Given the magnitude of the Federal deficit, it is \n        likely that additional cuts to discretionary spending will be \n        necessary for a comprehensive deficit reduction solution.\n            (11) Congress must establish a manageable, long-term \n        discretionary spending plan. An additional $320 billion in \n        targetable cuts to discretionary appropriations from fiscal \n        year 2014 through fiscal year 2021 represents one-third of the \n        net amount that would have been indiscriminately cut by \n        sequestration over fiscal years 2013 through 2021.\n            (12) It is recognized that a reduction of $167 billion to \n        discretionary appropriations within budget function 050 from \n        fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2021 will affect the \n        National Military Strategy. The Department of Defense is highly \n        encouraged to revisit its current strategic guidance and to \n        work closely with Congress in building a new National Military \n        Strategy that accounts for available resource levels.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) eliminate the threat of sequestration to the American \n        economy;\n            (2) offer the Federal Government, industry, and the \n        American people the predictability that economic recovery \n        demands;\n            (3) enable the Congress to pass appropriations legislation \n        in regular order with a clear discretionary spending budget and \n        grant the legislative and executive branches of government the \n        flexibility needed to identify and implement specific \n        discretionary spending reductions in a responsible and \n        deliberate manner; and\n            (4) provide a practicable, long-term discretionary spending \n        plan that will contribute to a comprehensive, balanced, long-\n        term, deficit reduction solution that includes affordable \n        revisions to mandatory spending and new revenues.\n\nSEC. 3. REPEAL OF SECTION 251A SEQUESTRATIONS.\n\n    Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \nAct of 1985 is repealed.\n\nSEC. 4. $320 BILLION REDUCTION IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.\n\n    The discretionary spending limits set forth in paragraphs (3) \nthrough (10) of section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act of 1985 are amended to read as follows:\n            ``(3) for fiscal year 2014--\n                    ``(A) for the security category, $546,000,000,000 \n                in budget authority; and\n                    ``(B) for the nonsecurity category, \n                $501,000,000,000 in budget authority;\n            ``(4) with respect to fiscal year 2015--\n                    ``(A) for the security category, $550,000,000,000 \n                in new budget authority; and\n                    ``(B) for the nonsecurity category, \n                $505,000,000,000 in new budget authority;\n            ``(5) with respect to fiscal year 2016--\n                    ``(A) for the security category, $559,000,000,000 \n                in new budget authority; and\n                    ``(B) for the nonsecurity category, \n                $513,000,000,000 in new budget authority;\n            ``(6) with respect to fiscal year 2017--\n                    ``(A) for the security category, $569,000,000,000 \n                in new budget authority; and\n                    ``(B) for the nonsecurity category, \n                $522,000,000,000 in new budget authority;\n            ``(7) with respect to fiscal year 2018--\n                    ``(A) for the security category, $579,000,000,000 \n                in new budget authority; and\n                    ``(B) for the nonsecurity category, \n                $531,000,000,000 in new budget authority;\n            ``(8) with respect to fiscal year 2019--\n                    ``(A) for the security category, $589,500,000,000 \n                in new budget authority; and\n                    ``(B) for the nonsecurity category, \n                $541,000,000,000 in new budget authority;\n            ``(9) with respect to fiscal year 2020--\n                    ``(A) for the security category, $602,500,000,000 \n                in new budget authority; and\n                    ``(B) for the nonsecurity category, \n                $553,000,000,000 in new budget authority;\n            ``(10) with respect to fiscal year 2021--\n                    ``(A) for the security category, $616,000,000,000 \n                in new budget authority; and\n                    ``(B) for the nonsecurity category, \n                $565,000,000,000 in new budget authority;''.\n\nSEC. 5.
