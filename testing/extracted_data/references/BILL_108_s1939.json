FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Mercury is a persistent, bioaccumulative heavy metal \n        that poses a significant risk to human health, wildlife, and \n        the environment.\n            (2) Mercury discharges into the atmosphere and surface \n        oceans have increased two-to-five fold since the beginning of \n        the industrialized period due to human activities.\n            (3) Substantial evidence is accumulating that exposure to \n        methyl-mercury is widespread in the general public and \n        occurring at higher than health-based levels of concern \n        according to the Food and Drug Administration, the \n        Environmental Protection Agency, and the World Health \n        Organization. Fish and seafood caught or sold in the United \n        States are contaminated with methyl-mercury, a toxic element \n        that may cause neurological damage and other health-related \n        problems as a result of fish or seafood consumption.\n            (4) According to the 1997 Environmental Protection Agency \n        Mercury Report to Congress, mercury levels in the following \n        fish, at least occasionally, exceeded the Food and Drug \n        Administration's ``action level'' limit of 1 part per million: \n        tilefish, king mackerel, shark, swordfish, tuna, lobster, red \n        snapper, saltwater and freshwater bass, bluefish, bluegills, \n        catfish, crappie, groupers, hake, halibut, northern pike, \n        walleye, largemouth bass, pompano, snook, sunfish, and other \n        finfish.\n            (5) The Food and Drug Administration advises pregnant women \n        and women of childbearing age not to eat shark, king mackerel, \n        tilefish, and swordfish and to limit consumption of all other \n        fish to 12 ounces per week. The Food and Drug Administration \n        advises other persons to limit their consumption of shark and \n        swordfish to no more than 7 ounces per week.\n            (6) The Environmental Protection Agency recommends that \n        women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant, nursing \n        mothers, and young children limit fish consumption to 6 meals \n        per week of cooked fish or an 8-ounce meal per week for \n        uncooked fish for adults and 2 meals per week of cooked fish or \n        a 3-ounce meal per week of uncooked fish for young children.\n            (7) In 2003, 44 States issued health advisories that warned \n        the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared to \n        27 States that issued such advisories in 1993.\n            (8) Eleven States warn pregnant women and young children to \n        limit consumption of canned tuna, the most consumed fish in the \n        United States, to 1 or 2 cans per week and some States warn \n        that the ``white'' albacore canned tuna has significantly \n        higher mercury levels than the ``light'' tuna, based upon Food \n        and Drug Administration testing.\n            (9) Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination \n        Survey Centers indicates that 7.8 percent of women of \n        childbearing age have blood mercury levels in their bodies \n        above what is considered safe for the developing fetus, \n        translating into over 300,000 babies born each year in the \n        United States at risk of mercury poisoning.\n            (10) Between 30 percent and 50 percent of women of \n        childbearing age are not aware of the methyl-mercury exposure \n        risks from ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish, according to \n        the Food and Drug Administration.\n            (11) A January 2001 report by the United States General \n        Accounting Office (GAO) criticized the Food and Drug \n        Administration for not providing guidance to the fishing \n        industry to identify and prevent fish contaminated with mercury \n        from reaching consumers, even though the Agency's own \ntesting found that, for example, over half of the swordfish exceeded \nits action level of one part per million (ppm).\n            (12) Evidence is continuing to emerge linking increased \n        risk of coronary heart disease to mercury exposure, as \n        presented in at least 2 peer reviewed studies.\n            (13) Health advisory information on mercury-contaminated \n        fish, which is necessary to protect public health, is not \n        widely known by the State or Federal Government. This lack of \n        awareness potentially threatens tens of millions of Americans \n        who may unknowingly ingest harmful amounts of mercury because \n        they are not aware of exposure risks from consumption of \n        freshwater fish and seafood.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) ensure that the public is adequately informed about the \n        potential adverse effects of mercury exposure through the \n        consumption of fish products;\n            (2) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n        work cooperatively with other Federal and State agencies, as \n        well as nonprofit organizations, to create appropriate \n        advisories for the distribution to the public of explanations \n        of the potential adverse effects of mercury exposure from fish \n        consumption;\n            (3) require the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to work cooperatively with State fish and \n        game officials to create an informative guide for distribution \n        to the public about the dangers of the consumption of \n        recreationally-caught fish;\n            (4) require the Food and Drug Administration to resume its \n        seafood methyl-mercury monitoring program to better document \n        mercury levels in various fish species sold in commerce;\n            (5) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \n        cooperation with private and public organizations, to design \n        and implement a National Public Education Program regarding the \n        presence of methyl-mercury in seafood and fish consumption \n        advisories for methyl-mercury; and\n            (6) require the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to annually prepare a report on the impacts \n        of mercury on human health and the environment.\n\nSEC. 3.
