FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The loss of life due to fire has dropped significantly \n        over the last 25 years in the United States. However, the \n        United States still has one of the highest fire death rates in \n        the industrialized world. For 2006, the National Fire \n        Protection Association reported 3,245 civilian fire deaths, \n        17,925 civilian fire injuries, and $11,307,000,000 in direct \n        losses due to fire.\n            (2) Every year, over 100 firefighters die in the line of \n        duty. The United States Fire Administration should continue its \n        leadership to help local fire agencies dramatically reduce \n        these fatalities.\n            (3) Members of the fire service community should continue \n        to work together to further the promotion of national voluntary \n        consensus standards that increase firefighter safety.\n            (4) The United States Fire Administration provides crucial \n        support to the Nation's 30,300 fire departments through \n        training, data collection, fire awareness and education, and \n        other activities for improving fire prevention, control, and \n        suppression technologies.\n            (5) The collection of data on fire and other emergency \n        incidents is a vital tool both for policy makers and emergency \n        responders to identify and develop responses to emerging \n        hazards. Improving the United States Fire Administration's data \n        collection capabilities is essential for accurately tracking \n        and responding to the magnitude and nature of the Nation's fire \n        problem.\n            (6) The research and development performed by the Federal \n        Government and non-government organizations on fire \n        technologies, techniques, and tools advance the capabilities of \n        the Nation's fire service to prevent and suppress fires.\n            (7) The United States Fire Administration is one of the \n        strongest voices representing the Nation's fire service within \n        the Federal Government, and, as such, it should have a \n        prominent place within the Federal Government.\n\nSEC. 3.
