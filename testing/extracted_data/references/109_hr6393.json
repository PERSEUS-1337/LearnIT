FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Census reported pre-Katrina that there were--\n                    (A) 25,000 two-parent families in New Orleans with \n                children under 18;\n                    (B) 26,000 female householders with children under \n                18, and no husband present; and\n                    (C) more than 18,000 householders who were more \n                than 65 years old and living alone.\n            (2) Studies have stated that reopening child care \n        facilities was crucial for helping parents get back to work and \n        businesses to recover.\n            (3) Studies have shown that without available and \n        affordable child care economic recovery will be greatly impeded \n        and lead to a reduction in worker productivity.\n            (4) In New Orleans before the Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, \n        the city had 1,912 day-care slots at 266 licensed centers, but \n        now 80 percent of those centers and 75 percent of those slots \n        are gone.\n            (5) The National Association of Child Care Resource and \n        Referral Agencies, reported in a study published by the \n        Mississippi State University Early Childhood Institute that \n        between 62 percent to 94 percent of the licensed child care \n        slots in the three coastal counties hardest hit by Hurricanes \n        Katrina and Rita in Mississippi were lost.\n            (6) In Jackson County, Mississippi, initial assessment \n        found that one-fourth of the county's licensed centers were \n        damaged beyond repair, representing 11 percent of the county's \n        licensed child care capacity and another 39 percent of centers \n        needed repairs.\n            (7) Studies have stated the most effective way to rebuild \n        the child care infrastructure is to--\n                    (A) help child care programs in the disaster area \n                reopen as rapidly as was safe by giving priority to \n                licensed early childhood facilities; and\n                    (B) recruit, train, and retain child-care \n                professionals.\n\nSEC. 3.
