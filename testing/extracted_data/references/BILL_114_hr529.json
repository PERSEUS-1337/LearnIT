FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) When the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation \n        Act of 2001 became law, the tax treatment of section 529 \n        college savings plans was changed so that qualified \n        distributions were no longer taxed as income. The favorable tax \n        treatment of college savings plans was made permanent with the \n        passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.\n            (2) Section 529 college savings plans empower middle-class \n        families to accumulate savings to offset the rising costs of \n        attending college.\n            (3) The latest data from the College Savings Plan Network \n        shows that there are 11.83 million 529 accounts open throughout \n        all 50 states, which represent $244.5 billion in total assets. \n        The average 529 account size is $20,671.\n            (4) States that sponsor 529 college savings plans have \n        taken steps to ensure these plans are a tool that all families \n        can use to save for college, including setting minimum \n        contributions as low as $25 per month to encourage \n        participation by families of all income levels.\n            (5) The President's fiscal year 2016 Budget proposes \n        raising taxes by taxing certain future distributions made from \n        529 college savings plans.\n            (6) The tax proposed by the President would discourage the \n        use of 529 college savings plans, requiring families and \n        students to take on more debt.\n            (7) Purchase of a computer represents a significant higher \n        education expense and therefore should be eligible for \n        qualified distributions under 529 college savings plans.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) enact policies that strengthen 529 college savings \n        plans; and\n            (2) make 529 plans more modern, consumer-friendly, and \n        responsive to the realities faced by students today.\n\nSEC. 2.
