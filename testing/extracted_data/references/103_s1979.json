    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Sexual Harassment Prevention Act of \n1994''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Sexual harassment in employment persists widely in the \n        workplace, although it violates title VII of the Civil Rights \n        Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) and adversely affects \n        employees.\n            (2) According to guidelines issued by the Equal Employment \n        Opportunity Commission in 1980, the most effective tool for \n        eliminating sexual harassment is prevention.\n            (3) The Merit Systems Protection Board found in 1981 and \n        1988 surveys of Federal Government employees that 42 percent of \n        female employees and 14 percent of male employees questioned \n        had experienced some kind of harassment in employment. The \n        American Psychological Association estimates that at least 50 \n        percent of all working women have been sexually harassed at the \n        workplace during their careers.\n            (4) The vast majority of sexual harassment episodes go \n        unreported to a supervisory employee or other individual \n        designated by the employer. Only 5 percent of the Government \n        employees who indicated in the 1988 Merit Systems Protection \n        Board survey that they had been harassed filed a formal \n        complaint or requested an investigation of the harassment.\n            (5) Sexual harassment has a significant cost for employees \n        and employers. A 1988 study by Working Woman Magazine shows \n        that sexual harassment costs a typical ``Fortune 500'' employer \n        $6,000,000, or $292.53 per employee, each year. The same study \n        estimates that it is 34 times more expensive for such an \n        employer to ignore the problem than to establish effective \n        programs and policies to address the problem.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish workplace requirements that will reduce \n        the incidence of sexual harassment in employment;\n            (2) to provide a low-cost system to assist employers to \n        establish programs and policies to prevent sexual harassment in \n        employment;\n            (3) to raise the awareness of employees of the definition \n        of sexual harassment and of available avenues of redress; and\n            (4) to increase the authority and capacity of the Equal \n        Employment Opportunity Commission, and other enforcement \n        agencies, to assist in preventing sexual harassment in \n        employment.\n\nSEC. 3. EMPLOYER REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Posting of Notice in the Workplace.--Each employer shall post \nand keep posted in conspicuous places upon its premises where notices \nto employees and applicants for employment are customarily posted, a \nnotice that shall be prepared or approved by the appropriate primary \nenforcement agency and shall set forth--\n            (1) the definition of sexual harassment found in section \n        1604.11(a) of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (or any \n        corresponding similar regulation);\n            (2) the fact that sexual harassment in employment is a \n        violation of Federal law;\n            (3) information describing how to file with the primary \n        enforcement agency a complaint alleging such harassment, \n        including information on the time periods within which an \n        alleged victim of discrimination (including sexual harassment) \n        must file a charge with the primary enforcement agency, or a \n        State or local fair employment agency, in order to satisfy the \n        applicable statute of limitations;\n            (4) an address, and the toll-free telephone number, to be \n        used to contact the appropriate enforcement agency regarding \n        such harassment or compliance with the requirements of this \n        Act; and\n            (5) such other information as the primary enforcement \n        agency may require.\n    (b) Separate Notice to Individual Employees.--\n            (1) Contents.--Each employer shall provide annually to each \n        employee individually a written notice that includes--\n                    (A) the information specified in paragraphs (1) \n                through (4) of subsection (a);\n                    (B) a description of the procedures established by \n                such employer to resolve allegations of sexual \n                harassment in employment; and\n                    (C) such other information as the appropriate \n                primary enforcement agency may require.\n            (2) Manner of notice.--Such notice shall be provided in a \n        manner that ensures that such employee actually receives such \n        notice.\n    (c) Management Information for Supervisory Employees.--Not later \nthan 60 days after an employer places an individual in a supervisory \nemployment position or 1 year after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, whichever occurs later, such employer shall provide to the \nsupervisory employee information specifying the responsibilities of, \nand the methods to be used by, such employee to ensure that immediate \nand corrective action is taken to address allegations of sexual \nharassment in employment.\n    (d) Civil Penalty.--A willful violation of this section shall be \npunishable by a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each separate \nviolation.\n\nSEC. 4.
