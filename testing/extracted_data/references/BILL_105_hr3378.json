FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The cross-country expedition of Meriwether Lewis and \n        William Clark, known as ``The Corps of Discovery'', was a very \n        important exploratory journey in American history that provided \n        invaluable geographic, scientific, and cultural information.\n            (2) In 1805, the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition \n        built Fort Clatsop at the mouth of the Columbia River near \n        Astoria, Oregon, where they spent 106 days waiting for the end \n        of winter and preparing for their journey home.\n            (3) As the westernmost point and the second longest \n        stopover of the expedition, and as the site where Lewis and \n        Clark edited their journals and prepared many of their maps, \n        Fort Clatsop is a uniquely special place in the journey of \n        Lewis and Clark.\n            (4) The Fort Clatsop National Memorial was created by \n        Congress in 1958 for the purpose of commemorating the \n        culmination, and the winter encampment, of the Lewis and Clark \n        Expedition following its successful crossing of the North \n        American continent, and is the only National Park Service site \n        solely dedicated to the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\n            (5) The 1995 General Management Plan for the Fort Clatsop \n        National Memorial, prepared with input from the local \n        community, calls for the addition of lands to the memorial to \n        include the trail used by expedition members to travel from the \n        fort to the Pacific Ocean and to include the shore and forest \n        lands surrounding the fort and trail to protect their natural \n        settings.\n            (6) Expansion of the Fort Clatsop National Memorial would \n        require Federal legislation because the size of the memorial is \n        currently limited by statute to 130 acres.\n            (7) Congressional action to allow for the expansion of Fort \n        Clatsop would be both timely and appropriate before the start \n        of the national bicentennial celebration of the Lewis and Clark \n        Expedition planned to take place during the years 2004 through \n        2006.\n\nSEC. 3. ACQUISITION OF LANDS FOR FORT CLATSOP NATIONAL MEMORIAL.\n\n    The Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the establishment of Fort \nClatsop National Memorial in the State of Oregon, and for other \npurposes'', approved May 29, 1958 (Chapter 158; 72 Stat. 153), is \namended--\n            (1) in section 2 (16 U.S.C. 450mm-1)--\n                    (A) by striking ``: Provided,'' and all that \n                follows through the end of the sentence and inserting a \n                period;\n                    (B) by inserting ``(a)'' before ``The Secretary of \n                the Interior''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) In addition to the land and improvements designated under \nsubsection (a), the Fort Clatsop National Memorial shall include land \nand improvements that are acquired by the Secretary of the Interior \nunder section 3(b).'';\n            (2) in section 3 (16 U.S.C. 450mm-2), by inserting ``(a)'' \n        before ``Within the area'', and by adding at the end the \n        following:\n    ``(b)(1) In addition to lands acquired under subsection (a), the \nSecretary of the Interior may acquire for inclusion in the Fort Clatsop \nNational Memorial any land or improvements located in areas identified \non the map entitled `Fort Clatsop Boundary Map' and numbered 405-80016-\nCCO-June 1996 as appropriate to preserve the historic scene and provide \nlands for the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.\n    ``(2) The Secretary may make acquisitions under this subsection \nonly by purchase from willing sellers using appropriated or donated \namounts, by willing donation, or by exchange in accordance with \nparagraph (3).\n    ``(3)(A) To acquire land or improvements under this subsection by \nexchange, the Secretary may enter into exchanges of lands or \nimprovements administered by the National Park Service, the Forest \nService, or the Bureau of Land Management for lands or improvements in \nClatsop County, Oregon, that are of approximately equal value and that \nare owned by any non-Federal person.\n    ``(B) An exchange under this paragraph shall be made--\n            ``(i) in the case of an exchange of land or improvements \n        administered or to be administered after the exchange by the \n        Forest Service, in accordance with otherwise applicable \n        provisions of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. 1000 \n        et seq.), the Act of March 1, 1911 (Chapter 186; 16 U.S.C. \n        552), popularly known as the Weeks Law, and other provisions of \n        law governing the disposal or acquisition by exchange of \n        National Forest lands; and\n            ``(ii) in the case of an exchange of land or improvements \n        administered or to be administered after the exchange by the \n        Bureau of Land Management, in accordance with otherwise \n        applicable provisions of the Federal Land Policy and Management \n        Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.).''; and\n            (3) in section 4 (16 U.S.C. 460mm-3), by inserting ``(a)'' \n        before ``Establishment of'', and by adding at the end the \n        following:\n    ``(b) Before issuing any regulations governing the protection, \npublic use, or management of land or improvement acquired under section \n3(b), the Secretary shall seek comment from the government of Clatsop \nCounty, Oregon, and persons that reside in the vicinity of the land or \nimprovement.
