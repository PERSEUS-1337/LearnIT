Net revenues shall be defined as all revenues derived from the tax less any refunds, costs of administration by the State Board of Equalization, and costs of administration by the MTA. Such costs of administration by the MTA shall not exceed 1.5 percent of the revenues derived from the tax. The MTA shall, during the period in which the ordinance is operative, allocate 20 percent of all net revenues derived from the tax for bus operations to all eligible and included municipal transit operators in the County of Los Angeles and to the MTA, in accordance with Section 99285. However, the allocations to the MTA and eligible and included municipal operators shall be made solely from revenues derived from a tax imposed pursuant to this section, and not from local discretionary sources. Funds allocated by MTA to itself pursuant to this section shall be used for transit operations and shall not supplant funds from any other source allocated by MTA to itself for public transit operations. Funds allocated by MTA to the eligible and included municipal operators pursuant to this section shall be used for transit operations and shall not supplant any funds authorized by other provisions of law and allocated by MTA to the eligible and included municipal operators for public transit.

The MTA shall include the projects and programs described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) in the expenditure plan required under subdivision (f).

The priorities for projects and programs described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) and in the expenditure plan required under subdivision (f) shall be those set forth in the expenditure plan. The funding amounts specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) are minimum amounts that shall be allocated by the MTA from the net revenues derived from a tax imposed pursuant to this section. Nothing in this section prohibits the MTA from allocating additional net revenues derived from the tax to these projects and programs.\n(A) Capital Projects.\n(i) Exposition Boulevard Light Rail Transit Project from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica.
