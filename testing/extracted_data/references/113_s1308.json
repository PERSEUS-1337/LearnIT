FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Private sector funding and expertise can help address \n        the energy efficiency challenges facing the United States.\n            (2) The Federal Government spends more than $6 billion \n        annually in energy costs.\n            (3) Reducing Federal energy costs can help save money, \n        create jobs, and reduce waste.\n            (4) Energy savings performance contracts and utility energy \n        service contracts are tools for utilizing private sector \n        investment to upgrade Federal facilities without any up-front \n        cost to the taxpayer.\n            (5) Performance contracting is a way to retrofit Federal \n        buildings using private sector investment in the absence of \n        appropriated dollars. Retrofits seek to reduce energy use, \n        improve infrastructure, protect national security, and cut \n        facility operations and maintenance costs.\n\nSEC. 3. USE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES IN FEDERAL BUILDINGS.\n\n    (a) Implementation of Identified Energy Efficiency Measures.--\nSection 543(f)(4) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 \nU.S.C. 8253(f)(4)) is amended to read as follows:\n            ``(4) Implementation of identified energy efficiency \n        measures.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the \n                completion of each evaluation under paragraph (3), each \n                energy manager shall consider--\n                            ``(i) implementing any energy-saving or \n                        conservation measure that the Federal agency \n                        identified in the evaluation conducted under \n                        paragraph (3) that is life cycle cost-\n                        effective; and\n                            ``(ii) bundling individual measures of \n                        varying paybacks together into combined \n                        projects.\n                    ``(B) Measures not implemented.--The energy \n                manager, as part of the certification system under \n                paragraph (7) and using guidelines developed by the \n                Secretary, shall provide reasons for not implementing \n                any life cycle cost-effective measures under \n                subparagraph (A).''.\n    (b) Annual Contracting Goal.--Section 543(f)(10)(C) of the National \nEnergy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8253(f)(10)(C)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``Each Federal agency'' and inserting the \n        following:\n                            ``(i) In general.--Each Federal agency''; \n                        and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new clauses:\n                            ``(ii) Tracking.--Each Federal agency shall \n                        use the benchmarking systems selected or \n                        developed for the agency under paragraph (8) to \n                        track energy savings realized by the agency \n                        through the implementation of energy-saving or \n                        conservation measures pursuant to paragraph \n                        (4), and shall submit information regarding \n                        such savings to the Secretary to be published \n                        on a public Web site of the Department of \n                        Energy.\n                            ``(iii) Consideration.--Each Federal agency \n                        shall consider using energy savings performance \n                        contracts or utility energy service contracts \n                        to implement energy-saving or conservation \n                        measures pursuant to paragraph (4).\n                            ``(iv) Contracting goal.--It shall be the \n                        goal of the Federal Government, in the \n                        implementation of energy-saving or conservation \n                        measures pursuant to paragraph (4), to enter \n                        into energy savings performance contracts or \n                        utility energy service contracts equal to \n                        $1,000,000,000 in each year during the 5-year \n                        period beginning on January 1, 2014.\n                            ``(v) Report to congress.--Not later than \n                        September 30 of each year during the 5-year \n                        period referred to in clause (iv), each Federal \n                        agency shall submit to the Secretary \n                        information regarding progress made by the \n                        agency towards achieving the goal described in \n                        such clause.
