FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) each year thousands of infants throughout the United \n        States are abandoned by their parents shortly after birth, such \n        as when a mother gives birth at a hospital under an assumed \n        name and address and then disappears afterwards, leaving the \n        infant behind, when the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, \n        and when infants are left to die in garbage dumpsters because \n        their mothers cannot care for them;\n            (2) infants who are abandoned during the formative months \n        occurring shortly after birth are denied the ability to bond \n        with a loving parent or parents;\n            (3) the process of attachment or bonding between an infant \n        and the same adults is essential to the development of a \n        healthy personality in the infant;\n            (4) the Inspector General of the Department of Health and \n        Human Services, in the February 1990 report entitled ``Crack \n        Babies'', states that legislation ``should reduce barriers to \n        placing drug exposed infants into foster care and adoptive \n        homes and establish `fast track' procedures to expedite child \n        welfare cases involving drug abuse'';\n            (5) according to experts, current legal rules and agency \n        policies make it exceedingly difficult and time consuming to \n        terminate parental rights of those parents who truly abandon \n        their infants, and as a result very few of those abandoned \n        infants are available for adoption;\n            (6) the welfare of infants abandoned during the formative \n        months occurring shortly after birth is of such special \n        interest and concern to our society that if there are persons \n        desiring to adopt and parentally bond with such an infant, the \n        infant should be afforded the right to expeditious placement \n        with, and adoption by, such persons; and\n            (7) other steps should be taken to expedite the adoption of \n        infants who are abandoned during the formative months occurring \n        shortly after birth.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to encourage States to implement a \nsystem that will expedite the initiation of the adoption process for \ninfants abandoned at birth. In doing so, States will appoint competent \npersons to be preadoptive parents for infants abandoned at birth in \norder to provide a proper and loving home during the infants' formative \nmonths. The preadoptive parents will also be responsible for initiating \nlegal proceedings that could lead to the legal adoption of the infant. \nOnce the proceedings have been initiated, the State courts of proper \njurisdiction will continue to be responsible for the final decision, \ntaking into account the legal rights of all the parties involved, \nincluding the infant abandoned at birth, the natural parents, the \npreadoptive parents, and the State.\n\nSEC. 4. ADOPTION BY PREADOPTIVE PARENTS OF CERTAIN ABANDONED INFANTS.\n\n    (a) Certain State Laws Required as Condition of Project Grants.--\nTitle 1 of the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 670 \nnote) is amended--\n            (1) in section 101(a), by striking ``The Secretary'' in the \n        matter preceding paragraph (1) and inserting ``Subject to \n        section 101A, the Secretary''; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 101 the following section:\n\n``SEC. 101A. CERTAIN STATE LAWS REQUIRED AS CONDITION OF PROJECT \n              GRANTS.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary may not make a grant under section \n101 to a public or nonprofit private entity unless the project for \nwhich the grant is to be made is located in a State for which there is \nin effect State laws and rules of law that provide all of the \nfollowing:\n            ``(1) Within 30 days after the State obtains custody of a \n        designated abandoned infant (as defined in subsection (b)), the \n        State shall--\n                    ``(A) find 1 or more individuals to be the \n                preadoptive parents of such infant;\n                    ``(B) designate such individual or individuals as \n                the preadoptive parents of the infant; and\n                    ``(C) place the infant with such individual or \n                individuals.\n            ``(2)(A) During the 90-day period beginning on the date a \n        designated abandoned infant is placed with the preadoptive \n        parents of the infant, the preadoptive parents shall have the \n        right to petition the courts of the State for an expedited \n        hearing--\n            ``(i) to terminate the parental rights of all other persons \n        with respect to the infant; and\n            ``(ii) to become the adoptive parents of the infant.\n            ``(B) In determining whether to grant a petition described \n        in subparagraph (A), the courts of the State shall not draw any \n        inference adverse to the interests of a petitioner by reason of \n        the present or former status of any petitioner as a foster \n        parent.\n            ``(3) If the preadoptive parents of a designated abandoned \n        infant fail to file a petition described in paragraph (2)(A) \n        during the 90-day period described in such paragraph, the State \n        shall--\n                    ``(A) immediately revoke their designation as the \n                preadoptive parents of the infant; and\n                    ``(B) within 30 days after the end of such 90-day \n                period--\n                            ``(i) find 1 or more individuals (other \n                        than the former preadoptive parents of the \n                        infant) to be the new preadoptive parents of \n                        the infant;\n                            ``(ii) designate such individual or \n                        individuals as the preadoptive parents of the \n                        infant; and\n                            ``(iii) place the infant with such \n                        individual or individuals.\n    ``(b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the term \n`designated abandoned infant' means an abandoned infant--\n            ``(1) who has not attained the age of 18 months; and\n            ``(2) whose abandonment occurs during the first 6 months \n        after the infant is born.\n    ``(c) Rule of Construction.--The provisions and rules of State law \nthat are enacted or adopted pursuant to this subsection shall not be \nconstrued to affect any provision or rule of State law with respect to \nthe abandonment of children that is not so enacted or adopted, except \nto the extent that such provisions or rules of State law are in direct \nconflict.''.\n    (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall not \napply to any child who attains the age of 18 months before the date of \nthe enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.

For purposes of the \nprevious sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative \nsession, each year of such session shall be deemed to be a separate \nregular session of the State legislature."
