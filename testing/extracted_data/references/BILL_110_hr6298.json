FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On May 16, 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \n        and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \n        Saud al-Faisal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud signed a Memorandum of \n        Understanding between the Government of the United States of \n        America and the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \n        Concerning Cooperation in Nuclear Energy and Other Energy \n        Fields.\n            (2) This Memorandum of Understanding declared an intent to \n        cooperate in developing ``appropriately-sized light water \n        reactors and fuel service arrangements for the Kingdom of Saudi \n        Arabia'' as well as ``civilian nuclear energy training, \n        infrastructure and human resource development''.\n            (3) Saudi Arabia possesses vast energy resources, including \n        the world's largest proven reserves of oil.\n            (4) Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in a national natural \n        gas distribution pipeline which will serve as the backbone of \n        Saudi Arabia's national electricity generation system for \n        decades to come.\n            (5) Questions about the need for oil-rich nations in the \n        Middle East to acquire the equipment and expertise to generate \n        nuclear power have been raised in the past, notably in 2004, \n        when Vice President Dick Cheney said, ``[Iran is] already \n        sitting on an awful lot of oil and gas. No one can figure out \n        why they need nuclear, as well, to generate energy''.\n            (6) Saudi Arabia possesses even greater petroleum resources \n        than does Iran.\n            (7) The development of nuclear energy technologies by the \n        Kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not appear to have a compelling \n        economic rationale, particularly because Saudi Arabia has \n        additional indigenous energy advantages besides petroleum \n        reserves, such as an average of more than 300 days of exposure \n        to full sunlight every year, giving it a rich solar electricity \n        generation potential.\n            (8) The proliferation of nuclear technology in the Middle \n        East will increase that region's instability, and prevent the \n        establishment of a durable and lasting security framework.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    Congress--\n            (1) affirms the strong and historic ties between the \n        Government of the United States of America and the Government \n        of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia;\n            (2) disapproves of the Memorandum of Understanding between \n        the Government of the United States of America and the \n        Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Concerning \n        Cooperation in Nuclear Energy and Other Energy Fields signed by \n        Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Minister of Foreign \n        Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Saud al-Faisal bin \n        Abdulaziz al-Saud on May 16, 2008, at Riyadh;\n            (3) encourages the Government of the United States of \n        America and the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to \n        enter into full cooperation in the development of renewable \n        energy sources in Saudi Arabia, including a solar energy \n        program that takes advantage of that country's strong solar \n        energy potential; and\n            (4) reiterates that the United States is committed to the \n        nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and to preventing the \n        acquisition of nuclear weapons by the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON NUCLEAR COOPERATION WITH THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI \n              ARABIA.\n\n    (a) Restriction on Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.--Notwithstanding \nany other provision of law or any international agreement, no agreement \nfor cooperation between the United States of America and the Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia pursuant to section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 \n(42 U.S.C. 2153) may enter into force on or after the date of the \nenactment of this Act.\n    (b) Restriction on Exports of Nuclear Materials, Equipment, or \nTechnology.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including \nspecifically section 121 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n2151), no nuclear materials and equipment or sensitive nuclear \ntechnology, including items and assistance authorized by section 57 b. \nof such Act (42 U.S.C. 2077(b)) and regulated under part 810 of title \n10, Code of Federal Regulations, and nuclear-related items on the \nCommerce Control List maintained under part 774 of title 15, Code of \nFederal Regulations, shall be exported or reexported, or transferred or \nretransferred, whether directly or indirectly, and no Federal agency \nshall issue any license, approval, or authorization for the export or \nreexport, or transfer or retransfer, whether directly or indirectly, of \nthese items or assistance (as defined in this subsection) to the \nKingdom of Saudi Arabia if the end user is a nuclear production or \nutilization facility, or if the President determines that the material, \nequipment, technology, or item may be diverted for use in such a \nfacility."
