FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The tuna processing and manufacturing industry is by \n        far the largest private-sector base of employment in American \n        Samoa and serves as the critical foundation for the overall \n        economy of American Samoa. The unique local economy created by \n        the operation of tuna canneries is largely irreplaceable as an \n        employment base. The canneries currently provide 80 percent of \n        private sector employment in American Samoa, and generate more \n        than $80,000,000 (30 percent) of the territory's income from \n        labor according to a recent Department of Labor report. Most \n        other private sector jobs in American Samoa provide goods or \n        services to the tuna processors. Moreover, the economic growth \n        of many other private sector employers in the consumer retail \n        and service sectors is tied either directly or indirectly to \n        the tuna industry.\n            (2) Over the past 30 years, direct employment growth in the \n        fish processing industry has accounted for more than one-third \n        of total job growth in American Samoa. Moreover, a recent study \n        reflects that every job added to or subtracted from the economy \n        by a change in employment in the tuna processing industry adds \n        or subtracts another 0.47 jobs from other sectors of American \n        Samoa's economy, the so-called ``multiplier effect''.\n            (3) An important component of the tuna processing \n        industry's multiplier effect is derived from direct delivery of \n        tuna by fishing vessels to American Samoa for processing, which \n        results in revenue for the territory from visitor expenditures \n        on vessel refueling, repair, and other shipyard services, \n        stevedores, fishing net repairs, lodging, dining, and a host of \n        other services. Unfortunately, while having provided limited \n        economic benefit through indirect deliveries which ensured a \n        constant supply of fish to the canneries, the large majority of \n        the eligible fleet which fishes under the auspices of a United \n        States flag and United States license no longer provides direct \n        delivery or economic benefit to American Samoa, where many of \n        them are home-ported, choosing rather to deliver their catch to \n        massive carrier ships for purposes of transshipping their fish \n        to be cleaned in low-wage labor rate countries.\n            (4) Due to low-wage labor rates of 0.60 cents and less per \n        hour for tuna cannery workers in competing countries, increased \n        transportation and energy costs, decreased volumes of direct-\n        delivered fish to American Samoa, recent Federal minimum wage \n        policy changes that have resulted in mandatory annual wage \n        increases, heavy foreign competition for United States market \n        share in the tuna industry, and a number of other issues, one \n        of American Samoa's tuna canneries has announced that it will \n        shut down by September 2009. This closure will result in job \n        loss for nearly 40 percent of the territory's private sector \n        employees, as well as increased energy, shipping, and food \n        costs for the remaining businesses and public entities because \n        the canneries help subsidize the costs of these industries.\n            (5) Closure of the remaining tuna processing plant would \n        result in job loss for another 40 percent of private sector \n        employees, and a recent study of the territory's economy \n        concluded that closure of the remaining tuna processing plant \n        would result in total job loss of 44 percent of all employment \n        in the territory, leaving the American Samoan Government, which \n        receives significant operational and capital grants from the \n        Federal Government, as the territory's only significant \n        employer.\n            (6) Due to present dependence on the canneries and Federal \n        aid, if both canneries leave American Samoa, only direct \n        Federal assistance will remain to bridge the gap left by the \n        loss of approximately $80,000,000 in private sector income from \n        the tuna canneries.\n            (7) The Department of the Interior has previously reported \n        to Congress that in the absence of the revenue derived from the \n        canneries, American Samoa, with its population of nearly \n        70,000, will be ``almost wholly dependent'' on direct \n        assistance from the Federal Government, warning that the \n        American Samoan economy will be ``devastated'';\n            (8) Having served, starting at the turn of the last \n        century, as an important refueling station for American ships \n        in the South Pacific, American Samoa has long held a position \n        of strategic and historic importance to the United States, and \n        over the years, American Samoans have sacrificed to help keep \n        our country free, with many serving in the United States \n        military.\n            (9) In March 2006, it was reported to Congress that the \n        sacrifice of American Samoa in the Iraq war was \n        disproportionate to the territory's small size, as residents of \n        the territory were 15 times more likely to be killed in action \n        in Iraq than residents of the United States as a whole.\n    (b) Policy.--The Federal Government should provide employment \nstabilization and economic development assistance to the people of \nAmerican Samoa, including incentives for the continued operation and \ndevelopment of American Samoa's tuna processing industry, as the \nterritory now faces severe economic conditions.\n\nSEC. 3.
