    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Recognizing Addiction as a Disease \nAct of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease that is \n        characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite \n        harmful consequences. It is considered a brain disease because \n        drugs change the brain's structure and manner in which it \n        functions. These brain changes can be long lasting, and can \n        lead to the harmful behaviors seen in people who abuse drugs. \n        The disease of addiction affects both brain and behavior, and \n        scientists have identified many of the biological and \n        environmental factors that contribute to the development and \n        progression of the disease.\n            (2) The pejorative term ``abuse'' used in connection with \n        diseases of addiction has the adverse effect of increasing \n        social stigma and personal shame, both of which are so often \n        barriers to an individual's decision to seek treatment.\n\nSEC. 3.

THE EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH \n              AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since it was established by Congress in 1962 at the \n        request of President John F. Kennedy, the National Institute of \n        Child Health and Human Development has achieved an outstanding \n        record of achievement in catalyzing a concentrated attack on \n        the unsolved health problems of children and of mother-infant \n        relationships by fulfilling its mission to--\n                    (A) ensure that every individual is born healthy \n                and wanted, that women suffer no harmful effects from \n                reproductive processes, and that all children have the \n                chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and \n                productive lives, free from disease or disability; and\n                    (B) ensure the health, productivity, independence, \n                and well-being of all individuals through optimal \n                rehabilitation.\n            (2) The National Institute of Child Health and Human \n        Development has made unparalleled contributions to the \n        advancement of child health and human development, including \n        significant efforts to--\n                    (A) reduce dramatically the rates of Sudden Infant \n                Death Syndrome, infant mortality, and maternal HIV \n                transmission;\n                    (B) develop the Haemophilus Influenza B (Hib) \n                vaccine, credited with nearly eliminating the incidence \n                of mental retardation; and\n                    (C) conduct intramural research, support extramural \n                research, and train thousands of child health and human \n                development researchers who have contributed greatly to \n                dramatic gains in child health throughout the world.\n            (3) The vision, drive, and tenacity of one woman, Eunice \n        Kennedy Shriver, was instrumental in proposing, passing, and \n        enacting legislation to establish the National Institute of \n        Child Health and Human Development (Public Law 87-838) on \n        October 17, 1962.\n            (4) It is befitting and appropriate to recognize the \n        substantial achievements of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a tireless \n        advocate for children with special needs, whose foresight in \n        creating the National Institute of Child Health and Human \n        Development gave life to the words of President Kennedy, who \n        wished to ``encourage imaginative research into the complex \n        processes of human development from conception to old age.''.\n    (b) Amendments to the Public Health Service Act.--The Public Health \nService Act is amended--\n            (1) in section 401(b)(7) (42 U.S.C. 281(b)(7)), by striking \n        ``National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'' \n        and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of \n        Child Health and Human Development'';\n            (2) in section 404B (42 U.S.C. 283d), by striking \n        ``National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'' \n        and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of \n        Child Health and Human Development'';\n            (3) in section 404E(a) (42 U.S.C. 283g(a)), by striking \n        ``National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'' \n        and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of \n        Child Health and Human Development'';\n            (4) in section 409D(c)(1) (42 U.S.C. 284h(c)(1)), by \n        striking ``National Institute of Child Health and Human \n        Development'' and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National \n        Institute of Child Health and Human Development'';\n            (5) in section 424(c)(3)(B)(vi) (42 U.S.C. 285b-\n        7(c)(3)(B)(vi)), by striking ``National Institute of Child \n        Health and Human Development'' and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy \n        Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human \n        Development'';\n            (6) in section 430(b)(2)(B) (42 U.S.C. 285c-4(b)(2)(B)), by \n        striking ``National Institute of Child Health and Human \n        Development'' and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National \n        Institute of Child Health and Human Development'';\n            (7) in subpart 7 of part C of title IV (42 U.S.C. 285g et \n        seq), by striking ``National Institute of Child Health and \n        Human Development'' each place that such appears and inserting \n        ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and \n        Human Development'';\n            (8) in section 487B(a) (42 U.S.C. 288-2(a)), by striking \n        ``National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'' \n        and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of \n        Child Health and Human Development'';\n            (9) in section 519C(g)(2) (42 U.S.C. 290bb-25c(g)(2)), by \n        striking ``National Institute of Child Health and Human \n        Development'' and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National \n        Institute of Child Health and Human Development'';
