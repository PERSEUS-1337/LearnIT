STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY UNITS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) older electric utility units are exempt from strict \n        emission control requirements applicable to newer facilities, \n        allowing some older units to emit greater quantities of \n        dangerous pollutants;\n            (2) this disparity in regulatory treatment is of particular \n        concern in the new era of electric utility restructuring, which \n        was never envisioned at the time of enactment of the Clean Air \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) or amendments to that Act;\n            (3) in an era of electric utility restructuring, utilities \n        that spend less money on environmental controls will be able to \n        increase their generation of power and emissions of dangerous \n        pollutants;\n            (4) this situation results in an unfair competitive \n        disadvantage for utilities that generate electricity while \n        meeting strict environmental standards; and\n            (5) electricity restructuring can result in enormous \n        benefits for consumers and the environment if done right.\n    (b) Standards.--Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(k) Standards of Performance for Electric Generating Units.--\n            ``(1) Definition of grandfathered unit.--In this \n        subsection, the term `grandfathered unit' means a fossil fuel-\n        fired electric utility unit that, before the date of enactment \n        of this subsection, was not subject to the standards of \n        performance set forth in subpart D of part 60 of title 40, Code \n        of Federal Regulations, or to any subsequently adopted standard \n        of performance under this section applicable to fossil fuel-\n        fired electric utility units.\n            ``(2) Applicability.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n        of law, in the case of a fossil fuel-fired electric utility \n        unit, a standard of performance under this section that applies \n        to new or modified electric utility units shall also apply to a \n        grandfathered unit that--\n                    ``(A) has the capacity to generate more than 25 \n                megawatts of electrical output per hour;
