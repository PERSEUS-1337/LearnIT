CRS Report RL34016, Legal Services Corporation: Background and Funding , by [author name scrubbed]. The annual CJS appropriations act provides funding for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, the science agencies, and several related agencies. Appropriations for the Department of Commerce include funding for agencies such as the Census Bureau, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Appropriations for the Department of Justice provide funding for agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, along with funding for a variety of grant programs for state, local, and tribal governments. The vast majority of funding for the science agencies goes to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation. The annual appropriation for the related agencies includes funding for agencies such as the Legal Services Corporation and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The mission of the Department of Commerce is to promote \"job creation, economic growth, sustainable development and improved standards of living ... by working in partnership with businesses, universities, communities and ... workers.\" The department has wide-ranging responsibilities including trade, economic development, technology, entrepreneurship and business development, monitoring the environment, forecasting weather, managing marine resources, and statistical research and analysis. The Department of Commerce affects trade and economic development by working to open new markets for U.S. goods and services and promoting pro-growth business policies. The department also invests in research and development to foster innovation. The Department of Commerce manages and monitors coastal and ocean resources and assets to support both environmental and economic health. It also conducts the constitutionally mandated decennial census. Finally, the Department of Commerce operates the national patent system.  The following agencies within the Department of Commerce carry out these missions: International Trade Administration (ITA) seeks to develop the export potential of U.S. firms and improve the trade performance of U.S. industry; Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) enforces U.S. export laws consistent with national security, foreign policy, and short-supply objectives; Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides grants for economic development projects in economically distressed communities and regions; Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) seeks to promote private- and public-sector investment in minority businesses; Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) , excluding the Census Bureau, provides (1) information on the state of the economy through preparation, development, and interpretation of economic data, and (2) analytical support to department officials in meeting their policy responsibilities; Census Bureau , a component of ESA, collects, compiles, and publishes a broad range of economic, demographic, and social data; National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) advises the President on domestic and international communications policy, manages the federal government's use of the radio frequency spectrum, and performs research in telecommunications sciences; United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) examines and approves applications for patents of claimed inventions and registration of trademarks; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) assists industry in developing technology to improve product quality, modernize manufacturing processes, ensure product reliability, and facilitate rapid commercialization of products on the basis of new scientific discoveries; and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides scientific, technical, and management expertise to (1) promote safe and efficient marine and air navigation; (2) assess the health of coastal and marine resources; (3) monitor and predict the coastal, ocean, and global environments (including weather forecasting); and (4) protect and manage the nation's coastal resources. The mission of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is to \"enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.\" DOJ provides legal advice and opinions, upon request, to the President and executive branch department heads. It prosecutes individuals accused of violating federal laws and represents the U.S. government in court. The department enforces federal criminal and civil laws, including antitrust, civil rights, environmental, and tax laws. DOJ, through agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, investigates organized and violent crime, illegal drugs, and gun and explosives violations. The department, through the U.S. Marshals Service, protects the federal judiciary, apprehends fugitives, and detains individuals who are not granted pretrial release. It incarcerates individuals convicted of violating federal laws. DOJ also provides grants and training to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.  The major functions of DOJ agencies and offices are described below: United States Attorneys prosecute criminal offenses against the United States, represent the federal government in civil actions, and initiate proceedings for the collection of fines, penalties, and forfeitures owed to the United States; United States Marshals Service (USMS) provides security for the federal judiciary, protects witnesses, executes warrants and court orders, manages seized assets, detains and transports prisoners who have not been sentenced, and apprehends fugitives; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigates violations of federal criminal law; helps protect the United States against terrorism and hostile intelligence efforts; provides assistance to other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies; and shares jurisdiction with the Drug Enforcement Administration over federal drug violations; Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigates federal drug law violations; coordinates its efforts with state, local, and other federal law enforcement agencies; develops and maintains drug intelligence systems; regulates legitimate controlled substances activities; and conducts joint intelligence-gathering activities with foreign governments; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) enforces federal law related to the manufacture, importation, and distribution of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives (it was transferred from the Department of the Treasury to DOJ by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 )); Federal Prison System ( Bureau of Prisons, BOP ) provides for the custody and care of the federal prison population, the maintenance of prison-related facilities, and the boarding of sentenced federal prisoners incarcerated in state and local institutions; Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) coordinates legislative and other initiatives relating to violence against women and administers grant programs to help prevent, detect, and stop violence against women, including domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking; Office of Justice Programs (OJP) manages and coordinates the activities of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Institute of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, and Office of Victims of Crime; and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) advances the practice of community policing by awarding grants to law enforcement agencies to hire and train community policing professionals, acquire and deploy crime-fighting technologies, and develop and test innovative policing strategies. The science agencies fund and otherwise support research and development (R&D) and related activities across a wide variety of federal missions, including national competitiveness, energy and the environment, and fundamental discovery. Congress established the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) through the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 ( P.L. 94-282 ). The act states that \"the primary function of the OSTP director is to provide, within the Executive Office of the President, advice on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of issues that require attention at the highest level of Government.\" The OSTP director also manages the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), which coordinates science and technology policy across the executive branch of the federal government, and co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), a council of external advisors that provides advice to the President on matters related to science and technology policy. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (P.L. 85-568) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities. It has four mission directorates. The Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate is responsible for human spaceflight activities, including the International Space Station and development efforts for future crewed spacecraft. The Science Mission Directorate manages robotic science missions, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Mars rover Curiosity, and satellites for Earth science research. The Space Technology Mission Directorate develops new technologies for use in future space missions, such as advanced propulsion and laser communications. The Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate conducts research and development on aircraft and aviation systems. In addition, NASA's Office of Education manages formal and informal education programs for school children, college and university students, and the general public. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in the non-medical sciences and engineering. Congress established the foundation as an independent federal agency in 1950 \"to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.\" The NSF is a primary source of federal support for U.S. university research. It is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education program portfolio and federal STEM student aid and support. The annual CJS appropriations act includes funding for seven related agencies with missions or responsibilities similar to those of the Departments of Commerce and Justice or the science agencies. The related agencies are the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the International Trade Commission, the Legal Services Corporation, the Marine Mammal Commission, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the State Justice Institute. On December 16, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ). The act provided a total of $61.753 billion for the agencies and bureaus funded by the annual CJS appropriations act, including $8.467 billion for the Department of Commerce, $27.030 billion for DOJ, $25.360 billion for the science agencies, and $896 million for the related agencies. The Administration requested a total of $66.332 billion for CJS for FY2016, which was 7.4% more than what Congress appropriated for FY2015. The Administration proposed increasing funding for the Department of Commerce by 15.8%, DOJ by 8.2%, the science agencies by 3.5%, and the related agencies by 15.1%. The FY2016 budget request for CJS included the following: A proposed 37.9% increase for the Census Bureau, which was mostly the result of a request for a $382 million increase (45.5%) for the Periodic Censuses and Programs account. A request for $150 million under NIST's Industrial Technology Services account for a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation program, which would have sought to create an effective manufacturing research infrastructure for industry and academia to solve industry-relevant problems. A requested 45.9% increase ($96 million) in the COPS program, most of which would have gone to the COPS hiring program. A proposed 39.6% increase in funding for the Administrative Review and Appeals account. A request for a $152 million (17.2%) increase for DOJ's General Legal Activities account, most of which would have gone to DOJ's Criminal Division. A proposed $959 million (193.6%) increase in the USMS's Federal Prisoner Detention account. The proposed increase was the result of Congress supplementing the Federal Prisoner Detention account for FY2015 by transferring $1.1 billion in unobligated balances from the Assets Forfeiture Fund. A request for an increase of $129 million (21.6%) in funding for NASA's Space Technology account, $149 million (3.4%) for the Exploration account, and $176 million (4.6%) for the Space Operations account. The FY2016 budget request also proposed an $80 million (12.2%) reduction in NASA's Aeronautics account. A proposed $253 million (4.3%) increase for NSF's Research and Related Activities account. A request for a 55.6% increase in funding for the International Trade Commission and a 20.5% increase in funding for the Legal Services Corporation. H.R. 2578 would have provided a total of $62.845 billion for CJS. The proposed funding level would have been 1.8% more than the FY2015 appropriation, but 5.3% less than the Administration's request. The House recommended $8.086 billion for the Department of Commerce, $28.007 billion for DOJ, $25.929 billion for the science agencies, and $823 million for the related agencies. In general, the House recommended funding all of the accounts in CJS at an amount below the Administration's request. The House-passed bill included the following: A recommended $501.1 million for DOJ's Office on Violence Against Women account, an amount that was 5.8% greater than the Administration's request and 16.5% greater than the FY2015 appropriation. A recommended 8.9% reduction in funding for the Census Bureau compared to the FY2015 appropriation. The amount recommended by the House would have been 33.9% below the Administration's request. A proposed reduction in funding for NOAA by 5.0% compared to FY2015 funding, which was mostly a result of a proposed 10.1% reduction in the Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction account. A proposed 21.8% increase in funding for the Administrative Review and Appeals account. A recommended 113.6% increase in the Federal Prisoner Detention account. The proposed increase was the result of Congress supplementing the Federal Prisoner Detention account for FY2015 by transferring $1.1 billion in unobligated balances from the Assets Forfeiture Fund. A proposal to eliminate the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account. The committee recommended allowing DOJ to fund the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice with set-asides from DOJ grant programs. A recommendation to reduce funding for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance and Juvenile Justice Programs accounts by 8.0% and 25.8%, respectively. A proposal to increase the obligation cap on the Crime Victims Fund to $2.705 billion, which would have been approximately 170% more than what the Administration requested for FY2016. A proposal to increase funding for NASA's Exploration and Space Technology accounts by 9.2% and 4.9%, respectively, but the House also proposed to reduce funding for the Aeronautics account by 7.8%. A proposed 20.0% reduction in funding for the Legal Services Corporation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $62.849 billion for CJS, an amount that was 1.8% greater than the FY2015 appropriation, 5.3% below the Administration's request, and nearly equal to the House-passed amount. The amount recommended by the committee included $8.477 billion for the Department of Commerce, $27.828 billion for DOJ, $25.639 billion for the science agencies, and $906 million for the related agencies. Like the House, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding most of the accounts in CJS at a level below the Administration's request. The amount recommended by the committee included the following: A proposed 5.0% increase in funding for NIST's Industrial Technology Services account, compared to FY2015 funding. The amount was also 11.5% more than what was recommended by the House. However, it was 52.6% below the Administration's proposal, which was largely the result of the committee not recommending $150 million in funding the Administration requested for a national network and manufacturing innovation program. A proposal to fund the Census Bureau at a level that was 13.7% greater than what the House recommended and 3.7% greater than the FY2015 appropriation, but 24.8% below the Administration's request. A recommendation to fund NOAA at a level that would have been 4.1% greater than the House-passed amount. However, the Senate committee-reported amount would have been 1.1% less than the FY2015 appropriation and 9.9% less than the Administration's request. A proposed 17.3% increase in funding for DOJ's Administrative Review and Appeals account, compared to FY2015 funding. However, the recommendation would have been 16.0% less than the Administration's request and 3.7% less than what the House recommended. A recommended 193.6% increase in the Federal Prisoner Detention account, compared to FY2015 funding. The committee-reported amount would have been 37.5% more than the House-passed amount. The proposed increase is the result of Congress supplementing the Federal Prisoner Detention account for FY2015 by transferring $1.1 billion in unobligated balances from the Assets Forfeiture Fund. The Senate Committee on Appropriations would have provided $234 million for the Office on Violence against Women account, an amount that would have been 45.6% less than the FY2015 appropriation, 50.6% less than the Administration's request, and 53.3% less than what the House recommended. A proposed 10.2% increase in the obligation cap for the Crime Victims Fund. A recommended 18.7% reduction in funding for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account. The recommended amount was also 11.6% less than the House-passed amount. A proposal to increase funding for NASA's Space Operations account by 24.3% and to decrease NASA's Exploration account by 12.1%. These changes would have resulted mostly from moving funds for the Commercial Crew program from Exploration to Space Operations; without that move, the recommendation for Space Operations would have been nearly flat and the recommendation for Exploration would have been an increase. The Senate Committee on Appropriations also recommended reducing funding for NASA's Aeronautics (19.4%), Education (9.2%), and Construction and Environmental Compliance and Restoration (15.8%) accounts relative to the FY2015 appropriation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations would have provided 28.3% more for the Legal Services Corporation than the House, but the committee-reported amount would have been 14.8% less than the Administration's request. On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ). Division B of the act (the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016) provides $66.000 billion for CJS, which includes $9.246 billion for the Department of Commerce, $29.090 billion for the Department of Justice, $26.754 billion for the science agencies, and $910 million for the related agencies. The FY2016 appropriation for CJS is 6.9% greater than the FY2015 appropriation, but 0.5% less than the Administration's request. The FY2016-enacted appropriation for CJS is 5.0% greater than the amount recommended by the House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations. In general, the FY2016 appropriation for CJS accounts is greater than the FY2015 appropriation, but below or equal to the Administration's request. The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 includes the following: A 25.9% increase in funding for the Census Bureau compared to the FY2015 appropriation. However, the FY2016 appropriation is 8.7% below the Administration's request. Of note, Congress agreed to the Administration's proposal to realign the Census Bureau's funding into two new accounts. An 11.6% increase in funding for NIST, which is largely the result of a 12.2% increase in funding for the Industrial Technology Services account, due to the addition of $25 million for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, and a more than doubling of funding for the Construction of Research Facilities account (from $50 million to $119 million). The FY2016 appropriation for NIST is 13.9% below the Administration's request. A 6.0% increase in funding for NOAA, which includes a 10.1% increase in the Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction account. The FY2016 appropriation is 3.5% below the Administration's request. A 21.8% increase for DOJ's Administrative Review and Appeals account. The FY2016 appropriation is 12.7% below the Administration's request. A 58.8% increase in funding for the U.S. Marshals Service, which is largely the result of Congress funding the Federal Prisoner Detention account through appropriated funds rather than supplementing the account with a transfer from the Assets Forfeiture Fund. A 4.3% increase in funding for the FBI, which includes a near tripling in funding for the FBI's Construction account (from $110 million to $309 million). The increased funding for this account is partially to help the FBI build a new headquarters in the National Capital region. An 8.1% increase in funding for the BOP, which is largely due to a quadrupling of funding for the BOP's Buildings and Facilities account (from $106 million to $530 million). The additional funding is to help the BOP build new prisons to meet their capacity demands and to help the BOP maintain and repair existing prisons. A 13.5% increase in funding for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account. The FY2016 appropriation is 23.3% greater than the Administration's request. A 28.8% increase in the obligation cap on the Crime Victims Fund, from $2.361 billion to $3.042 billion. The obligation cap is more than triple what the Administration requested. Of note, $379 million was transferred from the Crime Victims Fund to the Office on Violence Against Women (for purposes outside of those authorized by the Victims of Crime Act) and $10 million was designated for the Office of the Inspector General for oversight and auditing purposes. A 7.1% increase in appropriations for NASA. The FY2016 appropriation includes a 15.2% and a 31.4% increase, respectively, in the Space Technology and Space Operations accounts. However, the FY2016 appropriation also includes reductions for the Aeronautics (-1.7%), Exploration (-7.5%), Education (-3.4%), and Construction and Environmental Compliance and Restoration (7.2%) accounts. The FY2016 appropriation for NASA includes some increases compared to the Administration's request in the Science (5.7%); Aeronautics (12.0%); Space Operations (25.6%); and Education (29.4%) accounts. On the other hand, Congress also funded some of NASA's accounts at a level below the Administration's request: Space Technology (-5.3%); Exploration (-10.6%); Safety, Security, and Mission Services (-2.6%); and Construction and Environmental Compliance and Restoration (-16.4%). Of note, Congress provided up to $1.244 billion for the Commercial Crew program in the Space Operations account, rather than in the Exploration account, which previously funded this program.  Table 1 shows the FY2015-enacted appropriation, the Administration's FY2016 request, the House-passed amount, the Senate committee-reported amount, and the FY2016-enacted appropriation for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, the science agencies, and the related agencies. Table 2 shows enacted appropriations for these agencies, in detail, for FY2006 through FY2015 (the FY2013 amounts shown in Table 2 reflect sequestration).  Figure 1 shows the total appropriations, in both nominal and inflation-adjusted dollars, for CJS for FY2006-FY2015 (more detailed historical appropriations data can be found in Table 2 ). The data show that nominal appropriations for CJS increased starting with FY2006. Appropriations for CJS peaked in FY2009 at $76.782 billion if emergency supplemental appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) are included. If ARRA funding is not considered, appropriations peaked in FY2010 at $69.146 billion. ARRA provided a substantial increase in appropriations for FY2009. The $15.992 billion Congress appropriated for CJS under ARRA was equal to approximately 25% of the amount Congress provided for it through regular appropriations. Appropriations for CJS decreased in each of the three fiscal years after FY2010. Nominal appropriations for CJS were relatively flat in FY2014 and FY2015, though appropriations in both FY2014 and FY2015 were higher than they were in FY2013. If not for sequestration, which cut nearly $4 billion out of the total amount Congress appropriated for CJS for FY2013, funding for CJS would have held steady at approximately $61 billion between FY2011 and FY2015.  After adjusting for inflation, appropriations for CJS for FY2013-FY2015 were generally at the same level they were in FY2006.  Figure 2 shows total appropriations for CJS for FY2006-FY2015 by major component (i.e., the Departments of Commerce and Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science Foundation). The data show that the increases in CJS appropriations in FY2009 (not including ARRA funding), FY2010, and FY2011 resulted from Congress appropriating more funding for the Department of Commerce in support of the 2010 decennial census.  While decreased appropriations for the Department of Commerce mostly explain the overall decrease in CJS appropriations since FY2010, there have also been cuts in funding for DOJ and NASA. DOJ's FY2015 appropriation is 4.4% below its FY2010 appropriation, and NASA's FY2014 appropriation was 3.8% below its FY2010 appropriation. However, even though NASA received less in FY2015 than it did in FY2010, NASA's FY2015 appropriation is $1.379 billion more than its FY2006 appropriation. In addition, even with cuts to DOJ's appropriation since FY2010, Congress still appropriated $5.316 billion more for DOJ in FY2015 than it did in FY2006. Appropriations for DOJ increased because Congress appropriated increasing amounts for federal law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and for the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee and the Bureau of Prisons to cover expenses associated with a rising number of federal detainees and prisoners. Funding for the NSF has, for the most part, steadily increased over the past 10 fiscal years. The NSF's appropriation increased in 8 of the 10 fiscal years between FY2006 and FY2015, and the decrease in the NSF's funding for FY2013 was the result of sequestration. Increased funding for the NSF has mostly resulted from Congress increasing funding for the NSF's Research and Related Activities account."
