FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As concluded in the report of the Committee on Science \n        of the House of Representatives, ``Unlocking Our Future: Toward \n        a New National Science Policy,'' which was adopted by the House \n        of Representatives, the United States must maintain and improve \n        its preeminent position in science and technology in order to \n        advance human understanding of the universe and all it \n        contains, and to improve the lives, health, and freedoms of all \n        people.\n            (2) It is estimated that more than half of the economic \n        growth of the United States today results directly from \n        research and development in science and technology. The most \n        fundamental research is responsible for investigating our \n        perceived universe, to extend our observations to the outer \n        limits of what our minds and methods can achieve, and to seek \n        answers to questions that have never been asked before. Applied \n        research continues the process by applying the answers from \n        basic science to the problems faced by individuals, \n        organizations, and governments in the everyday activities, so \n        that our lives may become more meaningful and livable.\n            (3) The effectiveness of the United States in promoting \n        economic growth will be largely determined by the intellectual \n        capital and innovativeness of the United States. Education is \n        critical to developing this resource.\n            (4) The education programs of the United States need to \n        provide for 3 different kinds of intellectual capital. First, \n        the country needs scientists and engineers to continue the \n        research and development that is central to the economic growth \n        of the United States. Second, it needs technologically \n        proficient workers who are comfortable and capable dealing with \n        the demands of a science-based, high-technology workplace. \n        Last, it needs scientifically literate voters and consumers to \n        make intelligent decisions about public policy.\n            (5) Student performance on the recent Trends in \n        International Math and Science Study and the Program for \n        International Student Assessment highlights the shortcomings of \n        current K-12 science and mathematics education in the United \n        States, particularly when compared to other countries. We must \n        expect more from our Nation's educators and students if we are \n        to build on the accomplishments of previous generations. New \n        methods of teaching mathematics and science are required, as \n        well as better curricula and improved training of teachers, \n        coupled with strong parental involvement and support.\n            (6) Science is more than a collection of facts, theories, \n        and results. It is a process of inquiry built upon observations \n        and data that leads to a way of knowing and explaining the \n        perceived universe in logically derived concepts and theories.\n            (7) Students should learn science primarily by doing \n        science. Science education ought to reflect the scientific \n        process and be object-oriented, experiment-centered, and \n        concept-based.\n            (8) Children are naturally curious and inquisitive. To \n        successfully tap into these innate qualities, education in \n        science must begin at an early age and continue throughout the \n        entire school experience.\n            (9) Teachers provide the essential connection between \n        students and the content they are learning. High-quality, well-\n        trained prospective teachers need to be identified and \n        recruited by presenting to them a career that is respected by \n        their peers, is financially and intellectually rewarding, and \n        contains sufficient opportunities for advancement.\n            (10) Teachers must have incentives to remain in the \n        classroom and improve their practice, and training of teachers \n        is essential if the results are to be superior. Teachers need \n        to be knowledgeable of their content area, of their curriculum, \n        of up-to-date research in teaching and learning, and of \n        techniques that can be used to connect that information to \n        their students in their classroom.\n\nSEC. 3.
