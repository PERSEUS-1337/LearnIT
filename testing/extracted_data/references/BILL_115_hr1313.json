FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Congress has a strong tradition of protecting and \n        preserving employee workplace wellness programs, including \n        programs that utilize a health risk assessment, biometric \n        screening, or other resources to inform and empower employees \n        in making healthier lifestyle choices;\n            (2) health promotion and prevention programs are a means to \n        reduce the burden of chronic illness, improve health, and limit \n        the growth of health care costs;\n            (3) in enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n        Act (Public Law 111-148), Congress intended that employers \n        would be permitted to implement health promotion and prevention \n        programs that provide incentives, rewards, rebates, surcharges, \n        penalties, or other inducements related to wellness programs, \n        including rewards of up to 50 percent off of insurance premiums \n        for employees participating in programs designed to encourage \n        healthier lifestyle choices; and\n            (4) Congress has struck an appropriate balance among \n        employees, health care providers, and wellness plan sponsors to \n        protect individual privacy and confidentiality in a wellness \n        program which is designed to improve health outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3.
