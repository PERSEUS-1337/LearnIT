FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) illegal gambling on college sports is a serious \n        national problem;\n            (2) illegal gambling by college students and other underage \n        persons, particularly on sports, is a serious national problem \n        that warrants effective national countermeasures to combat it;\n            (3) recent scientific reports suggest a very high incidence \n        of illegal gambling among college students, on college sporting \n        events;\n            (4) illegal student bookies are present at every collegiate \n        institution;\n            (5) there is evidence that illegal sports gambling, \n        including that conducted on college and university campuses \n        through illegal student bookies, is linked to organized crime \n        and is a major source of revenue for organized crime \n        operations;\n            (6) the FBI estimates that close to $2,500,000,000 is \n        wagered illegally on the National Collegiate Athletic \n        Association Division I Men's Basketball Tournament each year;\n            (7) in Nevada, the only State where such sports betting is \n        legal, the 1998 National Collegiate Athletic Association \n        Division I Men's Basketball Tournament saw approximately \n        $80,000,000 wagered with Nevada's regulated sports books, or \n        only three percent of that wagered illegally elsewhere;\n            (8) there are no comprehensive studies available that \n        analyze the prevalence of illegal gambling on college sports;\n            (9) the National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC) \n        (as authorized under Public Law 104-169) was expressly limited \n        by its statutory charter to a study of legal gambling but did \n        recommend that the role of illegal sports gambling be examined \n        in future gambling related research including research by \n        agencies of the Department of Justice;\n            (10) the issue of illegal gambling on college sports is \n        still largely overlooked by college administrators;\n            (11) there needs to be comprehensive gambling education \n        programs conducted on each campus that target all students as \n        recommended by the NGISC;\n            (12) illegal gambling on college sports will continue to \n        flourish throughout the United States unless a strong effort is \n        made to enforce State and Federal laws prohibiting such \n        activity;\n            (13) in order to combat illegal gambling on college sports \n        in this country, law enforcement must ensure that compliance \n        with Federal and State laws is a high priority; and\n            (14) absent meaningful countermeasures, including \n        implementation of more effective student awareness and \n        education campaigns, illegal gambling on college sports will \n        continue to be a problem on college and university campuses \n        across the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
