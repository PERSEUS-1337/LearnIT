FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many reports over the past decade have found that it is \n        critical to our Nation's economic leadership and global \n        competitiveness that we educate and train more scientists and \n        engineers.\n            (2) In its 2007 report entitled ``Beyond Bias and \n        Barriers'', the National Academies stated that, in order to \n        maintain its scientific and engineering leadership amid \n        increasing economic and educational globalization, the United \n        States must aggressively pursue the innovative capacity of all \n        of its people--women and men.\n            (3) Research shows that the number of women who are \n        interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \n        (STEM) careers is reduced at every educational transition, from \n        high school on through full professorships.\n            (4) According to data compiled by National Science \n        Foundation in 2006, women now earn about half of all science \n        and engineering bachelor's degrees, but major variations \n        persist among fields. For example, women still receive only 20 \n        percent of all bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering and \n        physics.\n            (5) Even in science and engineering fields with a higher \n        representation of women, such as the social and behavioral \n        sciences, women remain underrepresented among university \n        faculty. According to data compiled by the National Science \n        Foundation, for over 30 years women have made up over 30 \n        percent of the doctorates in social sciences and behavioral \n        sciences and over 20 percent in the life sciences. Yet, at the \n        top research institutions, only 15.4 percent of the full \n        professors in the social and behavioral sciences and 14.8 \n        percent in the life sciences are women.\n            (6) Across fields, women remain a small portion of the \n        science and engineering faculty members at major research \n        universities, and they typically receive fewer institutional \n        resources for their research activities than their male \n        colleagues.\n            (7) Studies have not found any significant biological \n        differences between men and women in performing science and \n        mathematics that can account for the lower representation of \n        women in academic faculty and scientific leadership positions \n        in these fields.\n            (8) A substantial body of evidence establishes that most \n        people hold implicit biases. Decades of cognitive psychology \n        research reveals that most people carry prejudices of which \n        they are unaware but that nonetheless play a large role in \n        evaluations of people and their work. Unintentional biases and \n        outmoded institutional structures are hindering the access for \n        women to, and advancement of women in, science and engineering.\n            (9) Workshops held to educate faculty about unintentional \n        biases have demonstrated success in raising awareness of such \n        biases.\n            (10) The Federal Government provides over 60 percent of \n        research funding at institutions of higher education, and \n        through its grant making policies has had significant influence \n        on institution of higher education policies, including policies \n        related to institutional culture and structure.\n\nSEC. 3.
