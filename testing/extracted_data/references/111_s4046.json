    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Workplace Religious Freedom Act of \n2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In enacting title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n        (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) (referred to in this Act as ``title \n        VII''), Congress--\n                    (A) recognized the widespread incidence of and harm \n                caused by religious discrimination in employment;\n                    (B) expressly intended to establish that religion \n                is a class protected from discrimination in employment, \n                as race, color, sex, and national origin are protected \n                classes; and\n                    (C) recognized that, absent undue hardship, a \n                covered employer's failure to reasonably accommodate an \n                employee's religious practice is discrimination within \n                the meaning of that title.\n            (2) Eradicating religious discrimination in employment is \n        essential to reach the goal of full equal employment \n        opportunity in the United States.\n            (3) In Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63 \n        (1977), the Supreme Court held that an employer could deny an \n        employee's request for religious accommodation based on any \n        burden greater than a de minimus burden on the employer, and \n        thus narrowed the scope of protection of title VII against \n        religious discrimination in employment, contrary to the intent \n        of Congress.\n            (4) As a consequence of the Hardison decision and resulting \n        appellate and trial court decisions, discrimination against \n        employees on the basis of religion in employment continues to \n        be an unfortunate and unacceptable reality.\n            (5) Federal, State, and local government, and private \n        employers have a history and have established a continuing \n        pattern of discrimination in unreasonably denying religious \n        accommodations in employment, including in the areas of garb, \n        grooming, and scheduling.\n            (6) Although this Act addresses requests for accommodation \n        with respect to garb, grooming, and scheduling due to \n        employees' religious practices, enactment of this Act does not \n        represent a determination that other religious accommodation \n        requests do not deserve similar attention or future resolution \n        by Congress.\n            (7) The Supreme Court has held in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, \n        427 U.S. 445 (1976) that Congress has clearly authorized \n        Federal courts to award monetary damages in favor of a private \n        individual against a State government found in violation of \n        title VII, and this holding is supported by Quern v. Jordan, \n        440 U.S. 332 (1979).\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to address the history and widespread pattern of \n        discrimination by private sector employers and Federal, State, \n        and local government employers in unreasonably denying \n        religious accommodations in employment, specifically in the \n        areas of garb, grooming, and scheduling;\n            (2) to provide a comprehensive Federal prohibition of \n        employment discrimination on the basis of religion, including \n        that denial of accommodations, specifically in the areas of \n        garb, grooming, and scheduling;\n            (3) to confirm Congress' clear and continuing intention to \n        abrogate States' 11th amendment immunity from claims made under \n        title VII; and\n            (4) to invoke congressional powers to prohibit employment \n        discrimination, including the powers to enforce the 14th \n        amendment, and to regulate interstate commerce pursuant to \n        section 8 of article I of the Constitution, in order to \n        prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, including \n        unreasonable denial of religious accommodations, specifically \n        in the areas of garb, grooming, and scheduling.\n\nSEC. 4.
