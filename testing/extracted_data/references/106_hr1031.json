FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The White Bluffs, located on the Columbia River from \n        river mile 354 to river mile 376 in the State of Washington, \n        are a scenic example of pristine landscapes that should be \n        protected.\n            (2) The White Bluffs have been eroding at a more rapid rate \n        since the construction of the Columbia Basin Project by the \n        Bureau of Reclamation.\n            (3) Federal and local officials have identified the erosive \n        action of the Columbia River and return flows associated with \n        the Columbia Basin Project as two of the factors contributing \n        to the movement of ancient landslide masses in the White Bluffs \n        area.\n            (4) The movement of large landslide masses of the White \n        Bluffs may change the course of the Columbia River to some \n        degree, damaging the opposite south shore and degrading the \n        quality of Columbia River water by slide debris and aggradation \n        of the Columbia River channel downstream, both of which could \n        endanger salmon spawning grounds of the Hanford Reach.\n            (5) The largest, closest source of Columbia Basin Project \n        water to the White Bluffs is the product of two canal \n        wasteways.\n            (6) These two canal wasteways can be modified to reduce the \n        standing water above the White Bluffs.\n\nSEC. 3.
