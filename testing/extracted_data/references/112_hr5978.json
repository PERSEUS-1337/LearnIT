FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress has enacted laws to eradicate workplace \n        discrimination and to secure equal employment opportunities for \n        all Americans, as noted in Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. \n        324 (1977) and McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n        (1973) (stating that civil rights laws are meant ``to assure \n        equality of employment opportunities and to eliminate . . . \n        discriminatory practices and devices'' in the workplace).\n            (2) Workplace discrimination laws prohibit subjective \n        employment practices that operate to deny equal employment \n        opportunities to employees, as explained in Watson v. Fort \n        Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977 (1988), which stated that \n        personnel decisions ``based on the exercise of personal \n        judgment or the application of inherently subjective criteria'' \n        are unlawful when the personnel decisions have the effect of \n        discriminating on grounds prohibited by law.\n            (3) Class actions often have been the most effective means \n        to enforce employment discrimination laws, as explained in East \n        Texas Motor Freight System Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395 \n        (1977) (``[S]uits alleging . . . discrimination are often by \n        their very nature class suits, involving classwide wrongs'' \n        where ``[c]ommon questions of law or fact are typically \n        present.'') and in Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156 \n        (1974) (``Economic reality dictates that [claims of relatively \n        small value] proceed as a class action or not at all.'').\n            (4) Historically, a class action alleging employment \n        discrimination could be maintained if the class was united by a \n        common issue of law or fact. As a leading legal treatise, \n        William B. Rubenstein, 1 Newberg on Class Actions Sec. 3:20 \n        (5th ed. 2011), explained, ``this requirement [was] easily met \n        in most cases''. As another leading treatise, Charles A. Wright \n        et al., 7A Federal Practice and Procedure, Wright and Miller \n        Sec. 1763 (3rd ed. 2005), explained, this requirement had been \n        given ``permissive application''.\n            (5) However, the Supreme Court recently made it more \n        difficult for victims of discrimination to vindicate claims for \n        their rights. In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. \n        2541 (2011), the Court required ``convincing proof of a \n        companywide discriminatory pay and promotion policy'' as a \n        prerequisite to class certification. In a dissent in that case, \n        Justice Ginsberg wrote that the Court's decision ``disqualifies \n        the class at the starting gate''.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to restore employees' \nability to challenge, as a group, discriminatory employment practices, \nincluding subjective employment practices.\n\nSEC. 3.
