PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to authorize assistance for political \nfreedom and economic development, particularly through private sector \ndevelopment, in the Greater Middle East and Central Asia, including \ncontributions to and participation in 3 new entities: a Trust for \nDemocracy, a Development Foundation, and a Development Bank.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, signaled a \n        turning point in United States foreign policy.\n            (2) Al Qaeda and affiliated groups have established a \n        terrorist network with linkages in Afghanistan, Pakistan, \n        throughout the Greater Middle East and Central Asia, and around \n        the world.\n            (3) The war on terrorism requires that the United States \n        consider the Greater Middle East and Central Asia as a \n        strategic region with its own political, economic, and security \n        dynamics.\n            (4) While rich in cultural, geographic, and language \n        diversity, the Greater Middle East and Central Asia face common \n        impediments to economic development and political freedom.\n            (5) Although poverty and economic underdevelopment do not \n        alone cause terrorism, the expansion of economic growth, free \n        trade, and private sector development can contribute to an \n        environment that undercuts radical political tendencies that \n        give rise to terrorism.\n            (6) Given the relationship between economic and political \n        development and winning the global war on terror, America's \n        support for freedom in the Greater Middle East and Central Asia \n        must be matched with expanded and new programs of partnership \n        with the people and governments of the region to promote good \n        governance, political freedom, private sector development, and \n        more open economies.\n            (7) The United States and other donors should support those \n        citizens of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia who share \n        our desire to undertake reforms that result in more open \n        political and economic systems.\n            (8) Turkey, which should be supported in its aspirations \n        for membership in the European Union, plays a pivotal and \n        unique role in efforts to bring economic development and \n        stability to the Greater Middle East and Central Asia.\n            (9) The President should seek new mechanisms to work \n        together with European and other nations, as well as with the \n        countries of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia to \n        promote political and economic development in the Greater \n        Middle East and Central Asia.\n            (10) Because the dynamics of the Greater Middle East and \n        Central Asia have a serious impact on global security, the \n        North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should now shift its \n        strategic focus to the region, including expanded roles in \n        Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Mediterranean.\n\nSEC. 4.
