In preparing such report, the \n        Secretary shall give special consideration to the needs of \n        rural, critical access, sole community, and Medicare dependent \n        hospitals, and disproportionate share hospitals and other \n        hospitals with a disproportionate share of immune compromised \n        patients.\n    (c) Best Practices.--In addition to any other best practices \ncontained in the regulations promulgated under subsection (a), all \nhospitals shall comply with the following:\n            (1) A hospital shall require contact (barrier) precautions, \n        as determined by the Secretary, be taken when treating patients \n        who test positive for MRSA colonization (as defined by the \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n            (2) Where possible, a hospital will isolate, with the same \n        staffing ratio per bed as in the non-isolated beds of the \n        hospital, or cohort patients colonized or infected with MRSA, \n        control and monitor the movements of such patients within the \n        hospital, and take whatever steps are needed to stop the \n        transmission of MRSA bacteria to patients who did not come into \n        the hospital infected or colonized with such bacteria. The \n        Secretary may suspend the application of this paragraph in the \n        case of an emergency.\n            (3) All patients tested for MRSA shall be informed of the \n        results and such results shall be noted in the patient's \n        medical records.\n            (4) Patients being discharged from intensive care units \n        shall be tested again for MRSA, and those patients testing \n        positive will be informed of their status, and that status will \n        be noted in the patient's medical records in case of \n        readmittance to a hospital.\n            (5) A hospital shall educate their staff concerning modes \n        of transmission of MRSA, use of protective equipment, \n        disinfection policies and procedures, and other preventive \n        measures.\n    (d) Reporting.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than January 1, 2009, all \n        hospitals shall, using the National Healthcare Safety Network \n        of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, report the \n        number of cases of hospital-acquired MRSA and other resistant \n        infection rates that occur in the hospital facility. The \n        Secretary shall develop a process for the risk adjustment of \n        such reports by hospitals.\n            (2) Publication.--The Secretary shall develop a system for \n        the publication of hospital-specific MRSA and other infection \n        rates.\n    (e) Non-Hospital Medicare Providers.--\n            (1) MRSA infection reporting.--The Secretary, using the \n        MRSA and other infection information identified under section \n        (b) and such other billing and coding information as necessary, \n        shall develop a system of identifying infected transferred \n        patients. The Secretary shall define by regulation the term \n        infected transferred patient, and such term shall include any \n        patient who, after discharge from, or treatment at, a non-\n        hospital Medicare provider (including, but not limited to, a \n        skilled nursing facility, end stage renal disease program, or \n        ambulatory surgical center), is admitted directly (or within 5 \n        days of such discharge or treatment) to the hospital with MRSA \n        (or other infection). The Secretary shall establish a system to \n        promptly inform any facility that has transferred an infected \n        patient. Unless such facility can provide a reasonable \n        explanation that the infection was not acquired in that \n        facility, the facility shall submit to the Secretary a MRSA \n        infection action plan to reduce such infections.\n            (2) Assistance.--The Secretary shall promulgate regulations \n        to develop a program to provide technical assistance and \n        educational materials to non-hospital Medicare providers \n        described in paragraph (1) in order to assist in preventing \n        subsequent MRSA infections.\n            (3) Publication of certain information.--If a non-hospital \n        Medicare provider identified in a report submitted under \n        paragraph (1) fails to take steps, as described in the action \n        plan submitted under such paragraph, to combat MRSA infections, \n        the Secretary shall publish the name of the provider and the \n        number of MRSA infections from such provider in the previous \n        year.\n    (f) Assistance.--\n            (1) In general.--To provide for the rapid implementation of \n        MRSA screening programs and initiatives through the \n        installation of certified MRSA screening equipment and the \n        provision of necessary support services, a hospital may submit \n        an application to the Secretary for a 1-year increase in the \n        amount of the capital-related costs payment made to the \n        hospital under the prospective payment system under section \n        1886(g) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(g)). The \n        Secretary shall approve all requests that the Secretary \n        determines are reasonable and necessary.\n            (2) Repayment.--A hospital that receives an increase under \n        paragraph (1) shall, not later than 4 years after the date of \n        receipt of such increase, reimburse the Secretary for the costs \n        of such increase. Such costs shall include the accrual of \n        interest at the rate payable for Federal Treasury notes. Such \n        reimbursement may be in the form of reduced capital-related \n        costs payments to the hospital under the system described in \n        paragraph (1) for the years following the year in which the \n        increase was received.\n            (3) Certification system.--Not later than 6 months after \n        the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n        promulgate regulations for the development of a system to \n        certify appropriate MRSA screening and support services for \n        purposes of this subsection."
