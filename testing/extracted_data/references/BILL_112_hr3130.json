FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The presence of a heartbeat in a woman's unborn child \n        will be a material consideration to many women contemplating \n        abortion.\n            (2) The presence of a heartbeat in a woman's unborn child \n        is a developmental fact that illustrates to the woman that her \n        baby is already alive.\n            (3) On about the 21st or 22nd day after fertilization \n        (which is about 5 weeks from the first day of the last \n        menstrual period) the heart of an unborn child begins to beat.\n            (4) The heartbeat of an unborn child can be visually \n        detected at an early stage of pregnancy using an ultrasound \n        machine, typically, at 4 to 4.5 weeks after fertilization (6 to \n        6.5 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period) on \n        transvaginal ultrasound, and at 5.5 to 6 weeks after \n        fertilization (7.5 to 8 weeks from the first day of the last \n        menstrual period) on transabdominal ultrasound.\n            (5) The heartbeat of an unborn child can be made audible at \n        later stages, including by using a handheld Doppler fetal \n        monitor.\n            (6) Less than five percent of all natural pregnancies end \n        in spontaneous miscarriage after detection of cardiac activity. \n        A fetal heartbeat is therefore a key medical indicator that an \n        unborn child is likely to achieve the capacity for live birth.\n            (7) The observation of a heartbeat in a woman's unborn \n        child, when a heartbeat has been detected, is an important \n        component of full informed consent.\n            (8) Ensuring full informed consent for an abortion is \n        imperative, because of the profound physical and psychological \n        risks of an abortion. As the Supreme Court has observed, \n        ``[t]he medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of \n        an abortion are serious and can be lasting.'' H.L. v. Matheson, \n        450 U.S. 398, 411 (1981). The woman's decision whether to abort \n        ``is an important, and often a stressful one, and it is \n        desirable and imperative that it be made with full knowledge of \n        its nature and consequences.'' Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, \n        428 U.S. 52, 67 (1976). ``Whether to have an abortion requires \n        a difficult and painful moral decision,'' in which ``some women \n        come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once \n        created and sustained,'' and ``[s]evere depression and loss of \n        esteem can follow . . . The State has an interest in ensuring \n        so grave a choice is well informed. It is self-evident that a \n        mother who comes to regret her choice to abort must struggle \n        with grief more anguished and sorrow more profound when she \n        learns, only after the event, what she once did not know . . \n        .'' Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 159-160 (2007).\n            (9) Requiring providers to give a woman an opportunity to \n        observe her unborn child's heartbeat is constitutionally \n        permissible, and the ultrasound image of an unborn child is \n        truthful, nonmisleading information. ``In attempting to ensure \n        that a woman apprehend the full consequences of her decision, \n        the State furthers the legitimate purpose of reducing the risk \n        that a woman may elect an abortion, only to discover later, \n        with devastating psychological consequences, that her decision \n        was not fully informed. If the information the State requires \n        to be made available to the woman is truthful and not \n        misleading, the requirement may be permissible.'' (Opinion of \n        O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 \n        U.S. 833, 882 (1992)).\n            (10) Further, recent research, taking into account 22 \n        studies with control groups and more than 877,000 women over a \n        14-year period, finds that women who have had an abortion have \n        an 81 percent increased risk for mental health problems and 10 \n        percent of the mental health problems of women who have had an \n        abortion are directly attributed to abortion.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    The Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n\n                    ``TITLE XXXIV--INFORMED CONSENT\n\n``SEC. 3401.
