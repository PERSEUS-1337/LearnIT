FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1)(A) new transportation technologies are needed to \n        develop new modes of transportation that are environmentally \n        sound and energy efficient;\n            (B) very high- and super-speed magnetic levitation \n        (referred to in this section as ``MAGLEV'') is the technology \n        that appears to best meet the needs of the traveling public and \n        high-value freight shippers in the 40- to 600-mile distance \n        corridors;\n            (C) MAGLEV is energy efficient, consuming less energy per \n        passenger mile at any given speed than other forms of \n        transportation and reducing dependence on imported oil;\n            (D) since properly designed MAGLEV is virtually impossible \n        to derail, MAGLEV is safe and will prevent accidents and loss \n        of life, and will significantly reduce costs attributable to \n        accidents occurring on highways, freight rail lines, intercity \n        rail passenger service lines, commuter rail lines, and short \n        haul airline routes of the United States;\n            (E) MAGLEV is virtually unaffected by weather conditions, \n        which annually result in delays in other transportation modes \n        employed by freight and passenger carriers; and\n            (F) MAGLEV makes extensive use of existing highway rights-\n        of-way and consumes less land for its guideway infrastructure \n        than a comparable roadway;\n            (2) the commercial feasibility study of high-speed ground \n        transportation conducted under section 1036 of the Intermodal \n        Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-\n        240; 105 Stat. 1978)--\n                    (A) demonstrates that MAGLEV systems have the \n                potential for a public and private partnership under \n                which the private sector could operate a system without \n                operating subsidies and the total benefits of the \n                system would exceed the total costs; and\n                    (B) demonstrates that adding links or corridors to \n                the basic MAGLEV system would enhance the basic system, \n                leading to establishment of high-volume high-speed \n                ground transportation networks; and\n            (3) the study required by section 359(d) of the National \n        Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-59; 109 \n        Stat. 627) further demonstrates the potential for MAGLEV \n        systems.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to establish a \nMAGLEV transportation technology system operating along Federal-aid \nhighway and other rights-of-way as part of a national transportation \nsystem of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
