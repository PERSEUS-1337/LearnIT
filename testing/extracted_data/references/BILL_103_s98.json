FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) growing numbers of children live in an environment of \n        social and economic conditions that greatly increase the risk \n        of academic failure when such children become students;\n            (2) more than 20 percent of the Nation's children live in \n        poverty while at the same time the Nation's infrastructure of \n        social support for such children has greatly eroded, for \n        example, 40 percent of eligible children do not receive free or \n        reduced price lunches or benefit from food stamps, 25 percent \n        of such children are not covered by health insurance, and only \n        20 percent of such children are accommodated in public housing;\n            (3) many at-risk students suffer the effects of inadequate \n        nutrition and health care, overcrowded and unsafe living \n        conditions and homelessness, family and gang violence, \n        substance abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse, involuntary \n        migration, and limited English proficiency that often create \n        severe barriers to learning the knowledge and skills needed to \n        become literate, independent, and productive citizens;\n            (4) almost half of all children and youth live in a single \n        parent family for some period of their lives, resulting in \n        greatly reduced parental involvement in their education;\n            (5) high proportions of disadvantaged and minority children \n        live with never married mothers or teenage mothers who have \n        extremely limited resources available for early childhood \n        development and education;\n            (6) large numbers of children and youth are recent \n        immigrants or children of recent immigrants with limited \n        English proficiency and significant unmet educational needs;\n            (7) services for at-risk students are fragmented, \n        expensive, overregulated, often ineffective and duplicative, \n        and focused on narrow problems and not the needs of the whole \n        child and family;\n            (8) school personnel and other support service providers \n        often lack knowledge of and access to available services for \n        at-risk students and their family in the community, are \n        constrained by bureaucratic obstacles from providing the \n        services most needed, and have few resources or incentives to \n        coordinate services;\n            (9) service providers for at-risk students such as \n        teachers, social workers, health care givers, juvenile justice \n        workers and others are trained in separate institutions, \n        practice in separate agencies, and pursue separate professional \n        activities that provide little support for coordination and \n        integration of services;\n            (10) coordination and integration of services for at-risk \n        students emphasizing prevention and early intervention offers a \n        great opportunity to break the cycle of poverty that leads to \n        academic failure, teenage parenthood, leaving school, low skill \n        levels, unemployment, and low income; and\n            (11) coordination of services is more cost effective for \n        schools and support agencies because it reduces duplication, \n        improves quality of services, and substitutes prevention for \n        expensive crisis intervention.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--It is the purpose of this Act to make \ndemonstration grants to eligible entities to improve the educational \nperformance of at-risk students by--\n            (1) removing barriers to such student's learning;\n            (2) coordinating and enhancing the effectiveness of \n        educational support services;\n            (3) replicating and disseminating programs of high quality \n        coordinated support services;\n            (4) increasing parental educational involvement;\n            (5) improving the capacity of school and support services \n        personnel to collaborate educational services;\n            (6) integrating services, regulations, data bases, \n        eligibility procedures and funding sources whenever possible; \n        and\n            (7) focusing school and community resources on prevention \n        and early intervention strategies to address student needs \n        holistically.\n    (b) Additional Purposes.--It is also the purpose of this Act to \nfoster planning, coordination, and collaboration among local, county, \nState, and Federal educational and other student support service \nagencies and levels of government, nonprofit organizations, and the \nprivate sector to improve the educational performance of at-risk \nstudents by--\n            (1) identifying and removing unnecessary regulations, \n        duplication of services, and obstacles to coordination;\n            (2) improving communication and information exchange;\n            (3) creating joint funding pools or resource banks;\n            (4) providing cross-training of agency personnel; and\n            (5) increasing parental and community involvement in \n        education.\n\nSEC. 4.
