FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Consumers, businesses, and other participants engaged \n        in electronic commerce may be subject to multiple, confusing, \n        and burdensome taxation because of inconsistent rules among \n        thousands of State and local jurisdictions and disparate \n        treatment of digital goods and digital services.\n            (2) A consistent framework for taxation is needed that will \n        not impede electronic commerce and the sale of digital goods \n        and digital services, by preventing multiple taxation, and \n        providing greater certainty and simplicity.\n            (3) Neutrality should guide tax policy and administration \n        in this area. Transactions involving similar types of goods and \n        services should be taxed fairly, regardless of the method and \n        means of distribution, whether through electronic transfer or \n        through other channels of commerce. New or different taxes on \n        electronic transactions should be barred.\n            (4) To ensure neutrality and avoid multiple taxation, \n        certain rules should be adapted to reflect the unique nature of \n        electronic commerce and how digital goods and digital services \n        are provided.\n            (5) To recognize the critical role that online health, \n        energy management, and education services will play in our \n        economy, these services should be exempt from all State and \n        local taxes.\n\nSEC. 3. MULTIPLE AND DISCRIMINATORY TAXES PROHIBITED.\n\n    No State or local jurisdiction shall impose multiple or \ndiscriminatory taxes on or with respect to the sale or use of digital \ngoods or digital services.\n\nSEC. 4.

This limitation shall be \n        deemed satisfied if sourcing is determined by a seller pursuant \n        to State sourcing rules adopted pursuant to the Streamlined \n        Sales and Use Tax Agreement.\n            (2) Tax address.--The customer's tax address shall be--\n                    (A) with respect to digital goods or digital \n                services that are sold to a customer by a provider of \n                mobile telecommunications service that is subject to \n                being sourced under section 117 of title 4 of the \n                United States Code, and furnished to the customer in \n                conjunction with such provider's mobile \n                telecommunications service, the customer's place of \n                primary use, as defined in section 124 of title 4 of \n                the United States Code;\n                    (B) if subparagraph (A) does not apply, and if the \n                digital good or digital service is received by the \n                customer at a business location of the seller, such \n                business location;\n                    (C) if neither subparagraph (A) nor subparagraph \n                (B) applies, and if the location where the digital good \n                or digital service is received by the customer is known \n                to the seller, such location;\n                    (D) if none of subparagraphs (A) through (C) \n                applies, the customer's address that is either known to \n                the seller or, if not known, obtained by the seller \n                during the consummation of the transaction, including \n                the address of the customer's payment instrument if no \n                other address is available;\n                    (E) if an address is neither known nor obtained as \n                provided in subparagraph (D), the address of the seller \n                from which the digital good or digital service was \n                sold; and\n                    (F) notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) through (E), \n                for digital goods or digital services that are \n                delivered to a person other than the customer, \n                including advertising services, the delivery location \n                if known or, otherwise, the customer's address \n                determined under subparagraph (D) or (E).\n    (c) Limit on Expansive Interpretation.--No tax on or with respect \nto the sale or use of tangible personal property, telecommunications \nservice, Internet access service, or audio or video programming service \nmay be construed by any regulation, administrative ruling, or \notherwise, to be imposed on or with respect to the sale or use of a \ndigital good or a digital service.

For purposes of this definition, purchase for \n        resale includes purchase of a digital good or digital service \n        for further commercial broadcast, rebroadcast, transmission, \n        retransmission, licensing, relicensing, reproduction, copying, \n        distribution, redistribution, or exhibition of the digital good \n        or digital service, in whole or in part, to another person.\n            (2) Delivered or transferred electronically.--The term \n        ``delivered or transferred electronically'' means delivered or \n        transferred to the customer by means other than tangible \n        storage media. It is not necessary that the product or service \n        be physically transferred to the customer, provided that the \n        customer may access or remotely use the product or service.\n            (3) Digital good and digital service.--The term ``digital \n        good'' means any good or product that is delivered or \n        transferred electronically to the customer, including software, \n        information maintained in digital format, digital audio-visual \n        works, digital audio works, and digital books; and the term \n        ``digital service'' means any service that is delivered or \n        transferred electronically to the customer, including the \n        provision of remote access to or use of a digital good, but the \n        term ``digital service'' does not include telecommunications \n        service, Internet access service, or audio or video programming \n        service. For purposes of this section, ``audio or video \n        programming'' means programming provided by, or generally \n        considered comparable to programming provided by, a radio or \n        television broadcast station. ``Video programming'' shall not \n        include interactive on-demand services, pay-per-view services, \n        or services generally considered comparable to such services \n        regardless of the technology used to provide such services.\n            (4) Digital education service.--The term ``digital \n        education service'' means a primary, secondary, undergraduate, \n        postgraduate, or professional educational service delivered or \n        transferred electronically to a practitioner or student.\n            (5) Digital energy management service.--The term ``digital \n        energy management service'' means a service that utilizes \n        digital information to manage a customer's energy use, to allow \n        a customer to respond to energy market information or \n        circumstances, or to identify customer demand with particular \n        energy supply.\n            (6) Digital medical service.--The term ``digital medical \n        service'' means a health care, health information, or health \n        education service that is delivered or transferred \n        electronically to a practitioner, researcher, or patient.\n            (7) Digital code.--The term ``digital code'' means a code \n        that conveys to a customer only the right to obtain a digital \n        good or digital service. A digital code may be obtained by any \n        means, including by email or by tangible means regardless of \n        its designation as ``song code'', ``video code'', or ``book \n        code''. The tax treatment of the sale or use of a digital code \n        shall be the same as the tax treatment of the digital good or \n        digital service to which the digital code relates. The sale of \n        the digital code shall be considered the sale transaction for \n        purposes of this Act.\n            (8) Discriminatory tax.--The term ``discriminatory tax'' \n        means any tax imposed by a State or local jurisdiction--\n                    (A) on or with respect to the sale or use of any \n                digital good or digital service at a higher rate than \n                is generally imposed on or with respect to the sale or \n                use of tangible personal property or of similar \n                services that are not delivered or transferred \n                electronically;\n                    (B) on or with respect to any seller of digital \n                goods or digital services at a higher rate or by \n                incorporating a broader tax base than is generally \n                imposed on or with respect to sellers in transactions \n                involving tangible personal property or involving \n                similar services that are not delivered or transferred \n                electronically. This provision applies only to the \n                extent that the higher rate or broader tax base is \n                attributable to the fact that such person sells digital \n                goods or digital services; or\n                    (C) that is required to be collected with respect \n                to the sale or use of digital goods or digital services \n                by different sellers or under other terms that are \n                disadvantageous to those applied in taxing the sale or \n                use of tangible personal property or of similar \n                services that are not delivered or transferred \n                electronically.\n        For purposes of this subsection, all taxes, tax rates, \n        exemptions, deductions, credits, incentives, exclusions, and \n        other similar factors shall be taken into account in \n        determining whether a tax is a discriminatory tax.\n            (9) Generally imposed.--A tax shall not be considered \n        ``generally imposed'' if it is imposed only on specific \n        services, specific industries or business segments, or specific \n        types of property.\n            (10) Multiple tax.--The term ``multiple tax'' means any tax \n        with respect to which no credit is given for comparable taxes \n        paid to other States or local jurisdictions on the same \n        transaction. Taxes imposed by physically overlapping State or \n        local jurisdictions shall not be considered to be multiple \n        taxes by reason of being applied within the overlapping area.\n            (11) Sale and purchase.--The terms ``sale'' and \n        ``purchase'', and all variations thereof, shall include \n        ``lease'', ``rent'', and ``license'', and corresponding \n        variations thereof.\n            (12) Seller.--The term ``seller'' means a person making \n        sales of tangible personal property, digital goods, digital \n        services, or other services.\n            (13) State or local jurisdiction.--The term ``State or \n        local jurisdiction'' means any of the several States, the \n        District of Columbia, any territory or possession of the United \n        States, a political subdivision of any State, territory, or \n        possession, or any governmental entity or person acting on \n        behalf of such State, territory, possession, or subdivision and \n        with the authority to assess, impose, levy, or collect taxes.\n            (14) Tax.--The term ``tax'' means any charge imposed by any \n        governmental entity for the purpose of generating revenues for \n        governmental purposes, including any tax, charge, or fee levied \n        by a taxing jurisdiction as a fixed charge for each customer or \n        measured by gross amounts charged to customers, regardless of \n        whether such tax, charge, or fee is imposed on the vendor or \n        customer and regardless of the terminology used to describe the \n        tax, charge, or fee. The term ``tax'' does not include a tax on \n        or measured by net income or an ad valorem tax.\n\nSEC. 7. FEDERAL JURISDICTION.\n\n    Notwithstanding section 1341 of title 28 of the United States Code, \nand without regard to the amount in controversy or citizenship of the \nparties, a district court of the United States has jurisdiction, \nconcurrent with other jurisdiction of courts of the United States and \nthe States, to prevent a violation of this Act.\n\nSEC. 8.
