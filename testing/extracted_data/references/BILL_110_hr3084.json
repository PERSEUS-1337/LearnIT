FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Skin cancer is a growing epidemic in the United States \n        with more than 1,000,000 new cases diagnosed each year.\n            (2) About 10,000 Americans die each year from skin cancer.\n            (3) The most deadly form of skin cancer, melanoma, has \n        tripled among Caucasians since 1980.\n            (4) One in 5 Americans and one in 3 Caucasians will develop \n        skin cancer in the course of a lifetime.\n            (5) A person's risk for skin cancer doubles if he or she \n        has had 5 or more sunburns.\n            (6) More than 90 percent of all skin cancers are caused by \n        sun exposure, yet fewer than 33 percent of adults, adolescents, \n        and children routinely use sun protection.\n            (7) Most skin cancer is caused by prolonged exposure to the \n        ultraviolet rays from the sun. This invisible radiation is \n        classified as UVA radiation and UVB radiation.\n            (8) UVB radiation is the chief cause of sunburn and skin \n        cancer.\n            (9) UVA radiation is more constant, year-round, and \n        penetrates the skin more deeply, causing both premature aging \n        and skin cancer.\n            (10) Current United States sunscreen standards set by the \n        Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require protection from UVB \n        radiation but not UVA radiation.\n            (11) The current United States sunscreen standards provide \n        a false sense of security to Americans, since their sunscreen \n        is protecting successfully against sunburn, but not adequately \n        against other forms of skin damage, including skin cancers. \n        Consumers may wrongly believe that their sunscreen is \n        sufficiently protecting them and therefore stay in the sun \n        longer.\n\nSEC. 3. BROAD-SPECTRUM SUNSCREEN STANDARD.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct (21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) in section 502, by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(y) If it is a drug that is a sunscreen product and its labeling \nis in violation of section 566 .''; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 565 the following:\n\n``SEC. 566. BROAD-SPECTRUM SUNSCREEN STANDARD.\n\n    ``(a) Labeling.--The labeling of a drug that is a sunscreen product \nand fails to meet the standard adopted under subsection (b)(1) shall \nnot--\n            ``(1) describe the product using the term `broad-spectrum' \n        (or any variant of such term); or\n            ``(2) include the symbol described in subsection (b)(2).\n    ``(b) Standard; Symbol.--The Secretary shall--\n            ``(1) adopt a standard for broad-spectrum protection in \n        sunscreen products in order to better protect Americans from \n        skin cancer and premature aging; and\n            ``(2) adopt an easily recognized symbol for inclusion in \n        the labeling of sunscreen products meeting such standard.\n    ``(c) Minimum Requirements.--\n            ``(1) Minimum requirements.--In establishing the standard \n        under subsection (b)(1), the Secretary shall require--\n                    ``(A) a minimum ratio 1 to 3 of UVA protection \n                factor (UVA-PF) to sun protection factor (SPF);\n                    ``(B) a critical wavelength of 370 nanometers, as \n                obtained in application of the critical wavelength \n                testing method;\n                    ``(C) a minimum level of UVB radiation protection \n                of sun protection factor 6 as obtained in application \n                of the International Sun Protection Factor Test Methods \n                (2006) or an equivalent degree of protection obtained \n                with any in vitro method; and\n                    ``(D) truth in labeling requirements such that--\n                            ``(i) claims of broad-spectrum protection \n                        from ultraviolet radiation can only be made in \n                        cases where the product meets the requirements \n                        established under this section; and\n                            ``(ii) labels claiming broad-spectrum \n                        protection include the symbol described in \n                        subsection (b)(2) only if the sunscreen product \n                        meets the standard adopted under subsection \n                        (b)(1).\n            ``(2) Measurement of protection levels.--The protection \n        factors described in paragraph (1) shall be measured using \n        standardized, reproducible testing methods that take photo-\n        degradation into account.
