    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Existing law requires licensed pest control operators to provide to tenants written notification that includes the pest to be targeted, the pesticide to be used, the frequency of its use, and a health and safety statement prior to a pesticide application.\n(b) Landlords or authorized agents may apply pesticides without using the services of a licensed pest control operator. There is no requirement for landlords or authorized agents to notify tenants when pesticides are applied to their units or common areas.\n(c) It is therefore the intent of this bill to ensure that when pesticides are about to be applied to rental property by the landlord or an authorized agent, rather than by a licensed pest control operator, potentially affected tenants are provided with substantially the same written notification that they would have received under existing law had the pesticides been applied by a pest control operator.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 1940.8.5 is added to the Civil Code, to read:\n1940.8.5.\n(a) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n(1) \u201cAdjacent dwelling unit\u201d means a dwelling unit that is directly beside, above, or below a particular dwelling unit.\n(2) \u201cAuthorized agent\u201d means an individual, organization, or other entity that has entered into an agreement with a landlord to act on the landlord\u2019s behalf in relation to the management of a residential rental property.\n(3) \u201cBroadcast application\u201d means spreading pesticide over an area greater than two square feet.\n(4) \u201cElectronic delivery\u201d means delivery of a document by electronic means to the electronic address at or through which a tenant, landlord, or authorized agent has authorized electronic delivery.\n(5) \u201cLandlord\u201d means an owner of residential rental property.\n(6) \u201cPest\u201d means a living organism that causes damage to property or economic loss, or transmits or produces diseases.\n(7) \u201cPesticide\u201d means any substance, or mixture of substances, that is intended to be used for controlling, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest or organism, excluding antimicrobial pesticides as defined by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. Sec. 136(mm)).\n(8) \u201cLicensed pest control operator\u201d means anyone licensed by the state to apply pesticides.\n(b) (1) A landlord or authorized agent that applies any pesticide to a dwelling unit without a licensed pest control operator shall provide a tenant of that dwelling unit and, if making broadcast applications, or using total release foggers or aerosol sprays, any tenant in an adjacent dwelling unit that could reasonably be impacted by the pesticide use with written notice that contains the following statements and information using words with common and everyday meaning:\n(A) The pest or pests to be controlled.\n(B) The name and brand of the pesticide product proposed to be used.\n(C) \u201cState law requires that you be given the following information:\n\n\nCAUTION \u2013 PESTICIDES ARE TOXIC CHEMICALS. The California Department of Pesticide Regulation and the United States Environmental Protection Agency allow the unlicensed use of certain pesticides based on existing scientific evidence that there are no appreciable risks if proper use conditions are followed or that the risks are outweighed by the benefits. The degree of risk depends upon the degree of exposure, so exposure should be minimized.\nIf within 24 hours following application of a pesticide, a person experiences symptoms similar to common seasonal illness comparable to influenza, the person should contact a physician, appropriate licensed health care provider, or the California Poison Control System (1-800-222-1222).\nFor further information, contact any of the following: for Health Questions \u2013 the County Health Department (telephone number) and for Regulatory Information \u2013 the Department of Pesticide Regulation (916-324-4100).\u201d\n\n\n(D) The approximate date, time, and frequency with which the pesticide will be applied.\n(E) The following notification:\n\u201cThe approximate date, time, and frequency of this pesticide application is subject to change.\u201d\n(2) At least 24 hours prior to application of the pesticide to the dwelling unit, the landlord or authorized agent shall provide the notice to the tenant of the dwelling unit, as well as any tenants in adjacent units that are required to be notified pursuant to paragraph (1), in at least one of the following ways:\n(A) First-class mail.\n(B) Personal delivery to the tenant, someone of suitable age and discretion at the premises, or under the usual entry door of the premises.\n(C) Electronic delivery, if an electronic mailing address has been provided by the tenant.\n(D) Posting a written notice in a conspicuous place at the unit entry in a manner in which a reasonable person would discover the notice.\n(3) (A) Upon receipt of written notification, the tenant may agree in writing, or if notification was electronically delivered, the tenant may agree through electronic delivery, to allow the landlord or authorized agent to apply a pesticide immediately or at an agreed upon time.\n(B) (i) Prior to receipt of written notification, the tenant and the landlord or authorized agent may agree orally to an immediate pesticide application if a tenant requests that the pesticide be applied before 24-hour advance notice can be given.
