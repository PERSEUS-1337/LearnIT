FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Although the majority of our Nation's elementary and \n        secondary public schools provide high quality education for our \n        children, many schools need additional resources to implement \n        immediate assistance and reform to enable them to provide a \n        basic and safe education for their students.\n            (2) The Government Accounting Office recently found that \n        \\1/3\\ of all elementary and secondary schools in the United \n        States, serving 14,000,000 students, need extensive repair and \n        renovation.\n            (3) Recent reform of under-achieving schools in a number of \n        States and school districts demonstrates that parents, \n        teachers, school administrators, other educators, and local \n        officials, given adequate resources and expertise, can succeed \n        in dramatically improving public education and creating high \n        performance schools.\n            (4) Such reform efforts show that parental and community \n        involvement in those reforms is indispensable to the objective \n        of high quality, safe, and accountable schools.\n            (5) Despite the successes of such reforms, public schools \n        are facing tremendous challenges in educating children for the \n        21st century. The elementary and secondary school population \n        will grow by 10 percent by the year 2005, and over the next 10 \n        years, schools will need more than 2,000,000 additional \n        teachers to meet the demands of such expected enrollments.\n            (6) Almost 7 of 10 Americans support increased Federal \n        assistance to our Nation's public schools, and that support \n        crosses all boundaries, including cities, towns, and rural \n        areas.\n            (7) When Federal investment in public schools and children \n        has increased, test scores have improved, and high school \n        graduation rates and college enrollments have increased.\n            (8) The Federal Government should encourage communities \n        that demonstrate a strong commitment to restore and reform \n        their public schools.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to assist local \ncommunities that are taking the initiative--\n            (1) to overcome adverse conditions in their public schools;\n            (2) to revitalize their public schools in accordance with \n        local plans to achieve higher academic standards and safer and \n        improved learning environments; and\n            (3) to ensure that every community public school provides a \n        quality education for all students.\n\nSEC. 3.
