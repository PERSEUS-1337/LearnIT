    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1978, the Judicial Conference of the United States \n        established a procedure for creating new Federal judicial \n        districts, which is still in force. According to the \n        ``Proceedings of the Judicial Conference, September 21-22, \n        1978'', this procedure requires that 4 principal criteria be \n        taken into consideration in evaluating the establishment of a \n        new Federal judicial district: caseload, judicial \n        administration, geography, and community convenience.\n            (2) The criterion of ``caseload'' is found to include the \n        total number of Federal court cases and the number of cases per \n        Federal judge, for both criminal and civil Federal cases.\n            (3) The criterion of ``judicial administration'' is found \n        to include the backlog of pending cases in a Federal judicial \n        district, which hinders the effective resolution of pending \n        business before the court.\n            (4) The criterion of ``geography'' is found to mean the \n        accessibility of the central administration of the Federal \n        judicial district to officers of the court, parties with \n        business before the court, and other citizens living within the \n        Federal judicial district.\n            (5) The criterion of ``community convenience'' is found to \n        mean the extent to which creating a new Federal judicial \n        district will allow the court to better serve the population \n        and diverse communities of the area.\n            (6)(A) The 13 southern counties of New Jersey, consisting \n        of Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, \n        Gloucester, Hunterdon, Mercer, Monmouth, Ocean, Salem, \n        Somerset, and Warren Counties, have a substantial criminal \n        caseload which requires the creation of a separate judicial \n        district.\n            (B) 352 Federal criminal cases originated in the 13 \n        southern New Jersey counties in fiscal year 2002 and were \n        handled principally by the 4 judges of the Camden vicinage and \n        the 3 judges of the Trenton vicinage.\n            (C) In fiscal year 2002, the criminal cases originating in \n        the 13 southern New Jersey counties exceeded that of 32 of the \n        current 93 Federal judicial districts other than the District \n        of New Jersey. Only 61 of the other current Federal judicial \n        districts had more criminal cases than the southern region of \n        New Jersey.\n            (D) For example, in the Eastern District of Louisiana (12 \n        judges), 304 criminal cases were filed in fiscal year 2002. In \n        the District of Connecticut (8 judges), only 251 criminal cases \n        were filed in fiscal year 2002.\n            (7)(A) The substantial civil caseload concentrated in the \n        southern counties of New Jersey requires the creation of a \n        separate judicial district.\n            (B) Approximately 2,744 Federal civil cases originated in \n        the 13 southern New Jersey counties in fiscal year 2002 and \n        were handled principally by the 4 judges of the Camden vicinage \n        and the 3 judges of the Trenton vicinage.\n            (C) In the fiscal year 2002, the civil cases originating in \n        the 13 southern New Jersey counties exceeded that of 61 of the \n        current Federal judicial districts other than the District of \n        New Jersey. Only 32 of the other Federal judicial districts had \n        more civil cases than the southern region of New Jersey.\n            (D) For example, in the Western District of Tennessee (5 \n        judges), 1,410 civil cases were filed in fiscal year 2002. In \n        the Southern District of West Virginia (5 judges), only 1,778 \n        civil cases were filed in fiscal year 2002.\n            (8)(A) The size of the backlog of pending cases \n        concentrated in the 13 southern counties of New Jersey requires \n        the creation of a separate judicial district.\n            (B) In fiscal year 2002, the pending criminal cases \n        attributed to the 13 southern New Jersey counties exceeded that \n        of 58 of the current 93 Federal judicial districts other than \n        the District of New Jersey. Only 35 of the other current \n        Federal judicial districts had more pending criminal cases than \nthe southern region of New Jersey.\n            (C) In fiscal year 2002, the pending civil cases attributed \n        to the 13 southern New Jersey counties exceeded that of 72 of \n        the current 93 Federal judicial districts other than the \n        District of New Jersey. Only 21 of the other current Federal \n        judicial districts had more pending civil cases than the \n        southern region of New Jersey.\n            (D) The number of pending cases in the Camden vicinage of \n        New Jersey exceeds the number of cases pending before entire \n        judicial districts with similar numbers of judges, clearly \n        indicating that southern New Jersey merits a separate Federal \n        judicial district. For example, as of October 1, 2002, there \n        were 1,846 civil cases pending before the Camden vicinage. The \n        Western District of Tennessee, with 5 judges, had only 991 \n        civil cases pending in fiscal year 2002. The Western District \n        of Oklahoma, with 6 judges, had only 1,400 civil cases pending \n        during the same period. Finally, there were 250 criminal cases \n        pending before the Camden vicinage at the end of fiscal year \n        2002, while the entire Eastern District of Louisiana, with 12 \n        judges, had only 191 criminal cases pending. Also, the Western \n        District of Pennsylvania, with 10 judges, had only 275 criminal \n        cases pending at the end of fiscal year 2002.\n            (9)(A) The distance between the northern and southern \n        regions of New Jersey and the density of New Jersey's \n        population create a substantial barrier to the efficient \n        administration of justice.\n            (B) The distance from Newark, New Jersey to Camden, New \n        Jersey is more than 85 miles.\n            (C) When a new Federal court district was created in \n        Louisiana in 1971, the distance between New Orleans and Baton \n        Rouge (nearly 80 miles) was cited as a major factor in creating \n        a new district court, as travel difficulties were impeding the \n        timely administration of justice.\n            (10)(A) New Jersey's culturally and regionally diverse \n        population of over 8,000,000 citizens, widely distributed \n        across a densely populated State, is inconvenienced by having \n        only 1 judicial district.\n            (B) The District of New Jersey is the fourth most populous \n        Federal judicial district in the United States.\n            (C) The population of the 13 southern New Jersey counties \n        exceeds the population of 69 of the current 93 Federal judicial \n        districts other than the District of New Jersey. The population \n        of the 8 northern New Jersey counties (consisting of Bergen, \n        Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Sussex, and Union) \n        exceeds the population of 73 of the current 93 Federal judicial \n        districts other than the District of New Jersey.\n            (D) Of the 27 States and territories that have only a \n        single Federal judicial district (including Puerto Rico and the \n        District of Columbia), New Jersey has the highest population.\n            (E) More than a dozen States have smaller populations than \n        New Jersey, yet they have multiple Federal judicial districts, \n        including Washington, Oklahoma, Iowa, West Virginia, and \n        Missouri.\n            (11) In evaluating the creation of a new Southern District \n        of New Jersey, the Judicial Conference should seek the views of \n        the chief judge of the affected district, the judicial council \n        for the affected circuit court, and the affected United States \n        Attorney as representative of the views of the Department of \n        Justice, as required in the procedure established by the \n        ``Proceedings of the Judicial Conference, September 21-22, \n        1978''.\n\nSEC. 2.
