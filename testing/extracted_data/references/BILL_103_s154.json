difference.\n            ``(3) Baseline.--(A) For fiscal year 1994 or 1995, the \n        applicable baseline for defense outlays shall be the total \n        estimated discretionary outlays for the fiscal year multiplied \n        by the ratio of the final defense outlay cap for fiscal year \n        1993 divided by the final total discretionary cap for fiscal \n        year 1993.\n

Treasury \n        shall increase the personal exemption amount for individuals as \n        determined under section 151 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n        1986 by an amount estimated to reduce receipts in the calendar \n        year beginning during such fiscal year by an amount equal to \n        one-half of the difference (peace dividend) described in \n        subsections (a) or (b) with respect to defense outlays for that \n        fiscal year.\n    ``(d) Permitting of Peace Dividend Investment.--Legislation \naffecting receipts as a result of the requirements of section

exemption as provided in this section.\n            ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, the levels of \n        defense spending for a fiscal year shall be determined on the \n        basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget.''.\n    (b) Point of Order.--The last sentence of section 904(d) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 (as amended by the Budget Enforcement \nAct of
