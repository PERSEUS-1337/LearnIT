FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, enacted on \n        August 3, 1996, made a number of significant modifications to \n        section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (``the \n        Act''). Section 408 as amended sets forth new criteria and \n        procedures for use by the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency in assessing and reassessing the \n        acceptability of tolerances that govern the level of pesticide \n        chemical residues that may be present in or on any food that \n        enters or is present in interstate commerce or is imported into \n        the United States.\n            (2) Under section 408 of the Act as amended, the \n        Administrator must use these new criteria and procedures in \n        deciding whether new tolerances may be issued, and thus whether \n        new pesticides or new pesticide uses may be approved for use \n        under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. \n        Such section also requires that all tolerances in effect on the \n        date of the enactment of the 1996 amendment be reassessed under \n        the new criteria and procedures.\n            (3) The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 requires the \n        use of a number of important new risk assessment criteria and \n        concepts that had never previously been used by the \n        Administrator and that require the development of major \n        modifications to existing Agency practices. New regulatory \n        concepts introduced by such Act include, but are not limited \n        to, those associated with new statutory terms such as \n        ``exposures for which there is reliable information'', \n        ``aggregate exposure'', ``reasonable certainty that no harm \n        will result'', ``common mechanism of toxicity'', ``cumulative \n        effects'', ``potential pre- and post-natal toxicity'', \n        ``completeness of the data with respect to exposure and \n        toxicity'', ``significant subpopulation group'', ``additional \n        data or information [that] are reasonably required to support \n        the continuation of a tolerance'', and ``pose the greatest risk \n        to human health''. How these terms are defined and used by the \n        Administrator, singly and in combination, will greatly affect \n        the outcome of the assessments and reassessments required to be \n        conducted under the Act as amended.\n            (4) The Act as amended requires the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to revoke tolerances now in effect if the \n        Administrator finds that the sum of the exposure from all the \n        tolerances exceeds safe levels. However, the Act as amended \n        does not provide any criteria for determining which of the \n        tolerances should be revoked in such situations in order to \n        reduce the exposure sufficiently. Nor does the Act as amended \n        establish procedures for providing pesticide producers, \n        agricultural producers, food processors and distributors, and \n        non-food pesticide users the opportunity to participate in such \n        decision making before proposed rules are issued by the \n        Administrator.\n            (5) Under the revised criteria of the Act as amended, \n        entirely new categories of data regarding toxicity, metabolism, \n        cumulative effects, and dietary, drinking water, and other \n        nonoccupational exposure levels are required to allow the \n        Administrator to reach sound, accurate, valid, and \n        understandable decisions on tolerance assessments and \n        reassessments. In some areas, massive data collection efforts \n        are underway but will not yield results for another year or \n        more. In other areas, the need for new data depends on \n        decisions not yet made by the Administrator about what kinds of \n        tests should be conducted and which compounds should be the \n        subjects of these new test requirements.\n            (6) The Administrator has instituted public proceedings to \n        discuss how the new criteria of the Act as amended should be \n        interpreted and amended, what new kinds of data are needed and \n        how the new data would be used once available, how criteria can \n        be made more transparent, equitable, and understandable, how \n        the Administrator should use available authority to be \n        flexible, how to decide which tolerances should be revoked when \n        some action is decided to be necessary, and how to provide \n        needed transition periods in case some existing products or \n        product uses should be removed from the market. These \n        proceedings are not yet finished and in some cases planned \n        public proceedings have been scheduled but have not yet begun.\n            (7) Unless the Administrator implements section 408 of the \n        Act as amended carefully and wisely, decisions made under it \n        could cause great harm to American agriculture, to food \n        production, food storage and transportation, and related \n        industries, and to other business. Such decisions could reduce \n        availability of fruits and vegetables, and other foods known to \naid human health, and could also have highly disruptive and problematic \neffects on a variety of other important public and private areas such \nas public health protection against insects and other disease vectors \nand residential and business pest control. A major concern is that some \nproducts will be removed from the market that are essential in \nintegrated pest management programs or pesticide resistance management \nprograms, and that pest species will more easily develop resistance to \nthe fewer remaining products that remain available.\n            (8) The regulatory requirements under the Food Quality \n        Protection Act of 1996 could have both short and long term \n        deleterious effects on U.S. agricultural products as these \n        producers move to a free market system as envisioned by the \n        Freedom to Farm Act.\n            (9) These disruptive and harmful effects could occur \n        without necessarily bringing about any significant health \n        benefits or risk reductions. The Administrator is now engaged \n        in making decisions on tolerance assessments and reassessments \n        at the same time that the Administrator is conducting a massive \n        program of policy development and reevaluation, and while the \n        Administrator is determining what data would be needed under \n        the new criteria and policies to answer some of the new \n        questions. If these decisions on individual pesticides are \n        issued and put into effect before the new policies are in place \n        or before the needed data are available, they may be based on \n        outdated and overly stringent policies, worst-case assumptions, \n        or both. These actions may be accompanied by adverse publicity \n        that could lead to unwarranted concern and could effectively \n        destroy the marketability of products that in fact are safe.\n            (10) The Act as amended has caused a major slowing of the \n        process for approval of new pesticide chemicals, new uses of \n        pesticides already registered for other uses, and applications \n        for emergency exemptions from the need for registration. This \n        is traceable to--\n                    (A) the Agency's need to develop new criteria and \n                procedures;\n                    (B) the diversion of resources to developing such \n                criteria and procedures and to the reassessment of \n                existing tolerances and registrations;\n                    (C) the requirement that no new tolerance can be \n                issued until the Administrator determines that all \n                existing tolerances for the pesticide have been \n                reassessed and found safe; and\n                    (D) the priority choices and resource allocation \n                decisions that are either dictated by the Act as \n                amended or chosen by the Administrator as a matter of \n                discretion.\n            (11) Congressional guidance for the Administrator is needed \n        to ensure that decisions are reasonable, well supported, and \n        balanced; to avoid disruptions in agriculture, other sectors of \n        the economy, and international trade caused by prematurely \n        implemented decisions or by public misunderstanding or \n        unwarranted speculation about tentative decisions. Much of the \n        potential problem can be avoided if the Administrator uses \n        available authority to resolve policy issues, announce data \n        needs, avoid unneeded use of assumptions in lieu of data, make \n        clear the tentative and preliminary nature of findings made in \n        the short term, and provide extended implementation periods for \n        adverse decisions when appropriate.\n\nSEC. 3. SPECIAL DATA REQUIREMENTS; REQUIREMENT FOR CALLING IN \n              ADDITIONAL DATA.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 408(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a(f)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and\n            (2) by striking ``(1) Requiring submission'' and all that \n        follows through ``(A) issue a notice requiring the person'' and \n        inserting the following:\n            ``(1) Requiring submission of additional data.--\n                    ``(A) Continuation of tolerance or exemption.--If \n                the Administrator determines that additional data or \n                information are reasonably required to support the \n                continuation of a tolerance or exemption that is in \n                effect under this section for a pesticide chemical \n                residue on a food, the Administrator shall obtain \n                additional data or information through any of the \n                methods described in paragraph (2).\n                    ``(B) Modifying, suspending, or revoking tolerance \n                or exemption.--If the Administrator makes a \n                determination that there may be grounds for modifying, \n                suspending, or revoking a tolerance or exemption in \n                effect under this section for a pesticide chemical \n                residue in or on food, the Administrator may not \n                modify, suspend, or revoke the tolerance or exemption \n                until the Administrator has considered additional data \n                or information obtained by the Administrator (after \n                making such determination).
