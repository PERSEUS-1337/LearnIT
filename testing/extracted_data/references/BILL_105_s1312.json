FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The annual losses in the United States from motor \n        vehicle collisions are estimated to exceed 800 deaths and \n        80,000 injuries to children under the age of 5.\n            (2) It is estimated that properly used child restraints in \n        motor vehicles can reduce the chance of serious or fatal injury \n        in a motor vehicle collision--\n                    (A) by a factor of 69 percent with respect to \n                infants; and\n                    (B) by a factor of 47 percent with respect to \n                children under the age of 5.\n            (3) Some of the most common seating position designs that \n        have emerged in motor vehicles during the last decade make \n        secure installation of child restraints difficult and, in some \n        circumstances, impossible.\n            (4) Results from regional child restraint clinics \n        demonstrated that 70 to 90 percent of child restraints are \n        improperly installed or otherwise misused and the improper \n        installation or other misuse is largely attributable to the \n        complication and wide variations in seat belt and child \n        restraint designs.\n            (5) There is an immediate need to expand the availability \n        of national, State, and local child restraint education \n        programs and supporting resources and materials to assist \n        agencies and associated organizations in carrying out effective \n        public education concerning child restraints.\n\nSEC. 3.
