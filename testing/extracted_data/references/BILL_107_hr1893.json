FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since the mid-1970s, the Federal Government and many \n        State and local agencies have encouraged Americans to seek a \n        General Equivalency Diploma (GED) rather than a traditional \n        high school degree.\n            (2) As the economy now demands higher skilled workers, the \n        General Equivalency Diploma is no longer an adequate \n        alternative to a traditional high school degree.\n            (3) Economists Stephen Cameron and James Heckman have \n        studied individuals with exam-certified high school equivalents \n        and have made each of the following conclusions:\n                    (A) Individuals with exam-certified high school \n                equivalents are statistically indistinguishable in the \n                labor market from high school dropouts.\n                    (B) Individuals with exam-certified equivalents and \n                high school dropouts have comparably poor wages, \n                earnings, hours of work, employment experiences, and \n                job tenure.\n                    (C) Measured by their ability and in their labor \n                market status, individuals who have a General \n                Equivalency Diploma are closer to high school dropouts \n                than individuals with traditional high school degrees.\n                    (D) Even after controlling for ability, men with \n                General Equivalency Diplomas have inferior labor market \n                status than individuals with traditional high school \n                degrees.\n                    (E) Individuals with General Equivalency Diplomas \n                have lower employment rates and less work experience \n                than individuals with traditional high school degrees.\n                    (F) Both anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests \n                that employers and the military discount the General \n                Equivalency Diploma.\n                    (G) There is no cheap substitute for classroom \n                instruction and education programs that focus on \n                obtaining a General Equivalency Diploma as an end in \n                itself are misguided.\n            (4) Although the rates of teenage pregnancy and early \n        childbearing in the United States have decreased somewhat \n        recently, approximately 3,941,553 adolescent girls between the \n        ages of 10 and 17 gave birth in 1999, and the number of births \n        for 2000 has yet to be determined.\n            (5) While, as a Nation, we should continue to make efforts \n        to prevent unintended pregnancies, we must also provide \n        pregnant teenagers and young mothers with educational \n        opportunities to help them become productive citizens and good, \n        caring parents.\n            (6) No Americans, including pregnant teenagers, young \n        mothers, and young fathers, should be provided with a second-\n        rate, inferior education.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY AND REVIEW OF POLICIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Education shall--\n            (1) conduct a study to review the value of a General \n        Equivalency Diploma (GED) relative to a traditional high school \n        degree; and\n            (2) review the policies and procedures of the Department of \n        Education to determine means by which the Department can reform \n        such policies and procedures to allow the Department--\n                    (A) to cooperate with other Federal agencies to \n                improve the educational opportunities offered to all \n                Americans, including pregnant teenagers and young \n                mothers;\n                    (B) to work with States and local educational \n                agencies to promote high quality education for all \n                Americans, including pregnant teenagers and young \n                mothers;\n                    (C) to encourage individuals, including pregnant \n                teenagers and young mothers, who already have dropped \n                out of school to return to school to receive additional \n                training;\n                    (D) to encourage individuals currently working to \n                obtain a General Equivalency Diploma to enter community \n                or four-year colleges in order to improve their skills \n                and enhance the value of their education credentials; \n                and\n                    (E) to encourage the restructuring the General \n                Equivalency Diploma to make it more relevant to current \n                high educational standards.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report \ncontaining--\n    (1) the results of the study conducted under this section;\n    (2) the results of the review conducted under this section; and\n    (3) any recommendations for reform.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act \n$2,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003."
