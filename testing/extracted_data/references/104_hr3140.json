individual's relationship with the Member, Senator, \n        officer, or employee, shall be considered a gift to the Member, \n        Senator, officer, or employee if it is given with the knowledge \n        and acquiescence of the Member, Senator, officer, or employee \n        and the Member, Senator, officer, or employee has reason to \n        believe the gift was given because of the official position of \n        the Member, Senator, officer, or employee.\n            (3) If food or refreshment is provided at the same time and \n        place to both a Member, Senator, officer, or employee and the \n        spouse or dependent thereof, only the food or refreshment \n        provided to the Member, Senator, officer, or employee shall be \n        treated as a gift for purposes of subsection (a).\n    (c) Exception.--The restrictions in subsection (a) shall not apply \nto the following:\n            (1) Anything for which the Member, Senator, officer, or \n

friendship unless the Member, Senator, officer, or \n        employee has reason to believe that, under the circumstances, \n        the gift was provided because of the official position of the \n        Member, Senator, officer, or employee and not because of the \n        personal friendship.\n            (B) In determining whether a gift is provided on the basis \n        of personal friendship, the Member, Senator, officer, or \n        employee shall consider the circumstances under which the gift \n        was offered, such as:\n                    (i) The history of the

individuals.\n                    (ii) Whether to the actual knowledge of the Member, \n                Senator, officer, or employee the individual who gave \n                the gift personally paid for the gift or sought a tax \n                deduction or business reimbursement for the gift.\n                    (iii) Whether to the actual knowledge of the \n                Member, Senator,

employees.\n            (5) A contribution or other payment to a legal expense fund \n        established for the benefit of a Member, Senator, officer, or \n        employee that is otherwise
