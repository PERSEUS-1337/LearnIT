FINDING.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) 21 percent of the children in the United States attend \n        public schools in rural areas;\n            (2) more than 14,000,000 school-age children (25 percent of \n        all school-age children) are left alone after school, including \n        more than 40,000 kindergartners;\n            (3) only 6,500,000 (11 percent) of children in kindergarten \n        through twelfth grade participate in after-school programs, \n        although an additional 15,000,000 would participate if a \n        quality program were available in the communities of the \n        children;\n            (4) in rural areas of the United States, 2,500,000 children \n        live in deep and persistent poverty;\n            (5) among children living in rural areas, 19 percent live \n        in poverty, compared to 15 percent among non-rural children;\n            (6) rural schools have fewer financial resources that non-\n        rural schools, largely as a result of diminished local property \n        tax bases and inequitable distributions of State funds;\n            (7) low literacy rates among parents in poor rural \n        communities affect the early language development and \n        educational aspirations of children;\n            (8) children living in poverty experience less cognitive \n        stimulation and enrichment than children living in middle-\n        income households;\n            (9) the poorer and more diverse the rural population, the \n        lower the scores of the students of the population are on the \n        National Assessment of Educational Progress;\n            (10) academic outcomes that are linked to after-school \n        programs include--\n                    (A) better performance in school as measured by \n                achievement test scores and grades;\n                    (B) better attitudes toward school and higher \n                educational aspirations;\n                    (C) higher school attendance; and\n                    (D) less disciplinary action;\n            (11) investing in after-school programs helps children in \n        rural communities break out of the cycle of poverty and creates \n        opportunities for at-risk youth;\n            (12) in areas in which resources are limited, after-school \n        programs are often the only source of supplemental enrichment \n        in literacy, nutrition education, technology, and preparation \n        for college entrance exams;\n            (13) children attending rural schools have the lowest \n        median per-student funding for after-school programs under the \n        21st century community learning center program under part B of \n        title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n        (20 U.S.C. 7171 et seq.), as compared to children attending \n        urban and suburban schools;\n            (14) after-school program providers in rural communities \n        face unique barriers that include--\n                    (A) higher transportation costs;\n                    (B) fewer economies of scale, because of the \n                smaller population base, which results in less funding \n                per child; and\n                    (C) fewer trained staff and community-based \n                organizations with whom to partner;\n            (15) in the 30 years before the date of enactment of this \n        Act--\n                    (A) the percentage of children in the United States \n                who are overweight has more than doubled; and\n                    (B) the number of teenagers who are overweight has \n                nearly tripled;\n            (16) rural, low-income children represent the highest \n        obesity group among all children in the United States; and\n            (17) after-school programs provide--\n                    (A) much-needed opportunities to promote and \n                support healthy lifestyles in youth in addition to \n                constructive learning environments; and\n                    (B) effective venues for improving nutrition, \n                nutrition education, and physical activity.\n\nSEC. 3.
