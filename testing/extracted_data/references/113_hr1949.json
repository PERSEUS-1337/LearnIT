and\n            (3) the ways in which the Federal Government may make such \n        information more readily available to--\n                    (A) students and their families in a format that is \n                easily accessible and understandable, and will aid \n                students and their families in making decisions; and\n                    (B) States, local governments, secondary schools, \n                individual or groups of institutions of higher \n                education, and private-sector entities.\n    (c) Scope of Study.--In conducting the study under this Act, the \nAdvisory Committee shall, at a minimum, examine--\n            (1) whether the current Federal transparency initiatives on \n        postsecondary education--\n                    (A) are reporting consistent information about \n                individual institutions of higher education across \n                Federal agencies; and\n                    (B) are similar to transparency initiatives on \n                postsecondary education carried out by States, \n                individual or groups of institutions of higher \n                education, or private-sector entities;\n            (2) whether--\n                    (A) the collection and reporting of postgraduation \n                earnings by the Federal Government is feasible, and if \n                feasible, the options for collecting and reporting such \n                information;\n                    (B) collecting and reporting such information would \n                improve the use of Federal transparency initiatives and \n                ease decisionmaking for students and their families; \n                and\n                    (C) collecting and reporting such information would \n                have an impact on student privacy, and if so, how such \n                impact may be minimized;\n            (3) whether any other information, including information \n        relating to student outcomes or identified under the review \n        required under subsection (d), should be collected and reported \n        by the Federal Government to improve the utility of such \n        initiatives for students and their families, and if so, how \n        such information may be collected and reported, including \n        whether the information should be disaggregated by subgroups of \n        students;\n            (4) whether any information currently collected and \n        reported by the Federal Government on institutions of higher \n        education is not useful for students and their families and \n        should not be so collected and reported;\n            (5) the manner in which the information from Federal \n        transparency initiatives is made available to students and \n        their families, and whether format changes may help the \n        information become more easily understood and widely utilized \n        by students and their families;\n            (6) any activities being carried out by the Federal \n        Government, States, individual or groups of institutions of \n        higher education, or private-sector entities to help inform \n        students and their families of the availability of Federal \n        transparency initiatives;\n            (7) the cost to institutions of higher education of \n        reporting to the Federal Government the information that is \n        being collected and reported through Federal transparency \n        initiatives, and how such cost may be minimized; and\n            (8) the relevant research described in subsection (d).\n    (d) Review of Relevant Research.--In conducting the study under \nthis Act, the Advisory Committee shall review and consider--\n            (1) research and studies, if any, that have been conducted \n        to determine questions most frequently asked by students and \n        families to help inform their search for an institution of \n        higher education;\n            (2) the types of information students seek before enrolling \n        in an institution of higher education;\n            (3) whether the availability to students and their families \n        of additional information on institutions of higher education \n        will be beneficial or confusing;\n            (4) results, if any, that are available from consumer \n        testing of Federal, State, institution of higher education, and \n        private-sector transparency initiatives on postsecondary \n        education that have been made publicly available on or after \n        the date that is 10 years before the date of enactment of this \n        Act; and\n            (5) any gaps in the research, studies, and results \n        described in paragraphs (1) and (4) relating to the types of \n        information students seek before enrolling in an institution of \n        higher education.\n    (e) Consultation.--\n            (1) In general.--In conducting the study under this Act, \n        the Advisory Committee shall--\n                    (A) hold public hearings to consult with parents \n                and students;
