    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares that the oversight boards to individual successor agencies were established pursuant to the Redevelopment Agency Dissolution Act, which prescribes that all oversight boards in the County of Los Angeles will be consolidated into a single countywide oversight board by July 1, 2016.\n(b) The Legislature further finds that collapsing all functions of the 71 oversight boards in the County of Los Angeles into a single countywide oversight board would create administrative gridlock and be a severe impediment to the expeditious disposition of properties owned by former redevelopment agencies.\n(c) In recognition of these findings and to ensure that the duties of the 71 oversight boards and successor agencies in the County of Los Angeles will be met in a timely manner, it is the intent of the Legislature to continue all oversight boards in the County of Los Angeles in existence until the respective successor agency requests dissolution of its oversight board and transfer of fiduciary duties to the countywide oversight board.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 34179 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n34179.\n(a) Each successor agency shall have an oversight board composed of seven members.

If a recognized employee organization does not exist for either the employees of the former redevelopment agency or the city or county employees performing administrative duties of the former redevelopment agency, the appointment shall be made from among the employees of the successor agency. In voting to approve a contract as an enforceable obligation, a member appointed pursuant to this paragraph shall not be deemed to be interested in the contract by virtue of being an employee of the successor agency or community for purposes of Section 1090 of the Government Code.\n(8) If the county or a joint powers agency formed the redevelopment agency, the largest city by acreage in the territorial jurisdiction of the former redevelopment agency may select one member.
