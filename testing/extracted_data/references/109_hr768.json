    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Family Life Education Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The American Medical Association (``AMA''), the \n        American Nurses Association (``ANA''), the American Academy of \n        Pediatrics (``AAP''), the American College of Obstetricians and \n        Gynecologists (``ACOG''), the American Public Health \n        Association (``APHA''), and the Society of Adolescent Medicine \n        (``SAM''), support responsible sexuality education that \n        includes information about both abstinence and contraception.\n            (2) Recent scientific reports by the Institute of Medicine, \n        the American Medical Association and the Office on National \n        AIDS Policy stress the need for sexuality education that \n        includes messages about abstinence and provides young people \n        with information about contraception for the prevention of teen \n        pregnancy, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases \n        (``STDs'').\n            (3) Research shows that teenagers who receive sexuality \n        education that includes discussion of contraception are more \n        likely than those who receive abstinence-only messages to delay \n        sexual activity and to use contraceptives when they do become \n        sexually active.\n            (4) Comprehensive sexuality education programs respect the \n        diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community \n        and will complement and augment the sexuality education \n        children receive from their families.\n            (5) The median age of puberty is 13 years and the average \n        age of marriage is over 26 years old. American teens need \n        access to full, complete, and medically and factually accurate \n        information regarding sexuality, including contraception, STD/\n        HIV prevention, and abstinence.\n            (6) Although teen pregnancy rates are decreasing, there are \n        still between 750,000 and 850,000 teen pregnancies each year. \n        Between 75 and 90 percent of teen pregnancies among 15- to 19-\n        year olds are unintended.\n            (7) Research shows that 75 percent of the decrease in teen \n        pregnancy between 1988 and 1995 was due to improved \n        contraceptive use, while 25 percent was due to increased \n        abstinence.\n            (8) More than eight out of ten Americans believe that young \n        people should have information about abstinence and protecting \n        themselves from unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted \n        diseases.\n            (9) United States teens acquire an estimated 4,000,000 \n        sexually transmitted infections each year. By age 24, at least \n        one in three sexually active people will have contracted a \n        sexually transmitted disease.\n            (10) An average of two young people in the United States \n        are infected with HIV every hour of every day. African \n        Americans and Hispanic youth have been disproportionately \n        affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Although less than 16 \n        percent of the adolescent population in the United States is \n        African American, nearly 50 percent of AIDS cases through June \n        2000 among 13- to 19-year olds were among Blacks. Hispanics \n        comprise 13 percent of the population and 20 percent of the \n        reported adolescent AIDS cases though June 2000.\n\nSEC. 3.
