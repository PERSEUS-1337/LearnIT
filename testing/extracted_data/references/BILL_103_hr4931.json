FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings regarding the Gulf of \nMaine:\n            (1) The Gulf of Maine is a critically important \n        environmental and economic resource shared by the United States \n        and Canada.\n            (2) The Gulf of Maine supports abundant and diverse marine \n        wildlife populations, including 100 species of birds, 73 \n        species of fish, 26 species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises, \n        1,600 types of bottom-dwelling organisms, and endangered \n        species such as the bald eagle, roseate tern, humpback whale, \n        and sperm whale.\n            (3) The Gulf of Maine holds substantial value as a \n        recreation resource for people today and its value as a \n        recreation resource will likely increase in the future. Nearly \n        \\1/3\\ of the United States population, comprising approximately \n        75,600,000 people, live within a 1-day drive of the Gulf of \n        Maine. The Gulf of Maine contains 2 United States national \n        parks and 1 Canadian national park, and it contains a United \n        States national marine sanctuary.\n            (4) The Gulf of Maine provides substantial commercial \n        benefits to the United States and Canada. Its commercial \n        fishing industry, including aquaculture, produces more than \n        $800,000,000 in revenues annually and employs 20,000 people. \n        Aquaculture is a growing multimillion dollar industry in the \n        region.\n            (5) Tourism and recreation in the Gulf of Maine region \n        generate millions of dollars in revenue each year and provide \n        employment for thousands. The Gulf of Maine attracts 10,000,000 \n        visitors annually. In addition, the Gulf of Maine is home to \n        many economically important maritime facilities, such as ports \n        and shipyards.\n            (6) Studies conducted by national and State governments and \n        other agencies have determined that, without prudent, \n        coordinated management, the future development and use of the \n        resources of the Gulf of Maine may have significant adverse \n        impacts on the environment and economy of the bordering States, \n        the adjacent region, and the United States.\n            (7) Environmental threats to the Gulf of Maine are too \n        extensive and complex to be managed by any single State, \n        provincial, or Federal agency. Existing threats include--\n                    (A) high levels of toxic contaminants in the deep \n                basin sediments of the Gulf of Maine, which indicate \n                that toxic contaminants are distributed throughout the \n                Gulf of Maine ecosystem;\n                    (B) bacterial contamination that has closed more \n                than \\1/3\\ of the shellfish beds in the Gulf of Maine, \n                resulting in significant economic losses; and\n                    (C) increasing loss of habitat in the Gulf of Maine \n                region, which results in diminished estuarine and \n                coastal habitats essential for migratory waterfowl and \n                commercially valuable fish species.\n            (8) The natural resources of the Gulf of Maine are \n        interconnected, forming an ecosystem that transcends political \n        boundaries. It is therefore important that the States, \n        provinces, and Federal Governments cooperate with one another \n        and coordinate their public policies, research, and management \n        activities related to the protection of the resources of the \n        Gulf of Maine.\n            (9) Interjurisdictional cooperation and coordination of \n        efforts, policies, and programs can maximize the efficient use \n        of limited fiscal resources in the Gulf of Maine region, and \n        further the goal of protecting the resources of the Gulf of \n        Maine and stimulating its economy over the long-term.\n            (10) The Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment, \n        established in 1989 by the States of Maine, Massachusetts, and \n        New Hampshire and the Canadian Provinces of New Brunswick and \n        Nova Scotia (in this Act referred to as the ``Gulf of Maine \n        Council''), is well-equipped to assist in the coordination of \n        policies and activities of the multiple agencies and \n        scientific, environmental, fishing, and marine trade \n        organizations active in the Gulf of Maine region. It has laid a \n        cooperative, regionally based foundation for future efforts to \n        protect, conserve, and sustainably develop the Gulf of Maine.\n            (11) The Gulf of Maine Council has developed innovative and \n        constructive strategies and programs to maintain and enhance \n        marine environmental quality and to allow for sustainable \n        resource use, such as the Gulf of Maine Action Plan 1991-2000 \n        and the Gulf of Maine Environmental Quality Monitoring Plan.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States that--\n            (1) United States Government activities relating to \n        conserving the natural resources of the Gulf of Maine and \n        encouraging sustainable development in the region should be \n        maintained and strengthened; and\n            (2) the environmental and economic interests of the \n        American people are well-served by United States Government \n        cooperation and coordination with the Gulf of Maine Council.\n\nSEC. 4.
