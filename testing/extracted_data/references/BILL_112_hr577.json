FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The number of older individuals in the United States \n        who are abused, neglected, or exploited is increasing, and a \n        large percentage of elder abuse cases are not reported to \n        Federal and State law enforcement authorities.\n            (2) The number of individuals in the United States aged 65 \n        and older is projected to increase exponentially in the coming \n        years, and many of these valued citizens will begin to \n        constitute a vulnerable population at increased risk of abuse \n        and exploitation in domestic and community-based settings.\n            (3) The projected increase in the number of individuals in \n        the United States aged 65 and over is expected to result in a \n        corresponding increase in the number of cases of elder abuse, \n        which suggests an urgent need for comprehensive consideration \n        of means by which such abuse can be prevented, reported, and \n        prosecuted by Federal and State authorities.\n            (4) Violent, physical, and sexual assaults upon older \n        individuals are particularly abhorrent and should be prosecuted \n        vigorously by Federal and State law enforcement authorities. \n        Such acts should be deterred by appropriate penalties including \n        enhanced penalties and the elimination of parole for \n        individuals convicted of violent sexual offenses against the \n        elderly.\n\nSEC. 3. NO PAROLE FOR SEXUAL OFFENSES COMMITTED AGAINST OLDER \n              INDIVIDUALS OR FOR SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS.\n\n    (a) In General.--For each fiscal year after the expiration of the \nperiod specified in subsection (b)(1) in which a State receives funds \nfor the program referred to in subsection (b)(2), the State shall have \nin effect throughout the State laws and policies that prohibit parole \nfor any individual who--\n            (1) is convicted of a criminal sexual offense against a \n        victim who is an older individual, which shall include any such \n        offense under State law for conduct that would constitute an \n        offense under chapter 109A of title 18, United States Code, had \n        the conduct occurred in the special maritime and territorial \n        jurisdiction of the United States or in a Federal prison; and\n            (2) is a sexually violent predator.\n    (b) Compliance and Ineligibility.--\n            (1) Compliance date.--Each State shall have not more than 3 \n        years from the date of enactment of this Act to comply with \n        subsection (a), except that--\n                    (A) the Attorney General may grant an additional 2 \n                years to a State that is making good faith efforts to \n                comply with such subsection; and\n                    (B) the Attorney General shall waive the \n                requirements of subsection (a) if compliance with such \n                subsection by a State would be unconstitutional under \n                the constitution of such State.\n            (2) Ineligibility for funds.--For any fiscal year after the \n        expiration of the period specified in paragraph (1), a State \n        that fails to comply with subsection (a) shall not receive 10 \n        percent of the funds that would otherwise be allocated for that \n        fiscal year to the State under the Edward Byrne Memorial \n        Justice Assistance Grant Program under subpart 1 of part E of \n        title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of \n        1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et seq.).\n    (c) Reallocation.--Amounts not allocated under the program referred \nto in subsection (b)(2) to a State for failure to fully comply with \nsubsection (a) shall be reallocated under that program to States that \nhave not failed to comply with such subsection.\n    (d) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section--\n            (1) the term ``older individual'' means an individual who \n        is 65 years of age or older; and\n            (2) the term ``sexually violent predator'' means a person \n        who--\n                    (A) has been convicted of a sexually violent \n                offense; and\n                    (B) has been diagnosed by a qualified mental health \n                professional as having a mental abnormality or \n                personality disorder that makes the person likely to \n                engage in predatory sexually violent offenses, or has \n                been determined by a court to suffer from such an \n                illness or disorder.\n\nSEC. 4.
