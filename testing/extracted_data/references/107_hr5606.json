    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Recruitment and Diversity in Nursing \nAct of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States is experiencing a nursing shortage \n        due to declining enrollment rates in education and nursing \n        programs. The Federal Government has a substantial interest in \n        addressing the nursing shortage, because the shortage affects \n        the overall health and safety of patients receiving health \n        care.\n            (2) The average age of nurses in the United States is 43.3. \n        Unless the Congress takes affirmative measures, the shortage \n        will only continue to worsen as nurses retire and leave the \n        profession.\n            (3) Increasing access to nursing education for \n        nontraditional students will result in more people entering the \n        profession and thus combat the current nursing shortage and \n        help to reduce the average age of nurses.\n            (4) Increasing the awareness of elementary and secondary \n        school students about careers in nursing, through the use of \n        nonprofit organizations, will assist in recruitment of \n        nontraditional nursing students and thus combat the current \n        nursing shortage and help to reduce the average age of nurses.\n\nSEC. 3. SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM FOR NONTRADITIONAL NURSING STUDENTS.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--Section 846 of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 297n) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (e), (f), (g), (h), and \n        (i) as subsections (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j), respectively;
