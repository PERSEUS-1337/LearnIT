    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Millions of children in the United States suffer from \n        vision problems, many of which go undetected. Because children \n        with vision problems can struggle developmentally, resulting in \n        physical, emotional, and social consequences, good vision is \n        essential for proper physical development and educational \n        progress.\n            (2) Vision problems in children range from common \n        conditions such as refractive errors, amblyopia, strabismus, \n        ocular trauma, and infections, to rare but potentially life- or \n        sight-threatening problems such as retinoblastoma, infantile \n        cataracts, congenital glaucoma, and genetic or metabolic \n        diseases of the eye.\n            (3) Since many serious ocular conditions are treatable if \n        identified in the preschool and early school-age years, early \n        detection provides the best opportunity for effective treatment \n        and can have far-reaching implications for vision.\n            (4) Various identification methods, including vision \n        screening and comprehensive eye examinations required by State \n        laws, can be helpful in identifying children needing services. \n        A child identified as needing services through vision screening \n        should receive a comprehensive eye examination followed by \n        subsequent treatment as needed. Any child identified as needing \n        services should have access to subsequent treatment as needed.\n            (5) There is a need to increase public awareness about the \n        prevalence and devastating consequences of vision disorders in \n        children and to educate the public and health care providers \n        about the warning signs and symptoms of ocular and vision \n        disorders and the benefits of early detection, evaluation, and \n        treatment.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS REGARDING VISION CARE FOR CHILDREN.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n(referred to in this section as the ``Secretary''), acting through the \nDirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may award \ngrants to States on the basis of an established review process for the \npurpose of complementing existing State efforts for--\n            (1) providing comprehensive eye examinations by a licensed \n        optometrist or ophthalmologist for children who have been \n        previously identified through a vision screening or eye \n        examination by a licensed health care provider or vision \n        screener as needing such services, with priority given to \n        children who are under the age of 9 years;\n            (2) providing treatment or services, subsequent to the \n        examinations described in paragraph (1), necessary to correct \n        vision problems;
