    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Methamphetamine Abuse Prevention Act \nof 2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) methamphetamine is a dangerous drug distributed \n        throughout the United States;\n            (2) the manufacture, distribution, and use of \n        methamphetamine results in increased crime, damage to the \n        environment, hazardous waste that endangers the public, \n        expensive cleanup costs often borne by Federal, State, and \n        local government agencies, and broken families;\n            (3) Congress has acted many times to limit the availability \n        of chemicals and equipment used in the manufacturing of \n        methamphetamine;\n            (4) pseudoephedrine is one of the basic precursor chemicals \n        used in the manufacture of methamphetamine;\n            (5) the United States Drug Enforcement Administration has \n        indicated that methamphetamine manufacturers often obtain \n        pseudoephedrine from retail and wholesale distributors, in both \n        bottles and ``blister packs'', and that the use of \n        pseudoephedrine tablets in blister packs is pervasive in the \n        illicit production of methamphetamine in both small and large \n        clandestine methamphetamine laboratories;\n            (6) while current law establishes a retail sales limit of 9 \n        grams for most pseudoephedrine products, including common cold \n        medicine, there is no such limit on the sale of blister-packed \n        pseudoephedrine products;\n            (7) the 9 gram limit on bottled pseudoephedrine allows an \n        individual to purchase approximately 366 thirty-milligram \n        tablets per transaction, which is significantly more than a \n        typical consumer would need for legitimate purposes;\n            (8) reducing the current 9 gram threshold to 6 grams would \n        allow consumers to continue purchasing sufficient medication \n        for legitimate purposes and would assist efforts to reduce \n        illegal use of the pseudoephedrine products;\n            (9) the United States Drug Enforcement Administration \n        recommended in March 2002 that retail distribution of \n        pseudoephedrine tablets in blister packages should not be \n        exempt from the general retail sales limit; and\n            (10) in recommending legislation to correct the current \n        disparity in the law between bottled and blister-packed \n        pseudoephedrine tablets, the United States Drug Enforcement \n        Administration stated that ``The removal of this difference \n        would significantly prevent illicit access to this \n        methamphetamine precursor and would be easier for both the \n        government and the industry to monitor and would increase \n        compliance by retailers''.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION OF RETAIL SALES THRESHOLD TO 6 GRAMS.\n\n    Section 102(39)(A)(iv)(II) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 \nU.S.C. 802(39)(A)(iv)(II)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``9 grams'' each place such term appears \n        and inserting ``6 grams''; and\n            (2) by striking ``and sold in package sizes of not more \n        than 3 grams of pseudoephedrine base or 3 grams of \n        phenylpropanolamine base; or'' and inserting the following: \n        ``and sold in, with respect to nonliquids, package sizes of not \n        more than 3.0 grams of pseudoephedrine base or 3.0 grams of \n        phenylpropanolamine base, and packaged in blister packs, each \n        blister containing not more than 2 dosage units, or where the \n        use of blister packs is technically infeasible, packaged in \n        unit dose packets or pouches and, with respect to liquids, sold \n        in package sizes of not more than 3.0 grams of pseudoephedrine \n        base or 3.0 grams of phenylpropanolamine base; or''.\n\nSEC. 4. ELIMINATION OF BLISTER PACK EXEMPTION.\n\n    (a) Regulated Transaction.--Section 102(39)(A)(iv)(I)(aa) of the \nControlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(39)(A)(iv)(I)(aa)) is amended \nby striking ``, except that'' and all that follows through ``1996)''.\n    (b) Definition.--Section 102 of the Controlled substances Act (21 \nU.S.C. 802) is amended--\n            (1) by striking paragraph (45); and\n            (2) by redesignating paragraph (46) as paragraph (45).\n    (c) Rule of Law.--To the extent that there exists a conflict \nbetween the amendment made by subsection (a) and section 401(d) of the \nComprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 (21 U.S.C. 802 note), \nthe amendment shall control.\n\nSEC. 5. NATIONAL UNIFORMITY FOR RESTRICTIONS ON THE SALE OF \n              PSEUDOEPHEDRINE PRODUCTS.\n\n    Section 708 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 903) is \namended--\n            (1) by striking ``No'' and inserting the following:\n    ``(a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), no''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Pseudoephedrine Drug Product.--\n            ``(1) State and local requirements.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--No State or political \n                subdivision of a State or State authorized entity may \n                establish with respect to the retail sales of any \n                pseudoephedrine drug product any requirement or \n                restriction that is different from, or in addition to, \n                or that is otherwise not identical with, the \n                requirements and restrictions that apply to \n                pseudoephedrine drug products under this Act.\n                    ``(B) State penalties.--Nothing in subparagraph (A) \n                shall be construed as preventing a State or political \n                subdivision of a State from adopting penalties that are \n                different from, or in addition to, or that are \n                otherwise not identical with, the penalties that apply \n                under this Act.\n                    ``(C) Grandfather clause.--Subparagraph (A) shall \n                not apply to any requirement or restriction regarding \n                the retail sale of pseudoephedrine drug products \n                established by a State or political subdivision of a \n                State or State authorized entity enacted prior to \n                January 1, 2005, other than a requirement or \n                restriction allowing any individual to purchase more \n                than 6 grams of pseudoephedrine base in any single \n                retail transaction.\n            ``(2) Exemptions.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Upon application of a State or \n                political subdivision thereof, the Attorney General, \n                not later than 30 days after receiving the application, \n                may exempt from paragraph (1)(A), under such conditions \n                as the Attorney General may prescribe, a State or \n                political subdivision requirement upon a determination \n                by the Attorney General that--\n                            ``(i) pseudoephedrine drug products \n                        obtained in that State or political subdivision \n                        are being used as a significant source of \n                        precursor chemicals for illegal manufacture of \n                        a controlled substance for distribution or \n                        sale;\n                            ``(ii) the requirement is likely to \n                        substantially decrease the use of \n                        pseudoephedrine drug products as a source of \n                        precursor chemicals for illegal manufacture of \n                        a controlled substance for distribution or \n                        sale;
