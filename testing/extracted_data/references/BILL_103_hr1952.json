PURPOSE.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to explore, assess, and stimulate a variety of \n        approaches to character education;\n            (2) to lend Federal support to local and State character \n        education programs that seek to promote commonly accepted civic \n        and character values and the principles of democracy.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) many Americans of all economic and social levels and \n        ages no longer make determinations of right and wrong as to \n        their own actions or the actions of others in matters of both \n        public and private concern;\n            (2) educational institutions, which have traditionally \n        played a role in assisting students to make such \n        determinations, no longer receive explicit authority or proper \n        assistance necessary to fulfill this responsibility;\n            (3) the Nation has witnessed a national moral recession in \n        governmental and political activities, scientific research, and \n        business and commerce, in which individuals have failed to \n        consider the ethics governing their behavior;\n            (4) statistics show alarming incidents in individual and \n        gang violence, drug and substance abuse, and suicide among both \n        young people and adults;\n            (5) polls show that Americans overwhelmingly prize values \n        such as honesty, but believe that people are less honest today \n        than in the past;\n            (6) leaders representing a broad spectrum of political, \n        social, and religious backgrounds believe that education in \n        moral issues contributes to good citizenship and have called \n        for strengthening the teaching of democratic values;\n            (7) local character education programs have shown positive \n        results in reducing negative student behavior, including \n        violence, vandalism, and disrespect for others, and in \n        promoting an understanding of shared civic and character \n        values;\n            (8) training in ethics is an ongoing concern in business \n        and industry and in public service; and\n            (9) while education remains the responsibility of local and \n        State governments, the Congress and the Federal Government may \n        appropriately provide assistance to educational agencies and \n        institutions attempting to promote ethics, civic and character \n        values, and the principles of democracy through character \n        education programs.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITION.\n\n    For purposes of this Act, the term ``character education'' means \nthe teaching of commonly accepted civic and character values and the \nprinciples of democracy that contribute to ethical behavior.\n\n           TITLE I--CHARACTER EDUCATION DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM\n\nSEC. 101.
