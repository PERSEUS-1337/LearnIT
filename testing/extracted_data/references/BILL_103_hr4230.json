TRADITIONAL INDIAN RELIGIOUS USE OF THE PEYOTE SACRAMENT.\n    The Act of August 11, 1978 (42 U.S.C. 1996), commonly referred to \nas the ``American Indian Religious Freedom Act'', is amended by adding \nat the end thereof the following new section:\n    ``Sec. 3. (a) The Congress finds and declares that--\n        ``(1) for many Indian people, the traditional ceremonial use of \n    the peyote cactus as a religious sacrament has for centuries been \n    integral to a way of life, and significant in perpetuating Indian \n    tribes and cultures;\n        ``(2) since 1965, this ceremonial use of peyote by Indians has \n    been protected by Federal regulation;\n        ``(3) while at least 28 States have enacted laws which are \n    similar to, or are in conformance with, the Federal regulation \n    which protects the ceremonial use of peyote by Indian religious \n    practitioners, 22 States have not done so, and this lack of \n    uniformity has created hardship for Indian people who participate \n    in such religious ceremonies;\n        ``(4) the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of \n    Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), held that the \n    First Amendment does not protect Indian practitioners who use \n    peyote in Indian religious ceremonies, and also raised uncertainty \n    whether this religious practice would be protected under the \n    compelling State interest standard; and\n        ``(5) the lack of adequate and clear legal protection for the \n    religious use of peyote by Indians may serve to stigmatize and \n    marginalize Indian tribes and cultures, and increase the risk that \n    they will be exposed to discriminatory treatment.\n    ``(b)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the use, \npossession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide \ntraditional ceremonial purposes in connection with the practice of a \ntraditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by \nthe United States or any State. No Indian shall be penalized or \ndiscriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or \ntransportation, including, but not limited to, denial of otherwise \napplicable benefits under public assistance programs.\n    ``(2) This section does not prohibit such reasonable regulation and \nregistration by the Drug Enforcement Administration of those persons \nwho cultivate, harvest, or distribute peyote as may be consistent with \nthe purposes of this Act.\n    ``(3) This section does not prohibit application of the provisions \nof section 481.111(a) of Vernon's Texas Health and Safety Code \nAnnotated, in effect on the date of enactment of this section, insofar \nas those provisions pertain to the cultivation, harvest, and \ndistribution of peyote.\n    ``(4) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any Federal department \nor agency, in carrying out its statutory responsibilities and \nfunctions, from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable \nlimitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior to or during the \nperformance of duties by sworn law enforcement officers or personnel \ndirectly involved in public transportation or any other safety-\nsensitive positions where the performance of such duties may be \nadversely affected by such use or ingestion. Such regulations shall be \nadopted only after consultation with representatives of traditional \nIndian religions for which the sacramental use of peyote is integral to \ntheir practice. Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this section \nshall be subject to the balancing test set forth in section 3 of the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103-141; 42 U.S.C. \n2000bb-1).\n    ``(5) This section shall not be construed as requiring prison \nauthorities to permit, nor shall it be construed to prohibit prison \nauthorities from permitting, access to peyote by Indians while \nincarcerated within Federal or State prison facilities.\n    ``(6) Subject to the provisions of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act (Public Law 103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1), this section \nshall not be construed to prohibit States from enacting or enforcing \nreasonable traffic safety laws or regulations.\n    ``(7) Subject to the provisions of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act (Public Law 103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1), this section \ndoes not prohibit the Secretary of Defense from promulgating \nregulations establishing reasonable limitations on the use, possession, \ntransportation, or distribution of peyote to promote military \nreadiness, safety, or compliance with international law or laws of \nother countries. Such regulations shall be adopted only after \nconsultation with representatives of traditional Indian religions for \nwhich the sacramental use of peyote is integral to their practice.\n    ``(c) For purposes of this section--\n        ``(1) the term `Indian' means a member of an Indian tribe;\n        ``(2) the term `Indian tribe' means any tribe, band, nation, \n    pueblo, or other organized group or community of Indians, including \n    any Alaska Native village (as defined in, or established pursuant \n    to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et \n    seq.)), which is recognized as eligible for the special programs \n    and services provided by the United States to Indians because of \n    their status as Indians;\n        ``(3) the term `Indian religion' means any religion--\n            ``(A) which is practiced by Indians, and\n            ``(B) the origin and interpretation of which is from within \n        a traditional Indian culture or community; and\n        ``(4) the term `State' means any State of the United States, \n    and any political subdivision thereof.\n    ``(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as abrogating, \ndiminishing, or otherwise affecting--\n        ``(1) the inherent rights of any Indian tribe;\n        ``(2) the rights, express or implicit, of any Indian tribe \n    which exist under treaties, Executive orders, and laws of the \n    United States;\n        ``(3) the inherent right of Indians to practice their \n    religions; and\n        ``(4) the right of Indians to practice their religions under \n    any Federal or State law.''.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
