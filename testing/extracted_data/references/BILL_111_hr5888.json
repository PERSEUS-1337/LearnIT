SHORT TITLE; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``America Rx Act of \n2010''.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish an America Rx \nprogram that utilizes manufacturer rebates and pharmacy discounts to \nreduce prescription drug prices to those residents who are without \naccess to discounted prices for outpatient prescription drugs.\n\nSEC. 2. AMERICA RX PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services shall establish a program (in this section referred to \n        as the ``America Rx program'') consistent with the provisions \n        of this section to provide qualified residents with access to \n        discounted prices for outpatient prescription drugs through \n        rebate agreements that the Secretary has negotiated with \n        prescription drug manufacturers.\n            (2) Outreach.--The Secretary shall provide for--\n                    (A) outreach efforts to build public awareness of \n                the program and maximize enrollment of qualified \n                residents; and\n                    (B) simplified eligibility procedures and uniform \n                eligibility standards for qualified residents.\n    (b) Rebate Agreements With Manufacturers.--\n            (1) In general.--Under the America Rx program the Secretary \n        shall negotiate with manufacturers of outpatient prescription \n        drugs rebate agreements with respect to drugs offered under the \n        program to qualified residents.\n            (2) Minimum amount of rebates.--In negotiating the amount \n        of such a rebate under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall take \n        into consideration the amount of the rebate calculated under \n        the Medicaid program, the average manufacturer price of \n        prescription drugs, and other information on prescription drug \n        prices and price discounts. The Secretary shall negotiate the \n        amount of such rebates in a manner so that the rebates on \n        average are comparable to the average percentage rebate \n        obtained in outpatient prescription drugs provided under \n        section 1927(c) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-\n        8(c)).\n            (3) Discounted prices.--The Secretary shall specify the \n        method for computing and applying such discounts, including a \n        method for computing and applying discounts on a uniform, \n        average percentage basis.\n            (4) Payment.--Rebates under such agreements shall be \n        payable to the Secretary according to a schedule (not less \n        often than quarterly) negotiated with manufacturers and shall \n        be paid, directly or through States, to participating \n        pharmacies that provide discounts to qualified residents.\n            (5) Incentive.--In order to induce manufacturers of \n        outpatient prescription drugs to enter into such rebate \n        agreements to carry out the purpose described in section 1(b), \n        the Secretary shall provide, in the case of a manufacturer that \n        has not entered into such an agreement, for a denial of a \n        deduction under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n        for the amount of expenses of the manufacturer for advertising \n        and marketing of drugs of the manufacturer, other than expenses \n        for free samples of drugs subject to section 503(b)(1) of the \n        Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act intended to be distributed \n        to patients.\n            (6) Application of rebates.--Amounts received by the \n        Secretary as rebates under this subsection shall be placed into \n        an appropriate account in the Treasury and shall be available \n        in advance of appropriations to the Secretary for the payment \n        of discounts and other costs of participating pharmacies in \n        carrying out the America Rx program and for the payment of \n        administrative costs in carrying out the program. Under the \n        America Rx program, participating pharmacies shall be ensured \n        reasonable and timely payment of discounts they provide to \n        qualified residents under the program.\n    (c) Role of States in Administering Program.--\n            (1) In general.--Under the America Rx program the Secretary \n        may enter into appropriate arrangements with States under which \n        States provide for the administration of the program in return \n        for payment of the reasonable administrative expenses \n        associated with such administration.\n            (2) Administrative functions.--Such administration \n        functions may include--\n                    (A) determinations of eligibility of qualified \n                residents;\n                    (B) arrangements with participating pharmacies; and\n                    (C) such other functions as the Secretary \n                determines appropriate.\n            (3) Contractual authority.--In carrying out \n        responsibilities under this section, the Secretary and States \n        may enter into agreements with pharmacy benefit managers and \n        other third parties.\n    (d) Program Eligibility.--\n            (1) Qualified resident defined.--For purposes of this \n        section, the term ``qualified resident'' means an individual \n        who--\n                    (A) is a citizen or national of the United States \n                or is lawfully present in the United States (as \n                determined in accordance with section 1411 of the \n                Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act); and\n                    (B) as determined under regulations of the \n                Secretary, is not covered under any public or private \n                program that provides substantial benefits (which may \n                be discounted prices) towards the purchase of \n                outpatient prescription drugs.\n            (2) Screening.--\n                    (A) For other governmental programs.--Individuals \n                who apply for benefits under the America Rx program \n                shall be screened for eligibility under the Medicaid \n                program and other applicable Governmental health care \n                programs and, if found eligible, shall be enrolled in \n                such program or programs.\n                    (B) Screening by health insurance exchanges.--In \n                the case of individuals enrolling in a qualified health \n                plan through a Health Insurance Exchange under title I \n                of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the \n                Exchange shall provide (at the time of enrollment) for \n                a screening of the individual to determine if the \n                individual is a qualified resident for purposes of the \n                America Rx program.\n            (3) Relation to other coverage.--In order not to discourage \n        employers and health insurance issuers from providing \n        comprehensive prescription drug coverage through a group health \n        plan or health insurance coverage, no such employer or issuer \n        may participate in a Health Insurance Exchange if the Secretary \n        determines that the prescription drug benefits under the plan \n        or coverage have been reduced as a result of the America Rx \n        program.\n            (4) Protection of the low income.--Nothing in this section \n        shall be construed as reducing the prescription drug benefits \n        available to low-income individuals, as well as senior citizens \n        and the disabled, under the Medicare or Medicaid programs as a \n        result of the implementation of the America Rx program.\n    (e) Arrangements With Participating Pharmacies.--\n            (1) In general.--Under the America Rx program arrangements \n        are made with pharmacies for the provision of prescription \n        drugs at discounted prices to qualified residents in a \n        reasonably accessible manner.
