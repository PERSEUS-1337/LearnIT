FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Approximately 16,000,000 Americans suffer from \n        diabetes, and another 650,000 will be newly diagnosed during \n        1997.\n            (2) Diabetes and its complications are a leading cause of \n        death by disease in America, and reduce life expectancy by up \n        to 30 percent. During 1997 diabetes and its complications will \n        contribute to the deaths of more than 170,000 Americans.\n            (3) The total health-care-related costs of diabetes, \n        consisting of hospital stays, nursing home services, physician \n        care, laboratory tests, and pharmaceutical products, total over \n        $130,000,000,000 per year.\n            (4) Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness \n        in the United States, with 24,000 new cases resulting from \n        diabetes each year.\n            (5) One-third of all kidney dialysis patients have \n        diabetes-related kidney failure.\n            (6) Diabetes is a leading risk factor for coronary artery \n        disease overall, and in particular for women between the ages \n        of 30 and 55. Women with either Type I or Type II diabetes have \n        almost a two-fold risk of developing coronary artery disease.\n            (7) Diabetic neuropathy affects 90 percent of people with \n        long-term diabetes and is a major contributor to lower \n        extremity amputations. Patients with diabetes account for more \n        than half of all leg amputations in the United States.\n            (8) Sixty to 65 percent of people with diabetes are \n        affected by hypertension.\n            (9) African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native \n        Americans are at 1\\1/2\\ to 2\\1/2\\ times greater risk of \n        developing diabetes.\n\nSEC. 3.
