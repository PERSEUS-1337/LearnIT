    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) States and localities should be able to exercise \n        control over the construction and location of such towers \n        through the use of zoning, planned growth, and other controls \n        relating to the protection of the environment and public \n        health.\n            (2) The placement of commercial telecommunications, radio, \n        or television towers near homes can greatly reduce the value of \n        such homes, destroy the views from such homes, and reduce \n        substantially the desire to live in such homes.\n            (3) There are alternatives to the construction of \n        additional telecommunications towers to effectively provide \n        wireless services, including the collocation of transmitters on \n        existing towers and the use of alternative technologies, \n        including satellites.\n            (4) The Federal Communications Commission does not consider \n        itself a health agency and turns to health and radiation \n        experts outside the agency for guidance on the issue of health \n        effects due to radio frequency exposure. Additionally, both the \n        Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection \n        Agency agree that the research completed to date is \n        insufficient to determine whether using portable cellular \n        telephones presents risks to human health. It is therefore in \n        the interest of the Nation for the Congress to authorize a \n        thorough Federal study into the health effects of low-level, \n        prolonged exposure to nonionizing radiation.\n            (5) The rapid proliferation of personal wireless \n        transmitters and the expected rollout of digital television \n        transmitters mean that the number of sources of nonionizing \n        radiation and the relative strength of these sources will \n        increase dramatically in our Nation's communities in the near \n        future. Until independently funded, conclusive, peer-reviewed \n        studies are completed on this subject, we should exercise \n        caution and give States and local governments full authority to \n        protect the public from radio frequency emissions.\n            (6) The Federal Communications Commission has proposed \n        rules regarding the siting of personal wireless transmitter \n        towers. It is in the interest of the Nation that the second \n        memorandum opinion and order notice of proposed rulemaking of \n        the Commission with respect to application of such ordinances \n        to the placement of such towers, WT Docket No. 97-192, ET \n        Docket No. 93-62, and RM-8577, be modified in order to permit \n        State and local governments to exercise their zoning and land \n        use authorities, and their power to protect public health and \n        safety, to regulate the placement of telecommunications towers. \n        Further, the proposed rules should be modified to allow a \n        licensee or applicant to seek relief from an adverse action \nonly after they have exhausted all available administrative or judicial \nremedies at the local or State levels of jurisdiction, and, that when \npetitioning before the Commission for relief from an adverse decision, \nthe applicant shall bear the burden of proof relating to the placement \nof such towers.\n            (7) On August 19, 1997, the Federal Communications \n        Commission issued a proposed rule, MM Docket No. 97-182, which \n        would preempt the application of State and local zoning and \n        land use ordinances regarding the placement of \n        telecommunications towers for digital television services. It \n        is in the interest of the Nation that the Commission not adopt \n        this rule.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To repeal the limitations on the exercise of State and \n        local authorities regarding the placement, construction, and \n        modification of personal wireless service facilities that arise \n        under section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n        U.S.C. 332(c)(7)).\n            (2) To permit State and local governments to regulate the \n        placement, construction, and modification of such facilities on \n        the basis of the environmental effects of the operation of such \n        facilities.\n            (3) To prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from \n        adopting rules which would preempt State and local regulation \n        of the placement of such facilities.\n\nSEC. 2. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND \n              MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) Repeal of Limitations.--Section 332(c)(7)(B) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)) is amended--\n            (1) in clause (i), by striking ``thereof--'' and all that \n        follows through the end and inserting ``thereof shall not \n        unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally \n        equivalent services.'';\n            (2) by striking clause (iv);\n            (3) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and\n            (4) in clause (iv), as so redesignated--\n                    (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``30 days \n                after such action or failure to act'' and inserting \n                ``30 days after exhaustion of any administrative \n                remedies with respect to such action or failure to \n                act''; and\n                    (B) by striking the third sentence and inserting \n                the following: ``In any such action in which a person \n                seeking to place, construct, or modify a tower facility \n                is a party, such person shall bear the burden of \n                proof.''.\n    (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule.--Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, the Federal Communications Commission may not adopt \nas a final rule the proposed rule set forth in ``Preemption of State \nand Local Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on Siting, Placement and \nConstruction of Broadcast Station Transmission Facilities'', MM Docket \nNo. 97-182, released August 19, 1997."
