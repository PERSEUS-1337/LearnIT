The lien arises at the time of the entry \nof the order and continues until the liability is satisfied, remitted, \nor set aside.

On application of the person against \nwhom restitution is ordered, the Attorney General or any other person \nor entity holding a lien pursuant to this section, shall--\n            ``(A) issue a certificate of release, as described in \n        section 6325 of the Internal Revenue Code, of any lien imposed \n        pursuant to this section, upon his acceptance of a bond \n        described in section 6325(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code; \n        or\n            ``(B) issue a certificate of discharge, as described in \n        section 6325 of the Internal Revenue Code, of any part of the \n        person's property subject to a lien imposed pursuant to this \n        subsection, upon his determination that the fair market value \n        of that part of such property remaining subject to and \n        available to satisfy the lien is at least three times the \n        amount of the restitution ordered.\n    ``(2) The provisions of sections 6323, 6331, 6332, 6334 through \n6336, 6337(a), 6338 through 6343, 6901, 7402, 7403, 7424 through 7426, \n7505(a), 7506, 7701, and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and \nof section 513 of the Act of October 17, 1940 (54 Stat. 1190), apply to \nan order of restitution and to the lien imposed by paragraph (1) as if \nthe liability of the person against whom restitution is ordered were \nfor an internal revenue tax assessment where the Attorney General is \nthe lienholder, except to the extent that the application of such \nstatutes is modified by regulations issued by the Attorney General to \naccord with differences in the nature of the liabilities. For the \npurposes of this paragraph references in the preceding sections of the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to `the Secretary' shall be construed to \nmean `the Attorney General' and references in those sections to `tax' \nshall be construed to mean `order of restitution'.\n    ``(3) A notice of the lien imposed by paragraph (1) shall be \nconsidered a notice of lien for taxes payable to the United States for \nthe purposes of any State or local law providing for the filing of a \nnotice of a tax lien.
