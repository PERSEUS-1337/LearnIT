BEST-IN-CLASS APPLIANCES DEPLOYMENT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy shall, in consultation \nwith the Administrator, establish and administer a program to be known \nas the ``Best-in-Class Appliances Deployment Program''.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Best-in-Class Appliances \nDeployment Program is to reward retailers with bonuses for increasing \nthe sales of best-in-class high-efficiency installed building \nequipment, high-efficiency consumer electronics, and high-efficiency \nhousehold appliance models, with the goal of reducing life-cycle costs \nfor consumers, encouraging innovation, and maximizing energy savings \nand public benefit. The program shall include bounties under subsection \n(c) to retailers for the replacement and recycling of old, inefficient, \nand environmentally harmful appliances. The program shall also include \nbonuses under subsection (d) to manufacturers for developing new \nSuperefficient Best-in-Class Products.\n    (c) Incentives for Sales of Best-in-Class Product Models.--\n            (1) Selection of best-in-class product models.--In \n        establishing the program, the Secretary of Energy shall use \n        broad product classes and select as qualifying Best-in-Class \n        Product models no more than the most efficient ten percent of \n        the commercially available product models in a class that \n        demonstrate, as a group, a distinctly greater energy efficiency \n        than the average energy efficiency of that class of appliances. \n        In selecting models, the Secretary shall--\n                    (A) identify commercially available models in the \n                relevant class of products;\n                    (B) identify the subgroup and percentage of those \n                models (not greater than 10 percent) that the Secretary \n                believes share the distinctly higher energy-efficiency \n                characteristics that warrant designation as best-in-\n                class;\n                    (C) specify the higher energy-efficiency \n                characteristic they share;\n                    (D) announce the best-in-class designation and the \n                best-in-class bonus to be paid for each sale of an \n                eligible best-in-class model over a 3-year period \n                beginning on the date of the announcement;\n                    (E) add other models in that class to the list of \n                best-in-class models eligible for the bonus as they \n                demonstrate their ability to meet the higher-efficiency \n                characteristics on which the designation was made; and\n                    (F) make bonus payments for qualifying models sold \n                during the 3-year period.\n            (2) Review of best-in-class standards.--The Secretary shall \n        review annually the product-specific criteria and the product \n        models that qualify as Best-in-Class Products and, after a 30-\n        day comment period, make upwards adjustments in the efficiency \n        criteria as required to maintain an appropriate ratio of such \n        product models to the total number of product models in the \n        product class.\n            (3) Upgrade of best-in-class product eligibility.--To the \n        extent that the Secretary determines to increase the energy \n        efficiency required to qualify for best-in-class designation \n        within any group of product models, the Secretary shall--\n                    (A) consider any Superefficient Best-in-Class \n                Product models that have been designated pursuant to \n                subsection (d);\n                    (B) specify and announce the new higher best-in-\n                class standard;\n                    (C) list those models that qualify as best-in-class \n                under the new higher standard;\n                    (D) announce any change in the bonus payment \n                appropriate to increase the market share of such best-\n                in-class models, which shall not be lower than any \n                ongoing bonus payment during the 3-year period for any \n                prior designation of best-in-class models;\n                    (E) pay the new bonus payment for any models \n                already qualifying under the earlier best-in-class \n                standard that continue to qualify under the revised \n                standard for a new 3-year-period; and\n                    (F) continue paying bonus payments at the original \n                level to any models that qualified at that level but do \n                not qualify at the new level for the remainder of the \n                3-year period announced with the original designation.\n            (4) Size of individual bonus payments.--The size of each \n        bonus payment shall be the product of--\n                    (A) an amount determined by the Secretary; and\n                    (B) the difference in energy consumption as \n                determined by comparing the energy used by the \n                qualifying product and the energy used by the average \n                product in the product class.\n        The Secretary shall determine the amount under subparagraph (A) \n        for each product type in consultation with State and utility \n        efficiency program administrators as well as the Administrator, \n        based on estimates of the amount of bonus payment that would \n        provide significant incentive to increase the market share of \n        Best-in-Class Products.\n            (5) Eligible bonus recipient.--(A) The Secretary shall \n        ensure that not more than 1 bonus payment is provided to \n        distributors and retailers per unit of eligible models sold.\n            (B) In this section--\n                    (i) the term ``retailer'' means an individual, \n                organization, or company that sells products directly \n                to end-users; and\n                    (ii) the term ``distributor'' mean an individual, \n                organization, or company that sells products in \n                multiple lots and not directly to individual end-users.\n            (C) The Secretary may make distributors eligible to receive \n        the best-in-class incentive for sales that are not to the final \n        end-user in addition to retailers to the extent that the \n        Secretary determines that for a particular product category \n        distributors are well situated to increase sales of Best-in-\n        Class Products.\n    (d) Bounties for Replacement and Retirement of Existing Low-\nEfficiency Products.--\n            (1) The Secretary of Energy shall establish a program to \n        make a bounty payment for the recovery and recycling of older \n        operating low-efficiency appliances that might otherwise \n        continue in operation.\n            (2) The Secretary shall offer a bounty as an additional \n        incentive for retailers based on documentation that the sales \n        of a Best-in-Class Product were accompanied by the retirement \n        and recycling of an existing inefficient but still-functioning \n        product by the consumer to whom the Best-in-Class Product was \n        sold.\n            (3) The bounty payment shall be based on the difference \n        between the estimated energy use of the product replaced and \n        the energy use of an average new product in the product class, \n        discounted for the estimated remaining lifetime of the product \n        that was recycled.\n            (4) The Secretary may specify that the availability of a \n        product bonus related to sale of a Best-in-Class Product is \n        linked to the recovery and recycling of an older working \n        appliance, and may limit the total payment to less than the sum \n        of the bonus and the bounty payments, if not doing so would \n        mean that the Nation's total energy use would otherwise \n        increase.\n            (5) The Secretary shall ensure that no product for which a \n        bounty is paid is sold or returned to active service, but that \n        it is instead destroyed, and recycled to the extent feasible.\n            (6) The Secretary shall establish standards for \n        environmentally responsible methods of recycling, especially \n        for products utilizing refrigerants.\n    (e) Rewards to Manufacturers for Development of Superefficient \nBest-in-Class Products.--\n            (1) In general.--(A) The Secretary of Energy shall \n        establish a program to reward manufacturers for the development \n        and production of Superefficient Best-in-Class Products.\n            (B) In this section, the term ``Superefficient Best-in-\n        Class Product'' means a product that--\n                    (i) can be mass produced; and\n                    (ii) achieves the highest level of efficiency that \n                the Secretary finds could be produced and sold \n                commercially to mass-market consumers.\n            (C) The Secretary may establish a standard for a \n        Superefficient Best-in-Class Product even if no existing \n        product exists, if the Secretary has reasonable grounds to \n        conclude that a mass-producable product could be made to meet \n        that standard.\n            (D) The Secretary may also establish a superefficient best-\n        in-class level that is met by one or more existing Best-in-\n        Class Product models if those product models have distinct \n        energy efficiency attributes and performance characteristics \n        that make them significantly better, in the judgment of the \n        Secretary, than those product models qualifying as best-in-\n        class, but that represent not more than 10 percent of the \n        currently qualifying best-in-class models.\n            (2) Reward.--\n                    (A) The bonus payment provided to a manufacturer \n                for the development and production of a Superefficient \n                Best-in-Class Product shall be in addition to any bonus \n                payments made to retailers for best-in-class \n                qualification.\n                    (B) The amount of the bonus paid per unit for \n                qualifying Superefficient Best-in-Class Product models \n                as sold to retailers or distributors shall be the \n                product of--\n                            (i) an amount determined by the Secretary; \n                        and\n                            (ii) the difference in energy consumption \n                        as determined by comparing the energy used by \n                        the qualifying product and the energy used by \n                        the average product in the product class.\n                    (C) The Secretary shall determine the amount under \n                subparagraph (B)(i) for each product type by \n                considering the present value to the Nation of the \n                energy (and water or other resources or inputs) saved \n                over the useful life of the product, and may adjust \n                this value upward or downward after consultation with \n                State and utility efficiency program administrators as \n                well as the Administrator.\n                    (D) The adjustment may also be made based on the \n                effect of the reward on the sales of products in \n                different classes that may be affected by this program.\n                    (E) The incremental bonus payments shall be applied \n                to sales of any Superefficient Best-in-Class Product \n                for the first 3 years of its sale.\n            (3) Coordination of incentives.--No product for which \n        Federal tax credit is received under section 45M of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be eligible to receive \n        bonus payments pursuant to this subsection.\n    (f) Reporting.--Each retailer, distributor, and manufacturer \nparticipating in the program under this section shall meet any \nreasonable request of the Secretary of Energy for documentation of \nsales reported for purpose of receiving bonuses or bounties, and shall \nreport to the Secretary, on a confidential basis for program-design \npurposes--\n            (1) for retailers and distributors, the number of units \n        sold within each product type and model-specific wholesale \n        purchase price on a monthly basis;\n            (2) for manufacturers, model-specific energy consumption \n        data; and\n            (3) for manufacturers, on an immediate basis, concerning \n        any product design or function changes that affect the energy \n        consumption of the unit.\n    (g) Auditing Requirements.--The Secretary of Energy shall establish \nmonitoring and verification protocols to ensure that energy consumption \ntests for each model are recorded correctly and that sales of energy-\nefficient models are tabulated correctly by each claimant of bonus or \nbounty payments under this section. In addition, the Secretary may \nrequire reports from retailers on the methods used to increase the \nsales of qualifying products as a factor in determining the level and \nallocation of any such payments.\n    (h) Disclosure.--The Secretary of Energy may require that retailers \nand distributors disclose publicly and to consumers their participation \nin the program under this section.\n    (i) Cost-Effectiveness Requirement.--\n            (1) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n                    (A) Cost-effectiveness.--The term ``cost-\n                effectiveness'' means a measure of aggregate savings in \n                the cost of energy over the lifetime of the product as \n                a ratio to the cost to the Secretary of Energy of the \n                rewards for the product.\n                    (B) Savings.--The term ``savings'' means the \n                cumulative megawatt-hours of electricity or million \n                British thermal units of other fuels saved by a \n                product, in comparison to projected energy consumption \n                based on the efficiency performance of displaced new \n                product sales. The amount of savings is the product \n                of--\n                            (i) the net number of best-in-class or \n                        superefficient best-in-class pieces of \n                        equipment, electronics, and appliances sold by \n                        a retailer, manufacturer, or distributor in a \n                        calendar year;\n                            (ii) the savings during the projected \n                        useful life of the pieces of equipment, \n                        electronics, and appliances; and\n                            (iii) the impact of any documented measures \n                        to retire and recycle low-performing devices at \n                        the time of purchase of highly-efficient \n                        substitutes.\n            (2) Requirement.--The Secretary shall make cost-\n        effectiveness a top priority in designing and administering \n        this section, except that the cost-effectiveness of the rewards \n        to manufacturers, in aggregate, may be lower by this measure \n        than that of the rewards to retailers and distributors.\n    (j) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated such \nsums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2010 through 2014 \nto the Secretary of Energy for purposes of this section, of which not \nmore than 10 percent for any fiscal year may be expended on program \nadministration."
