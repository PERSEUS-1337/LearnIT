ENERGY-RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) information and opinions provided by individuals and \n        entities of the academic and industrial sectors should be an \n        important consideration with respect to energy-related research \n        and development activities carried out by the Federal \n        Government;\n            (2) in carrying out energy-related research and development \n        activities, the Federal Government should regularly seek input \n        from multiple sources, including the industrial sector, \n        academia, and other relevant sectors;\n            (3) research is better focused around well-defined problems \n        that need to be resolved;\n            (4) a number of potential problems to be resolved are \n        likely to require input from a diverse selection of \n        technologies and contributing sectors;\n            (5) sharing of information relating to energy research and \n        development is important to the development and innovation of \n        energy technologies;\n            (6) necessary intellectual property protection can lead to \n        delays in sharing valuable information that could aid in \n        resolving major energy-related problems;\n            (7) the Federal Government should facilitate the sharing of \n        information from a diverse array of industries by ensuring the \n        protection of intellectual property while simultaneously \n        creating an environment of openness and cooperation; and\n            (8) the Federal Government should revise the methods of the \n        Federal Government regarding energy-related research and \n        development to encourage faster development and implementation \n        of energy technologies.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Network.--The term ``network'' means the Energy \n        Technologies Innovation Network established by subsection \n        (d)(1).\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n            (3) Survey.--The term ``survey'' means a survey conducted \n        pursuant to subsection (c).\n    (c) Energy-Related Research and Development Priorities.--\n            (1) In general.--Not less frequently than once every 5 \n        years, the Secretary shall conduct a survey in accordance with \n        this subsection to determine the 10 highest-priority energy-\n        related problems to resolve to ensure the goals of--\n                    (A) maximizing the energy security of the United \n                States;\n                    (B) maximizing improvements in energy efficiency \n                within the United States; and\n                    (C) minimizing damage to the economy and the \n                environment of the United States.\n            (2) Survey.--\n                    (A) In general.--Each survey shall contain a \n                request that the respondent shall list, in descending \n                order of priority, the 10 highest-priority energy-\n                related problems that, in the opinion of the \n                respondent, require resolution as quickly as \n                practicable to ensure the goals described in paragraph \n                (1).\n                    (B) Announcement.--The Secretary shall announce the \n                existence of each survey by--\n                            (i) publishing an announcement in the \n                        Federal Register;
