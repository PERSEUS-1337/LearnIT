If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that there \n        is an insufficient level of duties from watch and watch-related \n        tariffs, the Secretary may authorize refunds of duties \n        collected on jewelry under chapter 71 or any other duties that \n        the Secretary determines are appropriate.\n``(B) At the election of the certificate holder and upon making the \n        certification described in this clause, the Secretary of the \n        Treasury shall pay to the holder the face value of the \n        certificate, less the value of (1) any duty refund claimed by \n        the holder under the certificate, plus (2) a discount of not \n        more than 2 percent of the face value of the certificate, as \n        determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.
