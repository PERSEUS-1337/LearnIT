    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality \nAct (NICA) of 2017''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 2006, Nicaragua, under President Enrique Bolanos, \n        entered into a $175,000,000, 5-year compact with the Millennium \n        Challenge Corporation (MCC).\n            (2) After the 2008 municipal elections, the MCC stated that \n        there was a pattern of decline in political rights and civil \n        liberties in Nicaragua.\n            (3) In 2009, the MCC terminated the compact and reduced the \n        amount of MCC funds available to Nicaragua by $61,500,000, \n        which led to the compact ending in 2011.\n            (4) According to Nicaraguan law, the National Assembly is \n        the only institution allowed to change the constitution, but in \n        2009, Daniel Ortega circumvented the legislature and went to \n        the Supreme Court, which he controls, to rule in his favor that \n        Presidential term limits were inapplicable.\n            (5) The Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n        Representatives convened a congressional hearing on December 1, \n        2011, entitled ``Democracy Held Hostage in Nicaragua: Part 1'' \n        where former United States Ambassador to Nicaragua Robert \n        Callahan testified ``[f]irst, that Daniel Ortega's candidacy \n        was illegal, illegitimate, and unconstitutional; second, that \n        the period leading to the elections and the elections \n        themselves were marred by serious fraud; third, that Daniel \n        Ortega and his Sandinista party have systematically undermined \n        the country's fragile governmental institutions''.\n            (6) From fiscal year 2012 until present, the Department of \n        State found that the Government of Nicaragua did not meet \n        international standards of fiscal transparency.\n            (7) On January 25, 2012, a press statement from Secretary \n        of State Hillary Clinton stated, ``As noted by international \n        observers and Nicaraguan civil society groups, Nicaragua's \n        recent elections were not conducted in a transparent and \n        impartial manner, and the entire electoral process was marred \n        by significant irregularities. The elections marked a setback \n        to democracy in Nicaragua and undermined the ability of \n        Nicaraguans to hold their government accountable.''.\n            (8) According to the Department of State's 2015 Fiscal \n        Transparency Report: ``Nicaragua's fiscal transparency would be \n        improved by including all off-budget revenue and expenditure in \n        the budget, auditing state-owned enterprises, and conducting a \n        full audit of the government's annual financial statements and \n        making audit reports publicly available within a reasonable \n        period of time.''.\n            (9) According to the Department of State's Country Reports \n        on Human Rights Practices for 2015: ``In 2011 the Supreme \n        Electoral Council (CSE) announced the re-election of President \n        Daniel Ortega Saavedra of the Sandinista National Liberation \n        Front (FSLN) in elections that international and domestic \n        observers characterized as seriously flawed. International and \n        domestic organizations raised concerns regarding the \n        constitutional legitimacy of Ortega's re-election. The 2011 \n        elections also provided the ruling party with a supermajority \n        in the National Assembly, allowing for changes in the \n        constitution, including extending the reach of executive branch \n        power and the elimination of restrictions on re-election for \n        executive branch officials and mayors. Observers noted serious \n        flaws during the 2012 municipal elections and March 2014 \n        regional elections.''.\n            (10) According to the Department of State's Country Reports \n        on Human Rights Practices for 2015 in Nicaragua: ``The \n        principal human rights abuses were restrictions on citizens' \n        right to vote; obstacles to freedom of speech and press, \n        including government intimidation and harassment of journalists \n        and independent media, as well as increased restriction of \n        access to public information, including national statistics \n        from public offices; and increased government harassment and \n        intimidation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil \n        society organizations''.\n            (11) The same 2015 report stated: ``Additional significant \n        human rights abuses included considerably biased policies to \n        promote single-party dominance; arbitrary police arrest and \n        detention of suspects, including abuse during detention; harsh \n        and life-threatening prison conditions with arbitrary and \n        lengthy pretrial detention; discrimination against ethnic \n        minorities and indigenous persons and communities.''.\n            (12) In February 2016, the Ortega regime detained and \n        expelled Freedom House's Latin America Director, Dr. Carlos \n        Ponce, from Nicaragua.\n            (13) On June 3, 2016, the Nicaraguan Supreme Court, which \n        is controlled by Nicaragua's leader, Daniel Ortega, instructed \n        the Supreme Electoral Council not to swear in Nicaraguan \n        opposition members to the departmental and regional electoral \n        councils.\n            (14) On June 5, 2016, regarding international observers for \n        the 2016 Presidential elections, President Ortega stated, \n        ``Here, the observation ends. Go observe other countries . . . \n        There will be no observation, neither from the European Union, \n        nor the OAS . . .''.\n            (15) On June 7, 2016, the Department of State's Bureau of \n        Democracy, Human Rights and Labor posted on social media: \n        ``Disappointed government of Nicaragua said it will deny \n        electoral observers requested by Nicaraguan citizens, church, \n        and private sector . . . We continue to encourage the \n        government of Nicaragua to allow electoral observers as \n        requested by Nicaraguans.''.\n            (16) On June 14, 2016, President Ortega expelled three \n        United States Government officials (two officials from U.S. \n        Customs and Border Protection and one professor from the \n        National Defense University) from Nicaragua.\n            (17) On June 29, 2016, the Department of State issued a \n        Nicaragua Travel Alert which stated, ``The Department of State \n        alerts United States citizens about increased government \n        scrutiny of foreigners' activities, new requirements for \n        volunteer groups, and the potential for demonstrations during \n        the upcoming election season in Nicaragua . . . Nicaraguan \n        authorities have denied entry to, detained, questioned, or \n        expelled foreigners, including United States Government \n        officials, academics, NGO workers, and journalists, for \n        discussions, written reports or articles, photographs, and/or \n        videos related to these topics. Authorities may monitor and \n        question private United States citizens concerning their \n        activities, including contact with Nicaraguan citizens.''.\n            (18) On August 1, 2016, the Department of State issued a \n        press release to express grave concern over the Nicaraguan \n        government limiting democratic space leading up to the \n        elections in November and stated, ``[O]n June 8, the Nicaraguan \n        Supreme Court stripped the opposition Independent Liberal Party \n        (PLI) from its long recognized leader. The Supreme Court took \n        similar action on June 17 when it invalidated the leadership of \n        the Citizen Action Party, the only remaining opposition party \n        with the legal standing to present a presidential candidate. \n        Most recently, on July 29, the Supreme Electoral Council \n        removed 28 PLI national assembly members (16 seated and 12 \n        alternates) from their popularly-elected positions.''.\n            (19) On November 7, 2016, the Department of State issued a \n        press release stating, ``The United States is deeply concerned \n        by the flawed presidential and legislative electoral process in \n        Nicaragua, which precluded the possibility of a free and fair \n        election on November 6. In advance of the elections, the \n        Nicaraguan government sidelined opposition candidates for \n        president, limited domestic observation at the polls and access \n        to voting credentials, and took other actions to deny \n        democratic space in the process. The decision by the Nicaraguan \n        government not to invite independent international electoral \n        observers further degraded the legitimacy of the election.''.\n            (20) In November and December of 2016, the Board of \n        Executive Directors of the Inter-American Development Bank \n        postponed consideration of a policy-based loan of $65,000,000 \n        to the Government of Nicaragua due to the efforts of the United \n        States mission that expressed serious concerns of the absence \n        of transparency, systemic corruption, and the lack of free and \n        fair elections in Nicaragua.\n            (21) On February 2017, the European Parliament issued a \n        resolution on the situation of human rights and democracy in \n        Nicaragua and expressed concern of the ``deteriorating human \n        rights situation in Nicaragua and deplores the attacks and acts \n        of harassment to which human rights organizations and their \n        members and independent journalists have been subjected by \n        individuals, political forces and bodies linked to the \n        State.''.\n            (22) According to the Department of State's Country Reports \n        on Human Rights Practices for 2016: ``actions by the ruling \n        Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party resulted in \n        de facto concentration of power in a single party, with an \n        authoritarian executive branch exercising significant control \n        over the legislative, judicial, and electoral functions.''.\n            (23) According to the Department of State's Country Reports \n        on Human Rights Practices for 2016 in Nicaragua: ``The November \n        6 elections for president, vice president, national assembly \n        members, and representatives for the Central American \n        parliament did not meet the conditions of being free and fair . \n        . . The November 6 presidential and legislative elections were \n        marred by allegations of institutional fraud and the absence of \n        independent opposition political parties. National observers \n        and opposition leaders claimed rates of abstention from 60 to \n        70 percent.''.\n            (24) According to the Department of State's Country Reports \n        on Human Rights Practices for 2016: ``Companies reported that \n        bribery of public officials, unlawful seizures, and arbitrary \n        assessments by customs and tax authorities were common . . . \n        The courts remained particularly susceptible to bribes, \n        manipulation, and other forms of corruption, especially by the \n        FSLN, giving the sense that the FSLN heavily influenced CSJ and \n        lower-level court actions.''.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to support--\n            (1) the rule of law and an independent judiciary and \n        electoral council in Nicaragua;\n            (2) independent pro-democracy organizations in Nicaragua;\n            (3) free, fair, and transparent elections under \n        international and domestic observers in Nicaragua; and\n            (4) anti-corruption and transparency efforts in Nicaragua.\n\nSEC. 4.
