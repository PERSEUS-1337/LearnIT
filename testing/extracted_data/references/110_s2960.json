FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Improvised explosive devices come in many forms, \n        including--\n                    (A) radio controlled improvised explosive devices;\n                    (B) suicide improvised explosive devices;\n                    (C) suicide or homicide improvised explosive \n                devices;\n                    (D) vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices;\n                    (E) waterborne improvised explosive devices; and\n                    (F) underwater improvised explosive devices.\n            (2) The United States has suffered numerous improvised \n        explosive device attacks in the past 25 years, including--\n                    (A) the 1983 United States embassy bombing in \n                Beirut, Lebanon;\n                    (B) the 1983 United States Marine barracks bombing \n                in Beirut, Lebanon;\n                    (C) the 1983 United States Senate bombing following \n                the Grenada invasion;\n                    (D) the 1984 United States embassy annex bombing in \n                Beirut, Lebanon;\n                    (E) the 1986 TWA Flight 840 bombing;\n                    (F) the 1986 LaBelle Discotheque bombing in Berlin, \n                Germany;\n                    (G) the 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing;\n                    (H) the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York \n                City, New York;\n                    (I) the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building \n                bombing in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;\n                    (J) the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Khobar, Saudi \n                Arabia;\n                    (K) the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing in \n                Atlanta, Georgia;\n                    (L) the 1998 health clinic bombing in Birmingham, \n                Alabama;\n                    (M) the 1998 United States embassy bombing in Dar \n                es Salaam, Tanzania;\n                    (N) the 1998 United States embassy bombing in \n                Nairobi, Kenya;\n                    (O) the 2000 USS Cole bombing in Aden, Yemen; and\n                    (P) the 2008 military recruiting office bombing in \n                New York City, New York.\n            (3) Improvised explosive devices are responsible for 60 \n        percent of all United States combat casualties in Iraq and 50 \n        percent of all United States combat casualties in Afghanistan.\n            (4) The knowledge to assemble, arm, and detonate improvised \n        explosive devices is highly importable due to advances in \n        global communications networks.\n            (5) The bomb squad, public safety dive team, explosive \n        detection canine team, and special weapons and tactics team \n        capabilities of the United States is inadequate for the \n        domestic threat of an improvised explosive device attack.\n            (6) Federal funding in support of bomb squad, public safety \n        dive team, explosive detection canine team, and special weapons \n        and tactics team capability development is inadequate and lacks \n        sufficient strategic planning to properly equip, train, and \n        prepare the Nation's emergency response providers.\n            (7) Bomb squad, public safety dive teams, explosive \n        detection canine teams, and special weapons and tactics teams \n        operated by State and local governments are usually the first \n        to respond to domestic bombing threats and best-positioned to \n        discern funding shortfalls based on threats identified by \n        Federal, State, and local government sources.\n\nSEC. 3.
