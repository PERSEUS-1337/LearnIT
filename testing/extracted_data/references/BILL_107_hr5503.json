FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Harold Rogers Prescription Monitoring Program has \n        supplied and will continue to supply critically important \n        information and experience regarding effective prescription \n        drug monitoring practices.\n            (2) Schedule II, III, and IV controlled substances have a \n        useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to \n        maintain the health and general welfare of the American people.\n            (3) Schedule II, III, and IV controlled substances have a \n        moderate to high potential for misuse when the prescribing \n        practitioner is unaware of all such prescriptions that a \n        patient is receiving, including abuse, improper use, and \n        illegal distribution.\n            (4) Such misuse imposes substantial and detrimental effects \n        on the health and welfare of the American people.\n            (5) Currently there is no national databank that health \n        care practitioners and pharmacists who, respectively, prescribe \n        and dispense schedule II, III, and IV controlled substances can \n        access to determine whether a particular prescription is \n        medically unnecessary.\n            (6) A national electronic databank, supported by State \n        databanks where they are established under State law, would \n        allow providers to access the information necessary to \n        ascertain that a particular prescription may be unnecessary or \n        the subject of misuse.\n            (7) A major portion of the use and misuse of schedule II, \n        III, and IV controlled substances involves interstate and \n        foreign commerce.\n            (8) Schedule II, III, and IV controlled substances \n        dispensed intrastate cannot be differentiated from schedule II, \n        III, and IV controlled substances that are dispensed \n        interstate, and have significant interstate effects.\n\nSEC. 3. ELECTRONIC MONITORING SYSTEM FOR DISPENSING CONTROLLED \n              SUBSTANCES.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et seq.) is amended by adding after section 399N the following:\n\n``SEC. 399O.
