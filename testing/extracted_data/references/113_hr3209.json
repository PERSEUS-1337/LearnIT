SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DESIGNATION OF BOKO HARAM AS A FOREIGN \n              TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Congregation and People of Tradition for \n        Proselytism and Jihad, or more popularly known under its Hausa \n        name Boko Haram (``Western education is sinful.''), is a \n        Nigerian jihadist organization based in the northeastern part \n        of that country.\n            (2) Since its founding in 2001, Boko Haram reportedly has \n        been responsible for the deaths of more than 10,000 persons, \n        mostly Nigerians. This group has been officially designated by \n        the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as a \n        terrorist organization, along with another group--Jama'atu \n        Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis Sudan--under section 2 of \n        Nigeria's Terrorism Prevention Act of 2011 (as amended).\n            (3) Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the August 26, \n        2011, bombing of the United Nations Building in Abuja in which \n        21 persons were killed and another 60 were injured.\n            (4) In testimony before the Senate Select Committee on \n        Intelligence on January 31, 2012, Director of National \n        Intelligence James Clapper said Boko Haram ``is interested in \n        hitting targets, such as the U.S. Embassy and hotels frequented \n        by Westerners.''\n            (5) On February 23, 2012, United States Ambassador to \n        Nigeria Terrance P. McCulley said that Boko Haram's danger was \n        expanding and that at least part of the group ``has decided \n        it's in their interest to attack the international \n        community.''.\n    (b) Criteria.--Section 219(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct (8 U.S.C. 1189(a)(1)) provides the 3 criteria for the designation \nof an organization as a Foreign Terrorist Organization:\n            (1) The organization must be a foreign organization.\n            (2) The organization must engage in terrorist activity, as \n        defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and \n        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)), or terrorism, as \n        defined in section 140(d)(2) of the Foreign Relations \n        Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. \n        2656f(d)(2)), or retain the capability and intent to engage in \n        terrorist activity or terrorism.\n            (3) The organization's terrorist activity or terrorism must \n        threaten the security of United States nationals or the \n        national security (national defense, foreign relations, or the \n        economic interests) of the United States.\n    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) Boko Haram has met the criteria for designation as a \n        Foreign Terrorist Organization under section 219 of the \n        Immigration and Nationality Act (as described in subsection \n        (b)); and\n            (2) the Secretary of State, in consultation with the \n        Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, should \n        exercise the Secretary of State's statutory authority and \n        designate Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n    (d) Report.--If the Secretary of State does not designate Boko \nHaram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization within 60 days after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \nCongress a report that contains the reasons therefor.\n\nSEC. 3.
