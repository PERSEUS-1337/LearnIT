SENSE OF CONGRESS; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) finding a cure is essential to ending the AIDS epidemic \n        in the United States and globally;\n            (2) AIDS treatment has saved millions of lives and also \n        makes it much less likely that HIV infection will be passed to \n        a partner;\n            (3) access to AIDS treatment in the United States and \n        globally needs to continue to be expanded but AIDS treatment is \n        not a cure and not the ultimate solution for the tens of \n        millions of people living with HIV/AIDS;\n            (4) the National Institutes of Health is the leading health \n        research organization in the world and has dedicated millions \n        of dollars to AIDS cure research;\n            (5) to accelerate AIDS cure research and product \n        development, it is becoming increasingly important to invest in \n        areas that can complement the essential role of the National \n        Institutes of Health; and\n            (6) a cure will save hundreds of millions of dollars in \n        spending and have a powerful positive economic impact globally.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is estimated that in 2010 roughly 34,000,000 people \n        were living with HIV/AIDS worldwide.\n            (2) In the United States, 1,200,000 Americans are estimated \n        to be infected with the virus.\n            (3) Every 9.5 minutes, a citizen of the United States \n        becomes infected with HIV. Roughly 2,700,000 individuals, \n        including 390,000 children, became newly infected with HIV in \n        2010 alone.\n            (4) In fiscal year 2012, the Federal Government spent \n        $27,700,000,000 on HIV/AIDS, the largest component being \n        services and treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS in the \n        United States at a cost of $15,600,000,000. The average \n        lifetime cost of HIV treatment is estimated to be $367,134 per \n        person.\n            (5) In the last two years, discoveries have led to growing \n        optimism in the scientific community that a cure for AIDS can \n        be found. The eradication of HIV from the body of one \n        individual in Germany has led many scientific leaders to \n        believe that curing AIDS is now possible. Leading researchers \n        believe we are now at the cutting edge of scientific discovery \n        for an AIDS cure with a range of novel approaches being \n        explored, including stem cells, gene therapy, medications, and \n        immune response modifications, such as therapeutic vaccines.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF HIV/AIDS CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED MEDICAL \n              RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Research Program.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense, acting through \n        the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program, shall \n        establish and support an accelerated research program dedicated \n        to the discovery of a cure for HIV/AIDS.\n            (2) Administration.--The Secretary shall carry out the \n        research program established under paragraph (1) in \n        collaboration with--\n                    (A) the Director of the National Institutes of \n                Health;\n                    (B) the Director of the National Institute of \n                Allergy and Infectious Diseases; and\n                    (C) any head of a Federal agency that the Secretary \n                determines appropriate.\n    (b) Scope.--To provide the basis for developing a cure for HIV/\nAIDS, the Secretary shall ensure that research conducted under \nsubsection (a)(1) is highly targeted to address the following \nscientific questions and priorities:\n            (1) How HIV persists despite antiretroviral therapy.\n            (2) Where HIV persists beyond the reach of antiretroviral \n        therapy.\n            (3) Whether ongoing attempts of the immune system to clear \n        the infection actually hinders the ability of the medical \n        community to cure infected individuals.\n            (4) Why the immune system reduces but does not eliminate \n        levels of the virus.\n            (5) How to measure ultra-low levels of the virus in the \n        body of an infected individual.\n            (6) Identifying and testing interventions, such as drugs, \n        that may eliminate the virus from infected individuals.\n            (7) Identifying and testing interventions, such as \n        vaccines, that may help an infected individual permanently \n        control the virus without antiretroviral therapy.\n    (c) Assistance by Nonprofit Entities.--\n            (1) Coordination.--In carrying out the research program \n        established under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall \n        coordinate with at least one eligible nonprofit entity--\n                    (A) whose primary mission is ending the AIDS \n                epidemic through innovative research; and\n                    (B) that has experience carrying out programs \n                dedicated to AIDS cure research.\n            (2) Responsibilities.--The Secretary shall ensure that the \n        responsibilities of a nonprofit entity selected under paragraph \n        (1) include partnering with the Secretary to establish research \n        priorities for peer-reviewed funded research pursuant to \n        subsection (b).\n    (d) Annual Reports.--In each annual report on the Congressionally \nDirected Medical Research Program that the Secretary submits to \nCongress, the Secretary shall include information on the progress of \nthe research program established under subsection (a)(1).\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section $20,000,000 for each of fiscal \nyears 2013 through 2017."
