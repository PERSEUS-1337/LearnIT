FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Historically, courts in the United States have \n        recognized the undeniable differences between adult and youth \n        offenders.\n            (2) While writing for the majority in Roper v. Simmons (125 \n        S. Ct. 1183), a recent Supreme Court decision abolishing use of \n        the death penalty for juveniles, Justice Kennedy declared such \n        differences to be ``marked and well understood''.\n            (3) Notwithstanding such edicts, many youth are being \n        sentenced in a manner that has typically been reserved for \n        adults. These sentences include a term of imprisonment of life \n        without the possibility of parole.\n            (4) The decision to sentence youthful offenders to life \n        without parole is an issue of growing national concern.\n            (5) While there are no youth serving such sentences in the \n        rest of the world, research indicates that there are over 2,500 \n        youth offenders serving life without parole in the United \n        States.\n            (6) The estimated rate at which the sentence of life \n        without parole is imposed on children nationwide remains at \n        least 3 times higher today than it was 15 years ago.\n            (7) The majority of youth sentenced to life without parole \n        are first-time offenders.\n            (8) Sixteen percent of these individuals were age 15 or \n        younger when they committed their crimes.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHING A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR PAROLE FOR CHILD \n              OFFENDERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Requirements.--For each fiscal year after the \n        expiration of the period specified in subsection (d)(1), each \n        State shall have in effect laws and policies under which each \n        child offender who is serving a life sentence receives, not \n        less than once during the first 15 years of incarceration, and \n        not less than once every 3 years of incarceration thereafter, a \n        meaningful opportunity for parole or other form of supervised \n        release. This provision shall in no way be construed to limit \n        the access of child offenders to other programs and appeals \n        which they were rightly due prior to the enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Regulations.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall issue \n        guidelines and regulations to interpret and implement this \n        section.\n    (b) Definition.--In this section and section 4, the term ``child \noffender who is serving a life sentence'' means an individual who--\n            (1) is convicted of one or more offenses committed before \n        the individual attained the age of 18; and\n            (2) is sentenced, for such an offense or offenses, to a \n        term of imprisonment of life, or of any number of years \n        exceeding 15 years, cumulatively.\n    (c) Applicability.--This section shall apply to individuals \nsentenced before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (d) Compliance and Consequences.--\n            (1) Compliance date.--Each State shall have not more than 3 \n        years from the date of enactment of this Act to be in \n        compliance with this section, except that the Attorney General \n        may grant a 2-year extension to a State that is making a good \n        faith effort to comply with this section.\n            (2) Consequence of noncompliance.--For any fiscal year \n        after the expiration of the period specified in paragraph (1), \n        a State that fails to be in compliance with this section shall \n        not receive 10 percent of the funds that would otherwise be \n        allocated for that fiscal year to that State under subpart 1 of \n        part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \n        Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et seq.), whether characterized as \n        the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program or \n        otherwise.\n            (3) Reallocation.--Amounts not allocated under a program \n        referred to in paragraph (2) to a State for failure to be in \n        compliance with this section shall be reallocated under that \n        program to States that are in compliance with this section.\n\nSEC. 4.
