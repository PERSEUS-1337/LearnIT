The Support Group should develop \n        specific approaches to neighboring countries to take into \n        account the interests, perspectives, and potential \n        contributions such countries can make.\n\nSEC. 7. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Iraq Study Group Report advised, ``Sustained \n        increases in U.S. troop levels would not solve the fundamental \n        cause of violence in Iraq, which is the absence of national \n        reconciliation . . . Past experience indicates that the \n        violence would simply rekindle as soon as U.S. forces are \n        moved.''.\n            (2) The goal of United States policy in Iraq, as stated by \n        President George W. Bush, is an Iraq that can ``govern itself, \n        sustain itself, and defend itself''.\n            (3) In accordance with Recommendation 21 of the Iraq Study \n        Group Report, if the Iraqi Government does not make substantial \n        progress toward the achievement of milestones on national \n        reconciliation, security, and governance, the United States \n        should reduce its political, military, or economic support for \n        the Iraqi Government. There must be consequences if Iraq does \n        not perform.\n            (4) In a November 2006 Department of Defense report to \n        Congress regarding the status of security in Iraq, 91 of 118 \n        battalions, 30 of 36 brigades, and six of ten divisions were in \n        the lead when conducting operations, with the United States in \n        supporting roles. The Iraqi Ground Forces Command had command \n        and control of two of the ten Iraqi Army divisions and only two \n        of Iraq's 18 provinces were in Provincial Iraqi Control, \n        operating independently of Coalition forces. Thus, there is an \n        urgent, near-term need for putting a time-table on when Iraqi \n        forces need to be trained, equipped, and in the lead of \n        security operations, tied to conditional funding, which may \n        give the Iraqi Government the incentive it needs to take \n        control of its security.\n            (5) The Iraq Study Group's recommendations for Iraq's goals \n        for national reconciliation, security, and governance include--\n                    (A) the reintegration of Baathists and Arab \n                nationalists into the government;\n                    (B) disarming, demobilizing, and reintegrating \n                militia members into civilian society;\n                    (C) the accruing of oil revenues to the central \n                government to be shared on the basis of population; and\n                    (D) amending the Iraq Constitution.\n            (6) The Iraq Study Group estimated the United States has \n        appropriated $34 billion to support the reconstruction of Iraq, \n        of which $21 billion has been appropriated for the Iraq Relief \n        and Reconstruction Fund.\n            (7) As part of the comprehensive strategy supported by the \n        Iraq Study Group, the United States should embark on a ``robust \n        diplomatic effort to establish an international support \n        structure intended to stabilize Iraq and ease tensions in other \n        countries of the region''.\n            (8) In his address to the Nation on the Iraq War on January \n        10, 2007, President Bush stated America would hold the \n        Government of Iraq to the benchmarks it has announced--the \n        Iraqi Government plans to take responsibility for security in \n        all of Iraq's provinces by November 2007, Iraq will pass \n        legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis, the Iraqi \n        Government will spend $10 billion of its own money on \n        reconstruction and infrastructure projects that will create new \n        jobs, Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections later in 2007, \n        and the Iraqi Government will reform de-Baathification laws and \n        establish a fair process for considering amendments to the Iraq \n        Constitution.\n            (9) In the State of the Union Address on January 23, 2007, \n        President Bush stated ``Iraq's leaders know that our commitment \n        is not open-ended. They have promised to deploy more of their \n        own troops to secure Baghdad, and they must do so. They have \n        pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction \n        or political party. And they need to follow through and lift \n        needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these \n        troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of \n        the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed themselves \n        to a series of benchmarks to achieve reconciliation--to share \n        oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of \n        Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to re-\n        enter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and \n        to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi province.''.\n    (b) Limitation on Assistance.--\n            (1) In general.--Beginning on December 31, 2007, assistance \n        described in paragraph (2) may be provided to the Government of \n        Iraq only if the President certifies to the congressional \n        defense committees that--\n                    (A) the Iraqi Government has approved laws to--\n                            (i) reintegrate Baathists and Arab \n                        nationalists into the government;\n                            (ii) disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate \n                        militia members into civilian society; and\n                            (iii) provide for the accruing of oil \n                        revenues to the central government to be shared \n                        on the basis of population;\n                    (B) the Iraqi Government has amended the Iraq \n                Constitution as appropriate to guarantee the rights of \n                all Iraqi citizens;\n                    (C) the Iraqi Government is making significant \n                progress to control its security forces, including \n                significant progress to ensure that the security forces \n                are able to take the lead in security operations; and\n                    (D) each of Iraq's provinces is under the control \n                of provincial Iraqi governmental authorities.\n            (2) Assistance described.--Assistance referred to in \n        paragraph (1) is assistance provided under any provision of law \n        for the Iraqi security forces or for the relief and \n        reconstruction of Iraq.\n\nSEC. 8.
