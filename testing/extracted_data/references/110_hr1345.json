    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) employees working on Cold War-era nuclear weapons were \n        employed in hundreds of facilities owned by the Federal \n        Government and private sector producing and processing \n        radioactive materials for use in the nuclear weapons program of \n        the United States beginning in the mid-1940's;\n            (2) those atomic workers helped to build the nuclear \n        arsenal that served as a deterrent to the Soviet Union during \n        the Cold War, but many paid a high price in terms of their \n        health;\n            (3) during the Cold War, many atomic workers were exposed \n        to radiation and placed in harm's way by the Department of \n        Energy and contractors, subcontractors, and vendors of the \n        Department--\n                    (A) without the knowledge and consent of the \n                workers;\n                    (B) without adequate radiation monitoring; and\n                    (C) without necessary protections from internal or \n                external occupational radiation exposures;\n            (4) due to the inequities posed by the factors described in \n        paragraph (3) and the resulting potential harm, Congress \n        legislatively designated classes of Cold War-era workers at the \n        Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge K-25, and the \n        Amchitka Island test sites as members of the Special Exposure \n        Cohort under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n        Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.);\n            (5)(A) the contribution of the State of New York to the \n        security of the United States throughout the Cold War was very \n        significant; and\n            (B) New York is home to 36 former atomic weapons employer \n        facilities and sites of the Department of Energy that produced \n        and processed radioactive materials, carried out classified \n        research, operated nuclear reactors, and processed high level \n        nuclear waste, 14 of which are located in the western region of \n        New York;\n            (6) research by the Department of Energy, the National \n        Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Advisory \n        Board on Radiation and Worker Health, and congressional \n        committees indicates that--\n                    (A) workers at certain facilities were not \n                adequately monitored for internal or external exposures \n                to ionizing radiation to which the workers were exposed \n                during the 1940's to 1960's; and\n                    (B) at other facilities, records were not \n                maintained, are not reliable, or fail to measure the \n                radioactive isotopes to which workers were exposed;\n            (7) at Bethlehem Steel in Lackawanna, New York, an atomic \n        weapons employer facility (as defined in section 3621 of the \n        Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act \n        of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384l)), no personal radiation dosimetry \n        monitoring records are available;\n            (8) if it is determined that it is not feasible to estimate \n        radiation dose with sufficient accuracy and there is a \n        reasonable likelihood that a class of workers may have been \n        endangered, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is \n        authorized, after receiving advice from the Advisory Board on \n        Radiation and Worker Health, to designate additional classes of \n        workers as members of the Special Exposure Cohort under section \n        3626 of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n        Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384q);\n            (9) the Secretary of Health and Human Services promulgated \n        regulations on May 28, 2004, to establish procedures for \n        classes of individuals to petition for membership in the \n        Special Exposure Cohort;\n            (10) section 3626(b) of the Energy Employees Occupational \n        Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384q(b)) \n        provides for the designation of an additional class of \n        employees in the Special Exposure Cohort if it is not feasible \n        to estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose that \n        the class received and there is a reasonable likelihood that \n        the radiation dose may have endangered the health of members of \n        the class; and\n            (11) legislation is needed to provide additional parameters \n        to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Advisory \n        Board on Radiation and Worker Health for evaluating petitions \n        for the Special Exposure Cohort in cases in which there is \n        limited or nonexistent individual radiation exposure monitoring \n        or an absence of records.\n\nSEC. 2.
