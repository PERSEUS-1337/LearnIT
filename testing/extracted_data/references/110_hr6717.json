    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Energy Cut the Red Tape \nNow Act of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Gas prices have skyrocketed to record high levels and \n        are negatively impacting America's economy, consumers, and \n        businesses.\n            (2) In July 2006, the average price of gas in the United \n        States was $2.98 per gallon and the price of a barrel of oil \n        was $68.86.\n            (3) As of July 1, 2008, the average price of gasoline in \n        the United States was $4.07 per gallon and the price of a \n        barrel of oil was $142.00.\n            (4) The United States currently imports from foreign \n        nations over 60 percent of all crude oil, gasoline, and diesel \n        fuel consumed by Americans annually.\n            (5) The Minerals Management Service has estimated that \n        88.85 billion barrels of oil are available in the Outer \n        Continental Shelf (OCS) areas of the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic \n        Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska, yet over 80 percent of the \n        OCS is under Federal leasing moratorium.\n            (6) The United States Geological Survey estimates that \n        there are 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Arctic \n        National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).\n            (7) The Bureau of Land Management estimates that the United \n        States holds the world's largest known unconventional oil \n        source, known as oil shale, and that more than 70 percent of \n        American oil shale lies on Federal land, primarily in Colorado, \n        Utah, and Wyoming.\n            (8) These Federal lands contain an estimated 1.23 trillion \n        barrels of oil, which is more than 50 times the Nation's proven \n        conventional oil reserves.\n            (9) There are currently no unconventional fuels leasing \n        programs operating in the United States that would allow oil \n        and gas companies to explore and drill for oil.\n            (10) The Federal Government could open land in Colorado, \n        Utah, and Wyoming for oil exploration and the United States \n        could offset all of its imports from Saudi Arabia according to \n        Bureau of Land Management statistics.\n            (11) There has not been a new oil refinery built in the \n        United States since 1981 and between 1980 and 2006 over half of \n        existing United States refineries closed.\n            (12) The current bureaucratic permitting process to drill \n        for oil and gas contributes to extensive delays in exploring \n        United States natural resources.\n            (13) It has been estimated that it takes seven years and an \n        average of $5,000,000,000 for one offshore platform to be built \n        and permitted before natural gas or oil is produced.\n\nSEC. 3. TERMINATION OR WAIVER OF RESTRICTIONS ON LEASING FOR \n              EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT, AND PRODUCTION OF OIL, GAS, AND \n              OIL SHALE DURING PERIOD OF HIGH OIL PRICES.\n\n    (a) Termination of Statutory Prohibitions.--Any Federal law that \nprohibits the leasing of Federal Outer Continental Shelf, Bureau of \nLand Management, or National Forest lands or Federal submerged lands \nfor exploration, development, or production of oil, gas, or oil shale, \nthat withdraws such lands from such leasing, or that prohibits the \nexpenditure of Federal funds for such leasing, shall have no force or \neffect.\n    (b) Waiver of Permit Requirements.--The Secretary of the Interior--\n            (1) may waive the application of any provision of Federal \n        law that requires a permit to engage in drilling for oil or gas \n        under a lease of Federal lands or Federal submerged lands for \n        exploration, development, or production of oil or gas, during \n        any period in which the most recent the spot market price for \n        West Texas Intermediate crude oil at the domestic spot market \n        at Cushing, Oklahoma, as published by the Energy Information \n        Administration, is less than $100 per barrel; and\n            (2) shall waive the application of such provisions during \n        any period in which the most recent such spot market price is \n        greater than $100 per barrel.\n\nSEC. 4.
