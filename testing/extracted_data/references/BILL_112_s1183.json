FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant \n        ecological and public health concern;\n            (2) it is estimated that approximately 410,000 children \n        born each year in the United States are exposed to levels of \n        mercury in the womb that are high enough to impair neurological \n        development;\n            (3) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have \n        found that 6 percent of women in the United States of \n        childbearing age have blood mercury levels in excess of values \n        determined to be safe by the Environmental Protection Agency;\n            (4) exposure to mercury occurs largely by consumption of \n        contaminated fish, but fish and shellfish are important sources \n        of dietary protein, and a healthy fishing resource is important \n        to the economy of the United States;\n            (5) in many locations, the primary route for mercury input \n        to aquatic ecosystems is atmospheric emissions, transport, and \n        deposition;\n            (6) computer models and other assessment tools provide \n        varying effectiveness in predicting mercury concentrations in \n        fish, and broad-scale data sets are insufficient to test model \n        predictions; and\n            (7) a comprehensive national mercury monitoring network to \n        accurately quantify regional and national changes in \n        atmospheric deposition, ecosystem contamination, and \n        bioaccumulation of mercury in fish and wildlife in response to \n        changes in mercury emissions would help policy makers, \n        scientists, and the public to better understand the sources, \n        consequences, and trends in United States mercury pollution.\n\nSEC. 3.
