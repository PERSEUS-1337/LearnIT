FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Cable rates continue to rise substantially faster than \n        the overall rate of inflation.\n            (2) Wire-based competition in video services is limited to \n        very few markets. According to the Federal Communications \n        Commission, only 2 percent of all cable subscribers have the \n        opportunity to choose between 2 or more wire-based video \n        service providers.\n            (3) It is only through wire-based video competition that \n        price competition exists. The Government Accountability Office \n        has confirmed that where wire-based competition exists, cable \n        rates are 15 percent lower than in markets without competition.\n            (4) It is in the public interest to further wire-based \n        competition in the video services market in order to provide \n        greater consumer choice and lower prices for video services.\n            (5) To spur competition in the communications industry, \n        Congress has decreased the regulatory burden on new entrants, \n        thereby increasing entry into the market and creating \n        competition.\n            (6) The United States continues to fall behind in broadband \n        deployment rates. According to a recent study by the \n        International Telecommunications Union, the United States is \n        now ranked 16th in the world in broadband deployment.\n            (7) The deployment of advanced high capacity networks would \n        greatly spur economic development in rural America.\n            (8) The deployment of advanced networks that can offer \n        substantially higher capacity are critical to the long-term \n        competitiveness of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO COMMUNICATIONS ACT.\n\n    Title VI of the Communication Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 521 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                        ``PART VI--VIDEO CHOICE\n\n``SEC. 661.
