FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) inorganic arsenic compounds, such as chromated copper \n        arsenate (referred to in this Act as ``CCA''), are used as wood \n        preservatives;\n            (2) according to the Environmental Protection Agency--\n                    (A) inorganic arsenic is a human poison;\n                    (B) exposure to inorganic arsenic may be fatal; and\n                    (C) at low levels, inorganic arsenic exposure may \n                cause--\n                            (i) nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea;\n                            (ii) decreased production of red and white \n                        blood cells;\n                            (iii) abnormal heart rhythm; and\n                            (iv) blood vessel damage;\n            (3) the Department of Health and Human Services has \n        determined that arsenic is a known carcinogen;\n            (4) breathing inorganic arsenic increases the risk of lung \n        cancer;\n            (5) ingesting inorganic arsenic increases the risk of skin \n        cancer and tumors of the bladder, kidney, liver, and lung;\n            (6) to protect against health risks associated with the use \n        of CCA, CCA is classified as a ``restricted use chemical'';\n            (7) as a restricted use chemical, CCA may be purchased and \n        used only by a certified applicator (or a person under the \n        direct supervision of a certified applicator) whose \n        certification specifically covers the purchase and use of CCA;\n            (8) individuals who use arsenic to treat wood are required \n        to wear--\n                    (A) protective clothing; and\n                    (B) a respirator, if the level of arsenic in the \n                ambient air of the workplace of the individual--\n                            (i) is unknown; or\n                            (ii) exceeds the permissible exposure limit \n                        of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air \n                        averaged over an 8-hour workday, as required \n                        under standards established by the Occupational \n                        Safety and Health Administration;\n            (9) producers of pressure-treated wood are required to \n        provide consumer information sheets to all lumber yards and \n        other retailers of treated wood products;\n            (10) those information sheets provide instructions on how \n        consumers should handle treated wood products, such as \n        instructions on the use of protective gloves, coveralls, and \n        face masks when sawing treated wood products; and\n            (11) because many consumers in the United States are \n        unaware of the dangers of mishandling arsenic-treated wood, an \n        appropriate consumer warning label should be affixed to each \n        piece of arsenic-treated wood sold in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. LABELING OF ARSENIC-TREATED WOOD.\n\n    The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n\n          ``Subtitle D--Commodity-Specific Labeling Standards\n\n``SEC. 281.
