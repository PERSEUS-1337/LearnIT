FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Encouraging the participation in Federal contracting of \n        small businesses owned and controlled by socially and \n        economically disadvantaged individuals is in the Federal \n        Government's interest, helps spur competition and innovation, \n        and supports community-level economic revitalization and \n        entrepreneurship.\n            (2) Small businesses are key engines of economic growth, \n        but they have had difficulties accessing Federal contracting \n        and procurement opportunities and participating in federally \n        funded projects, particularly in the area of transportation.\n            (3) Congress has supported efforts to ensure that small \n        businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically \n        disadvantaged individuals are regular participants in projects \n        funded by agencies throughout the Federal Government.\n            (4) The United States Department of Transportation has used \n        Disadvantaged Business Enterprise programs to ensure \n        nondiscrimination in the award and administration of contracts \n        by entities receiving funds through the Department's highway, \n        transit, and airport financial assistance programs.\n            (5) Congress and the Department have also worked to ensure \n        that--\n                    (A) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise programs are \n                narrowly tailored to provide a level playing field on \n                which small businesses owned and controlled by socially \n                and economically disadvantaged individuals can compete \n                fairly for contracts awarded by entities receiving \n                Department assistance;\n                    (B) only small businesses that meet the eligibility \n                requirements for Disadvantaged Business Enterprise \n                programs are permitted to participate in such programs;\n                    (C) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise programs \n                assist the development of small businesses that can \n                compete successfully in the marketplace outside of such \n                programs; and\n                    (D) recipients of Department assistance have \n                appropriate flexibility in providing opportunities for \n                small businesses owned and controlled by socially and \n                economically disadvantaged individuals.\n            (6) Congress has supported efforts to encourage veteran-\n        owned small businesses to participate in Federal contracting \n        and procurement opportunities, including by creating and \n        strengthening programs and institutions for veterans who own or \n        operate small businesses and requiring the President to \n        establish an annual Government-wide goal of at least 3 percent \n        for the award of procurement contracts to small businesses \n        owned by service-disabled veterans.\n\nSEC. 2.
