FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) although urban land use planning, growth management, \n        and other functions of State, local, regional, and tribal \n        agencies are rightfully within their jurisdiction, the Federal \n        Government can and should play an important role in the \n        development and demonstration of innovative techniques to \n        improve comprehensive land use planning and growth management;\n            (2) the United States is making a major investment in \n        acquiring remote sensing and other geospatial information from \n        both governmental and commercial sources;\n            (3) while much of the data is being acquired for scientific \n        and national security purposes, it also can have important \n        applications to help meet societal goals;\n            (4) it has already been demonstrated that Landsat data and \n        other earth observation data can be of enormous assistance to \n        Federal, State, local, regional, and tribal agencies for urban \n        land use planning, coastal zone management, natural and \n        cultural resource management, and disaster monitoring;\n            (5) remote sensing, coupled with the emergence of \n        geographic information systems and satellite-based positioning \n        information, offers the capability of developing important new \n        applications of integrated sets of geospatial information to \n        address societal needs;\n            (6) the full range of applications of remote sensing and \n        other forms of geospatial information to meeting public sector \n        requirements has not been adequately explored or exploited;\n            (7) the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, \n        Presidential Decision Directive 23 of 1994, and the Commercial \n        Space Act of 1998 all support and promote the development of \n        United States commercial remote sensing capabilities;\n            (8) many State, local, regional, tribal, and Federal \n        agencies are unaware of the utility of remote sensing and other \n        geospatial information for meeting their needs, even when \n        research has demonstrated the potential applications of that \n        information;\n            (9) even when aware of the utility of remote sensing and \n        geospatial technologies in the area of wildland fire management \n        to detect and monitor a wildland fire in real-time from the \n        early stages of fire growth, many State, local, regional, and \n        tribal agencies are hampered by a lack of overall strategy \n        guiding interagency management of resources and technology, \n        according to a September 2003 Government Accounting Office \n        report;\n            (10) remote sensing and other geospatial information, \n        especially when used in a coordinated approach, can be \n        particularly useful to State, local, regional, and tribal \n        agencies in the area of urban planning, especially in their \n        efforts to plan for and manage the impacts of growth, \n        development, and sprawl, as well as in wildland fire management \n        and environmental impact and disaster relief planning and \n        management;\n            (11) the United States Geological Survey, in coordination \n        with other agencies, can play a unique role in demonstrating \n        how data acquired for scientific purposes, when combined with \n        other data sources and processing capabilities, can be applied \n        to assist State, local, regional, and tribal agencies and the \n        private sector in decisionmaking in such areas as agriculture, \n        weather forecasting, and forest management; and\n            (12) in addition, the United States Geological Survey, in \n        conjunction with other agencies, can play a unique role in \n        stimulating the development of the remote sensing and other \n        geospatial information sector through pilot projects to \n        demonstrate the value of integrating governmental and \n        commercial remote sensing data with geographic information \n        systems and satellite-based positioning data to provide useful \n        applications products.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Director'' means the Director of the United \n        States Geological Survey;\n            (2) the term ``geospatial information'' means knowledge of \n        the nature and distribution of physical and cultural features \n        on the landscape based on analysis of data from airborne or \n        spaceborne platforms or other types and sources of data; and\n            (3) the term ``institution of higher education'' has the \n        meaning given that term in section 101(a) of the Higher \n        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)).\n\nSEC. 4.
