In the case of a variable rate loan \n        with an initial interest rate that may be different than the \n        rate or rates that will apply during subsequent periods, the \n        annual percentage rate shall be computed taking into account \n        the subsequent rates.\n            ``(2) Based on information provided by the consumer, the \n        consumer's total monthly debt payments will exceed 60 percent \n        of the consumer's monthly gross income, immediately after the \n        loan is consummated. The Board may establish a different debt \n        to income ratio if the Board determines that such a ratio is in \n        the public interest and is consistent with the purposes of this \n        Act.\n            ``(3) All points and fees payable at or before closing will \n        exceed 8 percent of the total loan amount.''; and\n            (2) by redesignating subsections (v), (w), (x), (y), and \n        (z) as (w), (x), (y), (z), and (aa), respectively.\n    (b) Material Disclosures.--Section 103(u) of the Truth in Lending \nAct (15 U.S.C. 1602(u)) is amended by striking ``and the due dates or \nperiods of payments scheduled to repay the indebtedness.'' and \ninserting ``the due dates or periods of payments scheduled to repay the \nindebtedness, and the disclosures for high cost mortgages required by \nparagraphs (1) through (6) of section 129(a).''.\n    (c) Definition of Creditor Clarified.--Section 103(f) of the Truth \nin Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1602(f)) is amended by adding at the end: \n``Notwithstanding the above, any person who originates 2 or more high \ncost mortgages a year, or who originates a high cost mortgage through a \nloan broker, is a creditor for the purposes of section 129.''.\n    (d) Disclosures Required and Certain Terms Prohibited.--The Truth \nin Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) is amended by adding after \nsection 128 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 129.
