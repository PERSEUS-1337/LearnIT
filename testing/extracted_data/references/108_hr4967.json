SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Nursing Home Fire \nSafety Act of 2004''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On February 26, 2003, a fire at a Hartford, \n        Connecticut, nursing facility without an automatic fire \n        sprinkler system claimed the lives of 16 patients.\n            (2) On September 27, 2003, a fire at a Nashville, \n        Tennessee, nursing facility without an automatic fire sprinkler \n        system claimed the lives of 15 patients.\n            (3) The National Fire Protection Association finds no \n        record of a multiple death fire in a nursing facility equipped \n        with an automatic fire sprinkler system.\n            (4) An estimated 1.5 million of the nation's elderly \n        population reside in nursing facilities.\n            (5) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n        estimates that of the approximate 17,000 nursing facilities \n        nationwide, about 25 percent do not have an automatic fire \n        sprinkler system.\n            (6) Many State governments lack requirements for their \n        nursing facilities that were not originally equipped with \n        automatic fire sprinkler systems to be retrofitted with such \n        systems.\n            (7) Automatic fire sprinkler systems greatly improve the \n        chances of survival for older adults in the event of a fire.\n\nSEC. 2.
