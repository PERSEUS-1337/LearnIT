FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Pulmonary hypertension is a serious and often fatal \n        condition where the blood pressure in the lungs rises to \n        dangerously high levels. In pulmonary hypertension patients, \n        the walls of the arteries that take blood from the right side \n        of the heart to the lungs thicken and constrict. As a result, \n        the right side of the heart has to pump harder to move blood \n        into the lungs, causing it to enlarge and ultimately fail.\n            (2) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous \n        potential for finding a cure or effective treatment, the \n        Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension must be expanded, \n        and collaboration among top pulmonary hypertension research \n        centers must be increased.\n            (3) Pulmonary hypertension remains a difficult diagnosis \n        and is rarely picked up in a routine medical examination. Even \n        in its later stages, the signs of the disease can be confused \n        with other conditions affecting the heart and lungs. The use of \n        new diagnostic standards has been positively related to the \n        rates of diagnosis.\n            (4) In the more advanced stages of pulmonary hypertension, \n        the patient is able to perform only minimal activity and has \n        symptoms even when resting, resulting in considerable \n        disability. The disease may worsen to the point where the \n        patient is completely bedridden.\n            (5) In 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \n        established the first pulmonary hypertension patient registry \n        in the world. The registry followed 194 people with pulmonary \n        hypertension over a period of at least one year and, in some \n        cases, more than seven years. Much of what is known about the \n        illness today stems from this study.\n            (6) Because the cause of pulmonary hypertension is still \n        not fully understood and there is still not a cure for \n        pulmonary hypertension, basic research studies are focusing on \n        the possible involvement of immunologic and genetic factors in \n        the cause and progression of pulmonary hypertension, looking at \n        agents that cause narrowing of the pulmonary blood vessels, and \n        identifying factors that cause growth of endothelial and smooth \n        muscle cells, and formation of scar tissue in the vessel walls.\n            (7) As research progresses, so do treatments for pulmonary \n        hypertension. Currently, there are six FDA-approved medications \n        for pulmonary hypertension and several more in trials. However, \n        not all medications are effective in all patients. In addition, \n        all pulmonary hypertension treatments have significant negative \n        side effects that impact patients' quality of life. Lung \n        transplantation is often considered a treatment of last resort \n        for pulmonary hypertension.\n            (8) The number of physicians who treat pulmonary \n        hypertension, and the number of pulmonary hypertension patients \n        receiving treatment, has grown exponentially over the past \n        decade, leading to the need for increased education of medical \n        professionals. In 2001, there were 100 identified physicians \n        treating pulmonary hypertension, and 3,000 patients receiving \n        treatment. In 2006, there were an estimated 3,000 such \n        physicians and 30,000 such patients. While pulmonary \n        hypertension treatment now includes the option of relatively \n        easy to administer oral therapies, effective management of \n        pulmonary hypertension remains complicated. Given the increase \n        in the number of physicians treating pulmonary hypertension, \n        education of medical professionals about pulmonary hypertension \n        management is critical to ensure optimal patient care.\n            (9) In December 2006, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \n        Institute hosted a landmark meeting of pulmonary hypertension \n        researchers and clinicians throughout the world. Over 500 \n        individuals attended, making this the largest such meeting \n        organized by a Federal department for this disease. During the \n        meeting, there was clear consensus that communication among \n        researchers is key to future advancement in the fight against \n        this devastating and expensive disease.\n\nSEC. 3.
