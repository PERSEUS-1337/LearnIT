    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal and Small Business Telework \nPromotion Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) Federal, State, and local governments spend billions of \n        dollars annually on the Nation's transportation needs;\n            (2) congestion on the Nation's roads costs over \n        $63,000,000,000 annually in lost work time, fuel consumption, \n        and costs of infrastructure and equipment repair;\n            (3) on average, on-road vehicles contribute 34 percent of \n        nitrogen oxides emissions;\n            (4) it is estimated that staying at home to work requires 3 \n        times less energy consumption than commuting to work;\n            (5) in 2000, it was reported that if an identified 10 to 20 \n        percent of commuters switched to teleworking, 1,800,000 tons of \n        regulated pollutants would be eliminated, 3,500,000,000 gallons \n        of gas would be saved, 3,100,000,000 hours of personal time \n        would be freed up, and maintenance and infrastructure costs \n        would decrease by $500,000,000 annually because of reduced \n        congestion and reduced vehicle miles traveled;\n            (6) the average American daily commute is 49 minutes for a \n        24-mile round trip (a total of 100 hours per year);\n            (7) the increase in work from 1969 to 1996, the increase in \n        hours mothers spend in paid work, combined with a shift toward \n        single-parent families resulted in families on average \n        experiencing a decrease of 22 hours a week (14 percent) in \n        parental time available outside of paid work they could spend \n        with their children;\n            (8) today 60 percent of the workforce is involved in \n        information work (an increase of 43 percent since 1990) \n        allowing and encouraging decentralization of paid work to \n        occur;\n            (9) telework reduces the volume of peak commuter traffic, \n        thereby reducing traffic congestion and air pollution;\n            (10) the Nation's communities can benefit from telework, \n        which gives workers more time to spend at home with their \n        families;\n            (11) it is in the national interest to raise awareness \n        within the small business community of telework options for \n        employees;\n            (12) the small business community can benefit from offering \n        telework options to employees because such options make it \n        easier for small employers to retain valued employees and \n        employees with irreplaceable institutional memory;\n            (13) companies with telework programs have found that \n        telework can boost employee productivity 5 percent to 20 \n        percent, thereby saving businesses valuable resources and time;\n            (14) individuals with disabilities, including disabled \n        American veterans, who own or are employed by small businesses \n        could benefit from telework to their workplaces;\n            (15) telework has the potential to provide more employment \n        opportunities in rural communities;\n            (16) estimates indicate that about 40,000,000 Americans are \n        currently teleworking;\n            (17) teleworking is seen as a valuable tool in worker \n        productivity and is of interest to the Federal workforce; and\n            (18) the Government Accountability Office notes that \n        140,694 employees teleworked, representing a 37 percent \n        increase from 2003, a growth that demonstrates a steady \n        escalation over time as the overall number of teleworkers in \n        the Federal Government has grown since 2001 with 72,844 \n        teleworkers, in 2002 with 90,010 teleworkers, and in 2003 with \n        102,921 teleworkers.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION OF EMPLOYEE VEHICLE FUEL CONSUMPTION BY FEDERAL \n              AGENCIES.\n\n    Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 \nU.S.C. 8253) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(f) Reduction of Employee Vehicle Fuel Consumption by Federal \nAgencies.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Each agency shall take such actions as \n        are necessary to reduce the level of fuel consumed by vehicles \n        of employees of the agency (other than fuel used for military \n        purposes), in connection with the employment of the employees, \n        by (to the maximum extent practicable) 10 percent or more \n        during the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of \n        this subsection.\n            ``(2) Methods.--An agency may use such methods as the \n        agency determines are appropriate to achieve the target \n        established by paragraph (1), including--\n                    ``(A) telework;\n                    ``(B) carpooling;\n                    ``(C) bicycling and walking to work;\n                    ``(D) fuel-efficient trip planning;\n                    ``(E) public transportation use; and\n                    ``(F) limiting travel days for vehicle travel \n                outside the office.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
