PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To establish measures to minimize bycatch and the \n        mortality of such bycatch of Atlantic Striped Bass, Morone \n        saxatilis, occurring in the non-directed fisheries that operate \n        in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone and encounter \n        Atlantic Striped Bass during seasonal migrations.\n            (2) To direct the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a study \n        of existing and new fishery observer data, to effectively map \n        migratory patterns, delineate wintering areas, and feeding \n        grounds of Atlantic Striped Bass in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive \n        economic zone.\n            (3) To delineate areas of highest Atlantic Striped Bass \n        discard and bycatch associated with mobile net gear on a \n        seasonal-, spatial-, temporal-, and gear-specific basis in the \n        waters off the Mid-Atlantic coast of the United States.\n            (4) To identify, through analysis of historical and \n        forthcoming at sea observer data, gear types, and fisheries \n        that experience high levels of Atlantic Striped Bass discard \n        and bycatch.\n            (5) To protect the historical opportunities of the \n        recreational Atlantic Striped Bass fishery, to protect the \n        various businesses and economic niches that are wholly or \n        partly dependent upon the recreational Atlantic Striped Bass \n        fishery, to protect the seasonal aggregations of Atlantic \n        Striped Bass that occur on wintering feeding grounds, to \n        protect the seasonal migrations of Atlantic Striped Bass that \n        occur in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone, to amass an \n        understanding of the bycatch of Atlantic Striped Bass in the \n        non-directed commercial fisheries.\n            (6) To protect the historical opportunities of the \n        recreational Striped Bass fishery to ensure the maintenance of \n        the Atlantic Striped Bass stock and will help achieve the \n        conservation goals.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Once primarily a coastal, near shore fishery, \n        increasing numbers of Atlantic Striped Bass are occupying the \n        Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone as management measures \n        have rebuilt stock levels to unprecedented levels.\n            (2) Variations in weather and oceanographic patterns have \n        allowed Atlantic Striped Bass to expand their range farther \n        offshore into the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone.\n            (3) Extensive coastal migrations of Atlantic Striped Bass, \n        which tend to be age- and sex-dependent, occur annually in the \n        Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone.\n            (4) Atlantic Striped Bass also aggregate on bottom features \n        that tend to hold forage fish, including herring, mackerel, \n        menhaden, and utilize these areas as winter-feeding grounds.\n            (5) These life history characteristics make large numbers \n        of Atlantic Striped Bass vulnerable to commercial fishing gear.\n            (6) Commercial fishing efforts coinciding with coastal \n        migrations of Atlantic Striped Bass and that occur on winter-\n        feeding grounds is creating a bycatch problem.\n            (7) A Federal moratorium on harvesting of Atlantic Striped \n        Bass in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone was \n        implemented in 1990 and it imposed possession and harvest \n        prohibitions by both recreational and commercial fishermen. \n        This conservation measure contributed to the eventual recovery \n        of the Atlantic Striped Bass stock and continues to keep \n        Atlantic Striped Bass fishing mortality rate below the \n        applicable target. Yet the bycatch problem in the Mid-Atlantic \n        exclusive economic zone by the non-directed fisheries is having \n        a negative effect on these benefits and further is in violation \n        of the national standard set forth in section 301(a)(9) of the \n        Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.\n            (8) As the bycatch of Atlantic Striped Bass increases, it \n        may increase the fishing mortality rate of Atlantic Striped \n        Bass above the 0.30 target as dictated in Amendment 6 of the \n        Interstate Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Striped Bass. \n        Provisions in Amendment 6 further attempt to increase the \n        number of larger Atlantic Striped Bass in the population and \n        develop a fuller age structure. Preliminary reports indicate \n        that the growing stock of Atlantic Striped Bass in the Mid-\n        Atlantic exclusive economic zone is largely composed of older \n        fish, which would compromise the conservation goals of \n        Amendment 6 which attempts to increase the percentage of the \n        larger Atlantic Striped Bass. This Act will initiate data \n        collection to better understand this issue and move forward \n        with the necessary management measures.\n\nSEC. 4.
