FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Truancy is the first sign of trouble--the first \n        indicator that a young person is giving up and losing his or \n        her way.\n            (2) Many students who become truant eventually drop out of \n        school, and high school drop outs are two and a half times more \n        likely to be on welfare than high school graduates; twice as \n        likely to be unemployed, or if employed, earn lower salaries.\n            (3) Truancy is the top-ranking characteristic of \n        criminals--more common than such factors as coming from single-\n        parent families and being abused as children.\n            (4) High rates of truancy are linked to high daytime \n        burglary rates and high vandalism.\n            (5) As much as 44 percent of violent juvenile crime takes \n        place during school hours.\n            (6) As many as 75 percent of children ages 13-16 who are \n        arrested and prosecuted for crimes are truants.\n            (7) Some cities report as many as 70 percent of daily \n        student absences are unexcused, and the total number of \n        absences in a single city can reach 4,000 per day.\n            (8) Society pays a significant social and economic cost due \n        to truancy: only 34 percent of inmates have completed high \n        school education; 17 percent of youth under age 18 entering \n        adult prisons have not completed grade school (8th grade or \n        less), 25 percent completed 10th grade, and 2 percent completed \n        high school.\n            (9) Truants and later high school drop outs cost the Nation \n        $240 billion in lost earnings and foregone taxes over their \n        lifetimes, and the cost of crime control is staggering.\n            (10) In many instances, parents are unaware a child is \n        truant.\n            (11) Effective truancy prevention, early intervention, and \n        accountability programs can improve school attendance and \n        reduce daytime crime rates.\n            (12) There is a lack of targeted funding for effective \n        truancy prevention programs in current law.\n\nSEC. 3.
