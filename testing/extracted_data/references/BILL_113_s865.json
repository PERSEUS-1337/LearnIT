FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In the United States, the chance of a woman developing \n        breast cancer during her lifetime has increased from 1 in 11 in \n        1975 to 1 in 8 today.\n            (2) Worldwide, breast cancer is the most frequently \n        diagnosed cancer in women with 1,300,000 cases each year. \n        Breast cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death in \n        women, with more than 438,000 women dying from the disease \n        worldwide in 2010, a 37.5 percent increase since 1990.\n            (3) More than 90 percent of deaths from breast cancer are \n        caused by metastasis, which occurs when cancerous cells spread \n        to other organs or bone.\n            (4) The National Cancer Institute estimated that breast \n        cancer care in the United States cost $16,500,000,000 in 2010, \n        and cost the Nation $12,100,000,000 in lost productivity.\n            (5) Over the past 40 years, very little has improved the \n        incidence, morbidity, and mortality rates of breast cancer.\n            (6) In recognition of the complexity of breast cancer, \n        experts have identified the need to transform how research is \n        conducted by engaging investigators from many disciplines.\n            (7) Advances in understanding the progression of breast \n        cancer, particularly metastasis, have the potential to \n        translate to better understanding and preventing the spread of \n        other types of cancer.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There shall be established a commission to be known as the \nCommission to Accelerate the End of Breast Cancer (in this Act referred \nto as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.
