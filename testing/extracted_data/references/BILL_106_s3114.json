FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the average telephone penetration rate for Native \n        Americans on reservations is 47 percent (with some reservations \n        as low as 16 percent) as compared to 94 percent for the entire \n        United States;\n            (2) barriers to telephone penetration on Native American \n        reservations include poverty (the per capita income for Native \n        Americans is $8,234), the high cost of service due to sparse \n        population, and geographic challenges; and\n            (3) without telephone service, individuals cannot obtain \n        access to medical care in an emergency (911 service), cannot \n        reach prospective employers quickly and easily, and cannot take \n        advantage of the educational, medical, and commercial \n        opportunities offered by the Internet.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF LOAN PROGRAM.\n\n    The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                  ``TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n``SEC. 601.
