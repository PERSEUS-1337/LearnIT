    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medicaid DSH \nIntegrity Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (``DSH'') \n        payments are a critical source of funding for many safety net \n        hospitals that provide essential access to care for the poor \n        and uninsured.\n            (2) The statutory reporting and auditing requirements added \n        by the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization \n        Act of 2003 are important to provide assurances to Congress, \n        the Department of Health and Human Services, States and the \n        public that DSH funds are being used to fulfill their intended \n        statutory purpose of assisting hospitals that serve a \n        disproportionate share of low-income individuals.\n            (3) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued \n        Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations (as defined in \n        section 2(d)) that, in implementing those reporting and \n        auditing requirements, also implemented changes to underlying \n        DSH policy which have the effect of narrowing the scope of DSH \n        payments that may be made for many States.\n            (4) In adding those reporting and auditing requirements, \n        Congress did not intend to alter the definition of DSH-eligible \n        costs or to narrow the scope of DSH payments that may be made \n        under the existing DSH program and the substantive standards in \n        section 1923(g) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-\n        4(g)).\n            (5) The policy changes in such regulations would result in \n        DSH payment reductions of millions of dollars to critical \n        safety net providers that have long participated in the \n        Medicaid DSH program under payment methodologies previously \n        approved by CMS.\n\nSEC. 2. REVISION OF MEDICAID DSH AUDITING AND REPORTING REGULATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \nconsultation with States and disproportionate share hospitals (as \ndetermined for purposes of the Medicaid DSH program), shall--\n            (1) indicate, in appropriate guidance, that CMS does not \n        intend to enforce any changes in policy related to the \n        calculation of the limits under section 1923(g)(1)(A) of the \n        Social Security Act that were contained in the Medicaid DSH \n        auditing and reporting regulations; and\n            (2) publish an interim final rule to revise the Medicaid \n        DSH auditing and reporting regulations at sections 447.299(c) \n        and 455.304 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, as \n        necessary--\n                    (A) to correct policy changes related to the \n                calculation of the limits under section 1923(g)(1)(A) \n                of the Social Security Act;\n                    (B) to provide appropriate guidance for otherwise \n                implementing the Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting \n                regulations; and\n                    (C) to provide for the regulatory changes described \n                in subsection (b).\n    (b) Regulatory Changes To Be Included in New Interim Final Rule.--\nThe regulatory changes described in this subsection are the following:\n            (1) In defining the costs of furnishing services to \n        individuals with no health insurance (or other source of third-\n        party coverage), CMS shall permit inclusion of all costs \n        related to services provided to patients with no insurance for \n        the service rendered, even if the patient has insurance that \n        covers other services. The receipt by a hospital of nominal \n        payments related to a service shall not constitute health \n        insurance or a source of third-party coverage.\n            (2) Consistent with prior guidance of CMS contained in a \n        letter to State Medicaid directors on August 17, 1994, CMS \n        shall permit States to use the definition of allowable costs in \n        its State Medicaid plan, or any other definition, in computing \n        such costs as long as the costs determined under such a \n        definition do not exceed the amounts that would be allowable \n        under the Medicare principles of cost reimbursement. CMS shall \n        interpret the language of the audit requirement at section \n        1923(j)(2)(C) of the Social Security Act describing ``inpatient \n        hospital and outpatient hospital services'' to be consistent \n        with the term ``hospital services'' as used in section \n        1923(g)(1)(A) of such Act and not to indicate an intent by \n        Congress for a more restrictive interpretation of such section \n        1923(g)(1)(A).\n            (3) CMS shall, as appropriate, revise the General DSH Audit \n        and Reporting Protocol referenced in the Medicaid DSH auditing \n        and reporting regulations and issued at the same time as those \n        regulations, in particular, to permit the use of either an \n        overall cost-to-charge ratio or departmental cost-to-charge \n        ratios.\n            (4) CMS shall revise section 455.304(d)(2) of title 42, \n        Code of Federal Regulations, to permit alternative \n        methodologies for determining actual costs, including through \n        trending forward costs from prior years.\n    (c) Initiation of Requirements.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 1923(j) of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1396r-4(j)) is amended by striking ``2004'' and \n        inserting ``2008''.\n            (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n        shall be effective as if included in the enactment of the \n        Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act \n        of 2003 (Public Law 108-173).\n    (d) Definitions.--In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``CMS'' means the Centers for Medicare & \n        Medicaid Services.\n            (2) The term ``Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting \n        regulations'' means the final regulation issued on December 19, \n        2008, and published beginning at 73 Federal Register 77904.\n            (3) The term ``Medicaid DSH program'' means the program of \n        payment adjustments under section 1923 of the Social Security \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-4).\n            (4) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health \n        and Human Services, acting through CMS."
