FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The region which includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, \n        and Ohio was once known as the Northwest Territory. It was the \n        first frontier region of the new United States of America. Some \n        of the indigenous peoples of the area were the Delaware, \n        Kikapoo, Miami, Ottawa, Piankeshaw, Potowatami, Shawnee, Wea, \n        and Wyandotte Indians.\n            (2) The distinctive landscape of this area was largely \n        defined by--\n                    (A) the Ordinance of 1785, which established a \n                system of transferring land ownership from the Indians \n                to the United States Government and then to private \n                owners, and created the system of land surveyance and \n                township and county plats which remains today;\n                    (B) the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which \n                established a process through which self-government in \n                this first frontier of the newly organized United \n                States could be established; and\n                    (C) the Treaty of Greeneville of 1795, which \n                signaled the end of Indian resistance in the region.\n            (3) The local environmental and topographical landscape of \n        the area was largely defined in commercial and strategic terms \n        by--\n                    (A) the area river systems, including but not \n                limited to--\n                            (i) the Fox River, the Illinois River, and \n                        the Kankakee River, in the State of Illinois;\n                            (ii) the Eel River, the Elkhart River, the \n                        Kankakee River, the Maumee River, the St. \n                        Joseph River, the St. Mary's River, and the \n                        Wabash River in the State of Indiana;\n                            (iii) the Detroit River, the St. Mary's \n                        River, and the St. Joseph River in the State of \n                        Michigan; and\n                            (iv) the Great Miami River, the Maumee \n                        River, and the St. Mary's River in the State of \n                        Ohio;\n                    (B) the Great Lakes;\n                    (C) the River Portage Trails, including but not \n                limited to--\n                            (i) the 3 mile portage from the St. Joseph \n                        River to the Little Wabash River in Fort Wayne, \n                        which was the only separation in the waterway \n                        from the upper Great Lakes to the Gulf of \n                        Mexico; and\n                            (ii) from the Great Miami River to the St. \n                        Mary's and Wabash Rivers in Ohio;\n                    (D) the 13 forts which developed in the region, \n                including but not limited to--\n                            (i) Fort Dearborn, in Chicago, Illinois;\n                            (ii) Fort Wayne, in Fort Wayne, Indiana;\n                            (iii) Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island, \n                        Michigan; and\n                            (iv) Fort Defiance, in Defiance, Ohio; and\n                    (E) the settlements, including Native American \n                villages, early trading posts, and territorial capitals \n                that developed in the region.\n            (4) The military history of the region includes, but is not \n        limited to--\n                    (A) LaBalme's Defeat in 1780;\n                    (B) the defeat of General Harmar in 1790;\n                    (C) the defeat of General St. Clair in 1791;\n                    (D) the United States victory by General ``Mad'' \n                Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794; \n                and\n                    (E) the Battle of Lake Erie in 1832.\n            (5) The confederacy of Indian Nations was organized by \n        Tecumseh and ``The Prophet'' to stop American advancement. \n        General William Henry Harrison defeated The Prophet at the \n        Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. This was the last major battle \n        east of the Mississippi River with Indian Nations and led to \n        the famous slogan ``Tippecanoe and Tyler too'', which propelled \n        Harrison to the Presidency of the United States.\n            (6) The War of 1812, during which the region might have \n        been lost to Canada without Commodore Perry's victory at Put-\n        in-Bay on Lake Erie.\n            (7) The rush of settlers to the region after the War of \n        1812 led to additional treaties and conflict with the Native \n        Americans. Most Indians were removed in a series of events \n        culminating with the so-called ``Black Hawk Wars'', which ended \n        in 1833.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act include the conservation, \ninterpretation, and development of the historical, cultural, natural, \nand recreational resources related to the region historically referred \nto as the Northwest Territory of the Great Lakes during the period from \n1785 to 1835.\n\nSEC. 3.
