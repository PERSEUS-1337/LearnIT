FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The November 10, 1995, execution by hanging of Ken \n        Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni environmental activists was \n        carried out by the Government of Nigeria after a trial that \n        ignored the fundamental standards of legal process, and despite \n        the pleas for clemency by the African and international \n        community, as well as the United States Administration, the \n        Chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n        International Relations of the House of Representatives, and \n        the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and the co-\n        chairs of the Human Rights Caucus of the House of \n        Representatives.\n            (2) The United Nations recommended in both March and April \n        of 1996 that the Government of Nigeria release the bodies of \n        the Ogoni Nine for proper burial and paid compensation to the \n        families of the deceased.\n            (3) This heinous action followed an October 1, 1995, \n        ambiguous statement by Nigerian military leader General Sani \n        Abacha, that the country would be returned to civilian \n        democratic rule in three years, and a lifting of the ban on \n        political parties while at the same time not repealing the \n        Treasonable Offenses Decree which allows the arrest of anyone \n        speaking against the government.\n            (4) General Abacha's announcement was pressured by the \n        outrage of the international community for his March 1995 \n        arrest and conviction to long prison terms by secret trial of \n        some 43 persons for involvement in a so-called coup. Among \n        those convicted and still incarcerated are former President \n        General Olusegun Obasanjo, the only military leader in Nigeria \n        to return power to democratic civilian rule, General Shehu Musa \n        Yar-Adua, deputy to the President in Abaasanjo's \n        Administration, and later, human rights activist Beko Ransome-\n        Kuti.\n            (5) The people of Nigeria and the international community \n        had been led to believe that the presidential election held in \n        Nigeria on June 12, 1993, would result in a return to full \n        democratic civilian rule in Nigeria.\n            (6) General Ibrahim Babangida, the head of Nigeria's \n        military government at the time of the June 12, 1993, election \n        interrupted the release of the election results on June 23, \n        1993, and later annulled the election, thereby preventing a \n        return to civilian rule.\n            (7) The election process indicated that voters in Nigeria--\n        a country with a population of approximately 90,000,000 persons \n        comprising 250 ethnic groups and spread across 357,000 square \n        miles--were expressing a spirit of national unity that \n        transcended ethnic, religious, and regional allegiances.\n            (8) The reported returns suggested that Chief M.K.O. Abiola \n        of the Social Democratic Party was receiving a substantial \n        majority of the votes cast, leading the poll in 20 of the 30 \n        States in Nigeria.\n            (9) The annulment of the presidential elections resulted in \n        various forms of civil unrest, which in turn led to the deaths \n        of more than 100 persons.\n            (10) An interim government established by General Babangida \n        on August 27, 1993, and headed by Ernest Shonekan, failed to \n        win the support of the Nigerian people.\n            (11) General Sani Abacha took power on November 17, 1993, \n        appointing an unelected Provisional Ruling Council to govern \n        Nigeria.\n            (12) Chief M.K.O. Abiola was imprisoned in solitary \n        confinement for over one year for pressing his claim as the \n        elected democratic leader of Nigeria, and still remains \n        incarcerated today.\n            (13) The political and economic conditions in Nigeria have \n        continued to deteriorate in the months since Abacha took \n        control of the country.\n            (14) The faith of the Nigerian people in the viability of \n        the nation as a unified whole must be preserved, and the \n        balkanization of Nigeria guarded against.\n            (15) The people of Nigeria have not accepted the \n        continuation of military rule and have courageously spoken out \n        in favor of the rapid return of democratic and civilian rule.\n            (16) On May 15, 1994, a broad coalition of Nigerian \n        democrats formed the National Democratic Coalition calling upon \n        the military government to step down in favor of the winner of \n        the June 12, 1993 election.\n            (17) The confidence of the Nigerian people and the \n        international community in the Provisional Ruling Council's \n        commitment to the restoration of democracy can only be \n        established by a sustained demonstration of a commitment to \n        human rights, due process, and the return of civilian rule.\n            (18) The United States would prefer to have a relationship \n        with Nigeria based upon cooperation and mutual support but \n        cannot, and will not, condone or overlook the denial of \n        democratic civilian rule, against the clear wishes of the \n        Nigerian people, by the Provisional Ruling Council or any other \n        body in Nigeria.\n            (19) The lack of support from the Nigerian authorities on \n        drug trafficking issues forced the United States for the last 2 \n        years to place Nigeria on the list of countries penalized for \n        failure to seriously address the narcotics proliferation issue, \n        thus endangering vulnerable youth in our communities.\n            (20) Continuing credible reports of widespread corruption \n        and questionable business practices in the Nigerian Government \n        and ``scams'' in the United States, and the lack of cooperation \n        in addressing these problems by the Nigerian Government, \n        further undermines Nigeria's credibility in the international \n        community, and is a constant embarrassment to approximately \n        1,000,000 law-abiding Nigerian Americans.\n            (21) Nigeria's leadership role on the African continent, \n        especially in the area of peacekeeping, will be severely \n        compromised by its failure to rejoin the world community of \n        democratic nations.\n            (22) Nigeria was recently suspended from the Commonwealth, \n        a forum linking Britain and former colonies, and African \n        countries like South Africa have already called for diplomatic, \n        economic, and sports sanctions, since the limited sanctions \n        imposed by the United States Administration have had little \n        effect in safeguarding the lives of the people of Nigeria and \n        moving Nigeria toward democracy.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Commitment to Unity and Democracy by the Nigerian People.--The \nCongress continues to support the Nigerian people in their commitment \nto unity and democracy as evidenced by their participation in the June \n12, 1993, presidential election in Nigeria, and in their subsequent \ninsistence on the return to full civilian and democratic rule.\n    (b) Actions Taken by the United States.--While the Congress \nendorses the limited steps taken by the Administration to demonstrate \nUnited States opposition to the annulment of the June 12, 1993, \npresidential election in Nigeria, more needs to be accomplished to \nencourage the restoration of fully democratic and civilian rule in \nNigeria.\n    (c) Sanctions to be Implemented in Coordination With International \nCommunity.--The Congress declares that the sanctions against Nigeria \ncontained in this Act should be taken in concert with the international \ncommunity and the United Nations to the maximum extent possible.\n    (d) Increase in Democracy Building and Rule of Law Assistance.--The \nCongress declares that the finite foreign assistance resources of the \nUnited States Government provided to Nigeria should be re-prioritized \nwithin present budget levels in order that more funds can be expended \nfor democracy building and the promotion of the rule of law through \nnongovernmental organizations in Nigeria.\n\nSEC. 4.
