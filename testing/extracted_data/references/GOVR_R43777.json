    "content": "The mission of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is to serve the United States by providing reliable scientific information to describe and understand the Earth; minimize loss of life and property from natural disasters; manage water, biological, energy, and mineral resources; and enhance and protect the nation's quality of life. The USGS is housed in the Department of the Interior (DOI), and part of its mission is to provide scientific information to other agencies and bureaus within DOI. This information is used to manage land, fish, and wildlife resources under the supervision of DOI. More broadly, the USGS conducts domestic as well as international scientific activities related to global scientific and natural resource issues. The aim of these activities is to improve the effectiveness of the U.S. government to carry out domestic missions, address U.S. foreign policy and national security interests, and increase the competitiveness of the U.S. private sector in the global economy.  The USGS conducts scientific activities under seven interdisciplinary mission areas: (1) water resources; (2) climate and land use change; (3) energy and minerals; (4) natural hazards; (5) core science systems; (6) ecosystems; and (7) environmental health. In the USGS accounts for appropriations, environmental health is combined with the Energy and Minerals mission area, and there is a Science Support and Facilities account. (See descriptions later in the report for more detail.) Within these program areas, the USGS relies on geologists, geophysicists, hydrologists, biologists, volcanologists, and cartographers, among others, to conduct research, monitoring, and data collection. USGS researchers often work in cooperation with other federal and state agencies, and in some cases with local cooperators, through agreements. Unlike other agencies within DOI, the USGS does not have authority to manage large tracts of public lands, nor does it have authority to construct infrastructure or modify waterways or habitat. Further, the USGS does not have regulatory authority under any statute. Congress has a broad interest in the activities of the USGS. Many scientific studies conducted by the agency affect areas of congressional interest. For example, the USGS conducts oil, gas, and mineral resource assessments that help Congress evaluate federal land use policy and provide broad-scale information for private-sector resource development. The USGS also collects data from large-scale ecosystems (e.g., Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes) that are used to inform ecosystem restoration initiatives. The agency also conducts large- and small-scale studies of water resources throughout the country, addressing both water quality and quantity, which assist decision makers at all levels of government that manage water use.  Congress has been involved in the direction and oversight of the USGS since its inception and has enacted several laws that authorize its activities. The USGS has evolved to be one of the primary scientific agencies of the U.S. government, covering a broad range of scientific topics for multiple audiences in the federal, state, local, and private sectors. The expanded role of the USGS since its Organic Act, however, has caused some in Congress to question if study areas such as ecosystem science and coastal stewardship, among others, represent the best direction and best allocation of resources for the USGS. They note that the USGS Organic Act specifically addresses classifying public lands and examining geologic structures and mineral resources, but that current USGS mission areas are much broader. Others praise the USGS for being one of the foremost scientific agencies of the U.S. government, and note that conducting research in each of its mission areas (e.g., energy and mineral resources, water resources, climate change, and others) addresses many issues of broad importance to the United States. The broadened nature of the USGS mission since it was established may be a direct result of Congress diversifying USGS activities by expanding its authority in legislation. The Appendix of this report provides a chronology of authorizing legislation affecting the USGS. Because of recent congressional interest in the scope of the USGS mission, how it has changed since its inception, and how the agency is currently structured and funded, this report explores the evolution of the USGS since the USGS Organic Act in 1879 and its present structure. Table 1 provides a snapshot of current USGS appropriations, and Table 2 provides a chronology of some of the key developments in USGS history since 1879.  The roots of the USGS existed before it was officially created and authorized as a federal agency in 1879. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and subsequent territorial acquisitions necessitated that mapping and surveying land in the United States be a priority of the federal government. Mapping was critical for classifying lands, organizing the distribution of lands, and securing the frontier. Various government entities participated in mapping throughout the 19 th century, and these efforts were later integrated, in part, within the USGS. State and federal involvement in geology also contributed to the creation of the USGS. States created geological surveys to foster internal improvements and develop natural resources. Some note that the state-run geological surveys resulted from an interest in mining for gold and other precious metals. The creation of the USGS was prompted in part by a report by the National Academy of Sciences that provided recommendations for surveying various topographical and geological aspects of the United States. Among other things, the report called for the creation of three new bureaus under DOI, of which one was the USGS. The primary purpose of the USGS, according to the report, would be to study the geological structure and economic resources of the United States. Largely based on this report, Congress authorized the creation of the USGS in an appropriations bill, named the Sundry Civil Expenses bill, passed on March 3, 1879, which became known as the USGS Organic Act. The act established the USGS to classify the public lands and examine the geological structure, mineral resources, and products within the national domain. A key excerpt from the act stating the authority of the Director of the USGS states: The Director of the United States Geological Survey, which office is established, under the Interior Department, shall be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. This officer shall have the direction of the United States Geological Survey, and the classification of the public lands and examination of the geological structure, mineral resources, and products of the national domain. The Director and members of the United States Geological Survey shall have no personal or private interests in the lands or mineral wealth of the region under survey, and shall execute no surveys or examinations for private parties or corporations.  The USGS Organic Act specifically authorized the examination of the geological structure and mineral resources of the nation, but did not specifically address water resources, ecosystem resources, natural hazards, and climate change, all of which are current mission areas in the USGS. Some have argued that \"products of the national domain\" could include water and ecosystem resources, but the intent behind the definition and scope of the word \"product\" was not specified in the authorizing language. The first Director of the USGS, Clarence King (1879-1881), apparently sensed that the mandate for the USGS was broad and established a framework for USGS activities. He stated that Congress intended the agency's mission to include a classification of all public domain lands, and later attempted to expand the scope of the USGS from a western focus to include the entire United States. King also led USGS efforts to establish and implement a mining geology program to collect mineral statistics in the western states. The interpretation and application of the authorities in the USGS Organic Act were molded by subsequent actions of its directors and by Congress. Further, the scope of the USGS was expanded by administrative decisions and laws that directly or indirectly authorized many current activities. (See Figure 1 for an illustration of key authorities and transitions for the USGS since 1879; see Table 2 for a chronology of specific events.) Starting with its first Director, discussed above, the USGS defined and changed the scope of the agency beyond its initial implementation of the 1879 Organic Act. For example, under its second Director, John Wesley Powell (1881-1894), the USGS broadened its work to include topographical mapping, paleontological studies, and stratigraphic studies to support the geological mapping program. The shift toward topography at this time was short-lived, however, as the budgets of the USGS and other federal science agencies were reduced substantially in the early 1890s. The USGS subsequently broadened its role to aid any industry (not just the mineral industry) in the knowledge and application of geology under its next director, Charles Walcott (1894-1907). USGS involvement in water resources, including the deployment and monitoring of streamgages, was also initiated under Wolcott's Administration.  In addition to actions of the USGS Directors, Congress authorized and appropriated funds for certain projects and initiatives that defined and changed the scope of the USGS. Further, Congress passed laws that directly amended the Organic Act to expand the scope of the USGS. For example, the Organic Act was amended in 1986 to authorize the USGS to conduct projects in cooperation with other federal, state, and private entities. Congress also authorized specific projects, which later expanded into program areas within the USGS. For example, efforts to study water resources by the USGS began in 1888 with an authorization by Congress to study the irrigation capacity of arid regions of the United States. This study identified areas where irrigation was necessary for agriculture; investigated water storage behind dams; measured streamflow; and designated sites that had the potential for reservoirs, canals, and ditches for irrigation purposes. This congressional authorization marked the beginning of USGS involvement in water resource studies of the United States.  Ecosystem studies in the USGS derived from the incorporation of biological studies into the USGS mission in 1996. In 1994, all of the biological research functions from all of the bureaus within DOI were consolidated into a new bureau, the National Biological Survey (NBS). The intent behind the NBS was to have an independent science agency to conduct research in a manner that insulates the science from those who manage federal lands and draft government regulations. Scientists from DOI agencies were transferred to this new bureau, mostly coming from the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Some argued that the NBS would distance scientists from the political pressures facing DOI agencies, and that the NBS would give visibility to research being conducted within DOI and reduce overlap of DOI research. However, in 1996 this bureau (then called the National Biological Service) was moved into the USGS and named the Biological Resources Division (BRD). The transfer of NBS to the USGS was intended to encourage the independent nature of scientific research. Further, according to the conference report for P.L. 104-134 , the BRD was to pay attention to \"wildlife resources entrusted to the stewardship of the Department; fisheries, including restoration of depleted stocks; fish propagation and riverine studies; aquatic resources; nonindigenous nuisances that affect aquatic ecosystems; impacts and epidemiology of disease on fish and wildlife populations; chemical drug registration for aquatic species; and effective transfer of information to natural resources managers.\" The BRD was transformed during a 2011 reorganization and became part of the Ecosystem program area. The general framework of independent scientific research stayed in place. The scope of USGS activities also has expanded in response to domestic and worldwide events. During both world wars, USGS activities broadened to include searching for strategic minerals and improving topographic maps. In the 1920s, energy shortages prompted Congress to direct the USGS to determine the known geological structure of producing oil and gas fields so that leases could be issued. This activity followed the enactment of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, which authorized the federal government to issue mining leases on federal lands. In 1964, a 9.2 magnitude earthquake in Alaska prompted USGS scientists to participate in a task force that guided rebuilding efforts. Consequently, the USGS Center for Earthquake Research was established in Menlo Park, CA, during that same year.  The scope of scientific work done by the USGS expanded beyond U.S. borders several times during its history. Amendments to the Organic Act in 1962 stated that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized, through the USGS, to conduct scientific activities outside of the national domain, when it is determined by the Secretary to be of the national interest. For example, international work currently conducted by the USGS includes addressing scientific and technological issues associated with climate variation, providing global petroleum and mineral resource assessments, and monitoring natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, flooding, and earthquakes.  Despite an increase in the scope of its authority and activities, on several occasions the USGS has shed some responsibilities and activities. In some cases, departments within the USGS have splintered off to form separate federal agencies and bureaus. For example, the U.S. Reclamation Service was originally established within the USGS under the authority of the Reclamation Act of 1902. The Reclamation Service studied potential water development projects in each western state with federal lands. The Service became the Bureau of Reclamation in 1907 when work under the Reclamation Act progressed from planning to construction. Other examples include the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the U.S. Forest Service, which were both derived from USGS functions. In 1982, part of the USGS staff and operating budget were reorganized and formed the separate Minerals Management Service (MMS), reorganized again following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to become the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), and the Bureau of Safety Environment and Enforcement (BSEE). Most organizational changes to the USGS throughout the 20 th and 21 st centuries have been confined to specific departments and programs. However, in 2011 the USGS reorganized its science programs into interdisciplinary program areas related to those outlined in the USGS 2007-2017 Strategic Plan. The USGS shifted to interdisciplinary mission areas, including Ecosystems; Climate Variability and Land-use Change; Energy and Minerals; Environmental Health; Natural Hazards and Risk Resilience Assessments; Water Resources; and Informatics and Data Integration. In addition, the USGS created an office for science quality and integrity. (See Figure 2 .)  The justification for realignment was to reduce barriers in the budget and management structure of the USGS that hindered the interdisciplinary nature of problem solving. The realigned program areas represent interdisciplinary entities that are intended to reflect the best structure for solving current natural science challenges, according to the USGS. Further, the realignment was intended to facilitate collaboration among various departments and programs within the USGS and increase collaboration across geographic boundaries among management.  USGS activities are organized under seven interdisciplinary mission areas that cover (1) water resources; (2) climate and land use change; (3) energy and minerals; (4) natural hazards; (5) core science systems; (6) ecosystems; and (7) environmental health. In its budget request, USGS also includes Science Support and Facilities under its mission areas. The following sections provide an overview of the responsibilities for each mission area, as well as the Science Support and Facilities program areas. Ecosystems \u2014Under this mission area, scientists investigate how ecological and geological processes affect the structure, function, and resilience of ecosystems. Many studies are regionally based in ecosystems such as the Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, and Florida Everglades. Other studies are national in scope. Authority for conducting activities under the Ecosystem program area is derived largely from laws that authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct research on recreation, and fish and wildlife issues. Water Resources \u2014This mission area covers scientific activities that involve collecting, assessing, and disseminating hydrological data; and analysis and research on hydrological systems and methods for water conservation. This program contains the National Streamflow Information sub-program and the Cooperative Water sub-program, both of which fund streamgages throughout the nation. Climate and Land Use Change \u2014This mission area is split into several components that collectively provide science to inform policy makers and stakeholders on the effect of climate and landuse change on natural resources within the United States. The mission area covers five sectors including National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and DOI Climate Science Centers; climate research and development; carbon sequestration science; land remote sensing; and land change science. Work in this area reflects the DOI Strategic Plan goal for providing science to address ecosystem, landuse, and climate effects on resources. The Land Use Change subprogram enables users to access and use Earth observation imagery collected via satellites. Energy and Minerals \u2014This mission area includes research and assessments on the nation's mineral and energy resources. There are two components within this program area: mineral resources and energy resources, Within this context, scientific activities address how energy and mineral resources influence landscape, water, climate, ecosystems, and human health. Environmental Healt h \u2014This mission area addresses the relationship between environmental and human health and the physical environment. Specifically, contaminant biology and toxic substances hydrology are two sub-programs. The contaminant biology sub-program reflects the goal to understand energy and mineral resources in the context of the life cycle of the energy or mineral commodity. Interactions between ecological processes, geological processes and contaminants and pathogens are studied under this area. Studying the effects of toxic chemicals on fish reproduction and the effect of insecticides on honeybee die-offs are examples of work done under this mission area. Natural Hazards \u2014This mission area provides scientific information and knowledge necessary to address and mitigate the effects of natural hazards such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, storm surges, and landslides. The Coastal and Marine Geology sub-program addresses the coastal effects of natural hazards, such as the impacts of hurricanes and tsunamis on the coast, and the effects of rising relative sea level on coastal ecosystems and communities. Core Science Systems \u2014The Core Science Systems program provides data in a geospatial framework for managing resources and planning for natural hazards. Science Support \u2014This budget area includes funding for administrative activities and information needs. Some examples include education services and the evaluation of science quality and integrity. Facilities \u2014The Facilities budget area includes funding for sites where USGS activities are housed\u2014offices, laboratories, storage, parking, and more\u2014as well as eight large research vessels. The FY2015 budget request for the USGS was $1.073 billion, which was $41.3 million more than the FY2014 enacted level of $1.032 billion. The House Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Committee reported an Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY2015. The USGS would receive $1.036 billion under this reported bill; this would be approximately $3.7 million over the FY2014 enacted amount and $37.6 million less than the Administration's request. (See Table 1 .) The Administration requested increases compared to the FY2014 enacted amounts for all USGS programs except for Science Support, which would receive a $2.4 million decrease, and Natural Hazards, which would receive flat funding. For the Ecosystems program area, there was an increase of approximately $10.8 million, including an increase of $4.0 million for the Invasive Species sub-program. Further, there was a requested increase of $18.4 million for the Climate Variability sub-program, including an increase of $11.6 million for Climate Science Centers administered by the USGS. The USGS is charged with implementing and maintaining the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) and its regional entities\u2014referred to as the DOI Climate Science Centers (CSCs). These centers support research, assessment, and synthesis of global change data for use at regional levels. The CSCs aim to evaluate global climate change models at scales that are appropriate for research managers of species and habitats, and facilitate data integration and outreach to collaborators and stakeholders, including federal agencies. For FY2015, the Administration proposes to use the centers to conduct adaptation planning for issues such as sea level rise and drought, as well as work with tribal communities, and to create a system for facilitating adaptation coordination among agencies. The House reported bill proposed small increases or flat funding for all USGS programs compared to the FY2014 enacted level except Core Science Systems and Science Support, which would be decreased by $0.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively.  The largest difference between the House reported bill and the Administration's request was for the Climate Variability sub-program. The Administration request of $72.0 million for the Climate Variability sub-program is $18.4 million above the FY2014 level; the House reported bill would be $3.0 million above the FY2014 level. (See Table 1 for more details.) Historically, appropriations for the USGS rose dramatically after the Second World War, and peaked in inflation-adjusted dollars in the late 1970s ( Figure 3 ). Funding for the agency rose again in the 1990s, but has yet to reach its peak funding level (inflation-adjusted).  This section reviews some selected issues related to the USGS that have been of interest to Congress.  Some in Congress contend that the mission of the USGS has expanded beyond the scope of its organic act to the detriment of its original focus on geology and resources. They note that with competing interests, such as ecosystem research, potentially less funding and effort is devoted to traditional USGS endeavors such as assessing energy supplies. In contrast, some others note that the USGS has expanded its scope due to congressional direction in terms of authorities and allocation of funding. Further, they note, the mission of the USGS has changed over time to reflect the needs of the country. For example, Ecosystems Program Area, created in the 2011 reorganization within USGS is targeted toward integrating the cross-disciplinary nature of USGS ecosystem related studies into one mission area to serve the scientific needs of large-scale ecosystem restoration initiatives, some of which have been authorized by Congress. However, critics of this expanded USGS mission contend that ecosystem based research should not be a focus of USGS; rather, research on fish and wildlife and their habitat should be the responsibility of other agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).  The USGS role as the scientific agency within DOI was partly defined by the need to separate scientific inquiry from regulatory responsibility. Stakeholders did not want scientific results to come from the same agency that has regulatory responsibilities. The USGS role as the primary scientific agency has continued to evolve. Ecosystem level scientific studies that relate to restoration, habitat assessment, and species survival that are integral to DOI's mission, some contend, should continue to be the responsibility of the USGS. Another distinction between research at USGS and other government entities is that USGS conducts science in support of natural resource management versus managing natural resources, a priority for FWS and other DOI agencies.  Some contend that the role of USGS as the scientific agency of DOI might be eroding due to the expansion of scientific expertise and programs within other DOI agencies. For example, FWS has a science support program area that the Administration is attempting to increase. In the FY2015 Administration's request, $31.6 million is proposed for Science Support under FWS, almost double the amount of funds appropriated to this program in FY2014. Increasing the scientific capacity of FWS might weaken the argument that the USGS is the scientific agency for DOI and some might question if FWS and USGS scientific efforts are overlapping or coordinated in certain mission areas.  A related question is how USGS balances its efforts among program areas and whether certain program areas should have greater resources than others. While the allocation of funding for programs under USGS is a responsibility of Congress, USGS does address the issue of balance through a process for framing and guiding its research. Approximately every 10 years the USGS creates a Science Strategy to guide its scientific efforts. The latest strategy was created in 2007 and extends through 2017. This strategy formed the basis for reorganizing the USGS from its traditional discipline-based program areas to interdisciplinary program areas in 2011. The question of whether USGS is overreaching its authorities in conducting scientific activities in nontraditional subject areas might be answered through an analysis of congressional authorizations for USGS activities. (See Appendix for citations and descriptions of selected USGS authorities.) While the Organic Act provides the Director with broad authority, USGS has interpreted this language as providing flexibility to carry out a wide variety of scientific activities that address issues of national significance. Further, some USGS activities not directly specified by law are considered complementary to DOI actions and activities authorized under law. The DOI agency support role for the USGS has allowed the agency to conduct many activities or initiatives that are not specifically authorized by law, but instead are initiated by the Director or the Secretary of the Interior. For example, the USGS is participating in the DOI Powering Our Future Initiative by supporting agencies responsible for alternative energy permitting and developing methodologies to assess the impacts of wind energy, among other things. The USGS maintains a network of over 8,000 streamgages that monitor streamflow throughout the country. These streamgages monitor water flow and quality and aid in the collection and retention of streamflow data for the nation. Streamgage data have many applications including measuring flows to manage water supplies for urban, agricultural, and municipal water uses; measuring flows for assessing flooding or drought events; measuring water quality; and providing data to help inform compact or treaty requirements; among other things. Streamgages are funded through the USGS National Streamflow Information Program (NSIP), the USGS Cooperative Water Program, other federal agencies and over 800 state and local funding partners. (See box below for the most recent authorizing legislation concerning streamgages.) The NSIP was formed in 1999 by the USGS to consolidate and better manage the network of approximately 3,086 streamgages that are funded completely by the federal government. Other streamgages are cooperatively funded with other stakeholders and are administered through the Cooperative Water Program (CWP) of the USGS. This program is a partnership between the USGS and approximately 1,400 state, local, and tribal agencies. The USGS and its cooperating parties sign joint-funding agreements to share the cost of specific data collection and investigations undertaken by the USGS. Some streamgages are partially funded by other federal agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.  Funding streamgages is a perennial challenge for the USGS. Each year, there is a mix of certain streamgages that are proposed for discontinuation and other streamgages that are proposed for construction. Stakeholders that rely on streamgages which are proposed for discontinuation usually petition the USGS or cooperative entities to continue to fund the streamgages. An underlying question for the program is how many resources should be devoted to the NSIP streamgage network versus the Cooperative Water Program streamgage network. For FY2015, the Administration has requested an increase of $1.2 million for the NSIP, but a decrease of $3.3 million for the Cooperative Water Program. This could indicate a slight shift to fortifying the national network of streamgages and monitoring from cooperative efforts. In several cases, cooperative efforts to administer streamgages were discontinued due to the stakeholders not providing sufficient funds to support the streamgages. While there does not appear to be opposition to streamgages in Congress, the question remains of how much funding should be allocated toward maintaining streamgages and a streamgage network.  Landsat satellites record and transmit space-based images of the Earth's land surface. The Landsat program represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of land remote sensing data. Stakeholders working in fields such as agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning, education, mapping, emergency response and disaster relief, and global change research use Landsat data. Landsat is a joint initiative between USGS and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). On February 11, 2013, NASA launched Landsat 8, a remote sensing satellite jointly operated by the USGS and NASA that represents the latest in a line of Earth-observing satellites that first began on July 23, 1972, with the launch of Landsat 1. In the current partnership, NASA develops the satellite and the instruments, launches the spacecraft, and checks its performance. After it is launched, USGS takes over satellite operations and manages and distributes the data. All Landsat data held in the USGS archive are available for download with no charge and with no restrictions. Since 1972, Landsat satellites have continuously gathered land imagery from space using several instruments mounted on the satellite. The instruments have generally improved in capability with the launch of each successive mission, and the resulting imagery data provide a long-term record of natural and human-caused changes to the Earth's land surface. Currently two satellites\u2014Landsat 7 and Landsat 8\u2014orbit the Earth at an altitude of 438 miles and complete 14 full orbits each day and cross every point on Earth once every 16 days. Landsat 7 carries an instrument called the enhanced thematic mapper, which captures visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, and thermal radiation reflected back from the Earth's surface. These observations allow users to distinguish soil from vegetation, and deciduous from coniferous trees; estimate peak vegetation; discriminate soil moisture content; and provide other information about the land surface. Landsat 8 carries two instruments: an operational land imager, which observes many of the same bands of radiation as Landsat 7 but with improvements; and a thermal infrared sensor as well.  The record of continuous observations by Landsat satellites over 40 years means that users can identify land-cover changes that happen slowly and subtly and are revealed by comparing current observations against those decades ago, like changes in the course of a river; and those that occur rapidly and devastatingly, like a volcanic eruption. The long-term comparability of observations is generally considered a prime value of the Landsat program. Some would also argue that the no-cost data policy for Landsat imagery is also a prime value of the program, but the current no-cost policy does not reflect the varied history of the program and earlier attempts to privatize Landsat. In addition to recurring interest in privatizing or commercializing Earth observing satellite data, such as Landsat, other issues regarding the future of Landsat may be of interest to Congress. A perennial question would be whether the value of the imagery to its user community is worth the cost and effort of designing, building, launching, and operating the next Landsat satellite. Typically the timeline from design and planning to launch and operations takes years, sometimes approaching a decade or longer. Also, are there other sources of moderate resolution remote sensing data similar or comparable to Landsat available from other satellites operated by other countries? If so, what would be the advantages and disadvantages of acquiring data from those sources, versus a U.S.-built and operated satellite? Part of that discussion would necessarily include an evaluation of the intrinsic value of 40+ years of continuous observations from a series of comparable satellites and instruments\u2014unique to Landsat\u2014and what would be the consequences of terminating that long-term record. Several natural disasters have hit the United States in recent years, ranging from hurricanes to drought. These disasters have generated congressional interest in the science behind natural hazards and efforts to mitigate their effects and predict their occurrences. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-288 , also known as the Stafford Act) gives authority to federal agencies to issue disaster warnings. The Stafford Act and other statutes provides the USGS with the authority to issue warnings on geologic hazards, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 ( P.L. 95-124 ) and subsequent laws established the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), that authorizes the USGS to improve the basic understanding of earthquakes and characterize national earthquake risks, which are published as seismic hazard maps and used in support of building codes, among other applications.  Under its Natural Hazards Program area, the USGS pursues activities for other natural hazards, such as volcano hazards, landslide hazards, floods and droughts, and wildfire hazards. Arguably, the Organic Act provides authorization for these activities under the language directing the Survey to \"... examine the geological structure ... of the national domain.\" All of the types of natural hazards addressed by the USGS have some fundamental relationship to geological structure, some perhaps more clearly than others. Slip along geologic faults is the primary mechanism for earthquakes, and movement of magma in the Earth's crust leads to volcanic eruptions. Floods, droughts, and wildfires may be less clearly linked to underlying geologic causes. Ultimately, however, the motion of tectonic plates around the globe is responsible for the modern arrangement of the continents and oceans, which in part leads to weather and climate patterns, the underlying reasons for causing floods and droughts.  The USGS has investigated the geological aspects of natural hazards for a large part of its history. For example, the USGS has managed the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) continuously since 1947, and also managed the HVO between 1924 and 1935. The United States has 58 historically active volcanoes, mostly in Alaska, Hawaii, and the Pacific Northwest.  The USGS is also active in monitoring earthquakes and volcano hazards worldwide. For example, the Global Seismic Network (GSN), comprising over 150 seismic stations, is distributed globally to provide a permanent network of seismometers that help provide earthquake locations, information for earthquake hazard mitigation, and earthquake emergency response. The GSN works with the International Monitoring System which is part of the monitoring organization that ensures compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Prior to the GSN, the USGS funded the development and deployment of the Worldwide Standardized Seismographic Network in the early 1960s, which served research purposes as well as for treaty monitoring of nuclear testing. Some of the advances in modern global seismology emerged from the effort to monitor underground nuclear explosions beginning during the Cold War. One relatively recent addition to the natural hazards responsibilities at the USGS is how to deal with what is known as \"induced\" seismicity. The issue of induced seismicity has gained national attention because of its possible links to the deep-well injection and disposal of wastewaters from oil and gas operations. The number of deep disposal wells has spiked over the past 5-10 years because of the increase in the number of unconventional wells, namely shale gas and shale oil that benefitted from the process of hydraulic fracturing to recover oil and gas that was previously unrecoverable in economic quantities. (See text box, below, for a description of hydraulic fracturing and induced seismicity.) A challenge to the USGS seismic hazard evaluation is how to gage the earthquake hazard posed by induced seismicity versus the earthquake hazard that is related to tectonic forces.  Several Members of Congress and some stakeholders have suggested that the USGS expand its role in the area of natural hazards. The USGS has contributed an improved fundamental understanding of geological processes, together with improvements in technology, on mitigating the negative impacts of natural hazards. For example, several Congressmen have supported a letter requesting the Administration to provide additional funds to fully develop an Early Earthquake Warning System that would cover the West Coast. Although it is currently impossible to predict earthquakes accurately, an earthquake early warning system may provide some small amount of advance warning to mitigate severe damage and loss of life. An early earthquake warning system would work by detecting the first seismic wave to arrive after an earthquake\u2014the P wave\u2014and immediately transmitting the expected intensity and arrival time of the more damaging S- and surface-waves to critical locations and facilities. Just seconds of warning could allow critical power systems to go into a safe mode, alert medical professionals to stop delicate procedures, and mobilize emergency personnel to regions most likely affected by the strongest shaking. However, implementing such a system could be costly, potentially in the hundreds of millions if done for the nation. Other hazard mitigation initiatives include USGS work on understanding coastal processes and improving the ability to assess the nation's vulnerability to extreme coastal storms such as hurricanes. The improved will also likely yield better ways to predict how beaches will change after a big storm, and help support better management of coastal infrastructure and resources. For example, Figure 4 shows the elevation changes pre- and post-Superstorm Sandy within the Fire Island National Seashore, indicating where sand was eroded and resulted in a new channel opening up that cut through the island. Studies such as the one shown in Figure 4 provide some indication of the potential magnitude of change along sandy beach communities in the United States from a severe coastal storm. This type of information may help community planners, local zoning boards, and emergency response authorities, as well as local government leaders charged with evacuation responsibilities in the event of a pending coastal storm.  Table 2 provides a chronology of selected milestones in the history of the USGS since 1879. The USGS Organic Act 43 U.S.C. 31 et seq . The USGS Organic Act of March 3, 1879, as amended, establishes the United States Geological Survey.
