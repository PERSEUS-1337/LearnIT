The independent peer review panel, in addition to providing valuable expertise to the commission in evaluating the seismic studies, also operates to assure the public that the seismic studies are being performed in an appropriate manner. Because (1) the commission\u2019s current contracts for the independent peer review panel are set to expire on November 30, 2015, the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant is authorized to operate until August 26, 2025, by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and there continues to be enhanced seismic studies and surveys conducted that warrant review by the independent peer review panel to ensure the safety of the public, and (2) continuing the Nuclear Planning Assessment Special Account beyond the July 1, 2019, expiration date is vital to provide the public assurance that the maintenance of the state\u2019s nuclear emergency programs is in place, and will provide certainty for emergency planning and response preparedness should an emergency occur, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately."
