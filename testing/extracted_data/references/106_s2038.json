FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has the finest health care system in \n        the world. However, there is continuing concern and fear among \n        the public about the safety of the nation's health care system \n        as a result of a high occurrence of medical mistakes--the fifth \n        leading cause of death.\n            (2) One national study estimates that more than 100,000,000 \n        Americans have experience with medical errors and 1 out 3 cases \n        caused permanent harm, with half of the errors occurring in \n        hospitals.\n            (3) Three of the top patient-safety issues were exposure to \n        infection, level of care received, and the credentials of \n        health care professionals.\n            (4) A recent large-scale study indicates that at least \n        44,000 Americans may die each year as a result of medical \n        error. Another study suggests that this number may be as high \n        as 98,000 Americans.\n            (5) When using the lower estimate in paragraph (4), deaths \n        due to medical errors still exceed the number of deaths \n        attributable to motor vehicle accidents (43,458), breast cancer \n        (42,297), or AIDS (16,516).\n            (6) Deaths from adverse drug events total more than 7,000 \n        annually--exceeding the number of yearly workplace injuries \n        (6,000).\n            (7) The total national cost of preventable medical errors \n        resulting in injury is estimated to be between $17,000,000,000 \n        and $29,000,000,000, from direct medical costs, lost \n        productivity, and disability.\n            (8) One recent study found that about 2 out of every 100 \n        admissions involves a preventable adverse drug event. If these \n        findings are generalized, these adverse drug events affecting \n        inpatients cost $2,000,000,000 nationally.\n            (9) Medical errors are costly in terms of repeat tests and \n        medical countermeasures, which also are subject to compounding \n        errors. Purchasers and patients pay for errors when insurance \n        costs and co-payments are inflated by services that would not \n        have been necessary had proper care been provided.\n            (10) Errors also erode trust in the health care system by \n        patients who experience longer hospital stays or disabilities \n        and physical and psychological discomfort. Health care \n        professionals pay for errors with loss of morale and \n        frustration at not being able to provide the best care \n        possible.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that \nindividuals enjoy the right to be free from accidental injury, \naccidental death, and medication-related errors, including medication-\nrelated errors.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Title IX of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 299 et seq.) \nis amended--\n            (1) by redesignating part C as part D;\n            (2) by redesignating sections 921 through 928, as sections \n        931 through 938, respectively;\n            (3) in section 938(1) (as so redesignated), by striking \n        ``921'' and inserting ``931''; and\n            (4) by inserting after part B the following:\n\n                ``PART C--REDUCING ERRORS IN HEALTH CARE\n\n``SEC. 921.
