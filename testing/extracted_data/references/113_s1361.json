    "title": "World War II Merchant Mariner Service Act",
    "content": "to repeal sections 2, 3, and 6 of \n        the Neutrality Act of 1939, and for other purposes (Public Law \n        77-294; 55 Stat. 764) repealed section 6 of the Neutrality Act \n        of 1939 (related to the arming of United States vessels) and \n        authorized the President during the national emergency to arm \n        or permit to arm any United States vessel.\n            (4) On February 7, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, \n        through Executive Order Number 9054, established the War \n        Shipping Administration that was charged with building or \n        purchasing, and operating the civilian shipping vessels needed \n        for the war effort.\n            (5) During World War II, United States merchant mariners \n        transported goods and materials through ``contested waters'' to \n        the various combat theaters.\n            (6) At the conclusion of World War II, United States \n        merchant mariners were responsible for transporting several \n        million members of the United States Armed Forces back to the \n        United States.\n            (7) The GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202) \n        provided that the Secretary of Defense could determine that \n        service for the Armed Forces by organized groups of civilians, \n        or contractors, be considered ``active service'' for benefits \n        administered by the Veterans Administration.\n            (8) Department of Defense Directive 1000.20 directed that \n        the determination be made by the Secretary of the Air Force, \n        and established the Civilian/Military Service Review Board and \n        Advisory Panel.\n            (9) In 1987, three merchant mariners along with the AFL-CIO \n        sued Edward C. Aldridge, Secretary of the Air Force, \n        challenging the denial of their application for veterans \n        status. In Schumacher v. Aldridge (665 F. Supp. 41 (D.D.C. \n        1987)), the Court determined that Secretary Aldridge had failed \n        to ``articulate clear and intelligible criteria for the \n        administration'' of the application approval process.\n            (10) During World War II, women were repeatedly denied \n        issuance of official documentation affirming their merchant \n        marine seamen status by the War Shipping Administration.\n            (11) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) \n        identifies the following acceptable forms of documentation for \n        eligibility meeting the requirements set forth in GI Bill \n        Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202) and Veterans \n        Programs Enhancement Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-368):\n                    (A) Certificate of shipping and discharge forms.\n                    (B) Continuous discharge books (ship's deck or \n                engine logbooks).\n                    (C) Company letters showing vessel names and dates \n                of voyages.\n            (12) Coast Guard Commandant Order of 20 March, 1944, \n        relieved masters of tugs, towboats, and seagoing barges of the \n        responsibility of submitting reports of seamen shipped or \n        discharged on forms, meaning certificates of shipping and \n        discharge forms are not available to all eligible individuals \n        seeking to document their eligibility.\n            (13) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) states \n        that ``deck logs were traditionally considered to be the \n        property of the owners of the ships. After World War II, \n        however, the deck and engine logbooks of vessels operated by \n        the War Shipping Administration were turned over to that agency \n        by the ship owners, and were destroyed during the 1970s'', \n        meaning that continuous discharge books are not available to \n        all eligible individuals seeking to document their eligibility.\n            (14) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) states \n        ``some World War II period log books do not name ports visited \n        during the voyage due to wartime security restrictions'', \n        meaning that company letters showing vessel names and dates of \n        voyages are not available to all eligible individuals seeking \n        to document their eligibility.\n\nSEC. 3.
