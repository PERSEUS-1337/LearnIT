    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n     This Act may be cited as the ``Universal Prekindergarten Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) High-quality prekindergarten programs help children to \n        succeed academically. Children who attended a high-quality \n        prekindergarten program have higher academic achievement, lower \n        rates of grade retention, are less likely to be placed in \n        special education, and graduate from high school at higher \n        rates than those who did not.\n            (2) Early childhood education can reduce juvenile \n        delinquency rates. A 15-year study following 989 low-income \n        children who attended high-quality, comprehensive \n        prekindergarten found that they were 33 percent less likely to \n        be arrested, and 42 percent less likely to be arrested for a \n        violent crime, than children in the control group.\n            (3) There is currently a drastic shortage of affordable, \n        quality early education programs that are accessible for \n        working families.\n            (4) Full-day, full-calendar-year universal prekindergarten \n        programs would ensure all children 3, 4, and 5 years old have \n        access to school readiness programs and quality child care.\n            (5) Research shows that investing in quality \n        prekindergarten programs will provide savings in the form of \n        reduced need for remedial education, decreased crime rates, \n        lower school dropout rates, and decreased welfare dependence.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that all \nchildren 3, 4, and 5 years old have access to a high-quality full-day, \nfull-calendar-year prekindergarten program by providing grants to \nStates to assist in developing a universal prekindergarten program that \nis voluntary and free-of-charge.\n\nSEC. 3. PREKINDERGARTEN GRANT PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION.\n\n     The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Education, shall provide grants to an agency \ndesignated by each State (hereafter in this Act referred to as the \n``designated State agency'') for the development of high-quality full-\nday, full-calendar-year universal prekindergarten programs for all \nchildren 3, 4, and 5 years old in the State.\n\nSEC. 4.
