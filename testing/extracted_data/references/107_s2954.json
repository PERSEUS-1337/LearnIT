    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Student Testing Flexibility Act of \n2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) State and local governments bear the majority of the \n        cost and responsibility of educating public elementary school \n        and secondary school students;\n            (2) State and local governments often struggle to find \n        adequate funding to provide basic educational services;\n            (3) the Federal Government has not provided its share of \n        funding for numerous federally mandated elementary and \n        secondary education programs;\n            (4) underfunded Federal education mandates increase \n        existing financial pressures on States and local educational \n        agencies;\n            (5) the cost to States and local educational agencies to \n        implement the annual student academic assessments required \n        under section 1111(b)(3)(C)(vii) of the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)(C)(vii)) \n        remains uncertain;\n            (6) public elementary school and secondary school students \n        take numerous tests each year, from classroom quizzes and exams \n        to standardized and other tests required by the Federal \n        Government, State educational agencies, or local educational \n        agencies;\n            (7) multiple measures of student academic achievement \n        provide a more accurate picture of a student's strengths and \n        weaknesses than does a single score on a high-stakes test; and\n            (8) the frequency of the use of high quality assessments as \n        a tool to measure and increase student achievement should be \n        decided by State educational agencies and local educational \n        agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. WAIVER AUTHORITY.\n\n    Section 1111(b)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n                    ``(E) Waiver authority.--\n                            ``(i) States.--Upon application by a State \n                        educational agency, the Secretary shall waive \n                        the requirements of subparagraph (C)(vii) for a \n                        State if the State educational agency \n                        demonstrates that the State--\n                                    ``(I) significantly closed the \n                                achievement gap between the groups of \n                                students described in paragraph (2); or\n                                    ``(II) exceeded the State's \n                                adequate yearly progress, consistent \n                                with paragraph (2), for 2 or more \n                                consecutive years.\n                            ``(ii) Local educational agencies.--Upon \n                        application of a local educational agency \n                        located in a State that does not receive a \n                        waiver under clause (i), the Secretary shall \n                        waive the application of the requirements of \n                        subparagraph (C)(vii) for the local educational \n                        agency if the local educational agency \n                        demonstrates that the local educational \n                        agency--\n                                    ``(I) significantly closed the \n                                achievement gap between the groups of \n                                students described in paragraph (2); or\n                                    ``(II) exceeded the local \n                                educational agency's adequate yearly \n                                progress, consistent with paragraph \n                                (2), for 2 or more consecutive years.\n                            ``(iii) Period of waiver.--A waiver under \n                        clause (i) or (ii) shall be for a period of 3 \n                        years and may be renewed for subsequent 3-year \n                        periods.\n                            ``(iv) Utilization of certain federal \n                        funds.--\n                                    ``(I) Permissive uses.--Subject to \n                                subclause (II), a State or local \n                                educational agency granted a waiver \n                                under clause (i) or (ii) shall use \n                                funds, that are awarded to the State or \n                                local educational agency, respectively, \n                                under this Act for the development and \n                                implementation of annual assessments \n                                under subparagraph (C)(vii), to carry \n                                out educational activities that the \n                                State educational agency or local \n                                educational agency, respectively, \n                                determines will improve the academic \n                                achievement of students attending \n                                public elementary schools and secondary \n                                schools in the State or local \n                                educational agency, respectively, that \n                                fail to make adequate yearly progress \n                                (as defined in paragraph (2)(C)).\n                                    ``(II) Nonpermissive use of \n                                funds.--A State or local educational \n                                agency granted a waiver under clause \n                                (i) or (ii) shall not use funds, that \n                                are awarded to the State or local \n                                educational agency, respectively, under \n                                this Act for the development and \n                                implementation of annual assessments \n                                under subparagraph (C)(vii), to pay a \n                                student's cost of tuition, room, board, \n                                or fees at a private school.''."
