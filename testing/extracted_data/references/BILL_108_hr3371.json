FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The disability and death of infants resulting from \n        injuries sustained in crib incidents are a serious threat to \n        the public health, welfare, and safety of people of this \n        country.\n            (2) The design and construction of a baby crib must ensure \n        that it is safe to leave an infant unattended for extended \n        periods of time. A parent or caregiver has a right to believe \n        that the crib in use is a safe place to leave an infant.\n            (3) Each year about 12,000 children ages 2 and under are \n        injured in cribs seriously enough to require hospital \n        treatment.\n            (4) Each year at least 30 children age 4 and under die from \n        injuries sustained in cribs.\n            (5) The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission \n        estimates that the cost to society resulting from deaths due to \n        cribs is at least $150,000,000 per year.\n            (6) Secondhand, hand-me-down, and heirloom cribs pose a \n        special problem. There are nearly 4 million infants born in \n        this country each year, but only an estimated one million to \n        two million new cribs sold. Many infants are placed in \n        secondhand, hand-me-down, or heirloom cribs.\n            (7) Most crib deaths occur in secondhand, hand-me-down, or \n        heirloom cribs.\n            (8) Existing State and Federal legislation is inadequate to \n        deal with the hazard presented by secondhand, hand-me-down, or \n        heirloom cribs.\n            (9) Prohibiting the contracting to sell, resell, lease, \n        sublease of unsafe cribs that are not new, or otherwise place \n        in the stream of commerce unsafe secondhand, hand-me-down, or \n        heirloom cribs, will prevent injuries and deaths caused by \n        cribs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to prevent the occurrence \nof injuries and deaths to infants as a result of unsafe cribs by making \nit illegal--\n            (1) to manufacture, sell, or contract to sell any crib that \n        is unsafe for any infant using it; or\n            (2) to resell, lease, sublet, or otherwise place in the \n        stream of commerce, after the effective date of this Act, any \n        unsafe crib, particularly any unsafe secondhand, hand-me-down, \n        or heirloom crib.\n\nSEC. 3.
