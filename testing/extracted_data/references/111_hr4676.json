FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The importance of travel and tourism cannot be \n        overstated: travel and tourism employs America.\n            (2) Approximately 8,300,000 domestic jobs depend on the \n        travel and tourism industry.\n            (3) The United States travel and tourism industry is worth \n        more than $691,000,000,000 annually in direct spending, of \n        which more than 85 percent is the result of domestic travel. \n        Including indirect spending, such industry tops \n        $1,200,000,000,000 in spending.\n            (4) The travel and tourism industry accounts for 2.6 \n        percent of GDP, nearly four times that of the automotive \n        industry.\n            (5) Domestic employment related to the travel and tourism \n        industry cannot be outsourced to other countries.\n            (6) The current economic downturn has created the most \n        difficult economic environment for the domestic travel and \n        tourism industry since the period following the terrorist \n        attacks of September 11, 2001.\n            (7) The travel and tourism industry has contracted by \n        nearly $130,000,000,000 in 2009 alone. The domestic tourism \n        economy has fallen by nearly 4.5 percent during 2009, twice the \n        rate of the overall economy of the United States.\n            (8) Domestic spending on travel and tourism has been in \n        decline since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, while \n        employment in the travel and tourism industry has been falling \n        since the second quarter of such year.\n            (9) Public-private partnerships have been underutilized in \n        the promotion of travel and tourism and are a dynamic tool in \n        creating new domestic tourism markets and promoting domestic \n        regional tourism growth.\n\nSEC. 3.
