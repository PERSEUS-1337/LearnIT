FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States is an Arctic nation with--\n                    (A) an approximately 700-mile border with the \n                Arctic Ocean;\n                    (B) more than 100,000,000 acres of land above the \n                Arctic Circle; and\n                    (C) an even broader area defined as Arctic by \n                temperature, which includes the Bering Sea and Aleutian \n                Islands.\n            (2) The Arctic region of the United States--\n                    (A) is home to an indigenous population which has \n                subsisted for millennia on the abundance in marine \n                mammals, fish, and wildlife, many of which are unique \n                to the region;\n                    (B) is known to the indigenous population as \n                Inuvikput or the ``place where we live''; and\n                    (C) has produced more than 16,000,000,000 barrels \n                of oil and, according to the United States Geological \n                Survey, may hold an additional 30,000,000,000 barrels \n                of oil and 220,000,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural \n                gas, making the region of fundamental importance to the \n                national interest of the United States.\n            (3) Temperatures in the United States Arctic region have \n        warmed by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius over the past half-century, a \n        rate of increase that is twice the global average.\n            (4) The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing and \n        thinning, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration estimates the Arctic Ocean may be ice free \n        during summer months in as few as 30 years.\n            (5) Such changes to the Arctic region are having a \n        significant impact on the indigenous people of the Arctic, \n        their communities and ecosystems, as well as the marine \n        mammals, fish, and wildlife upon which they depend.\n            (6) Such changes are opening new portions of the United \n        States Arctic continental shelf to possible development for \n        offshore oil and gas, commercial fishing, marine shipping, and \n        tourism.\n            (7) It is in the interests of the United States to work \n        with the State of Alaska and the United States neighbors in the \n        Arctic region to ensure that shipping in the Arctic Ocean and \n        adjacent seas is safe for mariners, protective of the natural \n        environment, including the air, land, water, and wildlife of \n        the Arctic, and mindful of the needs of longstanding \n        subsistence users of Arctic resources.\n            (8) It is in the interests of the United States to ensure \n        that shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas is secure, \n        that United States sovereign and security interests, including \n        the freedom of navigation rights of United States and foreign \n        vessels to transit international straits, are respected and \n        protected, consistent with international and customary law, \n        that access is provided throughout the Arctic Ocean for \n        legitimate research vessels of all nations, and that peaceful \n        relations are maintained in the Arctic region.\n            (9) It is in the interests of the United States to \n        cooperate to establish a system of international cooperation to \n        support reliable shipping, with methods for joint investment in \n        providing mariners aids to navigation, ports of refuge, vessel-\n        to-shore communication, weather and ice forecasting, ship \n        tracking and reporting, hydrographic mapping, and search and \n        rescue capability.\n            (10) The United States has continuing research, security, \n        environmental, and commercial interests in the Arctic region \n        that rely on the availability of polar class icebreakers of the \n        Coast Guard that were commissioned in the 1970s and are in need \n        of replacement.\n            (11) Sovereign interests of the United States in the Arctic \n        Ocean and Bering Sea regions may grow with submission of a \n        United States claim for an extended continental shelf, pending \n        the United States becoming a party to the United Nations \n        Convention on the Law of the Sea, done at Montego Bay December \n        10, 1982.\n            (12) Building new icebreakers, forward operating bases, \n        aids to navigation, and other facilities, and establishing \n        coordinated shipping regulations and oil spill prevention and \n        response capability through international cooperation requires \n        long lead times.\n            (13) Beginning such efforts, with the completion of an \n        Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the 8-nation Arctic \n        Council, is essential to protect United States interests given \n        the extensive current use of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas \n        by vessels of many nations.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to ensure safe, secure, and reliable \nmaritime shipping in the Arctic, including the availability of aids to \nnavigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and maritime \nsearch and rescue in the Arctic.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``Arctic'' has the meaning given that term in \nsection 112 of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 (15 U.S.C. \n4111).\n\nSEC. 5.
