FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The use of terrorism is detestable and an illegitimate \n        means of political expression.\n            (2) International terrorist organizations pose a direct \n        threat to the United States, and this threat is becoming more \n        acute and more difficult to prevent.\n            (3) The threat from international terrorism is made far \n        more dangerous by the proliferation of chemical, biological, \n        and radiological weapons and the means to produce those \n        weapons.\n            (4) The prosecution of the war against international \n        terrorist organizations must continue until the threat they \n        pose to the people and interests of the United States is \n        eliminated.\n            (5) The United States can only win the war against \n        terrorism if it receives cooperation from other countries and \n        entities.\n            (6) Protecting the United States homeland and United States \n        interests overseas from terrorism is of the highest priority in \n        the foreign relations of the United States.\n            (7) Cooperation in the global war against international \n        terrorism must be a primary focus of United States foreign \n        relations, United States assistance, and international security \n        relations.\n            (8) Winning the global war against international terrorism \n        requires cooperation from the international community, \n        especially in the areas of preventing the financing of terror, \n        sharing information on international terror networks, \n        eliminating terror cells, and in preventing the promotion of \n        virulent anti-Americanism with the intent to incite violence \n        and the glorification of terrorism in state-owned media and \n        state-controlled schools.\n            (9) The promotion of terrorism, intolerance, and virulent \n        anti-Americanism in state-owned media and state-controlled \n        education systems is abhorrent and poses a long-term threat to \n        the safety and security of the United States as well as the \n        community of nations.\n            (10) All countries and entities must be encouraged to \n        cooperate in the global war against international terrorism.\n            (11) Some foreign governments and entities are doing little \n        to counter proterrorist and prointolerance messages to mass \n        audiences, including to school age children.\n            (12) Countries providing direct or indirect assistance to \n        international terrorist organizations undermine the direct \n        security interests of the United States.\n            (13) Countries demonstrating indifference to or providing \n        actual endorsement of international terror as a legitimate \n        political tool make a direct threat to the security interests \n        of the United States.\n            (14) United States economic assistance programs and the \n        transfer of United States Munitions List items are a critical \n        tool of United States foreign policy and winning the global war \n        against international terrorism.\n            (15) Countries receiving United States assistance and the \n        export of items on the United States Munitions List should be \n        expected to support the global war against international \n        terror.\n            (16) Several existing laws, including the USA Patriot Act \n        of 2001, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n        1996, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export \n        Control Act, and the Export Administration Act of 1979 (or \n        successor statute), prohibit the provision of United States \n        assistance, and the licensing for export of items on the United \n        States Munitions List, to countries supporting terror or not \n        fully cooperating in antiterror efforts of the United States. \n        It would be appropriate in the implementation of these laws to \n        apply the definition of ``fully cooperative in the global war \n        against  international terrorism'' set forth in this Act, \nincluding preventing promotion of terror in state-owned and state-\ncontrolled media and educational systems.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States that--\n            (1) no United States economic assistance, other than \n        humanitarian assistance, may be provided to any foreign country \n        or entity that is not making a maximum effort to be fully \n        cooperative in the global war against international terrorism; \n        and\n            (2) no license for export of an item on the United States \n        Munitions List to a country or entity may be issued if that \n        country or entity is not making a maximum effort to be fully \n        cooperative in the global war against international terrorism.\n\nSEC. 4.
