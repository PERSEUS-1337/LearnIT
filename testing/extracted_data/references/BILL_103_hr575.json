FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) new threats to the global environment, including to the \n        earth's climate system, the ozone layer, biological diversity, \n        soils, oceans, and freshwater resources, have arisen in recent \n        years;\n            (2) such threats to the global environment may adversely \n        affect the health, livelihoods, and physical well-being of \n        Americans, the stability of many societies, and international \n        peace;\n            (3) in recent years, the definition of national security of \n        the United States has been broadened, both in official White \n        House documents and in legislation, to include economic \n        security as well as environmental security;\n            (4) with the end of the Cold War, the dramatic reduction of \n        the military threat to United States interests, and the new \n        recognition in world politics of the urgency of reversing \n        global environmental degradation recognized at the Earth Summit \n        in Rio in June 1992, the global environment has taken on even \n        greater importance to the United States;\n            (5) the extent and significance of such threats to United \n        States security has not been fully evaluated by the Congress or \n        the executive branch, and responses to global environmental \n        threats have not yet been fully integrated into United States \n        national security policy; and\n            (6) the United States Government currently lacks a focal \n        point for assessing the importance of such new environmental \n        threat to the national security of the United States and their \n        implications for United States global security policy.\n\nSEC. 3.
