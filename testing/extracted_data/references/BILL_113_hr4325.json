FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Food and Drug Administration, because \n        electronic cigarettes have not been fully studied, consumers \n        currently do not know--\n                    (A) the potential risks of electronic cigarettes \n                when used as intended;\n                    (B) how much nicotine or other potentially harmful \n                chemicals are being inhaled during use; or\n                    (C) if there are any benefits associated with using \n                these products.\n            (2) Most electronic cigarettes contain widely varying \n        levels of nicotine, which is a highly addictive drug that \n        impacts the cardiovascular system and can be lethal when \n        delivered in high doses.\n            (3) According to the Surgeon General, adolescents are \n        particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of nicotine and \n        adolescent exposure to nicotine may have lasting adverse \n        consequences for brain development.\n            (4) Use of electronic cigarettes has risen in youth \n        according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention that was released in September 2013, which found \n        that in one year, from 2011 to 2012, the percentage of middle \n        and high school students who had ever used electronic \n        cigarettes more than doubled.\n            (5) Electronic cigarette use may lead children to become \n        addicted to nicotine and could be a gateway to various tobacco \n        products.\n            (6) Marketing of electronic cigarettes to youth is \n        occurring in the form of advertising using cartoons and \n        sponsorships of events popular with youth such as concerts and \n        sporting events.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nFederal Trade Commission should prohibit the advertising, promoting, \nand marketing in commerce of electronic cigarettes to children as an \nunfair or deceptive act or practice, in order to protect the health of \nthe youth of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
