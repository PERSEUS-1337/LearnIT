FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A central tenet of representative democracy is that \n        citizens enjoy the right to peaceably assemble and petition \n        their government for redress of grievances.\n            (2) For this right to be exercised meaningfully, elected \n        representatives must be able to make themselves accessible to \n        their constituents.\n            (3) Fear of gun violence at events where elected \n        representatives are performing their official or \n        representational duties has a chilling effect on our democracy \n        in at least 2 ways:\n                    (A) by discouraging citizens from engaging in the \n                public and personal dialogue with their representatives \n                that is the lifeblood of vibrant democratic politics; \n                and\n                    (B) by leading elected representatives to reduce \n                the frequency and extent of personal contact with their \n                constituents as a reasonable precaution against \n                unreasonable threats to their personal safety.\n            (4) During the summer of 2009, there were multiple cases of \n        persons carrying firearms outside of venues at which the \n        President of the United States was holding meetings and \n        official events. In one instance, a man carried an AR-15 \n        automatic assault rifle and a sidearm. In another instance, \n        occurring hours before a presidential town hall a week earlier, \n        a man was arrested for breaching a security perimeter at the \n        location of the event, and was found to be in possession of an \n        unlicensed and loaded handgun.\n            (5) In recent months, there has been a threefold increase \n        in the number of reported threats against Members of the United \n        States House of Representatives and Members of the United \n        States Senate.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON KNOWINGLY POSSESSING A FIREARM NEAR A VENUE AT \n              WHICH A MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS PERFORMING AN OFFICIAL AND \n              REPRESENTATIONAL DUTY OR CAMPAIGNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(aa)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful \nfor any person, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, to \nknowingly carry a firearm--\n            ``(A) in, or within 250 feet of an entrance to or exit \n        from, a building or structure where the person knows that a \n        Member of Congress is--\n                    ``(i) performing an official and representational \n                duty of the Member;\n                    ``(ii) engaging in campaign activity as a candidate \n                for election for Federal office for purposes of the \n                Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971; or\n                    ``(iii) engaging in campaign activity as a \n                candidate for election for State or local office, as \n                determined pursuant to State law; or\n            ``(B) at, or within 500 feet of, any other place where the \n        person knows that a Member of Congress is performing such a \n        duty or engaging in such a campaign activity,\nif there is visible, at each place that is at the applicable distance \nspecified in this sentence from the building, structure, or other \nplace, a sign which clearly and conspicuously states that a Member of \nCongress will be present at the building, structure, or other place, \nand so states the time interval during which the Member of Congress is \nscheduled to be so present.\n    ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the carrying of a firearm--\n            ``(A) by a law enforcement officer (whether on- or off-\n        duty) who is authorized to carry a firearm in the line of duty; \n        or\n            ``(B) pursuant to the express written permission of--\n                    ``(i) any Member of Congress present at the \n                location involved, which permission has been filed with \n                the chief of police of the locality involved; or\n                    ``(ii) the chief of police of the locality \n                involved;\n            ``(C) on real property owned or rented by the carrier of \n        the firearm;\n            ``(D) on the premises of a business in which the carrier of \n        the firearm is employed and authorized by the employer to carry \n        the firearm; or\n            ``(E) which is in a locked container or otherwise not \n        readily accessible for use.\n    ``(3) If Federal investigative or prosecutive jurisdiction is \nasserted for a violation of this subsection, such assertion shall \nsuspend the exercise of jurisdiction by a State or local authority, \nunder any applicable State or local law, until Federal action is \nterminated.\n    ``(4) Violations of this subsection shall be investigated by the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation. Assistance may be requested from any \nFederal, State, or local agency, including the Army, Navy, and Air \nForce, any statute, rule, or regulation to the contrary \nnotwithstanding.''.\n    (b) Penalties.--Section 924(a) of such title is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(8) Whoever knowingly violates section 922(aa) shall be fined \nunder this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
