ADDITION OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892 et \nseq.) is amended by inserting a new section 302 as follows:\n\n``SEC. 302. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            ``(1) in 2007, the Nation celebrates the 200th anniversary \n        of its oldest scientific agency, the Survey of the Coast, which \n        was authorized by Congress and created by President Thomas \n        Jefferson in 1807 to conduct surveys of the coast and provide \n        nautical charts for safe passage through the Nation's ports and \n        along its extensive coastline;\n            ``(2) these mission requirements and capabilities, which \n        today are located in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration, evolved over time to include research, \n        development, operations, products, and services associated with \n        hydrographic, geodetic, shoreline and baseline surveying; \n        cartography, mapping, and charting; tides, currents, and water \n        level observations; maintenance of a national spatial reference \n        system, and associated products and services;\n            ``(3) there is a need to maintain federal expertise and \n        capability in hydrographic data and services to support a safe \n        and efficient marine transportation system for the enhancement \n        and promotion of international trade and interstate commerce \n        vital to the Nation's economic prosperity and for myriad other \n        commercial and recreational activities;\n            ``(4) the Nation's marine transportation system is becoming \n        increasingly congested, the volume of international maritime \n        commerce is expected to double within the next 20 years, and \n        nearly half of the cargo transiting U.S. waters is oil, refined \n        petroleum products, or other hazardous substances;\n            ``(5) in addition to commerce, hydrographic data and \n        services support other national needs for the Great Lakes and \n        coastal waters, the territorial sea, the Exclusive Economic \n        Zone, and the continental shelf of the United States, including \n        emergency response; homeland security; marine resource \n        conservation; coastal resiliency to sea-level rise, coastal \n        inundation, and other hazards; ocean and coastal science \n        advancement; and improved and integrated ocean and coastal \n        mapping and observations for an integrated ocean observing \n        system;\n            ``(6) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n        in cooperation with other agencies and the States, serves as \n        the Nation's leading civil authority for establishing and \n        maintaining national standards and datums for hydrographic data \n        and services;\n            ``(7) the Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration's Office of Coast Survey serves as the U.S. \n        National Hydrographer and the primary U.S. representative to \n        the international hydrographic community, including the \n        International Hydrographic Organization;\n            ``(8) the hydrographic expertise, data, and services of the \n        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provide the \n        underlying and authoritative basis for baseline and boundary \n        demarcation, including the establishment of marine and coastal \n        territorial limits and jurisdiction, such as the Exclusive \n        Economic Zone; and\n            ``(9) research, development and application of new \n        technologies will further increase efficiency, promote the \n        Nation's competitiveness, provide social and economic benefits, \n        enhance safety and environmental protection, and reduce risks.\n    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            ``(1) augment the ability of the National Oceanic and \n        Atmospheric Administration to fulfill its responsibilities \n        under this and other authorities;\n            ``(2) provide more accurate and up-to-date hydrographic \n        data and services in support of safe and efficient \n        international trade and interstate commerce, including \n        hydrographic surveys; electronic navigational charts; real-time \n        tide, water level, and current information and forecasting; \n        shoreline surveys; and geodesy and three-dimensional \n        positioning data;\n            ``(3) support homeland security, emergency response, \n        ecosystem approaches to marine management, and coastal \n        resiliency by providing hydrographic data and services with \n        many other useful operational, scientific, engineering, and \n        management applications, including storm surge, tsunami, \n        coastal flooding, erosion, and pollution trajectory monitoring, \n        predictions, and warnings; marine and coastal geographic \n        information systems; habitat restoration; long-term sea-level \n        trends; and more accurate environmental assessments and \n        monitoring;\n            ``(4) promote improved integrated ocean and coastal mapping \n        and observations through increased coordination and \n        cooperation;\n            ``(5) provide for and support research and development in \n        hydrographic data, services and related technologies to enhance \n        the efficiency, accuracy and availability of hydrographic data \n        and services and thereby promote the Nation's scientific and \n        technological competitiveness;
