FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) The Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas are becoming \n        increasingly accessible to shipping, due to thinning ice cover, \n        technological improvements allowing greater efficiencies in the \n        operation of ice-breakers and ice-strengthened cargo and \n        passenger vessels, satellite support for navigation and real-\n        time ice-charting, and growing demand for Arctic tourism and \n        natural resources.\n            (2) It is in the interests of the United States to work \n        with the State of Alaska and our neighbors in the Arctic Region \n        to ensure that shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas \n        is safe for mariners, protective of the natural environment, \n        including the air, land, water, and wildlife of the Arctic, and \n        mindful of the needs of longstanding subsistence users of \n        Arctic resources.\n            (3) It is further in the interests of the United States to \n        ensure that shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas is \n        secure, and that United States sovereign and security \n        interests, including the rights of United States vessels to \n        innocent passage through international straits, are respected \n        and protected, that access is provided throughout the Arctic \n        Ocean for legitimate research vessels of all nations, and that \n        peaceful relations are maintained in the Arctic region.\n            (4) It is further in the interests of the United States to \n        see that a system of international cooperation is established \n        to support reliable shipping, with methods for joint investment \n        in providing mariners aids to navigation, ports of refuge, \n        vessel-to-shore communication, hydrographic mapping, and search \n        and rescue capability.\n            (5) For nearly 500 years, mariners and sea-faring nations \n        have sought national and global benefits from sea routes in the \n        Arctic similar to those provided now by the Panama and Suez \n        canals, but as those benefits may finally be realized, expanded \n        shipping will present risks to residents of the Arctic, and \n        coordinated shipping regulations are needed to protect United \n        States interests even from shipping that may occur in the \n        Arctic region outside United States territorial waters.\n            (6) Proven models for international cooperation in \n        management of regional waterways exist, including United States \n        joint administration of the St. Lawrence Seaway with Canada, \n        and existing cooperation between the Coast Guard and its \n        Russian Federation counterpart for fisheries enforcement in the \n        Bering Sea and North Pacific regions.\n            (7) The United States has continuing research, security, \n        environmental, and commercial interests in the Arctic region \n        that rely on the availability of icebreaker platforms of the \n        Coast Guard. The Polar Class icebreakers commissioned in the \n        1970s are in need of replacement.\n            (8) Sovereign interests of the United States in the Arctic \n        Ocean and Bering Sea regions may grow with submission of a \n        United States claim for an extended continental shelf.\n            (9) Building new icebreakers, mustering international plans \n        for aids to navigation and other facilities, and establishing \n        coordinated shipping regulations and oil spill prevention and \n        response capability through international cooperation, \n        including the approval of the International Maritime \n        Organization, requires long lead times. Beginning those efforts \n        now, with the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping \n        Assessment by the eight-nation Arctic Council, is essential to \n        protect United States interests given the extensive current use \n        of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas by vessels of many \n        nations.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure safe, secure, \nand reliable maritime shipping in the Arctic including the availability \nof aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and \nmaritime search and rescue in the Arctic.\n\nSEC. 3. INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION AGREEMENTS.\n\n    To carry out the purpose of this Act, the Secretary of the \ndepartment in which the Coast Guard is operating shall work through the \nInternational Maritime Organization to establish agreements to promote \ncoordinated action among the United States, Russia, Canada, Iceland, \nNorway, and Denmark and other seafaring and Arctic nations to ensure, \nin the Arctic--\n            (1) placement and maintenance of aids to navigation;\n            (2) appropriate icebreaking escort, tug, and salvage \n        capabilities;\n            (3) oil spill prevention and response capability;\n            (4) maritime domain awareness, including long-range vessel \n        tracking; and\n            (5) search and rescue.\n\nSEC. 4. COORDINATION BY COMMITTEE ON THE MARITIME TRANSPORTATION \n              SYSTEM.\n\n    The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System established \nunder a directive of the President in the Ocean Action Plan, issued \nDecember 17, 2004, shall coordinate the establishment of domestic \ntransportation policies in the Arctic necessary to carry out the \npurpose of the Act.\n\nSEC. 5. AGREEMENTS AND CONTRACTS.\n\n    The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is \noperating may, subject to the availability of appropriations, enter \ninto cooperative agreements, contracts, or other agreements with, or \nmake grants to individuals and governments to carry out the purpose of \nthis Act or any agreements established under section 3.\n\nSEC. 6. ICEBREAKING.\n\n    The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is \noperating shall promote safe maritime navigation by means of \nicebreaking where needed to assure the reasonable demands of commerce.\n\nSEC. 7. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.\n\n    The Secretary of Transportation may enter into cooperative \nagreements, contracts, or other agreements with, or make grants to, \nindividuals to conduct demonstration projects to reduce emissions or \ndischarges from vessels operating in the Arctic.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated--\n            (1) to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast \n        Guard is operating--\n                    (A) $750,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2011 and \n                2012 for the construction of two polar capable \n                icebreakers;\n                    (B) $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2011 \n                through 2015 for seasonal operations in the Arctic; and\n                    (C) $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2012 \n                through 2015 to carry out agreements established under \n                section 5; and\n            (2) to the Secretary of Transportation $5,000,000 for each \n        of fiscal years 2011 through 2015 to conduct demonstration \n        projects under section 7.\n\nSEC. 9. ARCTIC DEFINITION.\n\n    In this Act the term ``Arctic'' has the same meaning as in section \n112 of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 (15 U.S.C. 4111)."
