ENERGY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER.\n\n    Section 917 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16197) is \namended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 917. ADVANCED ENERGY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CENTERS.\n\n    ``(a) Grants.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment \nof the Energy Technology Transfer Act, the Secretary shall make grants \nto nonprofit institutions, State and local governments, cooperative \nextension services, or institutions of higher education (or consortia \nthereof), to establish a geographically dispersed network of Advanced \nEnergy Technology Transfer Centers, to be located in areas the \nSecretary determines have the greatest need of the services of such \nCenters. In making awards under this section, the Secretary shall--\n            ``(1) give priority to applicants already operating or \n        partnered with an outreach program capable of transferring \n        knowledge and information about advanced energy efficiency \n        methods and technologies;\n            ``(2) ensure that, to the extent practicable, the program \n        enables the transfer of knowledge and information--\n                    ``(A) about a variety of technologies; and\n                    ``(B) in a variety of geographic areas;\n            ``(3) give preference to applicants that would \n        significantly expand on or fill a gap in existing programs in a \n        geographical region; and\n            ``(4) consider the special needs and opportunities for \n        increased energy efficiency for manufactured and site-built \n        housing, including construction, renovation, and retrofit.\n    ``(b) Activities.--Each Center shall operate a program to encourage \ndemonstration and commercial application of advanced energy methods and \ntechnologies through education and outreach to building and industrial \nprofessionals, and to other individuals and organizations with an \ninterest in efficient energy use. Funds awarded under this section may \nbe used for the following activities:\n            ``(1) Developing and distributing informational materials \n        on technologies that could use energy more efficiently.\n            ``(2) Carrying out demonstrations of advanced energy \n        methods and technologies.\n            ``(3) Developing and conducting seminars, workshops, long-\n        distance learning sessions, and other activities to aid in the \n        dissemination of knowledge and information on technologies that \n        could use energy more efficiently.\n            ``(4) Providing or coordinating onsite energy evaluations, \n        including instruction on the commissioning of building heating \n        and cooling systems, for a wide range of energy end-users.\n            ``(5) Examining the energy efficiency needs of energy end-\n        users to develop recommended research projects for the \n        Department.\n            ``(6) Hiring experts in energy efficient technologies to \n        carry out activities described in paragraphs (1) through (5).\n    ``(c) Application.--A person seeking a grant under this section \nshall submit to the Secretary an application in such form and \ncontaining such information as the Secretary may require.
