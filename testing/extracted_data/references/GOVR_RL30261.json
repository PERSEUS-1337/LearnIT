    "content": "On November 9, 1916, Jeannette Rankin (R-MT) was elected to the House of Representatives as Montana's Representative-at-Large to the 65 th Congress (1917-1919). This election win gave Representative Rankin the dist inction of being the first woman elected to serve in Congress. The first woman to serve in the Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-GA). She was appointed in 1922 and served for one day. Three hundred sixty five women have been elected or appointed to Congress. These figures include six nonvoting Delegates, one each from Guam, Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and American Samoa, and two from the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as one Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico. Of these 365 women, there have been 247 Democrats and 118 Republicans; 309 (211 Democrats, 98 Republicans) women elected only in the House of Representatives, including 7 (4 Democrats, 3 Republicans) women who have served as Delegates or Resident Commissioners in the House; 40 (25 Democrats, 15 Republicans) women elected or appointed only in the Senate; and 16 (11 Democrats, 5 Republicans) women elected or appointed in both houses. A record 131 women currently serve in the 116 th Congress. This is higher than the previous record from the 115 th Congress (109 women initially sworn in, 5 House Members subsequently elected, and 2 Senators subsequently appointed). Of these 131 women, there are 25 in the Senate (17 Democrats and 8 Republicans); 106 in the House (91 Democrats and 15 Republicans); 4 of the women in the House who serve as Delegates or Resident Commissioner (2 Democrats and 2 Republicans), representing the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico; 25 African American women, 10 Asian Pacific American women, 15 Hispanic women, and 2 Native American women; and 5 women who chair House committees, 1 woman who chairs a Senate standing committee, 1 woman who chairs a House select committee, and 1 woman who chairs a Senate select committee. One of the House committee chairs also chairs a Joint Committee.  Other notable facts about women in the 116 th Congress include the following: Not including Delegates and the Resident Commissioner, women currently hold 102 (23.4%) seats in the House of Representatives and 25 (25%) seats in the Senate, totaling 127 (23.7%) of the 535 voting seats in the 116 th Congress. Including Delegates and the Resident Commissioner, women currently hold 106 seats in the House of Representatives, increasing the total to 131 seats (24.2%) in the entire Congress. This report includes brief biographical information, committee assignments, dates of service, listings by Congress and state, and (for Representatives) congressional districts of the 365 women who have been elected or appointed to Congress. It will be updated when there are relevant changes in the makeup of Congress. For additional information, including a discussion of the impact of women in Congress as well as historical information, including the number and percentage of women in Congress over time, data on entry to Congress, comparisons to international and state legislatures, tenure, firsts for women in Congress, women in leadership, and African American, Asian Pacific American, Hispanic, and Native American women in Congress, see CRS Report R43244, Women in Congress: Statistics and Brief Overview , by Jennifer E. Manning and Ida A. Brudnick.
