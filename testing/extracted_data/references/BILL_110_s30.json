PURPOSES.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) intensify research that may result in improved \n        understanding of or treatments for diseases and other adverse \n        health conditions; and\n            (2) promote the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines \n        without the creation of human embryos for research purposes and \n        without the destruction or discarding of, or risk of injury to, \n        a human embryo or embryos other than those that are naturally \n        dead.\n\nSEC. 3. HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL RESEARCH.\n\n    Part H of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 498C the following:\n\n``SEC. 498D. HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL RESEARCH.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall conduct and support basic \nand applied research to develop techniques for the isolation, \nderivation, production, or testing of stem cells, including pluripotent \nstem cells that have the flexibility of embryonic stem cells (whether \nor not they have an embryonic source), that may result in improved \nunderstanding of or treatments for diseases and other adverse health \nconditions, provided that the isolation, derivation, production, or \ntesting of such cells will not involve--\n            ``(1) the creation of a human embryo or embryos for \n        research purposes; or\n            ``(2) the destruction or discarding of, or risk of injury \n        to, a human embryo or embryos other than those that are \n        naturally dead.\n    ``(b) Guidelines.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this section, the Secretary, after consultation with the \nDirector of NIH, shall issue final guidelines that--\n            ``(1) provide guidance concerning the next steps required \n        for additional research, which shall include a determination of \n        the extent to which specific techniques may require additional \n        animal research to ensure that any research involving human \n        cells using these techniques would clearly be consistent with \n        the standards established under subsection (a);\n            ``(2) prioritize research with the greatest potential for \n        near-term clinical benefit;\n            ``(3) consistent with standards established under \n        subsection (a), take into account techniques outlined by the \n        President's Council on Bioethics and any other appropriate \n        techniques and research; and\n            ``(4) in the case of research involving stem cells from a \n        naturally dead embryo, require assurances from grant applicants \n        that no alteration of the timing, methods, or procedures used \n        to create, maintain, or intervene in the development of a human \n        embryo was made solely for the purpose of deriving the stem \n        cells.\n    ``(c) Reporting Requirements.--Not later than January 1 of each \nyear, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the appropriate \ncommittees of the Congress a report describing the activities carried \nout under this section during the fiscal year, including a description \nof the research conducted under this section.\n    ``(d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued as altering the policy in effect on the date of enactment of \nthis section regarding the eligibility of stem cell lines for funding \nby the National Institutes of Health.\n    ``(e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.\n    ``(f) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) Naturally dead.--The term `naturally dead' means \n        having naturally and irreversibly lost the capacity for \n        integrated cellular division, growth, and differentiation that \n        is characteristic of an organism, even if some cells of the \n        former organism may be alive in a disorganized state.\n            ``(2) Human embryo or embryos.--The term `human embryo or \n        embryos' includes any organism, not protected as a human \n        subject under part 46 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, \n        as of the date of enactment of this section, that is derived by \n        fertilization, parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means \n        from one or more human gametes or human diploid cells.\n            ``(3) Risk of injury.--The term `risk of injury' means \n        subjecting a human embryo or embryos to risk of injury or death \n        greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero \n        under section 46.204(b) of title 45, Code of Federal \n        Regulations, and section 498(b) of this Act.''.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL AMNIOTIC AND PLACENTAL STEM CELL BANK.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \nenter into a contract with the Institute of Medicine for the conduct of \na study to recommend an optimal structure for an amniotic and placental \nstem cell bank program and to address pertinent issues to maximize the \npotential of such technology, including collection, storage, standards \nsetting, information sharing, distribution, reimbursement, research, \nand outcome measures. In conducting such study, the Institute should \nreceive input from relevant experts including the existing operators of \nfederal tissue bank programs and the biomedical research programs \nwithin the Department of Defense.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Institute of Medicine shall complete the study under \nsubsection (a) and submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nand the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the results of \nsuch study.\n\n            Passed the Senate April 11, 2007.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                NANCY ERICKSON,\n\n                                                             Secretary."
