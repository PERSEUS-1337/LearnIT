SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Measures to \nEncourage Results in Teaching Act of 1998''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) All students deserve to be taught by well-educated, \n        competent, and qualified teachers.\n            (2) More than ever before, education has and will continue \n        to become the ticket not only to economic success but to basic \n        survival. Students will not succeed in meeting the demands of a \n        knowledge-based, 21st century society and economy if the \n        students do not encounter more challenging work in school. For \n        future generations to have the opportunities to achieve success \n        the future generations will need to have an education and a \n        teacher workforce second to none.\n            (3) No other intervention can make the difference that a \n        knowledgeable, skillful teacher can make in the learning \n        process. At the same time, nothing can fully compensate for \n        weak teaching that, despite good intentions, can result from a \n        teacher's lack of opportunity to acquire the knowledge and \n        skill needed to help students master the curriculum.\n            (4) The Federal Government established the Dwight D. \n        Eisenhower Professional Development Program in 1985 to ensure \n        that teachers and other educational staff have access to \n        sustained and high-quality professional development. This \n        ongoing development must include the ability to demonstrate and \n        judge the performance of teachers and other instructional \n        staff.\n            (5) States should evaluate their teachers on the basis of \n        demonstrated ability, including tests of subject matter \n        knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. States \n        should develop a test for their teachers and other \n        instructional staff with respect to the subjects taught by the \n        teachers and staff, and should administer the test every 3 to 5 \n        years.\n            (6) Evaluating and rewarding teachers with a compensation \n        system that supports teachers who become increasingly expert in \n        a subject area, are proficient in meeting the needs of students \n        and schools, and demonstrate high levels of performance \n        measured against professional teaching standards, will \n        encourage teachers to continue to learn needed skills and \n        broaden teachers' expertise, thereby enhancing education for \n        all students.\n    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To provide incentives for States to establish and \n        administer periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs for \n        elementary school and secondary school teachers.\n            (2) To encourage States to establish merit pay programs \n        that have a significant impact on teacher salary scales.\n            (3) To encourage programs that recognize and reward the \n        best teachers, and encourage those teachers that need to do \n        better.\n\nSEC. 2. STATE INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER TESTING AND MERIT PAY.\n\n    (a) Amendments.--Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating part D as part E;\n            (2) by redesignating sections 2401 and 2402 as sections \n        2501 and 2502, respectively; and\n            (3) by inserting after part C the following:\n\n      ``PART D--STATE INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER TESTING AND MERIT PAY\n\n``SEC. 2401.
