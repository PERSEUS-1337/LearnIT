FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Health care spending in the United States has grown \n        rapidly to a rate of approximately 10 percent a year.\n            (2) According to the Congressional Budget Office, with the \n        cost of health care rising rapidly, spending for Medicare and \n        Medicaid is projected to grow even faster--in the range of 7 \n        percent to 8 percent annually.\n            (3) More and more Americans with health insurance coverage \n        are experiencing increases in out-of-pocket expenses for health \n        care.\n            (4) The rising costs of healthcare is driving more citizens \n        to be uninsured or underinsured. According to the Bureau of the \n        Census, Department of Commerce, the number of Americans without \n        health insurance in 2005 increased by 800,000 to 46,600,000 \n        from 45,800,000 in 2004.\n            (5) Many of these uninsured, nonelderly adults face chronic \n        conditions.\n            (6) The rising costs of healthcare are compounded for \n        Americans who suffer from a chronic disease that requires \n        expensive treatments. Some of these uninsured adults with \n        chronic conditions forgo needed medical care or prescription \n        drugs, due to the prohibitive costs.\n            (7) Many families who have a loved one with an expensive \n        chronic condition often face a difficult dilemma: if they \n        receive public assistance through State Medicaid programs, they \n        must meet and maintain a certain income threshold and if they \n        leave public assistance for private insurance, they must then \n        be able to meet higher premiums, co-payments and drug costs.\n            (8) Currently, nonprofit charitable organizations have \n        recognized a need to develop financial assistance programs for \n        patients with expensive chronic illnesses to access treatment \n        and therapies to lead productive and healthy lives.\n            (9) These patient assistance organizations (PAOs) prevent \n        patients with expensive chronic illnesses and conditions from \n        depleting financial resources to qualify for public assistance \n        programs by subsidizing health insurance premiums; pharmacy and \n        treatment co-payments; and expense associated with Medicare.\n            (10) The Federal Government should be looking for ways to \n        reduce the costs to public programs like Medicaid at the same \n        time transitioning beneficiaries into the private health \n        market. One way to do this is to create incentives for \n        beneficiaries and their families to enter the workforce, earn a \n        better living and ultimately, participate in the private health \n        insurance market.\n            (11) A targeted tax credit is one way the Federal \n        Government could encourage citizens to donate to qualified \n        PAOs.\n            (12) The benefits of a tax credit provides the Federal \n        Government with a greater savings than the cost of the tax \n        credits themselves by transitioning patients off public \n        programs such as Medicaid, lifting them out of poverty, and \n        enabling them to access health insurance coverage.\n            (13) This tax credit also contributes to PAOs that can \n        cover the ``TrOOP'' or ``doughnut hole'' expenses that Medicare \n        part D does not cover for disabled and senior citizens.\n            (14) This tax credit in the end fosters a tax policy that \n        addresses three major areas of public policy concern--\n                    (A) uninsured and underinsured citizens;\n                    (B) treatment for Medicare beneficiaries \n                (``doughnut hole''); and\n                    (C) cost savings for Medicaid.\n\nSEC. 3. CREDIT FOR CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO CERTAIN PRIVATE \n              CHARITIES PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE \n              AND DRUG COPAYMENT ASSISTANCE TO THE UNINSURED AND \n              UNDERINSURED.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart A of part IV of chapter 1 of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 (relating to nonrefundable personal credits) is \namended by inserting after section 25D the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 25E.
