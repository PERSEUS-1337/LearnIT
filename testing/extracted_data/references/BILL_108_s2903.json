FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Amateur Sports and education-based athletics are an \n        important part of our culture. Sports provide a tremendous \n        opportunity for the youth of America to learn the skills of \n        leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Studies have shown that \n        participation in these activities is directly connected to \n        academic achievement and overall social development.\n            (2) Amateur athletics are integral to the good health and \n        overall well-being of American society. Nonprofit organizations \n        put forward their best efforts to enact rules that are in the \n        best interests of young people. Injuries will occur as a result \n        of the inherent risks involved in sports. These risks, however, \n        should not work to the detriment of the greater good served by \n        amateur athletics.\n            (3) Young people who participate in school sports and other \n        amateur competition have lower levels of obesity.\n            (4) Young people who participate in sports tend to be \n        fitter adults, and suffer fewer health problems as they age.\n            (5) Playing rules in amateur sports are necessary to \n        provide the opportunity for young people to participate in age- \n        and skill level-appropriate competition.\n            (6) Sport involves intense physical activity. It also \n        involves a certain element of danger. Rules making is \n        anticipatory, and it involves tradeoffs and balancing acts. \n        Rules makers must draw unambiguous lines; they do not have the \n        luxury of self-protective vagueness. Given the large number of \n        participants and the risks inherent in sport, injuries cannot \n        be avoided. By deciding to partake in competition, athletes \n        assume such risks. Allowing lawsuits based merely on the good \n        faith development of the rules is wrong and unfair.\n            (7) Rules makers have been the target of an increasing \n        number of lawsuits claiming negligence due to the adoption, or \n        failure to adopt, particular rules for amateur sports.\n            (8) Repeatedly defending claims will have a detrimental \n        impact on the ability of rules makers to continue to provide \n        these services, and will discourage the best and brightest \n        coaches, officials, and administrators from serving on rules \n        committees.\n\nSEC. 3.
