FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Institute of Medicine, the Alliance for Aging \n        Research, the National Institute on Aging, and the Council on \n        Graduate Medical Education have reported that there is a \n        critical shortage of certified geriatricians.\n            (2) The average total educational debt that a physician who \n        completes required training including a fellowship in geriatric \n        medicine or geriatric psychiatry in order to become a certified \n        geriatrician exceeds $75,000, and the current reimbursement \n        policy for these physicians creates significant financial \n        disincentives to entering the practice of geriatric medicine \n        and geriatric psychiatry.\n            (3) It is essential that physicians that provide clinical \n        services to elderly individuals be trained in the range of \n        settings in which medical care is delivered in order to provide \n        those services appropriately.\n\nSEC. 3.
