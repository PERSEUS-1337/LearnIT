    "content": "Budget justifications are detailed written materials, data, and supporting documents provided by federal agencies that expand upon and support the President's yearly budget submission to Congress. In form and content, the justifications may vary by agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides yearly instructions to agencies for producing materials to be included in the President's budget submission and agency budget justifications. Each summer, OMB issues these instructions as part of a document entitled, Circular No. A-11: Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget . The release of budget justifications occurs soon after the release of the President's annual budget submission and in advance of congressional hearings on agency budget requests. Agencies submit budget justifications to the appropriations subcommittees to support agency testimony and inform congressional deliberations. Beginning with the FY2008 executive budget cycle, agencies have also been required to post their congressional budget justification materials on the internet within two weeks of transmittal to Congress. Website links to FY2020 budget justification documents for each of the 15 executive departments and 9 selected independent agencies are provided below. The organization of the materials on agency websites can vary, therefore brief guidance for navigating to FY2020-specific materials is provided below the links as appropriate.
