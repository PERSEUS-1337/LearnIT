    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bandelier National Monument \nAdministrative Improvement and Watershed Protection Act of 1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n        (1) Bandelier National Monument (hereinafter, the Monument) was \n    established by Presidential proclamation on February 11, 1916, to \n    preserve the archeological resources of a ``vanished people, with \n    as much land as may be necessary for the proper protection thereof \n    . . .'' (No. 1322; 39 Stat. 1746).\n        (2) At various times since its establishment, the Congress and \n    the President have adjusted the Monument's boundaries and purpose \n    to further preservation of archeological and natural resources \n    within the Monument.\n            (A) On February 25, 1932, the Otowi Section of the Santa Fe \n        National Forest (some 4,699 acres of land) was transferred to \n        the Monument from the Santa Fe National Forest (Presidential \n        Proclamation No. 1191; 17 Stat. 2503).\n            (B) In December of 1959, 3,600 acres of Frijoles Mesa were \n        transferred to the National Park Service from the Atomic Energy \n        Committee (hereinafter, AEC) and subsequently added to the \n        Monument on January 9, 1991, because of ``pueblo-type \n        archeological ruins germane to those in the monument'' \n        (Presidential Proclamation No. 3388).\n            (C) On May 27, 1963, Upper Canyon, 2,882 acres of land \n        previously administered by the AEC, was added to the Monument \n        to preserve ``their unusual scenic character together with \n        geologic and topographic features, the preservation of which \n        would implement the purposes'' of the Monument (Presidential \n        Proclamation No. 3539).\n            (D) In 1976, concerned about upstream land management \n        activities that could result in flooding and erosion in the \n        Monument, Congress included the headwaters of the Rito de los \n        Frijoles and the Canada de Cochiti Grant (a total of 7,310 \n        acres) within the Monument's boundaries (Public Law 94-578; 90 \n        Stat. 2732).\n            (E) In 1976, Congress created the Bandelier Wilderness, a \n        23,267 acres area that covers over 70 percent of the Monument.\n        (3) The Monument still has potential threats from flooding, \n    erosion, and water quality deterioration because of the mixed \n    ownership of the upper watersheds, along its western border, \n    particularly in Alamo Canyon.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to modify the boundary of \nthe Monument to allow for acquisition and enhanced protection of the \nlands within the Monument's upper watershed.\n\nSEC. 3. BOUNDARY MODIFICATION.\n\n    Effective on the date of enactment of this Act, the boundaries of \nthe Monument shall be modified to include approximately 935 acres of \nland comprised of the Elk Meadows subdivision, the Gardner parcel, the \nClark parcel, and the Baca Land & Cattle Co. lands within the Upper \nAlamo watershed as depicted on the National Park Service map entitled \n``Proposed Boundary Expansion Map Bandelier National Monument'' dated \nJuly, 1997. Such map shall be on file and available for public \ninspection in the offices of the Director of the National Park Service, \nDepartment of the Interior.\n\nSEC. 4. LAND ACQUISITION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), the \nSecretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire lands and interests \ntherein within the boundaries of the area added to the Monument by this \nAct by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, transfer \nwith another Federal agency, or exchange: Provided, That no lands or \ninterests therein may be acquired except with the consent of the owner \nthereof.\n    (b) State and local lands.--Lands or interests therein owned by the \nState of New Mexico or a political subdivision thereof may only be \nacquired by donation or exchange.\n    (c) Acquisition of less than Fee interests in Land.--The Secretary \nmay acquire less than fee interests in land only if the Secretary \ndetermines that such less than fee acquisition will adequately protect \nthe Monument from flooding, erosion, and degradation of its drainage \nwaters.\n\nSEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the \nNational Park Service, shall manage the national Monument, including \nlands added to the Monument by this Act, in accordance with this Act \nand the provisions of law generally applicable to units of National \nPark System, including the Act of August 25, 1916, an Act to establish \na National Park Service (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), and such \nspecific legislation as heretofore has been enacted regarding the \nMonument.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \nnecessary to carry out the purpose of this Act.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
