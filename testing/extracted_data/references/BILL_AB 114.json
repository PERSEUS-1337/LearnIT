The bid under which the amount ascertained is the least shall be deemed to be the bid resulting in the lowest net interest cost. Under the true interest cost method, the bonds shall be awarded to the bidder submitting the lowest interest rate bid determined by the nominal interest rate that, when compounded semiannually and used to discount the debt service payments on the bonds to the date of the bonds, results in an amount equal to the price bid for the bonds, excluding interest accrued to the date of delivery.\nTemporary or interim bonds, certificates, or receipts of any denomination whatever, to be signed by the Treasurer, may be issued and delivered until the definitive bonds are executed and available for delivery.

This appropriation shall be inoperative as to any facility for which jurisdiction has been transferred pursuant to Section 15816.\nSEC. 11.\nThis act is a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill within the meaning of subdivision (e) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution, has been identified as related to the budget in the Budget Bill, and shall take effect immediately."
