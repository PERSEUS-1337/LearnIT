FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Precision agriculture technologies and practices allow \n        farmers to significantly increase crop yields, eliminate \n        overlap in operations, and reduce inputs such as seed, \n        fertilizer, pesticides, water, and fuel.\n            (2) These technologies allow farmers to collect data in \n        real time about their fields, automate field management, and \n        maximize resources.\n            (3) Studies estimate that precision agriculture \n        technologies can reduce agricultural operation costs by up to \n        25 dollars per acre and increase farm yields by up to 70 \n        percent by 2050.\n            (4) The critical cost savings and productivity benefits of \n        precision agriculture cannot be realized without the \n        availability of reliable broadband Internet access service \n        delivered to the agricultural land of the United States.\n            (5) The deployment of broadband Internet access service to \n        unserved agricultural land is critical to the United States \n        economy and to the continued leadership of the United States in \n        global food production.\n            (6) Despite the growing demand for broadband Internet \n        access service on agricultural land, broadband Internet access \n        service is not consistently available where needed for \n        agricultural operations.\n            (7) The Federal Communications Commission has an important \n        role to play in the deployment of broadband Internet access \n        service on unserved agricultural land to promote precision \n        agriculture.\n\nSEC. 3. TASK FORCE.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n            (1) the term ``broadband Internet access service''--\n                    (A) means a mass-market retail service by wire or \n                radio that provides the capability to transmit data to \n                and receive data from all or substantially all Internet \n                endpoints, including any capabilities that are \n                incidental to and enable the operation of the \n                communications service, but excluding dial-up Internet \n                access service; and\n                    (B) also encompasses any service that the \n                Commission finds to be providing a functional \n                equivalent of the service described in subparagraph \n                (A);\n            (2) the term ``Commission'' means the Federal \n        Communications Commission;\n            (3) the term ``Department'' means the Department of \n        Agriculture;\n            (4) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture;
