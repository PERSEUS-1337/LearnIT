FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) merchandise purchased from out-of-State firms is \n        subject to State and local sales taxes in the same manner as \n        merchandise purchased from in-State firms,\n            (2) State and local governments generally are unable to \n        compel out-of-State firms to collect and remit such taxes, and \n        consequently, many out-of-State firms choose not to collect \n        State and local taxes on merchandise delivered across State \n        lines,\n            (3) moreover, many out-of-State firms fail to inform their \n        customers that such taxes exist, with some firms even falsely \n        claim that merchandise purchased out-of-State is tax-free, and \n        consequently, many consumers unknowingly incur tax liabilities, \n        including interest and penalty charges,\n            (4) Congress has a duty to protect consumers from explicit \n        or implicit misrepresentations of State and local sales tax \n        obligations,\n            (5) small businesses, which are compelled to collect State \n        and local sales taxes, are subject to unfair competition when \n        out-of-State firms cannot be compelled to collect and remit \n        such taxes on their sales to residents of the State,\n            (6) State and local governments provide a number of \n        resources to out-of-State firms including government services \n        relating to disposal of tons of catalogs, mail delivery, \n        communications, and bank and court systems,\n            (7) the inability of State and local governments to require \n        out-of-State firms to collect and remit sales taxes deprives \n        State and local governments of needed revenue and forces such \n        State and local governments to raise taxes on taxpayers, \n        including consumers and small businesses, in such State,\n            (8) the Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North \n        Dakota, 112 S. Ct. 1904 (1992) that the due process clause of \n        the Constitution does not prohibit a State government from \n        imposing personal jurisdiction and tax obligations on out-of-\n        State firms that purposefully solicit sales from residents \n        therein, and that the Congress has the power to authorize State \n        governments to require out-of-State firms to collect State and \n        local sales taxes, and\n            (9) as a matter of federalism, the Federal Government has a \n        duty to assist State and local governments in collecting sales \n        taxes on sales from out-of-State firms.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORITY FOR COLLECTION OF SALES TAX.\n\n    (a) In General.--A State is authorized to require a person who is \nsubject to the personal jurisdiction of the State to collect and remit \na State sales tax, a local sales tax, or both, with respect to tangible \npersonal property if--\n            (1) the destination of the tangible personal property is in \n        the State,\n            (2) during the 1-year period ending on September 30 of the \n        calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the taxable \n        event occurs, the person has gross receipts from sales of such \n        tangible personal property--\n                    (A) in the United States exceeding $3,000,000, or\n                    (B) in the State exceeding $100,000, and\n            (3) the State, on behalf of its local jurisdictions, \n        collects and administers all local sales taxes imposed pursuant \n        to this Act.\n    (b) States Must Collect Local Sales Taxes.-- Except as provided in \nsection 4(d), a State in which both State and local sales taxes are \nimposed may not require State sales taxes to be collected and remitted \nunder subsection (a) unless the State also requires the local sales \ntaxes to be collected and remitted under subsection (a).\n    (c) Aggregation Rules.--All persons that would be treated as a \nsingle employer under section 52 (a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 shall be treated as one person for purposes of subsection \n(a).\n    (d) Destination.--For purposes of subsection (a), the destination \nof tangible personal property is the State or local jurisdiction which \nis the final location to which the seller ships or delivers the \nproperty, or to which the seller causes the property to be shipped or \ndelivered, regardless of the means of shipment or delivery or the \nlocation of the buyer.\n\nSEC. 4. TREATMENT OF LOCAL SALES TAXES.\n\n    (a) Uniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n            (1) In general.--Sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions \n        of a State shall be deemed to be uniform for purposes of this \n        Act and shall be collected under this Act in the same manner as \n        State sales taxes if--\n                    (A) such local sales taxes are imposed at the same \n                rate and on identical transactions in all geographic \n                areas in the State, and\n                    (B) such local sales taxes imposed on sales by out-\n                of-State persons are collected and administered by the \n                State.\n            (2) Application to border jurisdiction tax rates.--A State \n        shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of \n        paragraph (1)(A) if, with respect to a local jurisdiction which \n        borders on another State, such State or local jurisdiction--\n                    (A) either reduces or increases the local sales tax \n                in order to achieve a rate of tax equal to that imposed \n                by the bordering State on identical transactions, or\n                    (B) exempts from the tax transactions which are \n                exempt from tax in the bordering State.\n    (b) Nonuniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n        nonuniform local sales taxes required to be collected pursuant \n        to this Act shall be collected under one of the options \n        provided under paragraph (2).\n            (2) Election.--For purposes of paragraph (1), any person \n        required under authority of this Act to collect nonuniform \n        local sales taxes shall elect to collect either--\n                    (A) all nonuniform local sales taxes applicable to \n                transactions in the State, or\n                    (B) a fee (at the rate determined under paragraph \n                (3)) which shall be in lieu of the nonuniform local \n                sales taxes described in subparagraph (A).\n        Such election shall require the person to use the method \n        elected for all transactions in the State while the election is \n        in effect.\n            (3) Rate of in-lieu fee.--For purposes of paragraph (2)(B), \n        the rate of the in-lieu fee for any calendar year shall be an \n        amount equal to the product of--\n                    (A) the amount determined by dividing total \n                nonuniform local sales tax revenues collected in the \n                State for the most recently completed State fiscal year \n                for which data is available by total State sales tax \n                revenues for the same year, and\n                    (B) the State sales tax rate.\n        Such amount shall be rounded to the nearest 0.25 percent.\n            (4) Nonuniform local sales taxes.--For purposes of this \n        Act, nonuniform local sales taxes are local sales taxes which \n        do not meet the requirements of subsection (a).\n    (c) Distribution of Local Sales Taxes.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), a \n        State shall distribute to local jurisdictions a portion of the \n        amounts collected pursuant to this Act determined on the basis \n        of--\n                    (A) in the case of uniform local sales taxes, the \n                proportion which each local jurisdiction receives of \n                uniform local sales taxes not collected pursuant to \n                this Act,\n                    (B) in the case of in-lieu fees described in \n                subsection (b)(2)(B), the proportion which each local \n                jurisdiction's nonuniform local sales tax receipts \n                bears to the total nonuniform local sales tax receipts \n                in the State, and\n                    (C) in the case of any nonuniform local sales tax \n                collected pursuant to this Act, the geographical \n                location of the transaction on which the tax was \n                imposed.\n        The amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be \n        calculated on the basis of data for the most recently completed \n        State fiscal year for which the data is available.\n            (2) Timing.--Amounts described in paragraph (1) (B) or (C) \n        shall be distributed by a State to its local jurisdictions in \n        accordance with State timetables for distributing local sales \n        taxes, but not less frequently than every calendar quarter. \n        Amounts described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be distributed by a \n        State as provided under State law.\n            (3) Transition rule.--If, upon the effective date of this \n        Act, a State has a State law in effect providing a method for \n        distributing local sales taxes other than the method under this \n        subsection, then this subsection shall not apply to that State \n        until the 91st day following the adjournment sine die of that \n        State's next regular legislative session which convenes after \n        the effective date of this Act (or such earlier date as State \n        law may provide). Local sales taxes collected pursuant to this \n        Act prior to the application of this subsection shall be \n        distributed as provided by State law.\n    (d) Exception Where State Board Collects Taxes.--Notwithstanding \nsection 3(b) and subsections (b) and (c) of this section, if a State \nhad in effect on January 1, 1995, a State law which provides that local \nsales taxes are collected and remitted by a board of elected States \nofficers, then for any period during which such law continues in \neffect--\n            (1) the State may require the collection and remittance \n        under this Act of only the State sales taxes and the uniform \n        portion of local sales taxes, and\n            (2) the State may distribute any local sales taxes \n        collected pursuant to this Act in accordance with State law.\n\nSEC. 5. RETURN AND REMITTANCE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--A State may not require any person subject to this \nAct--\n            (1) to file a return reporting the amount of any tax \n        collected or required to be collected under this Act, or to \n        remit the receipts of such tax, more frequently than once with \n        respect to sales in a calendar quarter, or\n            (2) to file the initial such return, or to make the initial \n        such remittance, before the 90th day after the person's first \n        taxable transaction under this Act.\n    (b) Local Taxes.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall also apply \nto any person required by a State acting under authority of this Act to \ncollect a local sales tax or in-lieu fee.\n\nSEC. 6.
