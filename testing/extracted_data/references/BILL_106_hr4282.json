SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act''.\n\n          TITLE I--STATE CRIMINAL ALIEN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM II\n\nSEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram II Act of 2000''.\n\nSEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Federal policies and strategies aimed at curbing \n        illegal immigration and criminal alien activity implemented \n        along our Nation's southwest border influence the number of \n        crossings, especially their location.\n            (2) States and local governments were reimbursed \n        approximately 60 percent of the costs of the incarceration of \n        criminal aliens in fiscal year 1996 when only 90 jurisdictions \n        applied for such reimbursement. In subsequent years, the number \n        of local jurisdictions receiving reimbursement has increased. \n        For fiscal year 1999, 280 local jurisdictions applied, and \n        reimbursement amounted to only 40 percent of the costs incurred \n        by those jurisdictions.\n            (3) Certain counties, often with a small taxpayer base, \n        located on or near the border across from sometimes highly \n        populated areas of Mexico, suffer a substantially \n        disproportionate share of the impact of criminal illegal aliens \n        on its law enforcement and criminal justice systems.\n            (4) A University of Arizona study released in January 1998 \n        reported that at least 2 of the 4 counties located on Arizona's \n        border of Mexico, Santa Cruz and Cochise Counties, are burdened \n        with this problem--\n                    (A) for example, in 1998, Santa Cruz County had \n                12.7 percent of Arizona's border population but 50 \n                percent of alien crossings and 32.5 percent of illegal \n                alien apprehensions;\n                    (B) for fiscal year 1998, it is estimated that, of \n                its total criminal justice budget of $5,033,000, Santa \n                Cruz County spent $1,900,000 (39 percent) to process \n                criminal illegal aliens, of which over half was not \n                reimbursed by Federal monies; and\n                    (C) Santa Cruz County has not obtained relief from \n                this burden, despite repeated appeals to Federal and \n                State officials.\n            (5) In the State of Texas, the border counties of Cameron, \n        Dimmit, El Paso, Hidalgo, Kinney, Val Verde, and Webb bore the \n        unreimbursed costs of apprehension, prosecution, indigent \n        defense, and other related services for criminal aliens who \n        served more than 142,000 days in county jails.\n            (6) Throughout Texas nonborder counties bore similar \n        unreimbursed costs for apprehension, prosecution, indigent \n        defense, and other related services for criminal aliens who \n        served more than 1,000,000 days in county jails.\n            (7) The State of Texas has incurred substantial additional \n        unreimbursed costs for State law enforcement efforts made \n        necessary by the presence of criminal illegal aliens.\n            (8) The Federal Government should reimburse States and \n        units of local government for the related costs incurred by the \n        State for the imprisonment of any illegal alien.\n            (9) According to data from the Immigration and \n        Naturalization Service, 27 percent of all Border Patrol \n        apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 1999 \n        took place in the San Diego and El Centro sectors of \n        California. Yet, those counties were reimbursed for only a \n        fraction of the expenses associated with the criminal activity \n        of illegal aliens.\n            (10) It is estimated that it costs in excess of $50,000,000 \n        to San Diego and Imperial County hospitals to treat \n        undocumented individuals in  emergency rooms. In October of \n1997 the California State Auditor issued a report that estimated \nbetween $4,900,000 and $8,100,000 of unreimbursed medical expenses were \nincurred by U.S. Border Patrol ``dumping''.\n            (11) One example of costs incurred by health providers \n        involved an overturned van containing 20 undocumented persons \n        in Imperial County. One of the victims involved a young man who \n        suffered head trauma. This patient never regained consciousness \n        and the costs of his care were magnified by treating him at an \n        acute level, as placement to a lower level of care was not \n        possible. The cost of providing care for this patient alone was \n        in excess of $200,000.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is--\n            (1) to assist States and local communities by providing \n        financial assistance for expenditures for illegal juvenile \n        aliens, and for related costs to States and units of local \n        government that suffer a substantially disproportionate share \n        of the impact of criminal illegal aliens on their law \n        enforcement and criminal justice systems; and\n            (2) to ensure equitable treatment for those States and \n        local governments that are affected by Federal policies and \nstrategies aimed at curbing illegal immigration and criminal alien \nactivity implemented on the southwest border.\n\nSEC. 103.
