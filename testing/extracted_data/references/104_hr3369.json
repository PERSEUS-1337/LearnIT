The clerk shall thereupon record the name of the person \nincurring the penalty and the amount of the penalty in the judgment \ndocket. The penalty provided in the order so docketed shall become a \nlien upon the title to any interest in property owned by the person \nagainst whom the order is entered, and execution may be issued upon the \norder in the same manner as execution upon the judgment of a court of \nrecord.\n    (c) Civil Actions Against Employers.--(1) Any employer that fails \nto provide notice of a planned reduction in operations as required \nunder section 1 shall be liable to each aggrieved employee who suffers \nan employment loss as a result of such failure for--\n            (A) back pay for each day of violation at a rate of \n        compensation not less than the higher of--\n                    (i) the average regular rate received by such \n                employee during the last 3 years of the employee's \n                employment; or\n                    (ii) the final regular rate received by such \n                employee; and\n            (B) benefits under an employee benefit plan described in \n        section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n        1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002(3)), including the cost of medical \n        expenses incurred during the employment loss which would have \n        been covered under an employee benefit plan if the employment \n        loss had not occurred.\nSuch liability shall be calculated for the period of the violation, up \nto a maximum of 60 days, but in no event for more than one-half the \nnumber of days the employee was employed by the employer.\n    (2) The amount for which an employer is liable under paragraph (1) \nshall be reduced by--\n            (A) any wages paid by the employer to the employee for the \n        period of the violation;\n            (B) any voluntary and unconditional payment by the employer \n        to the employee that is not required by any legal obligation; \n        and\n            (C) any payment by the employer to a third party or trustee \n        (such as premiums for health benefits or payments to a defined \n        contribution pension plan) on behalf of and attributable to the \n        employee for the period of the violation.\nIn addition, any liability incurred under paragraph (1) with respect to \na defined benefit pension plan may be reduced by crediting the employee \nwith service for all purposes under such a plan for the period of the \nviolation.\n\nSEC. 8.
