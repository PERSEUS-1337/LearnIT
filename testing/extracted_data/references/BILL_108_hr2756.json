FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2001, the earned income credit provided over \n        $30,000,000,000 in tax relief to 18,500,000 low-income \n        taxpayers.\n            (2) The earned income credit is the second largest program, \n        after Medicaid, that provides assistance to low-income \n        individuals combating poverty.\n            (3) Data from the United States Census Bureau Current \n        Population Survey indicates that in 1999, the earned income \n        credit assisted 4,700,000 people, including 2,600,000 children \n        of low-income workers, to rise above the poverty line.\n            (4) Each year, between 15 and 25 percent of those who are \n        eligible to receive the earned income credit fail to claim \n        their credit, either because they are unaware of it or cannot \n        obtain the assistance they may need to properly complete the \n        appropriate tax return.\n            (5) Lack of education, language barriers, fear or \n        intimidation, limited financial resources, and unawareness of \n        the earned income credit all contribute to low-income families \n        and individuals not taking advantage of the credit.\n            (6) The Taxpayer Advocate's Fiscal Year 2002 Annual Report \n        notes, ``The laws and regulations governing family status in \n        the Internal Revenue Code are numerous and complex. As a \n        result, taxpayers must often seek the service of paid tax \n        preparers to claim credits and benefits on returns. Low income \n        taxpayers are particularly susceptible to this need. They rely \n        extensively on paid preparers to assist in navigating the \n        intricacies of the Earned Income Tax Credit''.\n            (7) 2002 Internal Revenue Service data indicates that \n        nearly 68 percent of earned income credit recipients pay \n        someone to prepare their tax returns, and fewer than 1 in 10 \n        have their tax returns prepared for free by the Volunteer \n        Income Tax Assistance program.\n            (8) An estimated $994,000,000 in earned income credit \n        refunds were paid by the taxpayer directly to tax preparers and \n        related businesses for costs associated with preparation, \n        filing, loans, and check cashing.\n            (9) Many low-income families and individuals are \n        disproportionately disadvantaged in meeting the financial \n        obligation of hiring tax preparers and purchasing tax \n        preparation products.\n            (10) According to the Taxpayer Advocate's Fiscal Year 2002 \n        Annual Report, ``The Internal Revenue Service must undertake a \n        significant consumer education campaign so that low income \n        taxpayers are able to make informed choices between tax \n        preparers and tax preparation products''.\n            (11) Increasing public awareness about the earned income \n        credit will lead to increased utilization of the credit by low-\n        income families and individuals.\n\nSEC. 3.
