FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More than 730,000 radio amateurs in the United States \n        are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission in the \n        amateur radio services.\n            (2) Amateur radio, at no cost to taxpayers, provides a \n        fertile ground for technical self-training in modern \n        telecommunications, electronics technology, and emergency \n        communications techniques and protocols.\n            (3) There is a strong Federal interest in the effective \n        performance of amateur stations established at the residences \n        of licensees. Such stations have been shown to be frequently \n        and increasingly precluded by unreasonable private land use \n        restrictions, including restrictive covenants.\n            (4) Federal Communications Commission regulations have for \n        three decades prohibited the application to stations in the \n        amateur service of State and local regulations that preclude or \n        fail to reasonably accommodate amateur service communications, \n        or that do not constitute the minimum practicable regulation to \n        accomplish a legitimate State or local purpose. Commission \n        policy has been and is to require States and localities to \n        permit erection of a station antenna structure at heights and \n        dimensions sufficient to accommodate amateur service \n        communications.\n            (5) The Commission has sought guidance and direction from \n        Congress with respect to the application of the Commission's \n        limited preemption policy regarding amateur service \n        communications to private land use restrictions, including \n        restrictive covenants.\n            (6) There are aesthetic and common property considerations \n        that are uniquely applicable to private land use regulations \n        and the community associations obligated to enforce covenants, \n        conditions, and restrictions in deed-restricted communities. \n        These considerations are dissimilar to those applicable to \n        State law and local ordinances regulating the same residential \n        amateur radio facilities.\n            (7) In recognition of these considerations, a separate \n        Federal policy than exists at section 97.15(b) of title 47, \n        Code of Federal Regulations, is warranted concerning amateur \n        service communications in deed-restricted communities.\n            (8) Community associations should fairly administer private \n        land use regulations in the interest of their communities, \n        while nevertheless permitting the installation and maintenance \n        of effective outdoor amateur radio antennas. There exist \n        antenna designs and installations that can be consistent with \n        the aesthetics and physical characteristics of land and \n        structures in community associations while accommodating \n        communications in the amateur radio services.\n\nSEC. 3. APPLICATION OF PRIVATE LAND USE RESTRICTIONS TO AMATEUR \n              STATIONS.\n\n    (a) Amendment of FCC Rules.--Not later than 120 days after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission \nshall amend section 97.15 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, by \nadding a new paragraph that prohibits the application to amateur \nstations of any private land use restriction, including a restrictive \ncovenant, that--\n            (1) on its face or as applied, precludes communications in \n        an amateur radio service;\n            (2) fails to permit a licensee in an amateur radio service \n        to install and maintain an effective outdoor antenna on \n        property under the exclusive use or control of the licensee; or\n            (3) does not constitute the minimum practicable restriction \n        on such communications to accomplish the lawful purposes of a \n        community association seeking to enforce such restriction.\n    (b) Additional Requirements.--In amending its rules as required by \nsubsection (a), the Commission shall--\n            (1) require any licensee in an amateur radio service to \n        notify and obtain prior approval from a community association \n        concerning installation of an outdoor antenna;\n            (2) permit a community association to prohibit installation \n        of any antenna or antenna support structure by a licensee in an \n        amateur radio service on common property not under the \n        exclusive use or control of the licensee; and\n            (3) subject to the standards specified in paragraphs (1) \n        and (2) of subsection (a), permit a community association to \n        establish reasonable written rules concerning height, location, \n        size, and aesthetic impact of, and installation requirements \n        for, outdoor antennas and support structures for the purpose of \n        conducting communications in the amateur radio services.\n\nSEC. 4. AFFIRMATION OF LIMITED PREEMPTION OF STATE AND LOCAL LAND USE \n              REGULATION.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission may not change section \n97.15(b) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, which shall remain \napplicable to State and local land use regulation of amateur service \ncommunications.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Community association.--The term ``community \n        association'' means any non-profit mandatory membership \n        organization composed of owners of real estate described in a \n        declaration of covenants or created pursuant to a covenant or \n        other applicable law with respect to which a person, by virtue \n        of the person's ownership of or interest in a unit or parcel, \n        is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance \n        premiums, maintenance, improvement, services, or other expenses \n        related to common elements, other units, or any other real \n        estate other than the unit or parcel described in the \n        declaration.\n            (2) Terms defined in regulations.--The terms ``amateur \n        radio services'', ``amateur service'', and ``amateur station'' \n        have the meanings given such terms in section 97.3 of title 47, \n        Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives September 12, 2016.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
