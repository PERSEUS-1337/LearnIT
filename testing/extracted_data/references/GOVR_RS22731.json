    "content": "The Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives (CAO) is an elected officer of the House. Elected at the beginning of each Congress with the slate of officers nominated by the majority party, the CAO's term coincides with the dates of that Congress. Initially created in the 104 th Congress (1995-1996) to replace the appointed Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services, the CAO oversees human resources, financial services, technology infrastructure, procurement, facilities management, and other support functions for the House of Representatives. The CAO's portfolio complements the legislative operations of the Clerk of the House and the security functions of the Sergeant at Arms. Consolidation of administrative functions of the House under the direction of a single individual began with the creation of the appointed position of Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services in the 102 nd Congress (1991-1992). Following the change in majority party from Democratic to Republican, the House in the 104 th Congress (1995-1996) abolished the position of Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services and created an elected position of Chief Administrative Officer of the House to assume his duties.  In the 102 nd Congress (1991-1992), Representative Richard Gephardt introduced H.Res. 423 , the House Administrative Reform Resolution of 1992. Among other provisions, H.Res. 423 created the Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services who was \"charged with running the daily nonlegislative and financial operations of the House.\" In debate on the resolution, Representative Gephardt summarized the role the director could play in the operation of the House. The Director is to be jointly appointed by the Speaker, the majority leader and the minority leader, and that individual must have extensive management and financial experience. Under the resolution, the Director, subject to policy direction and oversight of the House Administration Committee, would ultimately receive responsibility for the finance office, inside mail and internal mail operations, House information systems, office furnishings, office supply, office systems management, typewriter, the House restaurant system, telecommunications and telephone exchange, the barber shop and beauty shop, the non-legislative functions of printing services, the recording studio, and the records and registration office, the office of photography, the guide service, and the House child care center. Following debate, the House agreed to H.Res. 423 by a vote of 269 to 81. The resolution amended the Rules of the House to create Rule LII establishing the Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services and defining the Director's authority over administrative and financial functions of the House. In January 1993, the rule governing the Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services was incorporated into to Rule VI with the adoption of the rules for the 103 rd Congress (1993-1994). The first Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services, Lt. Gen. Leonard P. Wishart, III (ret.), was jointly appointed by the Speaker, the majority leader, and the minority leader on October 23, 1992. In the 104 th Congress (1995-1996), as part of the rules package agreed to on January 5, 1995, the House abolished the appointed Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services position and created a new officer of the House, the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO). Elected by the House, the CAO provides infrastructure and support for House member and committee operations. The support provided includes managing employee payroll, benefits, child care, parking, dining services, and installing furniture in member offices. The Committee on House Administration provides \"oversight of the ... Chief Administrative Officer.\" Limited discussion of the creation of the CAO position took place in the debate on the Rules of the House ( H.Res. 6 ) for the 104 th Congress (1995-1996). Representative Ben Cardin advocated for appointing, not electing, the CAO to ensure the position remained bipartisan and outside of politics. \u2026[W]here a partisan Chief Administrative Officer will replace a nonpartisan Chief Administrative Officer will replace a nonpartisan Director of Financial and Non-Legislative Services. Many of us on both sides of the aisle have been working for less partisanism [sic], particularly in the administration of the House of Representatives. It was the Republicans who worked with us to develop the Director of Financial and Non-Legislative Services, being approved by both the majority and minority, reporting to a committee composed of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. What happens under this particular bill? That office is abolished and replaced with a partisan Chief Administrative Officer. A few months ago the Republicans favored bipartisanism in administration to avoid the abuse of power by any one party. Now, just a few months later, we see a complete reversal. As an elected official of the House, the CAO is elected by House members on the first day of a new Congress. In general, the majority party introduces a resolution to elect the officers of the House, including the CAO. The slate of candidates is often chosen by the majority party leadership, sometimes with consultation with the minority. After the resolution's introduction, the minority party typically offers an amendment to nominate their own slate of candidates for office. The vote to agree to the resolution is generally a party line vote. In two cases, the Speaker has named an interim CAO following the resignation of the elected official. The first instance occurred in the 105 th Congress (1997-1998) when Speaker Newt Gingrich, pursuant to his authority under 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 75a-1(a), appointed Jeff Trandahl \"to act as and to exercise temporarily the duties of the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives.\" The second instance occurred on July 15, 2010, following the resignation of CAO Daniel Beard. Speaker Nancy Pelosi used her authority pursuant to 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 75a-1(a) to appoint Daniel J. Strodel as interim CAO, effective July 18, 2010. The appointment for an interim CAO lasts until the House elects a replacement. The CAO's office supervises the non-legislative functions of the House of Representatives. CAO office divisions are organized along operational and mission lines that include the immediate office of the CAO, operations, and customer solutions. The immediate office includes the office of the chief administrative officer and his support staff. It is responsible for oversight of the operations and customer solutions divisions and directing studies ordered by the House leadership. The immediate office also supervises the management of the three House media galleries, which provide facilities for press coverage of the House; assists members of Congress and staff with the distribution of press releases; issues the CAO's semi-annual report on the office's activities and accomplishments; and issues the \"Statement of Disbursements of the House.\" The immediate office also maintains a public website, http://cao.house.gov . Operations is responsible for developing and maintaining facilities and systems that are used by the House of Representatives, including financial management, procurement, technology, and human resources. In addition, operations staff serve as consultants to members' offices on their internal operations and systems. Operations is divided into four groups: Administration and Financial Services , handling procurement, financial counseling, payroll and benefits, budget management, resources management, human resources, and workplace safety; Workforce Services , handling employee and organizational development, employee assistance, the House learning center, and House child care; House Information Resources , handling technology support, technology infrastructure, business solutions, web solutions, facilities management, informational security, and systems engineering; and Immediate Operations Office , handling business continuity and disaster recovery, business improvement, portfolio management, and committee hearing rooms renovation. In addition, operations manages projects that affect all House employees. These include improving payroll and benefit services, introducing new financial and purchasing systems, upgrading \"HouseNet,\" and updating the House messaging system. Customer Solutions is responsible for facilitating the daily work of congressional staff members through the CAO Customer Solutions Center (CCSC), which includes the CAO call center, FirstCall+. Customer Solutions is divided into three groups: Customer Solutions Delivery , handling the CCSC, the House recording studio, the office supply store, the House gift shop, and photography; Assets, Furnishings and Logistics , handling acquisition, payments, equipment maintenance, equipment inventory management, warehousing, carpet, drapes, upholstery, cabinetry, finishing, and modular furniture; and Immediate Customer Solutions Office , handling the disbursement of House resources and supplies and the management of customer relationships. Customer Solutions is also responsible for office renovations and moving members of the House and their staff to new offices. This responsibility includes holding equipment fairs to demonstrate new technology and products, and service fairs to highlight support offices, including the Architect of the Capitol, the Library of Congress (including the Congressional Research Service), the Clerk of the House, and the Sergeant at Arms. In March 2007, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and the then chair of the Committee on House Administration, the late Juanita Millender-McDonald, asked CAO Daniel Beard and his Senate counterparts to \"undertake a 'Green the Capitol' initiative to ensure that the House institutes the most up-to-date industry and government standards for green building and green operating procedures. \" Since 2007, the \"Green the Capitol\" initiative has worked to reduce the carbon footprint of the House through numerous programs including my green office, installing low VOC (volatile organic compounds) carpets in House offices, purchasing renewable electricity, using green cleaning products, and working with House food service vendor Restaurant Associates to use locally sourced food and biodegradable containers and utensils in the cafeterias. Since the creation of the office of the Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services in the 102 nd Congress (1991-1992), seven individuals have served as either the Director or as CAO of the House on a temporary or permanent basis. Table A-1 provides a list of Directors and CAOs, including the Congress in which they served, and the date of their appointment or election."
