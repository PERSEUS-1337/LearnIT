FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) a United States Army Dust Off crewman is a helicopter \n        crew member who served honorably in the Vietnam War aboard a \n        helicopter air ambulance under the radio call sign ``Dust \n        Off'';\n            (2) Dust Off crews performed aeromedical evacuation for \n        United States, Vietnamese, and allied forces inside South \n        Vietnam from May 1962 through March 1973;\n            (3) nearing the end of World War II, the United States Army \n        began using helicopters for medical evacuation and years later, \n        during the Korean War, these helicopter air ambulances were \n        responsible for transporting 17,700 United States casualties;\n            (4) during the Vietnam War, with the use of helicopter air \n        ambulances, United States Army Dust Off crews pioneered the \n        concept of dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and rescued \n        almost 900,000 United States, South Vietnamese, and other \n        allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy forces;\n            (5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool to assist \n        those injured on the battlefield;\n            (6) highly skilled and intrepid, Dust Off crews were able \n        to operate the helicopters and land them on almost any terrain \n        in nearly any weather to pick up wounded, after which the Dust \n        Off crews could provide care to these patients while \n        transporting them to ready medical facilities;\n            (7) the vital work of the Dust Off crews required \n        consistent combat exposure and often proved to be the \n        difference between life and death for wounded personnel;\n            (8) the revolutionary concept of a dedicated combat life-\n        saving system was cultivated and refined by United States Army \n        Dust Off crews during 11 years of intense conflict in and above \n        the jungles of South Vietnam;\n            (9) innovative and resourceful Dust Off crews in Vietnam \n        were responsible for taking the new concept of helicopter \n        medical evacuation, born just a few years earlier, and \n        revolutionizing it to meet and surpass the previously \n        unattainable goal of delivering a battlefield casualty to an \n        operating table within the vaunted ``golden hour'';\n            (10) some Dust Off units in Vietnam operated so efficiently \n        that they were able to deliver a patient to a waiting medical \n        facility on an average of 33 minutes from the receipt of the \n        mission, which saved the lives of countless personnel in \n        Vietnam, and this legacy continues for modern-day Dust Off \n        crews;\n            (11) the inherent danger of being a member of a Dust Off \n        crew in Vietnam meant that there was a 1 in 3 chance of being \n        wounded or killed;\n            (12) many battles during the Vietnam War raged at night, \n        and members of the Dust Off crews often found themselves \n        searching for a landing zone in complete darkness, in bad \n        weather, over mountainous terrain, and all while being the \n        target of intense enemy fire as they attempted to rescue the \n        wounded, which caused Dust Off crews to suffer a rate of \n        aircraft loss that was more than 3 times that of all other \n        types of combat helicopter missions in Vietnam;\n            (13) the 54th Medical Detachment typified the constant \n        heroism displayed by Dust Off crews in Vietnam, over the span \n        of a 10-month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters and 40 \n        soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644 \n        missions while being airborne for 4,832 hours;\n            (14) collectively, the members of the 54th Medical \n        Detachment earned 78 awards for valor, including 1 Medal of \n        Honor, 1 Distinguished Service Cross, 14 Silver Star Medals, 26 \n        Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Bronze Star Medals for valor, 4 \n        Air Medals for valor, 4 Soldier's Medals, and 26 Purple Heart \n        Medals;\n            (15) the 54th Medical Detachment displayed heroism on a \n        daily basis and set the standard for all Dust Off crews in \n        Vietnam;\n            (16) 5 members of the 54th Medical Detachment are in the \n        Dust Off Hall of Fame, 3 are in the Army Aviation Hall of Fame, \n        and 1 is the only United States Army aviator in the National \n        Aviation Hall of Fame;\n            (17) Dust Off crew members are among the most highly \n        decorated soldiers in American military history;\n            (18) in early 1964, Major Charles L. Kelly was the \n        Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter \n        Ambulance), Provisional, in Soc Trang, South Vietnam;\n            (19) Major Kelly helped to forge the Dust Off call sign \n        into history as one of the most welcomed phrases to be heard \n        over the radio by wounded soldiers in perilous and dire \n        situations;\n            (20) in 1964, Major Kelly was killed in action as he \n        gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a wounded American \n        soldier and several Vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied, \n        after being warned to stay away from the landing zone due to \n        the ferocity of enemy fire, ``When I have your wounded.'';\n            (21) General William Westmoreland, Commander, Military \n        Assistance Command, Vietnam (1964-1968), singled out Major \n        Kelly as an example of ``the greatness of the human spirit'' \n        and highlighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in \n        combat;\n            (22) General Creighton Abrams, Westmoreland's successor \n        (1968-1972), and former Chief of Staff of the United States \n        Army, highlighted the heroism of Dust Off crews, ``A special \n        word about the Dust Offs . . . Courage above and beyond the \n        call of duty was sort of routine to them. It was a daily thing, \n        part of the way they lived. That's the great part, and it meant \n        so much to every last man who served there. Whether he ever got \n        hurt or not, he knew Dust Off was there.'';\n            (23) Dust Off crews possessed unique skills and traits that \n        made them highly successful in aeromedical evacuation in \n        Vietnam, including indomitable courage, extraordinary aviation \n        skill and sound judgment under fire, high-level medical \n        expertise, and an unequaled dedication to the preservation of \n        human life;\n            (24) members of the United States Armed Forces on the \n        ground in Vietnam had their confidence and battlefield prowess \n        reinforced knowing that there were heroic Dust Off crews just a \n        few minutes from the fight, which was instrumental to their \n        well-being, willingness to fight, and morale;\n            (25) military families in the United States knew that their \n        loved ones would receive the quickest and best possible care in \n        the event of a war-time injury, thanks to the Dust Off crews;\n            (26) the willingness of Dust Off crews to also risk their \n        lives to save helpless civilians left an immeasurably positive \n        impression on the people of Vietnam and exemplified the finest \n        American ideals of compassion and humanity; and\n            (27) Dust Off crews from the Vietnam War hailed from every \n        State in the United States and represented numerous ethnic, \n        religious, and cultural backgrounds.\n\nSEC. 3.
