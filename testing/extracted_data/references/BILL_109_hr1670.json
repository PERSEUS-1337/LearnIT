FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, \n        two weeks before the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Egyptian \n        Government daily newspaper Al-Akhbar published a column that \n        stated: ``The Statue of Liberty, in New York Harbor, must be \n        destroyed because of following the idiotic American policy that \n        goes from disgrace to disgrace in the swamp of bias and blind \n        fanaticism.''.\n            (2) Since forging a ``cold peace'' with Israel in 1978, the \n        Government of Egypt has placed severe trade restrictions on \n        Israeli goods and Egyptian Government officials have allowed \n        anti-Semitic articles and cartoons to flood the semi-official \n        Egyptian press.\n            (3) In violation of the 1979 peace agreement between Egypt \n        and Israel, Egypt continues to promote a boycott of Israeli \n        products.\n            (4) The Israeli Defense Forces have repeatedly found arms \n        smuggling tunnels between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. More than \n        40 tunnels were discovered in 2003. Some of these tunnels \n        originate in Egyptian army and police outposts.\n            (5) Despite facing no major regional external threat, Egypt \n        has used military assistance from the United States to purchase \n        combat aircraft, advanced missile systems, tanks, and naval \n        vessels that undermine Israel's security.\n            (6) The Coptic Christian minority of between 6 and 10 \n        million in Egypt is victimized regularly, and remains without \n        protection. The Government of Egypt has never taken \n        responsibility for the arrest and torture of more than 1,200 \n        Copts in late 1998 in the wake of sectarian violence.\n            (7) Egypt regularly tortures its citizens. According to the \n        Egyptian Organization for Human Rights approximately 13,000 to \n        16,000 people are detained without charge on suspicion of \n        security or political offenses in Egypt each year. Amnesty \n        International published a report in 2003 stating that \n        ``everyone taken into detention in Egypt is at risk of \n        torture''.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE FOR EGYPT.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for \nfiscal year 2006 and subsequent fiscal years, United States military \nassistance may not be provided for Egypt.\n    (b) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of subsection \n(a) for a fiscal year if the President determines and certifies to \nCongress that it is in the national security interests of the United \nStates to do so.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the amount of United States military assistance that \n        would have been provided for Egypt for a fiscal year but for \n        the application of section 3(a) should be provided for Egypt \n        for such fiscal year in the form of economic support fund \n        assistance under chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance \n        Act of 1961 and further that such assistance should be in \n        addition to economic support fund assistance already proposed \n        to be provided for Egypt for such fiscal year;\n            (2) funds for economic support fund assistance for Egypt \n        should not be used by the armed forces of Egypt;\n            (3) 30 days prior to the initial obligation of funds for \n        economic support fund assistance for Egypt for a fiscal year, \n        the President should certify to Congress that procedures have \n        been established to ensure that the Comptroller General will \n        have access to appropriate United States financial information \n        in order to review the uses of such funds; and\n            (4) the agreement among the United States, Egypt, and \n        Israel to decrease the overall amount of United States foreign \n        assistance for both countries should continue.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITION.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``United States military assistance'' means--\n            (1) assistance for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, \n        demining and related programs and activities, including \n        assistance under chapter 8 of part II of the Foreign Assistance \n        Act of 1961 (relating to anti-terrorism assistance) and \n        assistance under chapter 9 of part II of such Act, section 504 \n        of the FREEDOM Support Act, section 23 of the Arms Export \n        Control Act, or the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for demining \n        activities, the clearance of unexploded ordnance, the \n        destruction of small arms, and related activities;\n            (2) assistance under section 541 of the Foreign Assistance \n        Act of 1961 (relating to international military education and \n        training); and\n            (3) assistance under section 23 of the Arms Export Control \n        Act (relating to the ``Foreign Military Finance'' program)."
