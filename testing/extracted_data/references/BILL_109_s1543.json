FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Strong academic health centers are essential to a \n        vigorous clinical research enterprise.\n            (2) Breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences over the \n        past 5 decades have provided an unprecedented supply of \n        information for improving human health and preventing disease.\n            (3) Translating the information gained through these basic \n        discoveries into knowledge that will impact clinical practice \n        and ultimately human health requires strong clinical research \n        institutions.\n            (4) The enhancement of clinical research career programs \n        and opportunity will sustain the momentum of the discovery, \n        development, and delivery of important health advances.\n            (5) Without a sound infrastructure to accomplish this \n        translation in a systematic and coherent way, the sum of data \n        and information produced by the basic science enterprise will \n        not result in tangible public benefit.\n            (6) The clinical research environment is increasingly \n        encumbered by incompatible databases, shortage of qualified \n        investigators, rising costs, inadequate funding, and mounting \n        unreimbursed regulatory burdens such as human subject research \n        protections and additional record-keeping requirements under \n        the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of \n        1996.\n\nSEC. 3.
