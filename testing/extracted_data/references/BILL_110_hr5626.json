FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On November 26, 2007, by signing the Declaration of \n        Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and \n        Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States \n        of America (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Declaration of Principles''), the President of the United \n        States pledged to negotiate by July 2008 an agreement to \n        replace the United Nations mandate that currently provides \n        international legal authority as well as immunity from Iraqi \n        prosecution for United States Armed Forces and other Coalition \n        forces operating in Iraq.\n            (2) In the Declaration of Principles, the President pledged \n        that this agreement would include the following security \n        commitments by the United States:\n                    (A) ``Supporting the Republic of Iraq in defending \n                its democratic system against internal and external \n                threats.''.\n                    (B) ``Providing security assurances and commitments \n                to the Republic of Iraq to deter foreign aggression \n                against Iraq that violates its sovereignty and \n                integrity of its territories, waters, or airspace.''.\n                    (C) ``Supporting the Republic of Iraq in its \n                efforts to combat all terrorist groups, at the \n                forefront of which is Al-Qaeda, Saddamists, and all \n                other outlaw groups regardless of affiliation, and \n                destroy their logistical networks and their sources of \n                finance, and defeat and uproot them from Iraq.''.\n            (3) However, in testimony before the United States Senate \n        on February 6, 2008, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \n        effectively renounced this pledge by the President when he \n        said, ``[T]he status of forces agreement that is being \n        discussed will not contain a commitment to defend Iraq, and \n        neither will any strategic framework agreement. My \n        understanding is--and it's, frankly, a clearer point than I \n        made earlier--and we certainly do not consider the declaration \n        of principles a security commitment to the Iraqis.''.\n            (4) On November 26, 2007, the President's Deputy National \n        Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan, General Douglas \n        Lute, stated in a press briefing that permanent United States \n        military bases in Iraq ``will certainly be a key item for \n        negotiation next year''. On January 28, 2008, when signing into \n        law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n        2008, which includes a ban on permanent United States military \n        bases in Iraq, President George W. Bush indicated in a signing \n        statement accompanying the bill that he would not be bound by a \n        provision of that law that prohibits the United States from \n        establishing permanent military bases in Iraq.\n            (5) However, in testimony before the Senate on February 6, \n        2008, Secretary of Defense Gates stated, ``The fact is, in \n        every meeting that I've taken part in, it has been affirmed \n        from the president on down that we do not want permanent bases \n        in Iraq.''.\n            (6) General Lute stated in a press briefing on November 26, \n        2007, in response to a question as to whether the \n        Administration would seek congressional input into the \n        agreement, ``We don't anticipate now that these negotiations \n        will lead to the status of a formal treaty which would then \n        bring us to formal negotiations or formal inputs from the \n        Congress.''. However, the Department of State has failed to \n        consult with congressional leaders on the Declaration of \n        Principles as required by the Department of State's Circular \n        175 procedure, which implements United States law regarding the \n        conduct of negotiations for international agreements.\n            (7) However, in testimony before the Senate on February 6, \n        2008, Secretary of Defense Gates stated, ``My view is that \n        there ought to be a great deal of openness and transparency to \n        the Congress as we negotiate this status of forces agreement so \n        that you can satisfy yourselves that those kinds of commitments \n        are not being made, and that there are no surprises in this.''.\n            (8) According to the Congressional Research Service, while \n        the primary purpose of a status of forces agreement between the \n        United States and another country or organization is typically \n        to provide United States Armed Forces with immunity from local \n        prosecution, and no existing status of forces agreement \n        authorizes offensive combat operations by United States Armed \n        Forces (absent reference to a treaty, law, or United Nations \n        Security Council resolution), Secretary of Defense Gates and \n        Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have written in an opinion \n        piece published February 13, 2008, in the Washington Post that \n        it is the intention of the Administration to have the status of \n        forces agreement with Iraq include the ``authority to fight'' \n        for United States Armed Forces engaged in combat operations.\n            (9) The inconsistencies between the various statements and \n        pledges described in paragraphs (1) through (8) raise \n        significant questions about the Administration's objectives in \n        seeking new agreements with Iraq.\n            (10)(A) Since August 6, 2004, United States Armed Forces \n        and other Coalition forces in Iraq have had international legal \n        authority to operate in Iraq under the United Nations mandate \n        for the Multinational Force-Iraq, most recently renewed in \n        December 2007 until December 31, 2008, and have had immunity \n        from local prosecution under an Iraqi law known as CPA Order \n        17, which is dependent on that mandate.\n            (B) The Iraqi Ambassador to the United States, Samir \n        Sumaidaie, said on February 5, 2008, ``If we cannot have an \n        agreement by that time [December 31, 2008,] we would have no \n        choice but to go back to the Security Council. Basically, we \n        need to have some legal cover for foreign forces.''.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS.\n\n    No funds appropriated or otherwise made available to any department \nor agency of the United States may be used--\n            (1) to establish or maintain any permanent or long-term \n        United States military base or facility in Iraq; or\n            (2) to implement any agreement that is consistent with the \n        security commitments of the United States to Iraq under the \n        Declaration of Principles, including the security commitments \n        described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of section 1(2) of \n        this Act, or any agreement that provides ``authority to fight'' \n        for United States Armed Forces engaged in combat operations, \n        other than for self-defense purposes, unless the agreement is \n        in the form of a treaty with respect to which the Senate has \n        given its advice and consent to ratification under Article II \n        of the Constitution of the United States or the agreement is \n        approved by an Act of Congress enacted after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) long-term relations between the United States and Iraq \n        should be determined by the United States Administration taking \n        office on January 20, 2009;\n            (2) in determining its policy toward Iraq, the United \n        States Administration referred to in paragraph (1) should \n        consult fully with the United States Congress, the Government \n        of Iraq, Coalition partners, and Iraq's neighbors; and\n            (3) to maintain current international legal authority as \n        well as immunity from Iraqi prosecution for United States Armed \n        Forces and other Coalition forces operating in Iraq while the \n        United States Administration referred to in paragraph (1) \n        determines United States policy toward Iraq, the current United \n        States Administration should encourage the Government of Iraq \n        to request the renewal of the United Nations mandate for Iraq \n        beyond December 31, 2008."
