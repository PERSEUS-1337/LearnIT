FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Recreational fishing is traditionally the most popular \n        outdoor sport with more than 50,000,000 participants of all \n        ages, in all regions of the country.\n            (2) Recreational anglers makes a substantial contribution \n        to local, State, and national economies and infuse \n        $116,000,000,000 annually into the national economy.\n            (3) In the United States, more than 1,200,000 jobs are \n        related to recreational fishing, a number that is approximately \n        1 percent of the entire civilian workforce in the United \n        States. In communities that rely on seasonal tourism, the \n        expenditures of recreational anglers result in substantial \n        benefits to the local economies and small businesses in those \n        communities.\n            (4) Recreational anglers have long demonstrated a \n        conservation ethic. In addition to payment of Federal excise \n        taxes on fishing equipment, motorboats and fuel, as well as \n        license fees, recreational anglers contribute more than \n        $500,000,000 annually to State fisheries conservation \n        management programs and projects.\n            (5) It is a long standing policy of the Federal Government \n        to allow public access to public lands and waters for \n        recreational purposes in a manner that is consistent with \n        principals of sound conservation. This policy is reflected in \n        the National Forest Management Act of 1976, the Wilderness Act, \n        the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and the National Parks and \n        Recreation Act of 1978.\n            (6) In most instances, recreational fishery resources can \n        be maintained without restricting public access to fishing \n        areas through a variety of management measures including take \n        limits, minimum size requirements, catch and release \n        requirements, gear adaptations, and closed seasons.\n            (7) A clear policy is required to demonstrate to \n        recreational anglers that recreational fishing can be managed \n        without unnecessarily prohibiting such fishing.\n            (8) A comprehensive policy on the implementation, use, and \n        monitoring of marine protected areas is required to maintain \n        the optimum balance between recreational fishing and sustaining \n        recreational fishery resources.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to promote sound conservation \nof fishery resources by ensuring that--\n            (1) Federal regulations promote access to fishing areas by \n        recreational anglers to the maximum extent practicable;\n            (2) recreational anglers are actively involved in the \n        formulation of any regulatory procedure that contemplates \n        imposing restrictions on access to a fishing area; and\n            (3) limitations on access to fishing areas by recreational \n        anglers are not imposed unless such limitations are \n        scientifically necessary to provide for the conservation of a \n        fishery resource.\n\nSEC. 4. MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT \n              AMENDMENTS.\n\n    (a) Limitation on Closures.--Section 303(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1853(a)) is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n            ``(15) not establish geographic areas where recreational \n        fishing is prohibited unless--\n                    ``(A) clear indication exists that recreational \n                fishing in such area is the cause of a specific \n                conservation problem in the fishery;\n                    ``(B) no alternative conservation measures related \n                to recreational fishing, such as gear restrictions, \n                quotas, or closed seasons will adequately provide for \n                conservation and management of the fishery;\n                    ``(C) the management plan--\n                            ``(i) provides for specific measurable \n                        criteria to assess whether the \nprohibition provides conservation benefits to the fishery; and\n                            ``(ii) requires a periodic review to assess \n                        the continued need for the prohibition not less \n                        than once every 3 years;\n                    ``(D) the best available scientific information \n                supports the need to close the area to recreational \n                fishing; and\n                    ``(E) the prohibition is terminated as soon as the \n                condition in subparagraph (A) that was the basis of the \n                prohibition no longer exists.''.\n    (b) Technical Amendments.--Such section is further amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (13), by striking ``and'' after the \n        semicolon; and\n            (2) in paragraph (14), by striking ``fishery.'' and \n        inserting ``fishery; and''.\n\nSEC. 5. NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES ACT AMENDMENT.\n\n    Section 304(a)(5) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. \n1434(a)(5)) is amended to read as follows:\n            ``(5) Fishing regulations.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall provide the \n                appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council with \n                the opportunity to prepare, and to revise from time to \n                time, draft regulations for fishing within the \n                exclusive economic zone as the Council may deem \n                necessary to implement the proposed designation.\n                    ``(B) Relationship to magnuson.--Draft regulations \n                prepared by the Council under subparagraph (A) shall be \n                made in accordance with the standards and procedures of \n                the Magnuson Act.\n                    ``(C) Regulation within a state.--Such regulations \n                may regulate a fishery within the boundaries of a State \n                (other than the State's internal waters) if--\n                            ``(i) the Governor of the State approves \n                        such regulation; or\n                            ``(ii) the Secretary determines, after \n                        notice and an opportunity for a hearing in \n                        accordance with section 554 of title 5, United \n                        States Code, that the State has taken any \n                        action, or omitted to take any action, the \n                        results of which will substantially and \n                        adversely affect the fulfillment of the \n                        purposes and policies of this Act and the goals \n                        and objectives of the proposed designation.\n                    ``(D) Notification and hearing.--If the Secretary \n                makes a determination under subparagraph (C)(ii) to \n                regulate a fishery within the boundaries of such State \n                (other than State's internal waters)--\n                            ``(i) the Secretary shall promptly notify \n                        the State and the appropriate Council of such \n                        determination;\n                            ``(ii) the State may request that a hearing \n                        be held pursuant to section 554 of title 5, \n                        United States Code; and\n                            ``(iii) the Secretary shall conduct a \n                        hearing requested under clause (ii) prior to \n                        taking any action to regulate a fishery within \n                        the boundaries of such State (other than the \n                        State's internal waters) under subparagraph \n                        (C)(ii).\n                    ``(E) Termination of regulation within a state.--If \n                the Secretary, pursuant to a determination under \n                subparagraph (C)(ii), assumes responsibility for the \n                regulation of any fishery, the State involved may at \n                any time thereafter apply to the Secretary for \n                reinstatement of its authority over such fishery.
