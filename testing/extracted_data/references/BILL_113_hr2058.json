FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An estimated 13,500 children and adolescents under age \n        20 are diagnosed with cancer each year.\n            (2) In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer \n        survived more than 5 years, but today, cure rates have \n        increased to over 80 percent for children and adolescents under \n        age 20.\n            (3) The population of survivors of childhood cancers has \n        grown dramatically, to over 360,000 individuals of all ages as \n        of 2012.\n            (4) As many as two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors are \n        likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment, \n        with as many as one-fourth experiencing a late effect that is \n        serious or life-threatening. The most common late effects of \n        childhood cancer are neurocognitive, psychological, \n        cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects and \n        secondary malignancies.\n            (5) As a result of disparities in the delivery of cancer \n        care, minority, low-income, and other medically underserved \n        children are more likely to be diagnosed with late stage \n        disease, experience poorer treatment outcomes, have shorter \n        survival time with less quality of life, and experience a \n        substantially greater likelihood of cancer death.\n            (6) The late effects of cancer treatment may change as \n        therapies evolve, which means that the monitoring and care of \n        cancer survivors may need to be modified on a routine basis.\n            (7) Despite the intense stress caused by childhood cancer, \n        there is a lack of standardized and coordinated psychosocial \n        care for the children and their families, from the date of \n        diagnosis through treatment and survivorship.\n            (8) The Institute of Medicine, in its report on cancer \n        survivorship entitled ``Childhood Cancer Survivorship: \n        Improving Care and Quality of Life'', states that an organized \n        system of care and a method of care for pediatric cancer \n        survivors is needed.\n            (9) Focused and well-designed research and pilot health \n        delivery programs can answer questions about the optimal ways \n        to provide health care, follow-up monitoring services, and \n        survivorship care to those diagnosed with childhood cancer and \n        contribute to improvements in the quality of care and quality \n        of life of those individuals.\n\nSEC. 3.
