HOME HEATING OIL AND PROPANE CONSUMERS.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n            (1) Carbon content.--The term ``carbon content'' means the \n        amount of carbon dioxide that will be emitted as a result of \n        the combustion of a fuel.\n            (2) Cost-effective.--The term ``cost-effective'', with \n        respect to an energy efficiency program or measure, means that \n        the program or measure meets the Total Resource Cost Test, \n        which requires that the net present value of economic benefits \n        over the life of the program or measure, including avoided \n        supply and delivery costs and deferred or avoided investments, \n        is greater than the net present value of the economic costs \n        over the life of the program or measure, including program \n        costs and incremental costs borne by the energy consumer.\n    (b) Allocation.--Not later than September 30 of each of calendar \nyears 2012 through 2030, the Administrator shall distribute among the \nStates, in accordance with this section, 1.5 percent of the emission \nallowances that the Administrator has established for the year in which \nsuch distribution is made (adjusted as necessary to preserve budget \nneutrality).\n    (c) Distribution Among States.--The Administrator shall distribute \nallowances among the States under this section each year ratably based \non the ratio of--\n            (1) the carbon content of home heating oil and propane sold \n        to consumers within each State in the preceding year for \n        residential or commercial uses; to\n            (2) the carbon content of home heating oil and propane sold \n        to consumers within the United States in the preceding year for \n        residential or commercial uses.\n    (d) Sale of Allowances.--Each State receiving emission allowances \nunder this section shall sell such allowances within 1 year of receipt, \neither directly or through consignment to the Administrator for \nauction. Emission allowances distributed under this section that are \nnot sold within 1 year of receipt by a State shall be returned to the \nAdministrator, who shall distribute such allowances to the remaining \nStates ratably in accordance with the formula in subsection (c).\n    (e) Use of Proceeds.--\n            (1) In general.--States shall use the proceeds from sales \n        of emission allowances distributed under this section \n        exclusively for the benefit of consumers of home heating oil or \n        propane for residential or commercial purposes. Such proceeds \n        shall be used exclusively for--\n                    (A) cost-effective energy efficiency programs for \n                consumers that use home heating oil or propane for \n                residential or commercial purposes; or\n                    (B) rebates or other direct financial assistance \n                programs for consumers of home heating oil or propane \n                used for residential or commercial purposes.\n            (2) Administration and delivery mechanisms.--In \n        administering programs funded under this section, States \n        shall--\n                    (A) use no less than 50 percent of funds provided \n                under this section for cost-effective efficiency \n                programs to reduce consumers' overall fuel costs;\n                    (B) use no more than 5 percent of funds provided \n                under this section for administrative expenses;\n                    (C) to the extent practicable, deliver funding \n                under this section through existing energy efficiency \n                and consumer energy assistance programs or delivery \n                mechanisms, including, where appropriate, programs or \n                mechanisms administered by parties other than the \n                State;\n                    (D) seek to coordinate the administration and \n                delivery of energy efficiency and consumer energy \n                assistance programs funded under this section, with one \n                another and with existing programs for various fuel \n                types, so as to deliver comprehensive, fuel-blind, \n                coordinated programs to consumers; and\n                    (E) ensure that funding provided under this section \n                does not displace or substitute for existing or \n                alternative sources of funding for energy efficiency \n                and consumer energy assistance programs.\n    (f) Reporting.--Each State receiving emission allowances under this \nsection shall submit to the Administrator, within 12 months of each \nreceipt of such allowances, a report, in accordance with such \nrequirements as the Administrator may prescribe, that--\n            (1) describes the State's use of proceeds of sales of \n        emission allowances distributed under this section, including a \n        description of the energy efficiency and consumer assistance \n        programs funded through such proceeds;\n            (2) demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of, and the energy \n        savings achieved by, energy efficiency programs funded through \n        this section; and\n            (3) includes a report prepared by an independent third \n        party, in accordance with such regulations as the Administrator \n        may promulgate, evaluating the performance of the energy \n        efficiency and consumer assistance programs funded under this \n        section.\n    (g) Enforcement.--If the Administrator determines that a State is \nnot in compliance with this section, the Administrator may withhold a \nportion of the allowances, the value of which is equal to up to twice \nthe value of the allowances that the State failed to use in accordance \nwith the requirements of this section, that such State would otherwise \nbe eligible to receive under this section in later years. Allowances \nwithheld pursuant to this subsection shall be distributed among the \nremaining States ratably in accordance with the formula in subsection \n(c)."
