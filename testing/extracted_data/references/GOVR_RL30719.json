    "content": "The \"digital divide\" is a term used to describe a gap between \"information haves and have-nots,\" or in other words, between those Americans who use or have adequate access to telecommun ications and information technologies and those who do not. Whether or not individuals or communities fall into the \"information haves\" category depends on a number of factors, ranging from the presence of computers in the home, to training and education, to the availability of affordable internet access. Broadband technologies are currently being deployed primarily by the private sector throughout the United States. While the numbers of new broadband subscribers continue to grow, studies and data suggest that the rate of broadband deployment in urban/suburban and high-income areas is outpacing deployment in rural and low-income areas. Prior to the late 1990s, American homes accessed the internet at maximum speeds of 56 kilobits per second by dialing up an Internet Service Provider over the same copper telephone line used for traditional voice service. A relatively small number of businesses and institutions used broadband or high-speed connections through the installation of special \"dedicated lines\" typically provided by their local telephone company. Starting in the late 1990s, cable television companies began offering cable modem broadband service to homes and businesses. This was accompanied by telephone companies beginning to offer DSL service (broadband over existing copper telephone wireline). Growth in broadband service has been steep, rising from 2.8 million high-speed lines reported as of December 1999, to 409 million connections as of June 30, 2017. Of the 409 million high-speed connections reported by the FCC, 353 million serve residential users.   Table 1 depicts the relative deployment of different types of broadband technologies. A distinction is often made between \"current generation\" and \"next generation\" broadband (commonly referred to as next generation networks or NGN). \"Current generation\" typically refers to initially deployed cable, DSL, and many wireless systems, while \"next generation\" refers to dramatically faster download and upload speeds offered by fiber technologies and also by successive generations of cable, DSL, and wireless technologies. In general, the greater the download and upload speeds offered by a broadband connection, the more sophisticated (and potentially valuable) the application that is enabled. FCC data indicate where fixed broadband service is and is not being deployed. The FCC has set a speed benchmark of 25 Mbps (download speed)/3 Mbps (upload speed) as the measure by which it determines whether a fixed service provides advanced telecommunications capability. Table 2 shows recent percentages of Americans in urban, rural, and tribal areas with access to terrestrial fixed broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3Mbps, as presented in the FCC's Communications Marketplace Report . According to the most recent FCC deployment data, as of December 2017, 94% of all Americans had access to fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of at least 25 Mbps/3 Mbps, with over 19.4 million Americans still lacking fixed terrestrial broadband at those speeds. Table 3 shows the percentage of Americans as of December 2017 with access to fixed 25 Mbps/3Mbps terrestrial broadband by state. Another important broadband availability metric is the extent to which there are multiple broadband providers offering competition and consumer choice. Typically, multiple providers are more prevalent in urban than in rural areas or tribal areas (see Table 4 ).  In contrast to broadband availability , which refers to whether or not broadband service is offered, broadband adoption refers to the extent to which American households actually subscribe to and use broadband. According to Census data from the 2016 American Community Survey, 81.4% of American households have a broadband internet subscription. Other Census data from July 2015 show that 68% of Americans use the internet at home. The Census data also show that Americans increasingly are connecting to the internet through other devices in addition to desktop computers: 52% of Americans used two or more devices to connect, including tablets, laptops, mobile phones, and TV connected boxes (gaming consoles and streaming video players). The most recent survey data from the Pew Research Center show that populations continuing to lag behind in internet adoption include people with low incomes, seniors, the less-educated, and households in rural areas (see Table 5 ). Pew has reported that the cost of monthly subscriptions is the main reason some people do not have broadband connections. In June 2015, GAO released a report ( Intended Outcomes and Effectiveness of Efforts to Address Adopti o n Barriers Are Unclear ) which found that affordability, lack of perceived relevance, and lack of computer skills are the principal barriers to broadband adoption. GAO examined adoption efforts by NTIA and the FCC, and identified three key approaches used to address broadband adoption barriers: discounts on computer equipment and broadband subscriptions; outreach efforts to promote broadband availability and benefits; and training to help people develop skills in using computers and broadband. While the number of new broadband subscribers continues to grow, the rate of broadband deployment in urban areas has outpaced deployment in rural and tribal areas. While there are many examples of rural communities with state of the art telecommunications facilities, recent surveys and studies have indicated that, in general, rural areas (and particularly tribal areas) tend to lag behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment.  For example According to the FCC's Communications Market place Report , \"As of year-end 2017, 94% of the overall population had coverage [of fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps], up from 91.9% in 2016. Nonetheless, the gap in rural and Tribal America remains notable: over 24% of Americans in rural areas and 32% of Americans in Tribal lands lack coverage from fixed terrestrial 25 Mbps/3 Mbps broadband, as compared to only 1.5% of Americans in urban areas.\" Also according to the FCC's Communications Market place Report , rural areas continue to lag behind urban areas in mobile broadband deployment. Although evaluated urban areas saw an increase of 10 Mbps/3 Mbps mobile LTE (median speed) from 81.9% in 2014 to 92.6% in 2017, such deployment in evaluated rural areas remained relatively flat at about 70%. According to January 2018 survey data from the Pew Research Center, 58% of adults in rural areas said they have a high-speed broadband connection at home, as opposed to 67% of adults in urban areas and 70% of adults in suburban areas. A November 2017 Census Bureau survey reported by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Digital Nation Data Explorer showed 72.9% of rural residents reporting using the internet, versus 78.5% of urban residents. According to NTIA, the data \"indicates a fairly constant 6-9 percentage point gap between rural and urban communities' internet use over time.\"  The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas. Particularly for wireline broadband technologies\u2014such as cable modem and fiber\u2014the greater the geographical distances among customers, the larger the cost to serve those customers. Thus, there is often less incentive for companies to invest in broadband in rural areas than, for example, in an urban area where there is more demand (more customers with perhaps higher incomes) and less cost to wire the market area. The terrain of rural areas can also be a hindrance, in that it is more expensive, for example, to deploy broadband technologies in a mountainous or heavily forested area. An additional added cost factor for remote areas can be the expense of \"backhaul\" (e.g., the \"middle mile\"), which refers to the installation of a dedicated line which transmits a signal to and from an internet backbone, which is typically located in or near an urban area. Some policymakers believe that disparities in broadband access across American society could have adverse consequences on those left behind, and that advanced telecommunications applications critical for businesses and consumers to engage in ecommerce are increasingly dependent on high-speed broadband connections to the internet. Thus, some say, communities and individuals without access to broadband could be at risk to the extent that connectivity becomes a critical factor in determining future economic development and prosperity. A February 2006 study done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the Economic Development Administration of the Department of Commerce marked the first attempt to quantitatively measure the impact of broadband on economic growth. The study found that \"between 1998 and 2002, communities in which mass-market broadband was available by December 1999 experienced more rapid growth in employment, the number of businesses overall, and businesses in IT-intensive sectors, relative to comparable communities without broadband at that time.\" Subsequently, other studies have attempted to assess the economic impact of broadband deployment. For example A June 2007 report from the Brookings Institution found that for every one percentage point increase in broadband penetration in a state, employment is projected to increase by 0.2% to 0.3% per year. For the entire U.S. private nonfarm economy, the study projected an increase of about 300,000 jobs. A July 2009 study commissioned by the Internet Innovation Alliance found net consumer benefits of home broadband on the order of $32 billion per year, up from an estimated $20 billion in consumer benefits from home broadband in 2005. A January 2009 study conducted by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) found that investing an additional $10 billion in one year on broadband networks will create or retain 498,000 U.S. jobs for that year. A study (first published in 2013) funded by the National Agricultural and Rural Development Policy Center found that nonmetropolitan counties that had high levels of broadband adoption (greater than 60%) in 2010 had significantly higher growth in median household income\u201423.4% versus just over 22%\u2014between 2001 and 2010 when compared to counties that had similar characteristics in the 1990s but were not as successful at adopting broadband. A 2016 study from the Hudson Institute found that rural broadband providers directly and indirectly added $24.1 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015. The rural broadband industry supported 69,595 jobs in 2015, both through its own employment and the employment that its purchases of goods and services generated. Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-104 ) requires the FCC to regularly initiate an inquiry assessing the availability of broadband to all Americans and to determine whether broadband is \"being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion.\" If the determination is negative, the act directs the FCC to \"take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market.\"  Starting in 1999, there have been eleven Section 706 reports, each providing a snapshot and assessment of broadband deployment. As part of this assessment, and to help determine whether broadband is being deployed in \"a reasonable and timely fashion,\" the FCC has set a minimum broadband speed that essentially serves as the benchmark the FCC uses to determine what it considers broadband service for the purposes of its Section 706 determination. In 2015 the FCC, citing changing broadband usage patterns and multiple devices using broadband within single households, raised its minimum fixed broadband benchmark speed from 4 Mbps (download)/1 Mbps (upload) to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps. The designation of minimum benchmark speeds for fixed broadband, and how mobile broadband speeds should be benchmarked and factored into an overall determination of broadband deployment, has proven controversial. On February 2, 2018, the FCC adopted and released its latest 706 report, the 2018 Broadband Deployment Report. The FCC concluded that advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. This determination was based on evaluating progress\u2014comparing deployment in the present year to deployment in previous years. According to the Report : We find that analyzing progress to determine whether deployment is occurring in a reasonable and timely fashion is the approach that is most consistent with the language of section 706, as the analysis of such progress enables the Commission to determine whether advanced telecommunications capability \"is being deployed\" in the manner that section 706 requires. The use of the present progressive tense\u2014\"is being deployed\"\u2014as well as the language requiring an evaluation of whether that deployment is \"reasonable and timely\" indicates that Congress intended that the Commission evaluate the current state of deployment to all Americans, not a rigid requirement that each and every American be served at this moment . The FCC's latest 706 determination that broadband is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion is a departure from the FCC's previous five determinations that broadband is not being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion. The latest 706 determination was approved by the three Republican FCC commissioners, with the remaining two Democratic commissioners dissenting. According to FCC Commissioner Rosenworcel's dissent: This report concludes that in the United States the deployment of broadband to all Americans is reasonable and timely. This is ridiculous\u2014and irresponsible. Today there are 24 million Americans without access to broadband. There are 19 million Americans in rural areas who lack the ability to access high-speed services at home. There are 12 million school-aged children who are falling into the Homework Gap because they do not have the broadband at home they need for nightly schoolwork. Ask any one of them if they think the deployment of the most essential digital age infrastructure is reasonable and timely and you will get a resounding \"No.\" To call these numbers a testament to our national success is insulting and not credible. In gathering data, information, and viewpoints for the Report , the August 8, 2017, N otice o f I nquiry proposed to maintain the 25 Mbps/3 Mbps benchmark for fixed broadband, while at the same time soliciting comments on whether to establish a lower benchmark speed specifically for mobile broadband. One proposal under consideration was whether the presence of fixed or mobile broadband should indicate that an area has adequate broadband service. Ultimately, the Report concluded that adoption of a single mobile benchmark is currently unworkable, given available data and the inherent variability of actual mobile speeds, and that mobile broadband service is not a full substitute for fixed service at this time. On August 8, 2018, the FCC adopted the Fourteenth Broadband Deployment Report Notice of Inquiry , which is collecting comments in preparation for the next Section 706 report in 2019. The FCC proposes to maintain the 25 Mbps/3 Mbps benchmark and is seeking comments on \"whether since the 2018 Report there have been developments that would support a different conclusion about substitutability\" between mobile and fixed broadband service, and \"to the extent that mobile services are able to offer equivalent functionality as fixed services either now or in the future ... whether or not and in what circumstances, if any, mobile and fixed services should be considered substitutes.\" Obtaining an accurate snapshot of broadband deployment is problematic. Rapidly evolving technologies, the constant flux of the telecommunications industry, the uncertainty of consumer wants and needs, and the sheer diversity and size of the nation's economy and geography make the status of broadband deployment difficult to characterize. Improving the quality of broadband deployment data has become an issue of congressional interest, as policymakers recognize that more accurate broadband availability maps could help ensure that federal broadband programs target unserved areas of the country that are most in need of assistance.  Since the initial deployment of broadband in the late 1990s, two federal agencies have implemented broadband availability data collection and mapping initiatives: the NTIA's State Broadband Initiative, which was funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and used to develop the previous National Broadband Map; and the FCC's Form 477 Data Program, which is used to populate and update the current National Broadband Map. One of the major criticisms of the FCC's Form 477 National Broadband Map is that broadband availability can be overstated because fixed broadband deployment data are collected at the census block level. A census block is considered served if there is broadband service (or the strong potential of broadband service) to one or more locations. This is especially problematic in rural areas, which have large census blocks and may be considered served if, for example, a single neighborhood in that large census block has broadband service.  On August 3, 2017, the FCC adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to explore ways \"to improve the quality, accuracy, and usefulness of the data it collects on fixed and mobile voice and broadband service,\" while at the same time examining how it can \"reduce burdens on industry by eliminating unnecessary or onerous data filing requirements.\" The Administration requested $50 million for broadband mapping in FY2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ) appropriated $7.5 million to NTIA to update the national broadband availability map in coordination with the FCC and using partnerships previously developed with the states. For FY2019, the House and Senate appropriations committees would provide an additional $7.5 million to NTIA for broadband mapping. On May 30, 2018, NTIA issued a Request for Comments on actions it should take to improve the quality and accuracy of broadband availability data. NTIA received comments on the following issues: identifying additional broadband availability data; technology type, service areas, and bandwidth associated with such data; new approaches, tools, technologies, or methodologies to capture broadband availability data; validating broadband availability data; and identifying gaps in broadband availability. On October 25, 2018, NTIA issued a notice for public comment regarding its intention to collect broadband availability data at a more granular level than what the FCC currently collects. As mandated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), on March 16, 2010, the FCC released its report, Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan . The National Broadband Plan (NBP) sought to \"create a high-performance America,\" which the FCC defined as \"a more productive, creative, efficient America in which affordable broadband is available everywhere and everyone has the means and skills to use valuable broadband applications.\" In order to achieve this mission, the NBP recommended that the country set six goals for 2020 Goal No. 1: At least 100 million U.S. homes should have affordable access to actual download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second and actual upload speeds of at least 50 megabits per second. Goal No. 2: The United States should lead the world in mobile innovation, with the fastest and most extensive wireless networks of any nation. Goal No. 3: Every American should have affordable access to robust broadband service, and the means and skills to subscribe if they so choose. Goal No. 4: Every American community should have affordable access to at least 1 gigabit per second broadband service to anchor institutions such as schools, hospitals, and government buildings. Goal No. 5: To ensure the safety of the American people, every first responder should have access to a nationwide, wireless, interoperable broadband public safety network. Goal No. 6: To ensure that America leads in the clean energy economy, every American should be able to use broadband to track and manage their real-time energy consumption. The National Broadband Plan was categorized into three parts Part I (Innovation and Investment) , which \"discusses recommendations to maximize innovation, investment and consumer welfare, primarily through competition. It then recommends more efficient allocation and management of assets government controls or influences.\" The recommendations address a number of issues, including spectrum policy, improved broadband data collection, broadband performance standards and disclosure, special access rates, interconnection, privacy and cybersecurity, child online safety, poles and rights-of-way, research and experimentation (R&E) tax credits, and R&D funding. Part II (Inclusion) , which \"makes recommendations to promote inclusion\u2014to ensure that all Americans have access to the opportunities broadband can provide.\" Issues include reforming the Universal Service Fund, intercarrier compensation, federal assistance for broadband in tribal lands, expanding existing broadband grant and loan programs at the Rural Utilities Service, enabling greater broadband connectivity in anchor institutions, and improved broadband adoption and utilization especially among disadvantaged and vulnerable populations. Part III (National Purposes) , which \"makes recommendations to maximize the use of broadband to address national priorities. This includes reforming laws, policies and incentives to maximize the benefits of broadband in areas where government plays a significant role.\" National purposes include health care, education, energy and the environment, government performance, civic engagement, and public safety. Issues include telehealth and health IT, online learning and modernizing educational broadband infrastructure, digital literacy and job training, smart grid and smart buildings, federal support for broadband in small businesses, telework within the federal government, cybersecurity and protection of critical broadband infrastructure, copyright of public digital media, interoperable public safety communications, next generation 911 networks, and emergency alert systems. With the conclusion of grant and loan awards established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ), there remain two ongoing major federal vehicles which direct federal money to fund broadband: the Universal Service Fund (USF) programs under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the broadband and telecommunications programs at the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  In June 2017, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) released an updated comprehensive Guide to Federal Funding of Broadband Projects . The guide provides summary and contact information for a variety of federal programs that may fund projects involving broadband infrastructure, adoption, access, planning, or research. Since its creation in 1934 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been tasked with \"mak[ing] available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States ... a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communications service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" This mandate led to the development of what has come to be known as the universal service concept. The universal service concept, as originally designed, called for the establishment of policies to ensure that telecommunications services are available to all Americans, including those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, by ensuring that rates remain affordable. Over the years this concept has evolved and expanded, fostering the development of various FCC policies and programs that target both providers of and subscribers to telecommunications and, more recently, broadband services. Passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-104 ) codified the long-standing commitment by U.S. policymakers to ensure universal service in the provision of telecommunications services, and the FCC established, in 1997, a federal Universal Service Fund (USF) to meet the expanded objectives and principles contained in the act. The USF is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), an independent not-for-profit organization, under the direction of the FCC. The USF is being transformed in stages, over a multiyear period, from a mechanism to support voice telecommunications services to one that supports the deployment, adoption, and utilization of both fixed and mobile broadband. The USF currently administers four programs: the High Cost/Connect America Fund Program, the Schools and Libraries Program, the Rural Health Care Program, and the Low Income Program. The USF disbursed $8.8 billion in 2017 with all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all territories receiving some benefit.  One of the major policy debates surrounding universal service in the last decade was whether access to advanced telecommunications services (i.e., broadband) should be incorporated into universal service objectives. The 1996 Telecommunications Act tasked the federal-state Joint Board with defining the services which should be included in the definition of services to be eligible for universal service support. The Joint Board's recommendation, which was adopted by the FCC in May 1997, largely limited the definition to voice telecommunications services. Some policymakers expressed concern that the FCC-adopted definition was too limited and did not take into account the importance and growing acceptance of advanced services such as broadband and internet access. They pointed to a number of provisions contained in the universal service principles of the 1996 act to support their claim. Universal service principles contained in Section 254(b)(2) state that \"Access to advanced telecommunications services should be provided to all regions of the Nation.\" The subsequent principle (b)(3) calls for consumers in all regions of the nation, including \"low-income\" and those in \"rural, insular, and high cost areas,\" to have access to telecommunications and information services including \"advanced services\" at a comparable level and a comparable rate charged for similar services in urban areas. Such provisions, they state, dictate that the FCC expand its universal service definition. The 1996 act does take into consideration the changing nature of the telecommunications sector and allows, if future conditions warrant, for the modification of the universal service definition. Section 254(c) of the act states that \"universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services\" and that the FCC is tasked with \"periodically\" reevaluating this definition \"taking into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services.\" Furthermore, the Joint Board is given specific authority to recommend \"from time to time\" to the FCC modification in the definition of the services to be included for federal universal service support. The Joint Board, on November 19, 2007, concluded such an inquiry and recommended that the FCC change the mix of services eligible for universal support. The Joint Board recommended, among other things, that \"the universal availability of broadband Internet services\" be included in the nation's communications goals and hence be supported by federal universal service funds.  This debate was put to rest when provisions contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) called for the FCC to develop, and submit to Congress, a national broadband plan to ensure that every American has \"access to broadband capability.\" The FCC in its national broadband plan , Connecting America: the National Broadband Plan , recommended that access to and adoption of broadband be a national goal. Furthermore the national broadband plan proposed that the Universal Service Fund be restructured to become a vehicle to help reach this goal. The FCC, in an October 2011 decision, adopted an Order that calls for the USF to be transformed, in stages, over a multiyear period, from a mechanism to support voice telephone service to one that supports the deployment, adoption, and utilization of both fixed and mobile broadband. This transformation includes the phaseout of the USF's legacy High Cost Program and the creation of a new fund, the Connect America Fund, to replace it as well as an expansion and modification of the Schools and Libraries, Rural Health Care, and Low Income programs. Historically the High Cost Program provided support for eligible telecommunications carriers to help offset the higher-than-average costs of providing voice telephone service in rural, insular, or other high cost areas. This mechanism has been the largest USF program based on disbursements and has been particularly important to rural areas due to the lack of subscriber density often combined with higher costs. The High Cost Program is undergoing a transition from one that primarily supports voice communications to one that supports a broadband platform that enables multiple applications, including voice. The High Cost program is being phased out in stages and is being replaced by the Connect America Fund (CAF), which will support the provision of affordable voice and broadband services, both fixed and mobile, in high cost areas. The CAF will eventually replace all of the existing support mechanisms in the High Cost Program and contains a Mobility Fund and a Remote Areas Fund to meet these needs. According to data released by program administrators, approximately $4.67 billion in funding was disbursed in 2017. Congress, through the 1996 act, not only codified, but also expanded the concept of universal service to include, among other principles, that elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, libraries, and rural health care providers have access to telecommunications services for specific purposes at discounted rates. (See \u00a7\u00a7254(b)(6) and 254(h) of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C. 254.) 1. The Schools and Libraries (E-Rate) Program. Under universal service provisions contained in the 1996 act, elementary and secondary schools and classrooms and libraries are designated as beneficiaries of universal service discounts. Universal service principles detailed in Section 254(b)(6) state that \"Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms ... and libraries should have access to advanced telecommunications services.\" The act further requires in Section 254(h)(1)(B) that services within the definition of universal service be provided to elementary and secondary schools and libraries for education purposes at discounts, that is at \"rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties.\" The FCC established the Schools and Libraries Division within USAC to administer the schools and libraries or \"E (education)-rate\" program to comply with these provisions. Under this program, eligible schools and libraries receive discounts ranging from 20% to 90% for telecommunications services depending on the poverty level of the school's (or school district's) population and its location in a high cost (i.e., rural) telecommunications area. Two categories of services are eligible for discounts: category one services (telecommunications, telecommunications services, and internet access), and category two services that deliver internet access within schools and libraries (internal connections, basic maintenance of internal connections, and managed internal broadband services). The funding cap for funding year 2018 (July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019) is $4.1 billion. According to data released by program administrators, approximately $2.62 billion in funding was disbursed in 2017. 2. The Rural Health Care Program. Section 254(h) of the 1996 act requires that public and nonprofit rural health care providers have access to telecommunications services necessary for the provision of health care services at rates comparable to those paid for similar services in urban areas. Subsection 254(h)(1) further specifies that \"to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable\" health care providers should have access to advanced telecommunications and information services. The FCC established the Rural Health Care Division (RHCD) within USAC to administer the universal support program to comply with these provisions. The Rural Health Care Program provides funding through three programs: the Telecommunications Program, the Healthcare Connect Fund, and the rural Health Care Pilot Program. The goal of these programs is to improve the quality of health care for those living in rural areas by ensuring access to broadband and telecommunications services. Under FCC established rules only public or nonprofit health care providers are eligible to receive funding. The Telecommunications Program, established in 1997, provides discounts for telecommunications services to ensure that eligible rural health care providers pay no more than urban providers for telecommunications services. The primary use of the funding is to provide reduced rates for telecommunications and information services necessary for the provision of health care.  The Rural Health Care Pilot Program was established in 2006 to help public and nonprofit health care providers build state- and region-wide broadband networks dedicated to the provision of health care services. The program provides funding up to 85% of eligible costs. No new funding is available under this program and current participants that need additional support will transfer to the most recently created program, the Healthcare Connect Fund. The FCC in December 2012 created the Healthcare Connect Fund, a program to expand health care provider access to broadband, particularly in rural areas, and replace the Rural Health Care Pilot Program with a permanent program. The Healthcare Connect Fund program supports high-capacity broadband connectivity and encourages the development of state and regional networks. This program provides a 65% discount on eligible expenses related to broadband connectivity and is available to individual rural health care providers and consortia. Consortia can include nonrural providers but at least 50% of providers must be located in a rural area. The total annual funding cap for all of the above mentioned USF rural health care programs is $400 million. According to data released by program administrators, approximately $261.5 million was disbursed in 2017. As initially designed the Low Income Program provided a discount for voice telephony service for eligible low-income consumers. The major program has two subprograms, Lifeline and Link Up, with the Lifeline Program providing the vast majority of support. In March 2016 the FCC adopted an Order to expand the Lifeline Program to support mobile and fixed broadband internet access services on a stand-alone basis, or with a bundled voice service. Households must meet a needs-based criteria for eligibility. The Lifeline Program provides assistance to only one line per eligible household either wired or wireless, in the form of a monthly subsidy of, in most cases, $9.25. Support is not given directly to the subscriber but to the designated service provider. According to data released by program administrators, approximately $1.27 billion was disbursed in 2017. RUS implements four programs specifically targeted at providing assistance for broadband connectivity infrastructure deployment in rural areas: the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program (also referred to as the Farm Bill Broadband Loans), the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans and Loan Guarantees (previously the rural telephone loan program dating back to 1949), the ReConnect Program (pilot broadband loan and grant program), and the Community Connect Grant Program. Additionally, RUS houses the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grant Program, which supports broadband-based distance learning and telemedicine applications. The 115 th Congress reauthorized and modified RUS broadband programs as part of the 2018 farm bill ( P.L. 115-334 , Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018). For more information on how the 2018 farm bill addressed RUS broadband programs, see CRS Report RL33816, Broadband Loan and Grant Programs in the USDA's Rural Utilities Service , by Lennard G. Kruger. On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed P.L. 111-5 , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Broadband provisions of the ARRA provided a total of $7.2 billion, for broadband grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations. The total consisted of $4.7 billion to NTIA/DOC for a newly established Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (grants) and $2.5 billion to the RUS/USDA Broadband Initiatives Program (grants, loans, and grant/loan combinations). Regarding the $2.5 billion to RUS/USDA broadband programs, the ARRA specified that at least 75% of the area to be served by a project receiving funds shall be in a rural area without sufficient access to high-speed broadband service to facilitate economic development, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. Priority was given to projects that provide service to the most rural residents that do not have access to broadband services. Priority was also given to borrowers and former borrowers of rural telephone loans. Of the $4.7 billion appropriated to NTIA $4.35 billion was directed to a competitive broadband grant program, of which not less than $200 million shall be available for competitive grants for expanding public computer center capacity (including at community colleges and public libraries); not less than $250 million to encourage sustainable adoption of broadband service; and $10 million transferred to the Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General for audits and oversight; and $350 million was directed for funding the Broadband Data Improvement Act ( P.L. 110-385 ) and for the purpose of developing and maintaining a broadband inventory map, which shall be made accessible to the public no later than two years after enactment. Funds deemed necessary and appropriate by the Secretary of Commerce may be transferred to the FCC for the purposes of developing a national broadband plan, which shall be completed one year after enactment. Final BTOP and BIP program awards were announced by September 30, 2010. With a few exceptions, all ARRA broadband projects were concluded as of September 30, 2015. On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration released its Legislative Outline for Rebuilding Infrastructure in America . The plan does not dedicate any funding exclusively for broadband, but does include rural broadband among the types of infrastructure projects that would be eligible for funding. Proposed funding streams include the following: $50 billion for a Rural Infrastructure Program. Funding would be block-granted to the states under a formula distribution for infrastructure projects including transportation, water and waste, power and electric, water resources, and broadband (including other high-speed data and communication conduits). Governors \"would have the discretion to choose investments to respond to the unique rural needs of their states.\" Eligible infrastructure projects would serve rural areas with populations of less than 50,000. An unspecified portion of the Rural Infrastructure Program funds would be set aside for tribal infrastructure and territorial infrastructure. $20 billion for a Transformative Projects Program, which would \"provide Federal funding and technical assistance for bold, innovative, and transformative infrastructure projects that could dramatically improve infrastructure.\" Funding would be awarded on a competitive basis to projects \"that are likely to be commercially viable, but that possess unique technical and risk characteristics that otherwise deter private sector investment.\" The program would be led by the Department of Commerce, which would chair an interagency project selection and evaluation committee. Federal funding would be available for up to 30% of eligible costs for project demonstration, up to 50% of eligible costs for project planning, and up to 80% of eligible costs for capital construction. $14 billion for expanding existing federal credit programs that address infrastructure. This would include additional budget authority to the USDA's Rural Utilities Service for RUS loan programs (which include telecommunications and broadband loans and loan guarantees). $6 billion for expanding the scope of Public Activity Bonds (PABs). The proposal would expand and modify eligible exempt facilities for PABs to include a number of new categories, including rural broadband service facilities. It will be up to Congress to determine the extent to which the Administration infrastructure proposal will be implemented, and how an infrastructure initiative will be legislated. Whether dedicated rural broadband funding should or should not be part of the legislative response will likely be debated. Meanwhile, rural broadband was included in the $20 billion carved out for infrastructure in the two-year budget agreement ($10 billion per year for two years) reached between the House and Senate in February 2018 ( P.L. 115-123 ). However, the amount of targeted funding specifically for broadband was not specified. The Trump Administration's Legislative Outline also contains many recommendations for reducing the costs and improving the time-effectiveness of infrastructure deployment by streamlining permitting regulations and procedures. In the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate have considered legislation that would streamline permitting for broadband deployment. The FCC has also begun a process to develop recommendations for lowering or removing regulatory barriers to broadband deployment (see section below, \" FCC's Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee \").  Aside from funding, another way the federal government can facilitate broadband deployment is by taking steps to lower or remove regulatory barriers to broadband deployment facing private sector providers. On January 31, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced the formation of a new federal advisory committee, the Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee (BDAC), which will provide advice and recommendations for the FCC on how to accelerate the deployment of broadband by reducing and/or removing regulatory barriers to infrastructure investment. The BDAC is composed of stakeholders, appointed by the FCC chairman, representing industry, states, localities, tribes, academia, and others. Five working groups have been formed; these are Model Code for Municipalities, Model Code for States, Competitive Access to Broadband Infrastructure, Removing State and Local Regulatory Barriers, and Streamlining Federal Siting.  The FCC has also initiated proceedings and adopted orders addressing the issue of reducing regulatory barriers for the deployment of wireless and wireline broadband. BroadbandUSA is housed at the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Using the expertise gained during administration of the ARRA Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), the BroadbandUSA program offers one-to-one technical assistance to communities seeking to plan and implement broadband initiatives. BroadbandUSA will leverage knowledge of federal funding and its network of contacts to help communities identify and leverage funding opportunities; provide support to communities seeking public-private partnerships; review, analyze, and provide recommendations and guidance associated with community-level reports, studies, and procurements; and provide background information and training to organizations that need assistance navigating the broadband landscape. BroadbandUSA also organizes regional events and workshops bringing together broadband stakeholders and publishes guides and tools that can serve as resources for communities seeking to launch broadband initiatives. Additionally, NTIA serves as cochair of the Broadband Interagency Working Group (BIWG) alongside the Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service (RUS). Through the BIWG, NTIA works with other federal agencies to improve coordination across programs, reduce regulatory barriers to broadband deployment, promote awareness of the importance of federal support for broadband investment and digital inclusion programs, and collect and share information with communities about available federal resources for broadband deployment and digital inclusion efforts. The BIWG was formed in January 2017, in response to the Broadband Opportunity Council Agency's Progress Report . BroadbandUSA also coordinates the State Broadband Leaders Network (SBLN), which includes state level office representatives involved in broadband efforts. The SBLN shares priorities and best practices; discusses emerging\u00a0telecommunications policy issues; links states and local jurisdictions to federal agencies and funding sources; and\u00a0addresses barriers to collaboration across states and agencies. Section 1436 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act, P.L. 114-94 ) authorized a high-speed broadband deployment initiative for the 13-state Appalachian region consisting of $10 million in available broadband grants annually through FY2020. In August 2016, ARC published a Broadband Planning Primer and Toolkit .  Broadband projects are eligible for funding under the Economic Development Assistance programs of the Economic Development Administration (EDA) in the Department of Commerce. The Explanatory Statement that accompanied the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 115-141 ) stated that funding provided under EDA's Public Works, Economic Adjustment Assistance, and other programs may be used to support broadband infrastructure projects, and that EDA is encouraged to prioritize unserved areas. The Explanatory Statement directed that \"EDA shall submit a report to the Committees within 30 days of the end of fiscal year 2018 describing the number and value of broadband projects supported with fiscal year 2018 funds.\" The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ) contained many broadband-related provisions Title VII, Section 779 of Division A (Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018) appropriates $600 million to RUS to \"conduct a new broadband loan and grant pilot program.\" The law states that the funding is to \"remain available until expended,\" and that at least 90% of the households to be served by a project receiving a loan or grant under the pilot program shall be in a rural area without sufficient access to broadband, defined for this pilot program as 10 Mbps downstream, and 1 Mbps upstream, which shall be reevaluated and redetermined, as necessary, on an annual basis by the Secretary of Agriculture. The pilot broadband loan and grant program is being implemented as the ReConnect Program, which is offering loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations. More information on the ReConnect Program is available at https://reconnect.usda.gov . Title I of Division B (Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018) appropriates $7.5 million to update the national broadband availability map in coordination with the FCC and using partnerships previously developed with the states. Title V of Division P (Ray Baum's Act of 2018). Section 101 amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for the deposits of bidders in auctions of spectrum frequencies to be deposited in the Treasury. Section 504 directs the FCC to submit a report to Congress on promoting broadband for veterans, in particular low-income veterans and veterans residing in rural areas. Section 505 directs the FCC to promulgate regulations to establish a methodology that shall apply to the collection of mobile service coverage data for the purposes of the Universal Service program. Section 508 requires the FCC to submit a report to Congress evaluating broadband coverage in Indian country and on land held by a Native Corporation pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, with the FCC required to complete a proceeding to address the unserved areas identified in the report. Title VI (MOBILE NOW) of Division P seeks to make more spectrum available for wireless broadband, facilitate broadband infrastructure deployment on federal lands, include communications facility installation data in the federal real property database, and require consultation between telecommunications providers and state highway authorities receiving federal highway money. Additionally, Section 615 directs GAO to conduct a study to evaluate the availability of broadband access using unlicensed spectrum and wireless networks in low-income neighborhoods. To the extent that Congress may consider various options for encouraging broadband deployment and adoption, a key issue is how to strike a balance between providing federal assistance for unserved and underserved areas where the private sector may not be providing acceptable levels of broadband service, while at the same time minimizing any deleterious effects that government intervention in the marketplace may have on competition and private sector investment. The 116 th Congress may address the digital divide issue by considering various approaches to providing support for infrastructure deployment, including support for rural broadband. In addition to loans, loan guarantees, and grants for broadband infrastructure deployment, a wide array of policy instruments are available to policymakers, including universal service reform, tax incentives to encourage private sector deployment, broadband bonds, demand-side incentives (such as assistance to low-income families for purchasing computers), reducing regulatory barriers to broadband deployment, and spectrum policy to spur rollout of wireless broadband services. In assessing federal incentives for broadband deployment, Congress may consider the appropriate mix of broadband deployment incentives to create jobs in the short and long term, the extent to which incentives should target next-generation broadband technologies, and the extent to which unserved and underserved areas with existing broadband providers should receive federal assistance. Aside from the 2018 farm bill ( P.L. 115-334 ) and annual appropriations legislation, the following broadband-related bills were introduced into the 115th Congress: Funding and Federal Assistance H.R. 547 (DeLauro), introduced on January 13, 2017, would have facilitated efficient investments and financing of infrastructure projects (including broadband projects) through the establishment of a National Infrastructure Development Bank.
