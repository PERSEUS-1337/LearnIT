FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) today's ferries are a critical transportation component \n        in many communities, providing vital transportation services \n        for passengers, automobiles, buses, and trucks in locations \n        where practical alternatives are insufficient or do not exist;\n            (2) ferries provide alternatives to other transport modes \n        that are facing severe capacity constraints;\n            (3) ferries do not require the construction of costly \n        infrastructure such as roads, bridges, or tunnels, thereby \n        reducing environmental impacts, capital investment, and \n        initiation times;\n            (4) ferries reduce single-occupancy vehicle travel thereby \n        reducing traffic congestion, air pollution, and energy use;\n            (5) ferries are flexible because vessels and some loading \n        facilities may be shifted to new locations due to changes in \n        demand or in times of national emergency;\n            (6) joint efforts by private operators and local \n        governments already have resulted in highly innovative and \n        successful ferry operations in many urban areas;\n            (7) recent technological developments have further \n        developed the potential for the use of high speed marine \n        vessels;\n            (8) the Department of Transportation strategic plan for the \n        National Transportation System urges emphasis on those modes of \n        transportation that promote those interests ``of critical \n        importance to our country, including clean air, reduced energy \n        consumption and safe, comfortable, and cost effective \n        transportation'';\n            (9) ferry transportation provides cost-effective \n        transportation in an environmentally sound manner; and\n            (10) ferry transportation is an important and unique \n        component of the national transportation system which should be \n        encouraged and supported in those communities for which it is \n        applicable.\n\nSEC. 3. REPORT ON UTILIZATION POTENTIAL.\n\n    (a) Study.--The Secretary of Transportation shall conduct a study \nof ferry transportation in the United States and its possessions--\n            (1) to identify existing ferry operations, including--\n                    (A) the locations and routes served;\n                    (B) the name, United States official number, and a \n                description of each vessel operated as a ferry;\n                    (C) the source and amount, if any, of funds derived \n                from Federal, State, or local government sources \n                supporting ferry construction or operations;\n                    (D) the impact of ferry transportation on local and \n                regional economies; and\n                    (E) the potential for use of high-speed ferry \n                services.\n            (2) identify potential domestic ferry routes in the United \n        States and its possessions and to develop information on those \n        routes, including--\n                    (A) locations and routes that might be served;\n                    (B) estimates of capacity required;\n                    (C) estimates of capital costs of developing these \n                routes;\n                    (D) estimates of annual operating costs for these \n                routes;\n                    (E) estimates of the economic impact of these \n                routes on local and regional economies; and\n                    (F) the potential for use of high-speed ferry \n                services.\n    (b) Report.--The Secretary shall report the results of the study \nunder subsection (a) within 1 year after the date of enactment of this \nAct to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \nUnited States Senate and the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure of the United States House of Representatives.\n\nSEC. 4. MEETING WITH STATE MUNICIPAL PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n    After reporting the results of the study required by section 3, the \nSecretary of Transportation shall meet with the relevant State and \nMunicipal planning organizations to discuss the results of the study \nand the availability of resources, both Federal and State, for \nproviding marine ferry service.\n\nSEC. 5.

MARINE HIGH-SPEED FERRY SAFETY.\n\n    (a) Coast Guard Review.-- The Coast Guard shall review the \nprovisions of the International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft to \ndetermine whether the provisions are suitable safety regulations for \nhigh-speed vessels not currently regulated, and make recommendations to \nthe House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n    (b) Manning Requirement.--Section 8101(a) of title 46, United \nStates Code, is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (2);\n            (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (3) and \n        inserting ``; and''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph;\n                    ``(4) a high-speed passenger vessel shall consider \n                the specialized nature of the vessel and the \n                navigation, handling, and maintenance functions of that \n                vessel for protection of life, property, and the \n                environment, and, for purposes of this paragraph, the \n                term `high-speed passenger vessel' means a vessel as \n                defined by Section 2101(22) or 2101(35) of this title, \n                which conforms to the definition of high-speed craft of \n                Chapter 1.4.24 of the International Code of Safety for \n                High-Speed Craft of the International Maritime \n                Organization.''.\n    (c) Manning Standards.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \nprescribe standards for the manning of each high speed passenger vessel \noperating on the waters of the United States or the waters of the \nexclusive economic zone, related to the duties, qualifications, and \ntraining of the officers and crew of the vessel, including standards \nrelated to--\n            (1) appropriate crew sizes;\n            (2) the adequacy of qualifications and training of \n        crewmembers;\n            (3) the ability of crewmembers to take emergency actions, \n        including the safe evacuation of passengers;\n            (4) the use of computer simulator courses and other courses \n        for training bridge officers and crewmembers, and the \n        feasibility and practicality of mandating such training;\n            (5) the advisability of cross-training of crewmembers and \n        the need for more than one crew member to be trained to perform \n        all essential operational tasks in both normal and emergency \n        situations;\n            (6) the need to specify an appropriate period of \n        operational training for the master and each crewmember and the \n        periods at which appropriate re-training should be carried out; \n        and\n            (7) the need for a type rating certificate for the master \n        and all officers having an operational role on the vessel.\nIn prescribing the standards, the Secretary shall consider the \nprovisions of the International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft of \nthe International Maritime Organization, particularly its provisions on \ntraining and qualifications and emergency instructions and drills. A \nhigh-speed passenger vessel is a vessel as defined by section 2101(22) \nor 2101(35) of title 46, United States Code, which conforms to the \ndefinition of High-speed craft of Chapter 1.4.24 of the International \nCode of Safety for High-Speed Craft of the International Maritime \nOrganization.\n\nSEC. 9.
