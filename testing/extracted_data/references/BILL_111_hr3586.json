FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) since January 1, 1998, employees have been permitted to \n        be owners of subchapter S corporations through an employee \n        stock ownership plan (hereafter in this section referred to as \n        an ``ESOP'') pursuant to Small Business Job Protection Act of \n        1996 (Public Law 104-188);\n            (2) with the passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \n        (Public Law 105-34), Congress designed incentives to encourage \n        businesses to become ESOP-owned S corporations;\n            (3) since that time, several thousand companies have become \n        ESOP-owned S corporations, creating an ownership interest for \n        several million Americans in companies in every State in the \n        country, in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to \n        technology development to services;\n            (4) while estimates show that 40 percent of working \n        Americans have no formal retirement account at all, every \n        United States worker who is an employee-owner of an S \n        corporation company through an ESOP has a valuable qualified \n        retirement savings account;\n            (5) recent studies have shown that employees of ESOP-owned \n        S corporations enjoy greater job stability than employees of \n        comparable companies;\n            (6) studies also show that employee-owners of S corporation \n        ESOP companies have amassed meaningful retirement savings \n        through their S ESOP accounts that will give them the means to \n        retire with dignity; and\n            (7) it is the goal of Congress to both preserve and foster \n        employee ownership of S corporations through ESOPs.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFERRAL OF TAX FOR CERTAIN SALES OF EMPLOYER STOCK TO EMPLOYEE \n              STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN SPONSORED BY S CORPORATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 1042(c)(1) of the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining qualified securities) is \namended by striking ``domestic C corporation'' and inserting ``domestic \ncorporation''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \napply to sales after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
