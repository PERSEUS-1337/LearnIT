SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Christopher Bryski \nStudent Loan Protection Act'' or ``Christopher's Law''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Bureau of Consumer Financial \n        Protection (hereafter referred to as the ``CFPB'') Student Loan \n        Ombudsman:\n                    (A) ``The CFPB received more than 3,100 private \n                student loan complaints and approximately 1,100 debt \n                collection complaints related to student loans between \n                October 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015.''.\n                    (B) ``Co-signers complain that information about \n                discharge or alternative arrangements in the case of \n                death of the primary borrower is not readily available \n                and that decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, \n                giving co-signers little understanding of how the \n                process works, or if they will be successful.''.\n                    (C) ``The complaints and input received by the CFPB \n                resemble many of the same issues experienced by \n                mortgage borrowers, such as improper application of \n                payments, untimeliness in error resolution, and \n                inability to contact appropriate personnel in times of \n                hardship.''.\n                    (D) ``The difference between federal and private \n                student loans in periods of disability was not well-\n                understood.''.\n            (2) An estimated 1,700,000 people sustain a traumatic brain \n        injury each year, with older adolescents aged 15 to 19 years \n        old more likely to sustain a traumatic brain injury than other \n        age groups.\n            (3) It has been estimated that the annual incidence of \n        spinal cord injury, not including those who die at the scene of \n        an accident, is approximately 40 cases per 1,000,000 people in \n        the United States or approximately 12,000 new cases each year. \n        These injuries can lead to permanent disability or loss of \n        movement and can prohibit the victim from engaging in any \n        substantial gainful activity.\n            (4) According to the CFPB, more than 90 percent of new \n        private student loans are co-signed.\n            (5) According to the CFPB, private student loan companies \n        provide co-signer release to less than 1 percent of eligible \n        borrowers.\n\nSEC. 2.
