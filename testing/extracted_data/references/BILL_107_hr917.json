FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to data from fiscal year 1999, approximately \n        162,000 Federal contract workers did not earn a wage sufficient \n        to lift a family of four out of poverty. Just under 60 percent \n        of these poorly paid workers work for large firms and 62 \n        percent work on Department of Defense contracts. These workers \n        represent 11 percent of the total 1.4 million Federal contract \n        workers in the United States.\n            (2) As of September 2000, 14,356 workers employed by the \n        Federal Government earned less than the poverty level for a \n        family of four.\n            (3) A majority of workers earning less than a living wage \n        are adult females working full-time. A disproportionate number \n        of workers earning less than a living wage are minorities.\n            (4) The Federal Government provides billions of dollars to \n        businesses each year, through spending programs, grants and \n        Government-favored financing.\n            (5) In fiscal year 1999, the Federal Government awarded \n        contracts worth over $208 billion.\n            (6) Congress must ensure that Federal dollars are used \n        responsibly to improve the economic security and well-being of \n        Americans across the country.\n\nSEC. 3. POVERTY-LEVEL WAGE.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--Notwithstanding any other law that does not \nspecifically exempt itself from this Act and except as provided in \nsubsection (b), the Federal Government and any employer under a Federal \ncontract for an amount exceeding $10,000 (or a subcontract under such a \ncontract) shall pay to each of their respective workers--\n            (1) an hourly wage (or salary equivalent) sufficient for a \n        worker to earn, while working 40 hours a week on a full-time \n        basis, the amount of the Federal poverty level for a family of \n        four (as published in the Federal Register by the Department of \n        Health and Human Services under the authority of section 673(2) \n        of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2))); \n        and\n            (2) an additional amount, determined by the Secretary based \n        on the locality in which a worker resides, sufficient to cover \n        the costs to such worker to obtain any fringe benefits not \n        provided by the worker's employer.\n    (b) Exemptions.--Subsection (a) does not apply to the following:\n            (1) A small-business concern (as that term is used in \n        section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)).\n            (2) A nonprofit organization exempt from Federal income tax \n        under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 \n        U.S.C. 501(c)), if the ratio of the total wages of the chief \n        executive officer of such organization to the wages of the \n        full-time equivalent of the lowest paid worker is not greater \n        than 25 to 1.\n    (c) Retaliation Prohibited.--It shall be unlawful for any employer \nsubject to subsection (a) to terminate or suspend the employment of a \nworker on the basis of such worker's allegation of a violation of \nsubsection (a).\n    (d) Contract Requirement.--Any contract subject to subsection (a) \nshall contain a provision requiring the Federal contractor to ensure \nthat any worker hired under such contract (or a subcontract thereof) \nshall be paid in accordance with subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4.
