ONE-STOP INTERNET WEBSITE FOR INFORMATION ON BENEFITS, \n              RESOURCES, SERVICES, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR VETERANS AND \n              THEIR FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) One of the most critical problems identified by \n        veterans and their families and caregivers is a lack of easily \n        accessible information and advice on benefits, resources, \n        services, and opportunities for members of the veteran \n        community.\n            (2) A guiding principle of the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs in bringing the Department into the 21st century is to \n        ensure coordination between the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        and the Department of Defense to provide a seamless transition \n        from military life to civilian life.\n            (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs has also emphasized \n        its intent to modernize, streamline, and simplify the provision \n        of resources to the veteran community, including through the \n        elimination of paper waste.\n            (4) The Internet increasingly serves as an essential \n        communication tool for all sectors of society and should be \n        used efficiently and effectively as a tool to provide \n        interactive outreach to the veteran community.\n            (5) The Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of \n        Labor, and other departments and agencies of the Federal \n        Government have taken strong steps to improve outreach to \n        veterans, including through the creation of Internet websites \n        for specific veteran populations, such as the National Resource \n        Directory for wounded veterans.\n            (6) However, the lack of a single, all-inclusive, user-\n        friendly Internet website with all relevant information on \n        benefits, resources, services, and opportunities for veterans \n        and their families and caregivers continues to impede the \n        seamless transition of veterans from military life to civilian \n        life.\n            (7) Moreover, veterans and their families and caregivers \n        continue to seek direct and personalized assistance from the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs that could be effectively and \n        efficiently supplemented by strong, interactive online \n        services.\n            (8) The Department of Defense has implemented an effective \n        and well-used program, Military One Source, that includes an \n        Internet website with consolidated information for members of \n        the Armed Forces on active duty.\n            (9) The Department of Defense has also successfully \n        employed various interactive, virtual tools on its Internet \n        websites to provide a higher quality virtual Internet \n        experience to members of the Armed Forces.\n            (10) The veterans community would be well-served by the \n        establishment of a single, consolidated, expanded, and \n        interactive Internet website to ensure streamlined and \n        simplified access to all information and advice on benefits, \n        resources, services, and opportunities available to veterans \n        and their families and caregivers.\n    (b) One-Stop Internet Website for Information on Benefits, \nResources, Services, and Opportunities for Veterans and Their Families \nand Caregivers.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n        establish and maintain an interactive Internet website that \n        provides information on the benefits, resources, services, and \n        opportunities described in subsection (d). The Secretary may \n        enter into a contract with an appropriate Federal or private \n        sector entity for purposes of establishing or maintaining the \n        website.\n            (2) Nature of website.--The website shall--\n                    (A) serve to consolidate, expand on, and improve \n                information and links from other existing Internet \n                websites relating to the benefits, resources, services, \n                and opportunities described in subsection (d), and may \n                include such other information and links on such \n                benefits, resources, services, and opportunities as the \n                Secretary considers appropriate; and\n                    (B) integrate dynamic Internet features and virtual \n                interface tools described in subsection (e) to provide \n                veterans a personalized, interactive, and user-centered \n                Internet experience and increase

and caregivers.\n            (3) Utilization of existing website in establishment.--In \n        establishing the website, the Secretary may utilize an existing \n        Internet website, such as the
