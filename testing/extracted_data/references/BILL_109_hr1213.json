FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Increased globalization and economic integration are \n        requiring countries throughout the world to rethink their \n        competitiveness strategies and to take affirmative steps to \n        improve their trade capacities.\n            (2) Countries of the Caribbean Basin can benefit from \n        assistance to improve their trade capacities.\n            (3) The Organization of American States (OAS) has relevant \n        experience in developing trade capacity initiatives and \n        programs of countries of the Western Hemisphere. In particular, \n        the Office for Trade, Growth and Competitiveness of the OAS has \n        successfully trained trade negotiators, particularly within the \n        context of negotiations to conclude a Free Trade Area of the \n        Americas (FTAA).\n\nSEC. 102. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    The Secretary of State is authorized to make a voluntary \ncontribution on a grant basis to the Organization of American States to \nestablish a Center for Caribbean Basin Trade (hereinafter in this title \nreferred to as the ``Center'') in accordance with the provisions of \nthis title.\n\nSEC. 103. ACTIVITIES.\n\n    The Center shall carry out the following activities:\n            (1) Provide government officials of Caribbean Basin \n        countries, including trade negotiators, with technical \n        assistance in developing and implementing trade agreements.\n            (2) Assist government officials and private sector \n        representatives of Caribbean Basin countries to further assist \n        firms in developing export readiness, such as developing firms' \n        commitment, identifying primary target markets, selecting \n        market entry strategies, developing an international market \n        plan, and developing distribution networks in other countries.\n            (3) Provide training and consulting services to Caribbean \n        Basin countries to upgrade port facilities, strengthen security \n        measures, upgrade customs procedures, and modernize other \n        infrastructure critical to trade.\n            (4) Provide training and consulting services to government \n        officials and private sector representatives of Caribbean Basin \n        countries on import requirements of major trading countries for \n        the Caribbean Basin region, including the United States, as \n        well as financing mechanisms.\n\nSEC. 104. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.\n\n    The Secretary of State, acting through the Assistant Secretary of \nState for Western Hemisphere Affairs and the United States Permanent \nRepresentative to the Organization of American States, shall work with \nthe Organization of American States to determine the location, staffing \nrequirements, programs, and working methodology of the Center.\n\nSEC. 105.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Studies demonstrate that greater emphasis needs to be \n        given to secondary education in countries of the Western \n        Hemisphere, including Caribbean Basin countries, in order to \n        bridge the widening educational and technology gap in such \n        countries, which ultimately hinders job growth.\n            (2) Access to education is fundamental in helping to \n        eradicate the poverty which limits economic growth in the \n        countries of the Caribbean Basin.\n            (3) Countries of the Western Hemisphere have consistently \n        lagged behind the countries of Asia and other regions, \n        suffering a self-perpetuating cycle of low-growth and \n        increasing poverty.\n            (4) The community college system in the United States \n        provides skills-based training for United States workers and is \n        a useful model for a skills-based training system for Caribbean \n        Basin countries.\n            (5) A skills-based training program established under the \n        management of the Organization of American States (OAS) would \n        be an effective means of addressing the needs of individuals \n        and economic concerns in the Caribbean Basin region.\n            (6) Such a program would provide individuals with the \n        skills required to improve their standard of living and, \n        together with employers, would further facilitate the economic \n        integration of the countries of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nSEC. 202. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    The Secretary of State is authorized to make a voluntary \ncontribution on a grant basis to the Organization of American States to \nestablish a skills-based training program for Caribbean Basin countries \n(hereinafter in this title referred to as the ``program'') in \naccordance with the provisions of this title.\n\nSEC. 203. ACTIVITIES.\n\n    The program shall carry out activities to support a productive \nworkforce in Caribbean Basin countries.\n\nSEC. 204. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the program should focus on mid-\nlevel technical education and training for the workforce in Caribbean \nBasin countries, utilizing existing educational facilities, cooperative \nprivate sector and government entities, and Internet-based training.\n\n                     TITLE III--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSEC. 301.
