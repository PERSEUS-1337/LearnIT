FINDINGS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION.\n\n    Congress finds that the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks \nUpon the United States (commonly referred to as the 9/11 Commission) \nconcluded the following:\n     (a) ``The small terrorist travel intelligence collection and \nanalysis program currently in place has produced disproportionately \nuseful results. It should be expanded. Since officials at the border \nencounter 12 travelers and their documents first and investigate travel \nfacilitators, they must work closely with intelligence officials.''.\n    (b) ``Information systems able to authenticate travel documents and \ndetect potential terrorist indicators should be used at consulates, at \nprimary border inspection lines, in immigration service offices, and \nintelligence and enforcement units.''.\n    (c) ``The President should direct the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to lead the effort to design a comprehensive screening system, \naddressing common problems and setting common standards with systemwide \ngoals in mind.''.\n    (d) ``A screening system looks for particular, identifiable \nsuspects or indicators of risk. It does not involve guesswork about who \nmight be dangerous. It requires frontline border officials who have the \ntools and resources to establish that people are who they say they are, \nintercept identifiable suspects, and disrupt terrorist operations.''.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTOMATED TARGETING SYSTEM FOR PERSONS ENTERING OR DEPARTING \n              THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through \nthe Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, may establish an \nautomated system for the purpose of the enforcement of United States \nlaw, including laws relating to antiterrorism and border security, to \nassist in the screening of persons seeking to enter or depart the \nUnited States (in this section referred to as the ``system'').\n    (b) Administrative Process To Correct Information.--The Secretary, \nacting through the Commissioner, shall ensure that an administrative \nprocess is established, or application of an existing administrative \nprocess is extended, pursuant to which any individual may apply to \ncorrect any information retained by the system established under \nsubsection (a). Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating \na private right of action and no court shall have jurisdiction based on \nany of the provisions of this section to hear any case or claim arising \nfrom the application of the system or the corrective administrative \nprocess established or applied under this subsection.\n    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued as abrogating, diminishing, or weakening the provisions of \nany Federal or State law that prevents or protects against the \nunauthorized collection or release of personal records.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary such sums as may be necessary to carry \nout this section.\n\nSEC. 4. PASSENGER AND CREW MANIFESTS FOR VESSELS, VEHICLES, AND \n              AIRCRAFT ARRIVING IN OR DEPARTING FROM THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    Part II of title IV of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1431 et \nseq.) is amended by inserting after section 434 the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 435.
