FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that energy crops--\n            (1) provide many of the soil and water conservation and \n        wildlife habitat benefits associated with cover already planted \n        on land enrolled in the conservation reserve program;\n            (2) can be harvested using best management practices \n        without compromising the conservation benefits being achieved \n        by the conservation reserve program;\n            (3) can maintain and enhance farm income while allowing \n        land to remain in the conservation reserve program at a reduced \n        cost to the Federal government;\n            (4) can supply a significant proportion of the energy needs \n        of the United States using domestic resources that are \n        renewable, sustainable, and environmentally beneficial; and\n            (5) can effectively trap carbon from the atmosphere and \n        provide air quality benefits.\n\nSEC. 3. HARVESTING OF ENERGY CROPS ON CONSERVATION RESERVE LAND.\n\n    Section 1232 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3832) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(f) Energy Crops.--\n            ``(1) Definition of energy crop.--In this subsection, the \n        term `energy crop' means a herbaceous perennial grass, a short \n        rotation woody coppice species of tree, or other crop, that may \n        be used to generate electric power or other energy product, as \n        determined by the Secretary in consultation with the State \n        technical committee for a State established under section 1261.\n            ``(2) Harvesting of energy crops in designated \n        demonstration areas.--In not more than 10 demonstration project \n        areas not exceeding a total of 1,000,000 acres (based on an \n        evaluation by the Secretary of joint industry and landowner \n        proposals to designate areas as demonstration project areas), \n        the Secretary shall permit an owner or operator of land, \n        located within a demonstration project area, that is subject to \n        a contract entered into under this subtitle to harvest an \n        energy crop on the land if the owner or operator--\n                    ``(A) carries out appropriate conservation measures \n                and practices on the land;\n                    ``(B) harvests energy crops in accordance with this \n                subsection on not more than 75 percent of the land that \n                is subject to the contract, in accordance with a \n                conservation plan and in a manner and at times of the \n                year that ensure that soil, water, and wildlife habitat \n                subject to the conservation reserve program as a whole \n                are not compromised;\n                    ``(C) if harvesting of energy crops on the land is \n                discontinued, maintains grasses or trees on the land \n                for the duration of the contract; and\n                    ``(D) submits a bid under paragraph (3) that is \n                accepted by the Secretary.\n            ``(3) Bids.--To carry out this subsection, the Secretary \n        shall establish a bid system under which an owner or operator \n        of land that is subject to a contract entered into under this \n        subtitle may offer to reduce the rental payments that would \n        otherwise be payable under the contract in exchange for \n        permission to harvest an energy crop on the land.\n            ``(4) Cost-Sharing.--The Secretary shall pay an owner or \n        operator of land described in paragraph (2) 50 percent of the \n        cost of converting land under the contract that is planted to \n        grasses not identified as an energy crop to the production of \n        an energy crop.\n            ``(5) Duration.--The Secretary shall permit an owner or \n        operator described in paragraph (2)--\n                    ``(A) to extend a contract entered into under this \n                subtitle for not to exceed 5 years; and\n                    ``(B) on expiration of a contract entered into \n                under this subtitle, obtain a priority, at an \n                appropriate rental rate, for reenrollment of the land \n                subject to the contract.''.\n\nSEC. 4. HARVESTING OF ENERGY CROPS ON CONSERVATION USE ACREAGE.\n\n    Section 503 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1463) is \namended--\n            (1) in subsection (c)--\n                    (A) in paragraph (7), by striking ``and'' at the \n                end;\n                    (B) in paragraph (8), by striking the period at the \n                end and inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(9) any acreage on the farm that is planted to an energy \n        crop in accordance with subsection (i).''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(i) Energy Crops.--\n            ``(1) Definition of energy crop.--In this subsection, the \n        term `energy crop' means a herbaceous perennial grass, a short \n        rotation woody coppice species of tree, or other crop, that may \n        be used to generate electric power or other energy product, as \n        determined by the Secretary in consultation with the State \n        technical committee for a State established under section 1261 \n        of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3861).\n            ``(2) Planting of energy crops.--For purposes of this Act, \n        acreage on a farm that is planted to an energy crop shall be \n        considered devoted to conservation uses if the producers on the \n        farm carry out appropriate conservation measures and practices \n        on the acreage, in accordance with a conservation plan that is \n        approved by the Secretary.\n            ``(3) Cost sharing.--The Secretary shall pay the producers \n        on a farm 50 percent of the cost of establishing an energy crop \n        if the producers agree to maintain the crop for at least 3 crop \n        years.''."
