FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 1997, Congress enacted the Adoption and Safe \n        Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-89; 111 Stat. 2115), \n        clearly stating that a child's health and safety are paramount, \n        and that each child deserves a permanent home.\n            (2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 provides \n        incentives for adoptions, and for fiscal year 2005, States \n        placed nearly 52,000 children from State care.\n            (3) In 2003, the Adoption Promotion Act (Public Law 108-\n        145, 117 Stat. 1879), which reauthorized the incentive program, \n        gave greater emphasis on moving older children into permanency.\n            (4) Despite the increase in adoptions, in 2005, more than \n        115,000 children in foster care were waiting to be adopted.\n            (5) Some States have chosen to limit services provided to \n        special needs adopted children who are not eligible for \n        adoption assistance under part E of title IV of the Social \n        Security Act, in effect discriminating against a child whose \n        parental rights have been terminated by basing the child's \n        eligibility for such assistance on the financial status of \n        adults who are no longer the child's legal parents.\n            (6) These children have many special needs and require \n        Federal financial assistance and support to start the physical \n        and emotional healing after what may have been past years of \n        abuse and neglect.\n\nSEC. 3. PROMOTION OF ADOPTION OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 473(a)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 673(a)(2)) is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(2)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(ii), a child meets the \nrequirements of this paragraph if the child--\n            ``(i)(I) at the time of termination of parental rights, was \n        in the care of a public or licensed private child placement \n        agency or Indian tribal organization pursuant to a voluntary \n        placement agreement, relinquishment, or involuntary removal of \n        the child from the home, and the State has determined, pursuant \n        to criteria established by the State, that continuation in the \n        home would be contrary to the safety or welfare of the child;\n            ``(II) meets all medical or disability requirements of \n        title XVI with respect to eligibility for supplemental security \n        income benefits; or\n            ``(III) was residing in a foster family home or child care \n        institution with a minor parent of the child pursuant to a \n        voluntary placement agreement, relinquishment, or involuntary \n        removal of the child from the home, and the State has \n        determined, pursuant to criteria established by the State, that \n        continuation in the home would be contrary to the safety or \n        welfare of the child; and\n            ``(ii) has been determined by the State, pursuant to \n        subsection (c), to be a child with special needs, which needs \n        shall be considered by the State, together with the \n        circumstances of the adopting parents, in determining the \n        amount of any payments to be made to the adoptive parents.\n    ``(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as \nprovided in paragraph (7), a child who is not a citizen or resident of \nthe United States, who is lawfully present in the United States, and \nwho meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) shall be treated as \nmeeting the requirements of this paragraph for purposes of paragraph \n(1)(B)(ii).\n    ``(C) A child who meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) of \nthis paragraph, who was determined eligible for adoption assistance \npayments under this part with respect to a prior adoption (or who would \nhave been determined eligible for such payments had the Adoption and \nSafe Families Act of 1997 been in effect at the time that such \ndetermination would have been made), and who is available for adoption \nbecause the prior adoption has been dissolved and the parental rights \nof the adoptive parents have been terminated, or because the child's \nadoptive parents have died, shall be treated as meeting the \nrequirements of this paragraph for purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(ii).''.\n    (b) Exception.--Section 473(a) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 673(a)) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(7)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a \nState shall not make a payment pursuant to this section to parents with \nrespect to a child considered by a State to be a special needs child if \nthe child--\n            ``(i) is not a citizen or resident of the United States; \n        and\n            ``(ii) was adopted outside of the United States or was \n        brought into the United States for the purpose of being \n        adopted.\n    ``(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as prohibiting \npayments under this part for a child described in subparagraph (A) that \nis placed in foster care subsequent to the failure, as determined by \nthe State, of the initial adoption of the child by the parents \ndescribed in such subparagraph.''.\n    (c) Determination of a Child With Special Needs.--Section 473(c)(1) \nof such Act (42 U.S.C. 673(c)(1)) is amended to read as follows:\n            ``(1)(A) the State has determined, pursuant to criteria \n        established by the State, that the child cannot or should not \n        be returned to the home of his or her parents; or\n            ``(B) the child meets all medical or disability \n        requirements of title XVI with respect to eligibility for \n        supplemental security income benefits; and''.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the States should reinvest in \nchild welfare programs any savings resulting from the implementation of \nthe amendments made by this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), the \namendments made by this Act shall take effect on October 1, 2008, and \nshall apply with respect to adoption assistance agreements entered \ninto, and to payments under part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct for calendar quarters beginning, on or after such date, without \nregard to whether regulations to implement the amendments are \npromulgated by such date.\n    (b) Delay Permitted if State Legislation Required.--If the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services determines that State \nlegislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) is required in \norder for a State plan approved under part E of title IV of the Social \nSecurity Act to meet the additional requirements imposed by the \namendments made by this Act, the plan shall not be regarded as failing \nto meet any of the additional requirements before the 1st day of the \n1st calendar quarter beginning after the first regular session of the \nState legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of this \nAct. If the State has a 2-year legislative session, each year of the \nsession is deemed to be a separate regular session of the State \nlegislature."
