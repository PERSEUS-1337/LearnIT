FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States should continue to lead the \n        international effort to identify, protect, and return looted \n        assets taken by the Nazis and their collaborators from victims \n        of the Holocaust.\n            (2) The citizens of the United States should understand \n        exactly how the United States Government dealt with the assets \n        looted from victims of the Nazis that came into its possession.\n            (3) The United States forces in Europe made extraordinary \n        efforts to locate and restitute assets taken by the Nazis and \n        their collaborators from victims of the Holocaust.\n            (4) However, the restitution policy formulated by the \n        United States and implemented in the countries in Europe \n        occupied by the United States had many inadequacies and fell \n        short of realizing the goal of returning stolen property to the \n        victims.\n            (5) As a result of these United States policies and their \n        implementation, there remain today many survivors or heirs of \n        survivors who have not had restored to them that which the \n        Nazis looted.\n            (6) The Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust \n        Assets in the United States, established in Public Law 105-186, \n        found the following:\n                    (A) The United States authorities generally \n                restituted those victims' assets that came under United \n                States control to the national government of their \n                country of origin. In these cases the recipient \n                government bore the responsibility to locate the \n                rightful owner and to restitute the property turned \n                over to it by United States authorities. The Commission \n                found little evidence of efforts by these countries to \n                effect restitution and no evidence that the United \n                States monitored the recipient countries' compliance \n                with these responsibilities.\n                    (B) The policy explained in subparagraph (A) \n                excluded those who no longer had a nation to represent \n                their interests, or who had fallen victim to the \n                ruthless efficiency of Nazi genocide and whose property \n                had been rendered heirless and unidentifiable. For \n                those cases, the United States designated ``successor \n                organizations'' to sell heirless and unclaimed property \n                and apply the proceeds to the care, resettlement, and \n                rehabilitation of victims. The adoption of this policy \n                led to many assets being too hastily labeled as \n                heirless or unidentifiable, with the result that they \n                were assigned to the successor organizations rather \n                than to the individuals themselves.\n                    (C) The United States military government \n                established strict deadlines that created narrow \n                windows for filing petitions for restitution and \n                prevented many rightful owners from asserting their \n                rights.\n                    (D) Even when property was returned to individual \n                owners or their heirs, it was often only after \n                protracted, cumbersome, and expensive administrative \n                proceedings that yielded settlements far less than the \n                full value of the assets concerned.\n                    (E) Better policy implementation in Germany and \n                Austria would have prevented identifiable victims' \n                assets from being stored in disorganized and poorly \n                secured military warehouses and facilities where they \n                were occasionally subject to theft and requisitioning \n                by United States servicemen and civilian employees.\n                    (F) In 1953, a Senate judiciary subcommittee \n                delving into the activities of the United States Office \n                of Alien Property (OAP) criticized the agency for \n                lacking good business practices in the way it handled \n                the assets under its control. The subcommittee \n                particularly singled out the ``inefficient and \n                dilatory'' manner in which claims were processed. Of \n                approximately 15,000 title claims only about 6,000 had \n                been processed.\n                    (G) Congress regarded frozen German assets as a \n                source from which to pay United States war claims for \n                damages suffered by American businesses and \n                individuals. The United States War Claims Commission \n                received more than $200,000,000 from liquidated German \n                and Japanese assets. Thus, United States war claims \n                were paid in part by German assets that likely included \n                victims' assets.\n            (7) The United States Government should redress and improve \n        upon the results that occurred as a result of the policies it \n        established to assist the victims or their heirs to recover \n        property stolen from them during the Nazi regime.\n            (8) The best way to improve upon these results is to create \n        a single institution to serve as a centralized repository for \n        research and information about Holocaust-era assets.\n            (9) Enhancing these policies will also assist victims of \n        future armed conflicts around the world.\n            (10) The conference on Material Claims Against Germany has \n        worked since 1951 with the Government of the United States and \n        with other governments to accomplish material restitution of \n        the looted assets of Holocaust victims, wherever those assets \n        were identified, and has played a major role in allocating \n        unclaimed restitution funds, including funds contributed by the \n        United States, to the Nazi Persecutee Relief Fund.\n\nSEC. 3.
