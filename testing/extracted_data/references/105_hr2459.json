FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On August 4, 1995, the Senate voted 67-27 to impose a \n        moratorium on United States use of anti-personnel landmines \n        beginning in February 1999.\n            (2) On April 3, 1996, 15 senior retired United States \n        military officers, including the former commanding officers of \n        United States Armed Forces in Korea, the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization (NATO), Vietnam, and Desert Storm, urged the \n        President to ban the production, stockpiling, sale, and use of \n        anti-personnel landmines.\n            (3) The generals stated that a ban would be ``humane and \n        militarily responsible'' and that it ``would not undermine the \n        military effectiveness or safety of our forces, nor those of \n        other nations''.\n            (4) In Vietnam, 7,318 United States military personnel were \n        killed, and 56,783 were injured, from landmines.\n            (5) In Bosnia, at least 204 soldiers under United Nations \n        command have been injured, and 20 killed, and at least 55 \n        soldiers under NATO command have been injured, and 9 killed, by \n        landmines.\n            (6) The Department of State estimates that a man, woman, or \n        child is killed or injured by a landmine every 22 minutes.\n            (7) On May 16, 1996, President Clinton declared that the \n        United States would ``aggressively pursue'' an international \nagreement to ban anti-personnel landmines.\n            (8) On June 7, 1996, the members of the Organization of \n        American States, including the United States, declared the goal \n        of a Western Hemisphere landmine free zone.\n            (9) On June 4, 1997, the members of the Organization of \n        African Unity adopted the goal of the establishment of Africa \n        as an anti-personnel landmine free zone.\n            (10) On October 5, 1996, the Government of Canada announced \n        that it would pursue negotiations on a treaty banning anti-\n        personnel landmines to be completed at Ottawa in December 1997.\n            (11) On December 10, 1996, the United Nations General \n        Assembly passed by a vote of 156-0 (with 10 abstentions), a \n        United States-sponsored resolution to ``pursue vigorously'' a \n        treaty banning the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer \n        of anti-personnel landmines, with a view to completing the \n        negotiation ``as soon as possible''.\n            (12) Formal negotiations on the Ottawa treaty began in \n        Oslo, Norway on September 1, 1997, with a moment of silence in \n        memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, who was a passionate \n        advocate for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.\n            (13) By exerting its unmatched international influence, the \n        United States could secure broad support for a legally binding \n        international treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.\n            (14) Such a treaty would further United States security and \n        humanitarian interests by deterring the use of anti-personnel \n        landmines against United States Armed Forces and civilians.\n\nSEC. 3.
