    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Gulf Coast Recovery Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) while public officials have the responsibility and \n        expertise to direct and control the Federal, State and local \n        response to any disaster, those officials lack the manpower and \n        equipment necessary to take all of the many steps necessary to \n        implement such a response;\n            (2) in the wake of a disaster, public officials have to \n        depend on private contractors for logistical and other support;\n            (3) historically, private contractors have answered the \n        call, providing valuable service to the public in times of \n        disaster;\n            (4) those contractors answered the call on September 11, \n        2001, and in the following weeks and months, working hand-in-\n        hand with Federal, State, and local officials to rescue the \n        survivors of the terrorist attacks on that historic date, to \n        recover the bodies of those who died, to remove mountains of \n        debris, to reconstruct the Pentagon, and ultimately, to restore \n        some sense of normalcy to New York City and Arlington, \n        Virginia;\n            (5) the expertise and equipment that private contractors \n        contributed to the Federal, State, and local response to the \n        terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, greatly enhanced that \n        response, increasing not only the efficiency but also the \n        effectiveness of that response;\n            (6) the support that private contractors provide to \n        Federal, State, and local officials in times of disaster--\n                    (A) make it safer for police, firefighters, and \n                other rescue workers to search for, rescue, and recover \n                both persons and property dislocated by the disaster; \n                and\n                    (B) enable those officials to quickly address \n                dangerous conditions that threaten life and property, \n                to restore basic public services, and to protect public \n                safety and health;\n            (7) it is in the national interest to have private \n        contractors assist public officials in times of disaster;\n            (8) by providing support to the Federal, State or local \n        response to a disaster, private contractors risk future \n        litigation and liability even if those contractors are in full \n        compliance with all Federal, State, and local laws (including \n        regulations) that apply to their work;\n            (9) class action lawsuits have been brought against the \n        private contractors that supervised the heroic response to the \n        terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City on \n        September 11, 2001;\n            (10) well-founded fears of future litigation and liability \n        under existing law discourage contractors from assisting in \n        times of disaster;\n            (11) whether private contractors remain willing to offer \n        their expertise and equipment to public officials in times of \n        disaster substantially affects, burdens, and deters interstate \n        commerce and travel;\n            (12) clarifying the liability that private contractors must \n        ultimately risk simply to support a Federal, State, or local \n        response to a disaster will help--\n                    (A) to ensure that those contractors continue to \n                answer the governmental requests for assistance in \n                times of great need; and\n                    (B) to limit the legal expenses that regrettably \n                but inevitably inflate the cost of the recovery from a \n                disaster; and\n            (13) temporarily insulating private contractors from any \n        liability that private parties may seek to impose on the \n        contractors under certain Federal laws would increase the power \n        and authority of the Federal agencies that bear the primary \n        responsibility for the administration of those laws to \n        effectively direct and control the response to a disaster.\n\nSEC. 3.
