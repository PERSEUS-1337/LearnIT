FINDINGS; POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly 100 major United States corporations, and many \n        government entities around the world, have reduced waste in \n        their operations and improved the quality of the goods and \n        services they provide by implementing a continuous process \n        improvement methodology known as lean six sigma.\n            (2) Use of this methodology has resulted in average cost \n        reductions greater than 25 percent while also improving the \n        quality of goods and services.\n            (3) The piloted use of lean six sigma within the Department \n        of Defense and several other departments and agencies has \n        demonstrated that it can successfully be applied across the \n        Federal Government.\n            (4) Continuous process improvement is essential for Federal \n        agencies to be successful in setting and meeting performance \n        goals and is a key component that is missing from current \n        statutory requirements for performance improvement efforts.\n            (5) Clear direction and authority from Congress is needed \n        to ensure this innovative management process from the private \n        sector is applied across the Federal Government to achieve \n        waste reduction and optimal efficiency.\n    (b) Congressional Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of \nthe United States--\n            (1) to reduce waste and improve the effectiveness of the \n        Federal Government through the use of continuous process \n        improvement methods;\n            (2) to require each Federal agency to implement the \n        necessary capabilities to fully institutionalize such methods \n        within such agency to reduce waste while maintaining or \n        improving the level of services provided by the Federal \n        Government; and\n            (3) to return savings from such methods to the United \n        States Treasury to reduce the deficit.\n\nSEC. 3.
