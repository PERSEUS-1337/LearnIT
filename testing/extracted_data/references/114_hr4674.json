FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On April 25, 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the \n        Richter scale and a subsequent earthquake on May 12 measuring \n        7.3 on the Richter scale and numerous aftershocks--\n                    (A) devastated Kathmandu, Nepal, and the \n                surrounding areas;\n                    (B) killed more than 8,700 people;\n                    (C) injured hundreds of thousands additional \n                people;\n                    (D) destroyed or damaged more than 770,000 homes, \n                leaving the families who had been living in those homes \n                without shelter;\n                    (E) damaged or destroyed more than 47,000 \n                classrooms;\n                    (F) damaged or destroyed over 1,000 health \n                facilities including primary health care centers and \n                birthing centers;\n                    (G) left many people with newly acquired \n                disabilities, including lost limbs and other physical \n                and mental trauma;\n                    (H) severely impacted livelihoods and food security \n                for millions of people, including the destruction of \n                stockpiled grains and the loss of more than 17,000 \n                cattle and 40,000 smaller domesticated animals; and\n                    (I) disrupted social structures and families \n                through death, injury, and relocation.\n            (2) The earthquake devastated Nepal's infrastructure, \n        including homes, offices, factories, roads, bridges, \n        communications, and other facilities.\n            (3) American citizens were also killed in the widespread \n        destruction caused by the earthquake.\n            (4) Six American servicemembers and 2 members of the \n        Nepalese Army lost their lives in a helicopter accident while \n        working to relieve the suffering of the Nepalese people \n        following the earthquake.\n            (5) The World Bank and the Government of Nepal conducted a \n        post disaster needs assessment that estimated almost \n        $6,700,000,000 in sector specific damage, losses, and recovery \n        needs.\n            (6) In Nepal, which is one of the poorest countries in the \n        world--\n                    (A) an estimated 25 percent of the population lives \n                on less than $1.25 per day;\n                    (B) there is a 46-percent unemployment rate, with \n                the majority of the population engaged in subsistence \n                agriculture;\n                    (C) only 25 percent of Nepalese participate in the \n                formal banking system, with the majority of Nepalese \n                severely lacking access to credit and financial \n                services, making accessing credit for rebuilding \n                difficult; and\n                    (D) has one of the slowest economic growth rates in \n                the region.\n            (7) The geography of Nepal poses a significant challenge to \n        relief, reconstruction, and development that requires \n        extraordinary efforts and assets to overcome.\n            (8) The United States Government, the Government of Nepal, \n        and civil society organizations have invested in disaster risk \n        reduction efforts for nearly 20 years. Those efforts have \n        reduced suffering and prevented greater loss of life and \n        property.\n            (9) In recent years, the Government and people of Nepal \n        have taken important steps forward to resolve civil conflict, \n        reconcile, and promote economic growth and development.\n            (10) Nepal has qualified for the Millennium Challenge \n        Corporation Threshold Program and has been selected for a \n        Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact, based on its \n        performance on key selection criteria.\n            (11) The earthquake has significantly increased the costs \n        and uncertainty of doing business in Nepal.\n\nSEC. 4.
