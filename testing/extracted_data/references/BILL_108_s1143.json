FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Over 3,000,000 individuals in the United States are \n        chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (referred to in \n        this section as ``HCV''), making it the Nation's most common \n        blood borne virus infection.\n            (2) Nearly 2 percent of the population of the United States \n        have been infected with HCV.\n            (3) Conservative estimates indicate that approximately \n        35,000 Americans are newly infected with HCV each year.\n            (4) HCV infection can cause life-threatening liver disease.\n            (5) Individuals infected with HCV serve as a source of \n        transmission to others and, since few individuals are aware \n        they are infected, are unlikely to take precautions to prevent \n        the spread or exacerbation of their infection.\n            (6) There is no vaccine available to prevent HCV infection.\n            (7) Treatments are available to slow the progression of \n        chronic hepatitis C.\n            (8) An estimated 2,400,000 to 2,700,000 people who are \n        chronically infected with hepatitis C are receiving no \n        treatment.\n            (9) Conservative estimates place the costs of lost \n        productivity and medical care arising from chronic hepatitis C \n        in the United States at more than $600,000,000 annually and \n        such costs will undoubtedly increase in the absence of expanded \n        prevention and treatment efforts.\n            (10) To combat the HCV epidemic in the United States, the \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed \n        Recommendations for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis C Virus \n        (HCV) Infection and HCV-Related Chronic Disease in 1998 and the \n        National Hepatitis C Prevention Strategy in 2001, and the \n        National Institutes of Health convened Consensus Development \n        Conferences on the Management of Hepatitis C in 1997 and 2002. \n        These recommendations and guidelines provide a framework for \n        hepatitis C prevention, control, research, and medical \n        management referral programs.\n            (11) Federal support is necessary to increase knowledge and \n        awareness of hepatitis C and to assist State and local \n        prevention and control efforts.\n\nSEC. 3.
