    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Interstate Class \nAction Jurisdiction Act of 1999''.\n    (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act reference is made to an \namendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference \nshall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of title \n28, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) as recently noted by the United States Court of Appeals \n        for the Third Circuit, interstate class actions are ``the \n        paradigm for Federal diversity jurisdiction because, in a \n        constitutional sense, they implicate interstate commerce, \n        invite discrimination by a local State, and tend to attract \n        bias against business enterprises'';\n            (2) most such cases, however, fall outside the scope of \n        current Federal diversity jurisdiction statutes;\n            (3) that exclusion is an unintended technicality, inasmuch \n        as those statutes were enacted by Congress before the rise of \n        the modern class action and therefore without recognition that \n        interstate class actions typically are substantial \n        controversies of the type for which diversity jurisdiction was \n        designed;\n            (4) Congress is constitutionally empowered to amend the \n        current Federal diversity jurisdiction statutes to permit most \n        interstate class actions to be brought in or removed to Federal \n        district courts; and\n            (5) in order to ensure that interstate class actions are \n        adjudicated in a fair, consistent, and efficient manner and to \n        correct the unintended, technical exclusion of such cases from \n        the scope of Federal diversity jurisdiction, it is appropriate \n        for Congress to amend the Federal diversity jurisdiction and \n        related statutes to allow more interstate class actions to be \n        brought in or removed to Federal court.\n\nSEC. 3. JURISDICTION OF DISTRICT COURTS.\n\n    (a) Expansion of Federal Jurisdiction.--Section 1332 is amended by \nredesignating subsections (b), (c), and (d) as subsections (c), (d), \nand (e), respectively, and by inserting after subsection (a) the \nfollowing:\n    ``(b)(1) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of \nany civil action which is brought as a class action and in which--\n            ``(A) any member of a proposed plaintiff class is a citizen \n        of a State different from any defendant;\n            ``(B) any member of a proposed plaintiff class is a foreign \n        state and any defendant is a citizen of a State; or\n            ``(C) any member of a proposed plaintiff class is a citizen \n        of a State and any defendant is a citizen or subject of a \n        foreign state.\nAs used in this paragraph, the term `foreign state' has the meaning \ngiven that term in section 1603(a).\n    ``(2)(A) The district courts shall not exercise jurisdiction over a \ncivil action described in paragraph (1) if the action is--\n            ``(i) an intrastate case;\n            ``(ii) a limited scope case; or\n            ``(iii) a State action case.\n    ``(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)--\n            ``(i) the term `intrastate case' means a class action in \n        which the record indicates that--\n                    ``(I) the claims asserted therein will be governed \n                primarily by the laws of the State in which the action \n                was originally filed; and\n                    ``(II) the substantial majority of the members of \n                all proposed plaintiff classes, and the primary \n                defendants, are citizens of the State in which the \n                action was originally filed;\n            ``(ii) the term `limited scope case' means a class action \n        in which the record indicates that all matters in controversy \n        asserted by all members of all proposed plaintiff classes do \n        not in the aggregate exceed the sum or value of $1,000,000, \n        exclusive of interest and costs, or a class action in which the \n        number of members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the \n        aggregate is less than 100; and\n            ``(iii) the term `State action case' means a class action \n        in which the primary defendants are States, State officials, or \n        other governmental entities against whom the district court may \n        be foreclosed from ordering relief.\n    ``(3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any claim concerning a \ncovered security as that term is defined in section 16(f)(3) of the \nSecurities Act of 1933 and section 28(f)(5)(E) of the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934.\n    ``(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any class action solely \ninvolving a claim that relates to--\n            ``(A) the internal affairs or governance of a corporation \n        or other form of business enterprise and that arises under or \n        by virtue of the laws of the State in which such corporation or \n        business enterprise is incorporated or organized; or\n            ``(B) the rights, duties (including fiduciary duties), and \n        obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any \n        security (as defined under section 2(a)(1) of the Securities \n        Act of 1933 and the regulations issued thereunder).''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1332(c) (as redesignated by this \nsection) is amended by inserting after ``Federal courts'' the \nfollowing: ``pursuant to subsection (a) of this section''.\n    (c) Determination of Diversity.--Section 1332, as amended by this \nsection, is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(f) For purposes of subsection (b), a member of a proposed class \nshall be deemed to be a citizen of a State different from a defendant \ncorporation only if that member is a citizen of a State different from \nall States of which the defendant corporation is deemed a citizen.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
