    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Code Talkers Recognition Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. EXPRESSION OF RECOGNITION.\n\n    The purposes of the medals authorized by this Act are to express \nrecognition by the United States and the Congress and to honor the \nNative American Code Talkers who distinguished themselves in performing \nhighly successful communications operations of a unique type that \ngreatly assisted in saving countless lives and in hastening the end of \nWorld War I and World War II.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) When the United States entered World War I, Indian \n        people of the United States were not accorded the status of \n        citizens of the United States.\n            (2) Without regard to this lack of citizenship, members of \n        Indian Tribes and nations enlisted in the Armed Forces to fight \n        on behalf of their native land.\n            (3) The first reported use of American Indian Code Talkers \n        was on October 17, 1918.\n            (4) The Choctaw Code Talkers in World War I were the first \n        Code Talkers that played a role in American military operations \n        and transmitted vital communications that helped defeat German \n        forces in Europe in World War I.\n            (5) Because the language used by the Choctaw soldiers in \n        the transmission of information was not based on a European \n        language or on a mathematical progression, the Germans were \n        unable to understand any of the transmissions.\n            (6) This was the first time in modern warfare that such \n        transmission of messages in a native language was used for the \n        purpose of confusing the enemy.\n            (7) On December 7, 1941, the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl \n        Harbor, Hawaii and Congress declared war the following day.\n            (8) The United States Government called upon the Comanche \n        Nation to support the military effort during World War II by \n        recruiting and enlisting Comanche men to serve in the United \n        States Army to develop a secret code based on the Comanche \n        language.\n            (9) During World War II, the United States employed Native \n        American Code Talkers who developed secret means of \n        communication based on Native languages and who were critical \n        to winning the war.\n            (10) The Army recruited about 50 Native Americans for such \n        special communication assignments and the Marines recruited \n        several hundred Navajos for duty in the Pacific.\n            (11) In 2001, Congress and President Bush honored the \n        Navajo Code Talkers with congressional gold medals for their \n        contributions to the United States Armed Forces as radio \n        operators during World War II.\n            (12) It is time for Congress to give all Native American \n        Code Talkers the recognition they deserve for their \n        contributions to United States victories in World War I and \n        World War II.\n            (13) Soldiers from the Assiniboine, Cherokee, Cheyenne, \n        Chippewa/Oneida, Choctaw, Comanche, Cree, Crow, Hopi, Kiowa, \n        Menominee, Meskwaki, Mississauga, Muscogee, Osage, Pawnee, Sac \n        and Fox, Seminole, and Sioux (Lakota and Dakota) Indian Tribes \n        and nations served as Code Talkers during World War II.\n            (14) To the enemy's frustration, the code developed by \n        these Native American Indians proved to be unbreakable and was \n        used extensively throughout the European theater.\n            (15) The heroic and dramatic contributions of the Native \n        American Code Talkers was instrumental in driving back Axis \n        forces across the Pacific during World War II.\n\nSEC. 4.
