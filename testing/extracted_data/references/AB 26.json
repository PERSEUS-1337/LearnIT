an application for licensure or renewal of a state license, or issue a conditional license, if any of the following conditions apply:\n(1) Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any

In determining which offenses are substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of the business or profession for which the application is made, the licensing authority shall include, but not be limited to, the following:\n(A) A felony conviction for the illegal possession for sale, sale, manufacture, transportation, or cultivation of a controlled substance.\n(B) A violent felony conviction, as specified in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 of the Penal Code.\n(C) A serious felony conviction, as specified in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 of the Penal Code.\n(D) A felony conviction involving fraud, deceit, or embezzlement.\n(5) The applicant, or any of its officers, directors, or owners, is a licensed physician making patient recommendations for medical cannabis pursuant to Section 11362.7 of the Health and Safety Code.\n(6) The applicant or any of its officers, directors, or owners has been subject to fines or penalties for cultivation or production of a controlled substance on public or private lands pursuant to Section 12025 or 12025.1 of the Fish and Game Code.\n(7) The applicant, or any of its officers, directors, or owners, has been sanctioned by a licensing authority or a city, county, or city and county for unlicensed commercial cannabis activities or has had a license revoked under this chapter in the three years immediately preceding the date the application is filed with the licensing authority.\n(8) Failure to obtain and maintain a valid seller\u2019s permit required pursuant to Part 1 (commencing with Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.\n(9) The applicant or any of its officers, directors, owners, employees, or authorized agents have failed to comply with any operating procedure required pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 19322.\n(10) Conduct that constitutes grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to this chapter.\n(c) On and after July 1, 2018, the licensing authority shall deny an application of an applicant with 20 or more employees unless the applicant attests on the application that the applicant will implement an employee training program approved by the licensing authority within one year of licensure, pursuant to Section 19326.5.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 19326.5 is added to the Business and Professions Code, to read:\n19326.5.\n(a) A licensee shall implement an employee training program to educate, inform, and train the licensee\u2019s employees on compliance with this chapter. A licensee may employ or contract with a third-party provider to provide the employee training program.

A licensing authority shall not be limited to approving workplace training organizations as third-party providers of employee training\nprograms.\nprograms\n; however, a licensing authority shall not approve a third-party provider of an employee training program if the provider is a licensee, except as provided in paragraph (1).\n(c) A licensing authority shall revoke the license of any licensee with 20 or more employees that fails to implement an employee training program as required by this section within one year of licensure.\n(d) Each licensing authority shall charge a fee for approving an employee training program. Revenues collected pursuant to this subdivision shall be deposited in the appropriate fee account within the Medical\nMarijuana\nCannabis\nRegulation and Safety Act Fund established pursuant to Section\n19350.\n19351.\nTotal fees assessed shall not exceed the reasonable regulatory costs. Each licensing authority may adjust fees as needed, but no more than once per year, to generate sufficient revenue to cover the costs of employee training program approval.\n(e) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2018.\nSEC. 4.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution."
