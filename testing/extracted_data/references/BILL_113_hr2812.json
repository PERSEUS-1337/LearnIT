In considering whether compliance \n                with the requirements of this section would likely \n                violate the State's constitution or an interpretation \n                thereof by the State's highest court, the Attorney \n                General shall consult with the chief executive and \n                chief legal officer of the State concerning the State's \n                interpretation of the State's constitution and rulings \n                thereon by the State's highest court.\n                    (C) Alternative procedures.--If the State is unable \n                to substantially implement this section because of a \n                limitation imposed by the State's constitution, the \n                Attorney General may determine that the State is in \n                compliance with this Act if the State has implemented, \n                or is in the process of implementing, reasonable \n                alternative procedures or accommodations that are \n                consistent with the purposes of this Act.\n                    (D) Funding reduction.--If a State does not comply \n                with subparagraph (C), then the State shall be subject \n                to a funding reduction as specified in paragraph (1).\n            (3) Reallocation.--Amounts not allocated under subpart 1 of \n        part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \n        Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et seq.) to a State for failure to \n        substantially implement this section shall be reallocated under \n        such subpart to States that have not failed to substantially \n        implement this section or may be reallocated to a State from \n        which they were withheld to be used solely for the purpose of \n        implementing this section.\n    (d) Definition of State.--In this section the term ``State'' shall \nhave the meaning given such term in section 901(a) of Omnibus Crime \nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3791(a) et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY ON ``STAND YOUR GROUND'' LAWS.\n\n    (a) Authority.--Not later than one year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Attorney General shall conduct a study of State laws \nthat allow a person to use deadly force when such person is threatened \nand do not impose a duty to retreat before using such force in any \nplace where such person is lawfully present (commonly known as ``stand \nyour ground laws'').\n    (b) Contents of Study.--In conducting the study under subsection \n(a), the Attorney General shall examine each of the following:\n            (1) The effect that stand your ground laws have on rates of \n        violent deaths, including determining whether States that have \n        stand your ground laws have higher rates of violent deaths than \n        States that do not have such laws.\n            (2) Whether women and minorities are targets of the force \n        authorized by stand your ground laws at a higher rate than the \n        general population.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after completing the study \nconducted under subsection (a), the Attorney General shall report the \nfindings of such study to Congress."
