FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n            (1) It is the Federal Government's responsibility to create \n        the conditions in which enterprise can once again flourish in \n        our inner cities, and to help create jobs where now there is \n        only unemployment.\n            (2) Enterprise zones will reduce taxes, regulations, and \n        other government burdens on economic activity in the Nation's \n        most economically depressed areas. If properly implemented, \n        this concept can and will work over a period of several years. \n        Because the problem in our inner cities is more urgent and more \n        immediate, however, it requires a more aggressive reform, \n        designated the ``turbo enterprise zone''.\n            (3) To suit the current emergency, the enterprise zone \n        concept is supercharged: first, it is targeted on especially \n        hard-hit areas bereft of current tax revenue production; and, \n        second, the incentives are extraordinary. Specifically, local \n        governments will be asked to ``green line'' the most depressed \n        areas. Within the green line, city, county, State, and Federal \n        governments will cooperate to implement a zero tax rate regime \n        for 5 years: No sales taxes, payroll withholding taxes, \n        property taxes, excise taxes, or income taxes. To obtain these \n        benefits, 90 percent of a business's employees and managers \n        must live within the green line.\n            (4) Under current circumstances, the hardest-hit areas of \n        our Nation's inner cities are tax burdens rather than tax \n        producers. By offering striking incentives for capital to \n        locate within the turbo enterprise zone, however, it is \n        realistically to be anticipated that enormous economic activity \n        will occur in this area within the 5-year period. As a \n        consequence, at the end of that time, it is anticipated that a \n        sturdy tax-generating infrastructure will be firmly in place.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to inspire renewed \nconfidence in the blighted areas within America's inner cities, without \nrequiring enormous amounts of new taxes and borrowing.\n\nSEC. 3.
