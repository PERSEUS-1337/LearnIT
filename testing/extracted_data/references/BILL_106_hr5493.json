IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEDERAL LAND MANAGERS AND GATEWAY \n              COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT COMPATIBLE LAND MANAGEMENT OF BOTH \n              FEDERAL AND ADJACENT LANDS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Communities that are adjacent to or near significant \n        parcels of the Federal lands, such as units of the National \n        Park System, units of the National Wildlife Refuge System, \n        units of the National Forest System, and lands administered by \n        the Bureau of Land Management, are often affected by the \n        management and public use of these Federal lands.\n            (2) These nearby communities, commonly known as gateway \n        communities, have social and economic links to these Federal \n        lands and can also affect the activities occurring on these \n        Federal lands.\n            (3) Gateway communities often serve as a starting point for \n        persons who visit these Federal lands and are an ideal place \n        for establishment of visitor services, including lodging, food \n        service, fuel, and auto repairs.\n            (4) Development in these gateway communities can benefit or \n        adversely affect the management and protection of these Federal \n        lands, depending on the extent to which advance planning for \n        the local development is coordinated between the communities \n        and Federal land managers.\n            (5) The management decisions of Federal land managers can \n        have unintended consequences for gateway communities, when the \n        decisions are not adequately communicated to, or coordinated \n        with, the elected officials and residents of gateway \n        communities.\n            (6) Experts in land management planning are available to \n        Federal land managers, but persons with technical planning \n        skills are often not readily available to gateway communities, \n        particularly small gateway communities.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the Federal Government that \nFederal land managers should make every effort to support, and \ncommunicate, coordinate, and cooperate with, gateway communities in \norder to--\n            (1) improve the relationship between Federal land managers \n        and elected officials and residents of gateway communities;\n            (2) enhance the facilities and services in gateway \n        communities that, while compatible with the management of \n        Federal lands, are available to visitors to Federal lands; and\n            (3) result in better land use decisions.\n    (c) Definitions.--In this Act:\n            (1) Federal land manager.--The term ``Federal land \n        manager'' means the superintendent of a unit of the National \n        Park System, the manager of a national wildlife refuge, the \n        resource area manager of a Bureau of Land Management area, or \n        the supervisor of a unit of the National Forest System.\n            (2) Gateway community.--The term ``gateway community'' \n        means a community that--\n                    (A) is located adjacent to or near Federal lands \n                administered by a Federal land manager;\n                    (B) provides identifiable visitor services to \n                persons using these Federal lands;\n                    (C) has identifiable social and economic links to \n                these Federal lands; and\n                    (D) contains lands, the use of which could either \n                benefit or adversely affect lands, waters, or other \n                resources of these Federal lands.\n            (3) Certified gateway community.--The term ``certified \n        gateway community'' means a gateway community that voluntarily \n        requests the technical assistance of a Federal land manager on \n        matters of land use coordination and planning for, and the \n        appropriate siting of development in, the gateway community.\n    (d) Participate in Federal Planning.--Whenever a Federal land \nmanager undertakes land management planning regarding Federal lands \nadministered by the Federal land manager, the Federal land manager \nshall--\n            (1) seek the active involvement of elected officials, \n        businesses, civic organizations, and other interested persons \n        in neighboring gateway communities in the planning process; and\n            (2) provide these persons with a meaningful opportunity to \n        participate in the development and implementation of the \n        resulting land management decisions.\n    (e) Coordination of Land Use.--A Federal land manager may enter \ninto a cooperative agreement with the local government of a certified \ngateway community for the purpose of mutual coordination of land \nmanagement and development plans. At a minimum, such an agreement shall \nprovide for the involvement of persons referred to in subsection (d)(1) \nin the Federal planning process and for the Federal land manager to be \ninvolved in land management planning conducted by the certified gateway \ncommunity.\n    (f) Grants To Assist Certified Gateway Communities.--Using funds \nappropriated or otherwise made available to a Federal land manager to \ncarry out this section, the Federal land manager may make grants to a \ncertified gateway community--\n            (1) to enable persons referred to in subsection (d)(1) to \n        participate in the Federal land use planning process;\n            (2) to enable the local government of a certified gateway \n        community to obtain professional land use planning assistance;\n            (3) to address public infrastructure impacts that are \n        identified through this process as a likely result of the \n        Federal land management decisions and for which sufficient \n        funds are not otherwise available; and\n            (4) to address other aspects of local economic development \n        that may affect land use decisions, including programs to \n        educate visitors to the Federal lands about these lands or \n        about the gateway community."
