    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterinary Workforce Expansion Act \nof 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Veterinary medicine is an integral and indispensable \n        component of the Nation's public health system. Veterinarians \n        protect human health by preventing and controlling infectious \n        diseases, ensuring the safety and security of the nation's food \n        supply, promoting healthy environments, and providing health \n        care for animals.\n            (2) Veterinarians are essential for early detection and \n        response to unusual disease events that could be linked to \n        newly emerging infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, SARS, \n        and West Nile Virus, or other biothreat agents of concern.\n            (3) There is a need to build national capacity in research \n        and training in the prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, and \n        control of newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.\n            (4) Veterinarians are uniquely qualified to address these \n        high priority public health issues because of their extensive \n        professional training in basic biomedical sciences, population \n        medicine, and broad, multi-species, comparative medical \n        approach to disease prevention and control.\n            (5) There is a shortage of veterinarians working in public \n        health practice. As used in the preceding sentence, the term \n        ``public health practice'' includes bioterrorism and emergency \n        preparedness, environmental health, food safety and food \n        security, regulatory medicine, diagnostic laboratory medicine, \n        and biomedical research.\n            (6) The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects there to be \n        28,000 job openings in the veterinary medical profession by \n        2012 due to growth and net replacements, a turnover of nearly \n        38 percent.\n            (7) The Nation's veterinary medical colleges do not have \n        the capacity to satisfy the current and future demand for \n        veterinarians and veterinary expertise that is vital to \n        maintain public health preparedness.\n\nSEC. 3. COMPETITIVE GRANTS PROGRAM.\n\n    Part E of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n294n et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                    ``Subpart 3--Veterinary Medicine\n\n``SEC. 771.
