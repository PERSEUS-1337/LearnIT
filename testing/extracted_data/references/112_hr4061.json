    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Student Right to Know Before You Go \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Every year, millions of people in the United States \n        will make the choice of whether to invest in higher education \n        or job retraining programs, but outcomes vary widely based on \n        the program of study selected, the institution selected, and \n        the maximum level of education attained.\n            (2) A person who obtains an associate degree earns, on \n        average, $1,500,000 over a lifetime, while individuals with the \n        maximum accreditation of a high school diploma can expect to \n        earn $1,300,000 over a lifetime. By comparison, individuals \n        with a baccalaureate degree earn, on average, $2,300,000 in \n        their lifetime. However, 28.2 percent of individuals with \n        associate degrees earn more than the median salary of \n        baccalaureate degree-holders. It is not just maximum level of \n        education attained, but also the earnings and employment \n        prospects associated with specific programs of study, that \n        determines the amount of an individual's earnings. Furthermore, \n        the employment and earnings projections of distinct degree and \n        certificate programs and the cost of obtaining these \n        credentials are not equal across institutions.\n            (3) On average, workers with a baccalaureate degree earn \n        more than 84 percent over their lifetime compared with those \n        who do not have a degree, and workers with an associate degree \n        earn, on average, $6,600 per year more than those with a high \n        school diploma as their highest credential.\n            (4) According to the National Center for Public Policy and \n        Higher Education report in 2008, the cost of college increased \n        439 percent from 1982 to 2007. In 2010, graduates who took out \n        loans left college with an average of more than $25,000 of \n        debt, more than double what it was 15 years ago. In 2011, \n        student debt in the United States outweighed credit card debt \n        at nearly $1,000,000,000,000.\n            (5) As of 2008, 84 percent of undergraduates had at least 1 \n        credit card, up from 76 percent in 2004. With the rising cost \n        of college tuition and expenses, students are increasingly \n        turning to private credit to supplement traditional student \n        aid; on average, students charge $2,200 towards direct \n        education expenses, with only 17 percent regularly paying off \n        their balances each month. The average student leaves college \n        with an average credit card debt of more than $4,100, up from \n        about $2,900 in 2004.\n            (6) Recent research shows that more than \\1/2\\ of student \n        loan borrowers are in deferment, forbearance, delinquency, or \n        default on their Federal student loans within 5 years of \n        leaving school.\n            (7) Greater access and transparency regarding the costs and \n        benefits of higher education are critical to better prepare \n        students, parents, and the public for the realities of college \n        and the workforce.\n            (8) Even though enrollment in colleges is on the rise, \n        corresponding graduation and completion rates have not risen. \n        At 2-year institutions of higher education, about 27 percent of \n        first-time, full-time students who enrolled in the fall of 2005 \n        completed a certificate or associate's degree within 150 \n        percent of the normal time required to complete such a degree.\n            (9) As unemployment among young adults remains elevated, \n        the economic value and employment potential of certain degrees \n        has become an increasingly important factor in selecting a \n        major. Not all academic fields have the same employment and \n        earnings potential. Labor and employment statistics show that \n        certain majors have a higher employment potential after college \n        and a higher median starting salary. Furthermore, the \n        employment and earnings outcomes for the same or similar \n        accreditation vary widely across institutions of higher \n        education.\n            (10) To enhance the public's knowledge and access to \n        improved information concerning the cost of college, financial \n        aid, prospective earnings, and post-graduation employment \n        rates, States, institutions of higher education, and other \n        stakeholders must collaborate to make these data points \n        available to prospective students, parents, and all taxpayers \n        in a new, comprehensive, and easily accessible manner.\n            (11) Such collaboration will allow for a more comprehensive \n        statistical overview of the current landscape in American \n        higher education and increase accountability and efficiency.\n            (12) Research shows that certain courses of study correlate \n        to improved earnings and employment; however, existing \n        reporting requirements make it impossible for researchers to \n        accurately analyze data at the institutional level. A State-\n        based reporting system would ensure that students, parents, \n        taxpayers, and policymakers can make informed decisions, \n        maximizing their return on investment and bringing greater \n        transparency to higher education in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
