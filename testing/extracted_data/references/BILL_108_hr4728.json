FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) After World War II, the United States and its allies \n        created a new international legal order based on respect for \n        human rights. One of its fundamental tenets was a universal \n        prohibition on torture and ill treatment.\n            (2) On June 26, 2003, the International Day in Support of \n        Victims of Torture, President George W. Bush stated, ``The \n        United States is committed to the world-wide elimination of \n        torture and we are leading this fight by example. I call on all \n        governments to join with the United States and the community of \n        law-abiding nations in prohibiting, investigating, and \n        prosecuting all acts of torture and in undertaking to prevent \n        other cruel and unusual punishment.''.\n            (3) The United States is a party to the Geneva Conventions, \n        which prohibit torture, cruel treatment, or outrages upon \n        personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading \n        treatment, during armed conflict.\n            (4) The United States is a party to 2 treaties that \n        prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n        punishment, as follows:\n                    (A) The International Covenant on Civil and \n                Political Rights, done at New York on December 16, \n                1966.\n                    (B) The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, \n                Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at \n                New York on December 10, 1984.\n            (5) The United States filed reservations to the treaties \n        described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) stating \n        that the United States considers itself bound to prevent \n        ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'' to the \n        extent that phrase means the cruel, unusual, and inhumane \n        treatment or punishment prohibited by the 5th amendment, 8th \n        amendment, or 14th amendment to the Constitution.\n            (6) Army Regulation 190-8 entitled ``Enemy Prisoners of \n        War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other \n        Detainees'' provides that ``Inhumane treatment is a serious and \n        punishable violation under international law and the Uniform \n        Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). . . . All prisoners will \n        receive humane treatment without regard to race, nationality, \n        religion, political opinion, sex, or other criteria. The \n        following acts are prohibited: murder, torture, corporal \n        punishment, mutilation, the taking of hostages, sensory \n        deprivation, collective punishments, execution without trial by \n        proper authority, and all cruel and degrading treatment. . . . \n        All persons will be respected as human beings. They will be \n        protected against all acts of violence to include rape, forced \n        prostitution, assault and theft, insults, public curiosity, \n        bodily injury, and reprisals of any kind. . . . This list is \n        not exclusive.''.\n            (7) The Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation of the \n        Department of the Army states that ``acts of violence or \n        intimidation, including physical or mental torture, threats, \n        insults, or exposure to inhumane treatment as a means of or an \n        aid to interrogation'' are ``illegal''. Such Manual defines \n        ``infliction of pain through . . . bondage (other than \n        legitimate use of restraints to prevent escape)'', ``forcing an \n        individual to stand, sit, or kneel in abnormal positions for \n        prolonged periods of time'', ``food deprivation'', and ``any \n        form of beating'' as ``physical torture'', defines ``abnormal \n        sleep deprivation'' as ``mental torture'', and prohibits the \n        use of such tactics under any circumstances.\n            (8) The Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation of the \n        Department of the Army states that ``Use of torture and other \n        illegal methods is a poor technique that yields unreliable \n        results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can \n        induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator wants \n        to hear. Revelation of use of torture by U.S. personnel will \n        bring discredit upon the U.S. and its armed forces while \n        undermining domestic and international support for the war \n        effort. It may also place U.S. and allied personnel in enemy \n        hands at a greater risk of abuse by their captors.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
