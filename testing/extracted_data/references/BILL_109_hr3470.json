FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Key child welfare laws, such as the Adoption and Safe \n        Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-89) and the John H. Chafee \n        Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-169), \n        emphasize the importance of monitoring States performances in \n        providing for the safety, permanency, stability, and well-being \n        of children in and emancipated from the foster care system via \n        measurable outcome data.\n            (2) Child welfare experts and government agents have \n        identified serious problems with current efforts to measure \n        program functioning related to children in foster care and \n        emancipated youth, including--\n                    (A) Performance measures that prohibit examining \n                children or success over time, overestimate the \n                proportion of children reunified with families, and \n                fail to consider the nature of the children (such as \n                the severity of their problems, their age, and their \n                urbanicity) served that could affect determinations of \n                a State's success;\n                    (B) The failure of the Department of Health and \n                Human Services to implement the National Youth in \n                Transition Database to monitor States' performance \n                related to youth aging out of the foster care system, \n                as mandated by the Foster Care Independence Act of \n                1999; and\n                    (C) Findings by the Government Accountability \n                Office that effective Federal oversight of the child \n                welfare system requires reliable information on States' \n                implementation efforts and that the ability of the \n                Administration of Children and Families to monitor \n                State performance continues to be hindered by an \n                absence of standard, comprehensive information within \n                and across State plans on each State's goals, services, \n                and youth outcomes as measured against baselines of \n                past achievement.\n\nSEC. 3.
