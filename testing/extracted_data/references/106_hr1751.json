    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Carrizo Plain National Conservation \nArea Act of 2000''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The public lands administered by the Bureau of Land \n        Management in the State of California within the Carrizo Plain \n        contain the last remnants of the once vast San Joaquin Valley \n        grasslands that covered a large expanse of central California.\n            (2) As a remnant ecosystem, these lands provide the best \n        remaining contiguous habitat for a number of State or federally \n        listed endangered species or threatened species, including the \n        San Joaquin kit fox, the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, the giant \n        kangaroo rat, and the San Joaquin antelope squirrel, and \n        numerous other federally or State listed or sensitive plant and \n        animal species. Many other important species of native wildlife \n        inhabit the area, such as pronghorn antelope and tule elk.\n            (3) In addition to its biological diversity, Carrizo Plain \n        contains nationally significant cultural and historical sites \n        which are very important to indigenous peoples in the area for \n        religious and traditional cultural purposes.\n            (4) The Carrizo Plain area also contains one of the best \n        and most visible exposures of the geologically unique San \n        Andreas fault, which is the boundary between the Pacific Plate \n        (on the west) which moves northward relative to the North \n        American Plate (on the east) and has and will continue to play \n        a critical role in the evolution and future of California.\n            (5) The Carrizo Plain offers unique research, interpretive, \n        and educational opportunities, and significant recreation \n        opportunities for the public.\n            (6) Since 1985, the Carrizo Plain has been cooperatively \n        managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the California \n        Department of Fish and Game, and The Nature Conservancy, each \n        of which owns a part of the Carrizo Plain and all of which work \n        closely together in a manner that makes jurisdictional \n        differences among them nearly transparent.\n            (7) A cooperative management plan has been prepared for the \n        Carrizo Plain by the Bureau of Land Management, the California \n        Department of Fish and Game, and The Nature Conservancy, with \n        full public involvement, that sets the stage for long-term \n        joint management of the area for public use and enjoyment.\n            (8) This management plan is based on the agencies' joint \n        primary mission as set forth in the plan to ``manage the \n        Carrizo Plain . . .  so indigenous species interact within a \n        dynamic and fully functioning ecosystem in perpetuity while \n        conserving unique natural and cultural resources and \n        maintaining opportunities for compatible scientific, cultural, \n        social, and recreational activities''. In this context, and \n        under the basic principles of multiple use and sustained yield, \n        other resource uses, such as livestock grazing and recreation \n        use, are allowed under the management plan in the conservation \n        area if they are managed in a manner compatible with that \n        primary mission.\n\nSEC. 3.
