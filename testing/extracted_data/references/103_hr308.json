    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Geothermal Energy Control Act of \n1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that the exploration for and the commercial \ndevelopment of geothermal energy in the United States, and the \nmarketing of any energy developed from such geothermal energy, is a \npart of the interstate commerce of the United States. The Congress \nfurther finds that geothermal energy is a national resource of the \nUnited States and that it is in the national interest for the Congress \nto control and conserve the development of this national resource.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL GEOTHERMAL ENERGY COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established a commission to be known \nas the National Geothermal Energy Commission (hereinafter in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Commission'') which shall be composed of 9 \nCommissioners who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate, one of whom shall be designated by \nthe President as Chairman and shall be the principal executive officer \nof the Commission.

PROSPECTS FOR GEOTHERMAL STEAM.\n\n    (a) Determination.--Within a year after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Commission shall determine (for all lands in the United \nStates which are not included in the geothermal leasing authority of \nsection 3 of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 1002) or any \ngeothermal development program conducted under any authority granted to \nany Secretary of a military department) all areas in which the geology, \nnearby discoveries, competitive interests, or other indicia would, in \nthe opinion of the Commission, engender a belief in people who are \nexperienced in the subject matter that the prospects for the extraction \nof geothermal steam and associated geothermal resources are good enough \nto warrant expenditures of money for that purpose. The Commission shall \ndivide all such areas into parcels of satisfactory size for the \npurposes of licensing for exploration and development under subsection \n(b).\n    (b) List of Parcels.--Immediately after the Commission divides \nareas into parcels under subsection (a), it shall publish the list of \nsuch parcels in the Federal Register. At any time after such \npublication, any person who wants to explore for geothermal steam and \nassociated geothermal resources in any such parcel shall apply to the \nCommission for a license for such exploration. The Commission shall \ngrant a license for any such parcel to the first person who applies for \na license for such parcel who the Commission determines is capable of \ncarrying out a complete exploration in such parcel for geothermal steam \nand associated geothermal resources. The Commission may refuse to grant \na license to such person if--\n            (1) such person has already been granted what the \n        Commission determines to be an excessive number of licenses \n        under this subsection in the same State as his present license \n        application, and\n            (2) there is another eligible applicant for such license \n        who has not been granted such an excessive number of licenses \n        in such State. A person may only commercially develop \n        geothermal steam and associated geothermal resources on any \n        such parcel if he has been granted a license for such parcel \n        under this subsection, and then only during the period of the \n        license's validity as determined under subsection (c).\n    (c) Term of License.--Any license granted under subsection (b) \nshall be valid for a period of 99 years. If geothermal steam and \nassociated geothermal resources are found on the parcel for which such \nlicense is granted, and if such steam and resources are developed in \ncommercial quantities within such 99-year period, such license may be \nextended at the option of the licensee for as long as such steam and \nresources are so developed. However, all extensions under the preceding \nsentence shall not exceed ninety-nine years. If such steam and \nresources are being commercially developed at the end of such ninety-\nnine-year extension, the licensee shall have a preferential right to \nrenew the lease for another ninety-nine-year period under such terms \nand conditions as the Commission may prescribe.\n    (d) Exclusive Rights.--Any license granted for a parcel under \nsubsection (b) or extended or renewed under subsection (c) shall be the \nexclusive license for such parcel as long as such license is valid.\n    (e) Termination.--Any license granted under subsection (b), \nextended or renewed under subsection (c), or transferred under section \n8 may, after a hearing on the record, be terminated by the Commission \nfor a violation of the terms of the license which the Commission may \nprescribe. However, such terms may not be inconsistent with any of the \nprovisions of this Act. Before the termination of a license under this \nsubsection, the Commission shall give the licensee an opportunity to \ncorrect such violation within a reasonable period of time. The \nCommission shall establish regulations for regranting licenses \nterminated under this subsection.\n\nSEC. 7. MARKETING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Any person who holds a license granted under \nsection 6(b) for a parcel may apply to the Commission for a license to \nmarket the geothermal steam and associated geothermal resource found in \nsuch parcel, but such steam and resource must be marketed in the same \nenergy form as such steam and resource was extracted from such parcel, \nor be marketed as water. The Commission shall grant such a license for \nmarketing for a geographic area which the Commission determines is the \nmost reasonable area to market successfully such steam and resource. \nThere shall only be one license for marketing granted under this \nsection for any geographic area.\n    (b) Validity.--Any license for marketing granted under subsection \n(a) shall be valid for as long as the person holding such license also \nholds his license for the same parcel granted under section 6(b).\n\nSEC. 8. TRANSFER OF LICENSE.\n\n    Any person granted a license under section 6 may transfer such \nlicense to another person for the commercial development of the \ngeothermal steam and associated geothermal resource which the person \ngranted such license discovered under such license. Any person granted \na license for the marketing of such steam and resource may transfer \nsuch license to another person for such marketing. However, the person \nproposing a transfer of a license under this section shall inform the \nCommission concerning the transfer within seven working days before the \ntransfer. The Commission shall approve the transfer if the transferee \nis eligible under section 9(a).\n\nSEC. 9. CITIZENSHIP; SALE OF ENERGY.\n\n    (a) Citizenship.--Any person granted a license by the Commission \nunder section 6, and any other person to whom such a license is \ntransferred under section 8, shall be a United States citizen or shall \nbe a person owned or controlled by a United States citizen.\n    (b) Sale of Energy.--If any holder of a license under this Act \nconverts any geothermal steam and associated geothermal resource \ncovered by such license to electrical or any other form of energy, he \nmay only sell such electrical or other form of energy (for transmission \nto consumers) to an existing utility company or other person which is \nlicensed, or in any other way has the authority, to transmit the \nelectricity or any other form of energy. Also, such licenseholder may \nsell such steam and resource to such an existing utility company or \nother person for conversion into electricity or any other form of \nenergy.\n\nSEC. 10. OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW.\n\n    Nothing contained in this Act shall relieve any person from the \noperation of sections 1 to 13, 14 to 19, 20, 21, 22 to 27, 41 to 46, \nand 47 to 58 of title 15 of the United States Code and sections 52 and \n53 of title 29. In the event a licensee is found by a court of \ncompetent jurisdiction, either in an original action in that court or \nin a proceeding to enforce or review the findings or orders of any \nGovernment agency having jurisdiction under the sections cited above, \nto have violated any of the provisions of such sections in the conduct \nof the licensed activity, the Commission may suspend, revoke, or take \nsuch other action as it may deem necessary with respect to any license \nissued by the Commission under the provisions of this Act.\n\nSEC. 11. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For the purposes of this Act, the term ``geothermal steam and \nassociated geothermal resources'' shall have the same meaning as such \nterm has in section 2(c) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. \n1001(c))."
