    "title": "An act to amend Section 6217 of, and to add Section 6212 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to state lands.",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Scattered along the California coastline are the remnants of many old, human-made structures including abandoned oil and gas wells, groins, jetties, piers, pilings, and seawalls.\n(b) These remnants, often covered and uncovered by tides, are the legacy of the rapid commercial development along the coastline that began just before the turn of the 20th century.\n(c) Most legacy oil and gas wells were abandoned in the early 1900s when there was little or no oversight of the abandonment and removal, if any, varied from well to well. Some legacy oil and gas wells, therefore, may seep oil into the surf zone impacting swimmers, surfers, and other recreational users, and causing environmental degradation.\n(d) The State Lands Commission has primary jurisdiction over sovereign lands along the California coastline that are held in trust for statewide public purposes, including, commerce, navigation, fishing, recreation, and open space and habitat preservation.\n(e) The State Lands Commission has long recognized the serious and perennial health concerns and safety hazards that coastal hazards and legacy oil and gas wells pose.\n(f) There is a critical need for adequate funding to inventory coastal hazards, including legacy oil and gas wells and related infrastructure, along the California coastline in order to begin determining how to remove coastal hazards and to identify and remediate leaking legacy oil and gas wells.\n(g) With adequate funding, the State Lands Commission can inventory coastal hazards, legacy oil and gas wells and other oil and gas related hazards along the California coastline, including determining GPS locations, assessing entitlement requirements, preparing preliminary engineering requirements and removal cost estimates for each hazard, and removing and remediating hazards that are a significant risk to public health and safety and the environment. Adequate funding will also enable the State Lands Commission to survey and monitor oil seepage in state waters under its jurisdiction and on tidelands, and to request studies to determine oil seepage locations, rates, environmental impacts, and mitigation measures.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 6212 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:\n6212.\n(a) Upon appropriation of moneys by the Legislature for the purposes of this section, the commission shall, within two years, administer a coastal hazard removal and remediation program to do all of the following:\n(1) Complete an in-depth inventory of legacy oil and gas wells and other coastal hazards along the California coastline, including conducting field surveys and determining high-priority hazards and legacy oil and gas wells to remediate.\n(2) Survey, study, and monitor oil seepage in state waters and tidelands under its jurisdiction to determine oil seepage locations, rates, and environmental impacts. The study information can facilitate possible mitigation measures.\n(3) Begin the process of remediating improperly abandoned legacy oil and gas wells that have a high risk of leaking oil and, with any remaining funds, remove other identified coastal hazards.\n(b) Notwithstanding Section 11005 of the Government Code and any other law requiring approval by a state officer of gifts, bequests, devises, or donations, the commission may seek and accept on behalf of the state any gift, bequest, devise, or donation whenever the gift and the terms and conditions thereof will aid in actions undertaken pursuant to subdivision (a).\n(c) In cooperation with the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources, the commission may seek to abandon legacy oil and gas wells that present a hazard to the public health and safety and the environment.\n(d) The commission shall annually report to the Legislature the activities and accomplishments of the program. The commission may include this information in the annual report it submits pursuant to Section 8618.\n(e) The commission shall prioritize its activities under this section based on available resources.\n(f) For purposes of this section the following definitions apply:\n(1) \u201cCoastal hazards\u201d are legacy oil and gas wells and human-made structures that have been orphaned, including piers, jetties, groins, seawalls, and facilities associated with past oil extraction and other operations, that pose a hazard to the public health and safety. Coastal hazards may include, but are not limited to, wood or steel piles or piling, sheet metal pilings, H piles and H beams, well casings, well caissons, railroad irons, cables, angle bars, pipes, pipelines, rip rap, and wood beams and structures.\n(2) \u201cLegacy oil and gas wells\u201d are wells drilled near shore, before current abandonment standards, where there is little or no information on the well\u2019s abandonment procedure and there is no viable company with the responsibility to reabandon the well should it start leaking or pose a threat to the environment or the public health and safety.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 6217 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n6217.\nWith the exception of revenue derived from state school lands and from sources described in Sections 6217.6, 6301.5, 6301.6, 6855, and Sections 8551 to 8558, inclusive, and Section 6404 (insofar as the proceeds are from property that has been distributed or escheated to the state in connection with unclaimed estates of deceased persons), the commission shall deposit all revenue, money, and remittances received by the commission under this division, and under Chapter 138 of the Statutes of 1964, First Extraordinary Session, in the General Fund. Out of those funds deposited in the General Fund, sufficient moneys shall be made available each fiscal year for the following purposes:\n(a) Payment of refunds, authorized by the commission, out of appropriations made for that purpose.\n(b) Payment of expenditures of the commission as provided in the annual Budget Act.\n(c) Payments to cities and counties of the amounts specified in Section 6817 for the purposes specified in that section, out of appropriations made for that purpose.\n(d) Payments to cities and counties of the amounts agreed to pursuant to Section 6875, out of appropriations made for that purpose.\n(e) (1) For the 2017\u201318 fiscal year, the sum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) shall be transferred to the Land Bank Fund and, notwithstanding Section 8610, shall be available, upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act, for the purpose of implementing the commission\u2019s coastal hazard removal and remediation program provided in Section 6212.\n(2) Commencing with the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, an amount sufficient to bring the unencumbered balance of the Land Bank Fund available for the purpose of implementing the commission\u2019s coastal hazard removal and remediation program provided in Section 6212 to five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) shall be transferred to the Land Bank Fund and, notwithstanding Section 8610, shall be available, upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act, for the purpose of implementing the commission\u2019s coastal hazard removal and remediation program provided in Section 6212."
