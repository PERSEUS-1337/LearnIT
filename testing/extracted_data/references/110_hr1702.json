    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Common Sense Budget Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of Defense's increasingly large budget \n        provides for total defense spending that is greater than that \n        of the other 192 countries in the world combined, yet--\n                    (A) the United States now ranks 42nd in the world \n                in infant mortality, behind most of the nations of \n                Western Europe and the industrialized Far East, while \n                $60,000,000,000 of the United States defense budget is \n                expended annually on weapons designed to thwart Soviet \n                Union aggression during the Cold War and other wasteful \n                programs;\n                    (B) Federal spending on elementary and secondary \n                education has fallen to less than 8 percent of the \n                proposed 2008 outlays for the Department of Defense, \n                while schools throughout the Nation are eliminating \n                programs in music, foreign language, and physical \n                education;\n                    (C) 46,000,000 individuals in the United States \n                lack health insurance during some period of any given \n                year, and half that number of individuals (over \n                9,000,000 of whom are children) lack such insurance for \n                the entire year;\n                    (D) the Government Accountability Office estimates \n                that--\n                            (i) \\1/3\\ of the Nation's public schools, \n                        serving 14,000,000 children, need extensive \n                        repair or need to have their entire physical \n                        plants replaced;\n                            (ii) 85 percent of the Nation's public \n                        schools, 73,000 facilities serving 40,000,000 \n                        children, need some repair work; and\n                            (iii) the total cost for the repairs and \n                        replacement described in this subparagraph is \n                        over $120,000,000,000;\n                    (E) research conducted by the National Center for \n                Education Statistics shows that middle school students \n                in the United States rank 9th in science test scores \n                and 15th in math test scores internationally, behind \n                students in such countries as the Republic of Korea, \n                the Slovak Republic, Singapore, the Russian Federation, \n                and Malaysia; and\n                    (F) the Government Accountability Office estimated \n                in 2003 that the Department of Defense could not \n                account for over $1,000,000,000,000 in funds \n                appropriated to the Department of Defense.\n            (2) The United States spends over $20,000,000,000 annually \n        to maintain its nuclear arsenal, although many of the weapons \n        in that arsenal no longer have practical utility. The United \n        States needs to eliminate spending on obsolete weapons systems \n        and use the funds saved to meet urgent domestic needs for \n        health care, education, job training, and increased energy \n        efficiency and conservation.\n            (3) The Department of Defense is spending billions of \n        dollars developing space weapons and preparing plans to deploy \n        them, although--\n                    (A) those expenditures and plans contravene White \n                House policy, in place for a decade, that emphasizes \n                arms control and nonproliferation pacts; and\n                    (B) the development of those weapons is opposed by \n                many United States allies, who have rightly stated that \n                a shift in policy towards that development will create \n                an arms race in space.\n            (4) The United States needs to reduce its dependence on \n        foreign oil by promoting long-term energy security through \n        greater investment in sustainable and renewable energy \n        alternatives.\n            (5) The United States is facing unprecedented challenges to \n        national security and broader national interests. Sustainable \n        development and humanitarian assistance programs should be a \n        central part of United States foreign policy. To address the \n        root causes of instability and terrorism and undercut the \n        ability of terrorist organizations to recruit effectively, the \n        United States needs to address the global challenges of \n        poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, disease, and disaster by \n        increasing funding for sustainable development and humanitarian \n        assistance programs.\n\nSEC. 3.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act takes effect 90 days after the date of enactment of this \nAct."
