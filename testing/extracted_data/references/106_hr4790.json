FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Recreational hunting is an important and traditional \n        recreational activity in which 14,000,000 Americans 16 years of \n        age and older participate.\n            (2) Hunters have been and continue to be among the foremost \n        supporters of sound wildlife management and conservation \n        practices in the United States.\n            (3) Persons who hunt and organizations related to hunting \n        provide direct assistance to wildlife managers and enforcement \n        officers of Federal, State, and local governments.\n            (4) Purchases of hunting licenses, permits, and stamps and \n        excise taxes on goods used by hunters have generated billions \n        of dollars for wildlife conservation, research, and management.\n            (5) Recreational hunting is an essential component of \n        effective wildlife management, in that it is an important tool \n        for reducing conflicts between people and wildlife and provides \n        incentives for the conservation of wildlife and habitats and \n        ecosystems on which wildlife depends.\n            (6) Each State has established at least one agency staffed \n        by professionally trained wildlife management personnel, that \n        has legal authority to manage the wildlife in the State.\n            (7) Recreational hunting is an environmentally acceptable \n        activity that occurs and can be provided for on Federal public \n        lands without adverse effects on other uses of that land and \n        water.\n\nSEC. 3.
