FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds--\n            (1) with an estimated 24,500 gangs operating within the \n        United States, gang violence and drug trafficking remain \n        serious problems throughout the country, causing injury and \n        death to innocent victims, often children;\n            (2) on November 13, 2005, a gang-related dispute broke out \n        in San Bernardino, California, and gunfire sprayed an apartment \n        building, killing 11-year old Mynisha Crenshaw and seriously \n        wounding her 14-year old sister as they ate Sunday dinner with \n        their family;\n            (3) this tragic shooting symbolizes the struggle that so \n        many communities across the United States, like San Bernardino, \n        face in combating gang violence, and serves as a reminder of \n        the nationwide problem of protecting children from senseless \n        violence;\n            (4) according to the National Drug Threat Assessment, \n        criminal street gangs are responsible for the distribution of \n        much of the cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and other illegal \n        drugs throughout the United States;\n            (5) the Federal Government has made an increased commitment \n        to the suppression of gang violence through enhanced law \n        enforcement and criminal penalties; and\n            (6) more Federal resources and coordination are needed to \n        reduce gang violence through proven and proactive prevention \n        and intervention programs that focus on keeping at-risk youth \n        in school and out of the criminal justice system.\n\nSEC. 3.
