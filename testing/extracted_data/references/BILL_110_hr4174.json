FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The oceans help regulate atmospheric chemistry by \n        acting as the largest sink for carbon dioxide.\n            (2) The rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is \n        overwhelming the natural ability of the oceans to absorb this \n        gas.\n            (3) The influx of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and \n        the subsequent absorption by the oceans is changing surface \n        ocean carbon chemistry and lowering the pH. These changes in \n        ocean chemistry are detrimental to organisms including corals, \n        which support one of the richest habitats on Earth, marine \n        shellfish, and many other organisms that form the base of the \n        food chain for many fish and marine mammals.\n            (4) The rich biodiversity of marine organisms is an \n        important contribution to the national economy and the change \n        in ocean chemistry threatens tourism, our fisheries, and marine \n        environmental quality, and could result in significant social \n        and economic costs.\n            (5) Existing Federal programs support research in related \n        ocean chemistry, but gaps in funding, coordination, and \n        outreach have impeded national progress in addressing ocean \n        acidification.\n            (6) National investment in a coordinated program of \n        research and monitoring would improve the understanding of \n        ocean acidification effects on whole ecosystems, advance our \n        knowledge of the socioeconomic impacts of increased ocean \n        acidification, and strengthen the ability of marine resource \n        managers to assess and prepare for the harmful impacts of ocean \n        acidification on our marine resources.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide for--\n            (1) development and coordination of a comprehensive \n        interagency plan to--\n                    (A) monitor and conduct research on the processes \n                and consequences of ocean acidification on marine \n                organisms and ecosystems; and\n                    (B) establish an interagency research and \n                monitoring program on ocean acidification;\n            (2) assessment and consideration of regional and national \n        ecosystem and socioeconomic impacts of increased ocean \n        acidification; and\n            (3) research on adaptation strategies and techniques for \n        effectively conserving marine ecosystems as they cope with \n        increased ocean acidification.\n\nSEC. 3.
