SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Real Solutions to \nWorld Hunger Act of 2002''.\n    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents; findings.\nSec. 2. Definitions.\nSec. 3. Ensuring safety and mitigating ecological impacts of United \n                            States exports of genetically engineered \n                            animals, plants, and seeds.\nSec. 4. Promotion of international research regarding sustainable \n                            agriculture to assist developing countries.\nSec. 5. Position of the United States in the international financial \n                            institutions regarding genetically \n                            engineered animals, plants, and seeds.\nSec. 6. Tax on biotech companies to help fund sustainable agriculture \n                            research.\n    (c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The need for mandatory labeling, safety testing, and \n        environmental reviews of genetically engineered foods do not \n        constitute obstacles to the cessation of world hunger.\n            (2) The dominant causes of world hunger are not \n        technological in nature, but rooted in basic social-economic \n        failures.\n            (3) Technologies, like genetically engineered food, may \n        have a limited role, but economics remain the significant \n        barrier to a consistent food supply, and the development of \n        expensive genetically engineered foods may only exacerbate this \n        trend.\n            (4) Most genetically engineered food products and almost \n        all research funding for the development of genetically \n        engineered food target developed nation agriculture and \n        consumers. Developing countries cannot afford this technology \n        and therefore are vastly ignored.\n            (5) Agroecological interventions have had significant \n        success in helping developing nations feed themselves with \nhigher yields and improved environmental practices, all within \nreasonable costs for developing countries.\n            (6) If the biotech industry believes they can help mitigate \n        hunger concerns, domestic or foreign, then requiring biotech \n        companies to make available the necessary resources for this \n        purpose is appropriate.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Genetically engineered animal.--The term ``genetically \n        engineered animal'' means an animal that contains a genetically \n        engineered material or was produced with a genetically \n        engineered material. An animal shall be considered to contain a \n        genetically engineered material or to have been produced with a \n        genetically engineered material if the animal has been injected \n        or otherwise treated with a genetically engineered material or \n        is the offspring of an animal that has been so injected or \n        treated.\n            (2) Genetically engineered plant.--The term ``genetically \n        engineered plant'' means a plant that contains a genetically \n        engineered material or was produced from a genetically \n        engineered seed. A plant shall be considered to contain a \n        genetically engineered material if the plant has been injected \n        or otherwise treated with a genetically engineered material \n        (except that the use of manure as a fertilizer for the plant \n        may not be construed to mean that the plant is produced with a \n        genetically engineered material).\n            (3) Genetically engineered seed.--The term ``genetically \n        engineered seed'' means a seed that contains a genetically \n        engineered material or was produced with a genetically \n        engineered material. A seed shall be considered to contain a \n        genetically engineered material or to have been produced with a \n        genetically engineered material if the seed (or the plant from \n        which the seed is derived) has been injected or otherwise \n        treated with a genetically engineered material (except that the \n        use of manure as a fertilizer for the plant may not be \n        construed to mean that any resulting seeds are produced with a \n        genetically engineered material).\n            (4) Genetically engineered material.--The term \n        ``genetically engineered material'' means material that has \n        been altered at the molecular or cellular level by means that \n        are not possible under natural conditions or processes \n        (including recombinant DNA and RNA techniques, cell fusion, \n        microencapsulation, macroencapsulation, gene deletion and \n        doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the \n        positions of genes), other than a means consisting exclusively \n        of breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro \n        fertilization or tissue culture or mutagenesis.\n            (5) Biotech company.--The term ``biotech company'' means a \n        person engaged in the business of creating genetically \n        engineered material and obtaining the patent rights to that \n        material for the purposes of commercial exploitation of that \n        material. The term does not include the employees of such \n        person.\n\nSEC. 3. ENSURING SAFETY AND MITIGATING ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF UNITED \n              STATES EXPORTS OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ANIMALS, PLANTS, \n              AND SEEDS.\n\n    It shall be unlawful for any person to ship or offer for shipment, \nor for any carrier or other person to transport or receive for \ntransportation, to any foreign country, any genetically engineered \nanimal, genetically engineered plant, or genetically engineered seed \nthat the person knows, or has reason to believe, will be used by the \nultimate purchaser to produce an agricultural commodity if--\n            (1) the genetically engineered animal, genetically \n        engineered plant, or genetically engineered seed--\n                    (A) was denied a Federal approval necessary as a \n                condition for commercial marketing in the United \n                States; or\n                    (B) was the subject of an application for such a \n                Federal approval that was withdrawn; or\n            (2) the government of the foreign country has not certified \n        that ecological impacts related to the importation of the \n        genetically engineered animal, genetically engineered plant, or \n        genetically engineered seed have been mitigated to the \n        satisfaction of the foreign government.\n\nSEC. 4. PROMOTION OF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH REGARDING SUSTAINABLE \n              AGRICULTURE TO ASSIST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.\n\n    (a) Grants for International Research.--The Secretary of \nAgriculture may make grants to designated international research \ninstitutions for the purpose of promoting the development of \nsustainable agriculture techniques that rely on minimum artificial \ninputs to meet the food and fiber needs of developing countries. \nEligible sustainable agriculture techniques may not derive any genetic \nengineered material.\n    (b) Use of Grant Funds.--A grant recipient shall use the funds \nprovided under this section only in a manner consistent with the \npurpose for which the grant is awarded.\n    (c) Designated Institutions.--The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices shall designate the international research institutions \neligible to apply for a grant under this section. The designated \ninstitutions shall include the United Nations Food and Agriculture \nOrganization and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural \nResearch.\n    (d) Competitive Basis.--Grants under this section shall be made on \na competitive basis.\n    (e) Funding Source.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall use the \nSustainable Agriculture Trust Fund, in such amounts as provided in \nadvance in appropriation Acts, to make grants under this section.\n\nSEC. 5. POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL \n              INSTITUTIONS REGARDING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ANIMALS, \n              PLANTS, AND SEEDS.\n\n    The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States \nExecutive Director at each international financial institution (as \ndefined in section 1701(c)(2) of the International Financial \nInstitutions Act) to make no effort to encourage the institution to \nprohibit any country eligible for assistance under the Heavily Indebted \nPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative of the International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development from requiring compulsory licensing with \nrespect to any genetically engineered animal, genetically engineered \nplant, or genetically engineered seed.\n\nSEC. 6.
