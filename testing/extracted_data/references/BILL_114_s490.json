FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) as of the date of enactment of this Act--\n                    (A) 113,000,000 acres of onshore Federal land are \n                open and accessible for oil and natural gas \n                development; and\n                    (B) approximately 166,000,000 acres of onshore \n                Federal land are off-limits or inaccessible for oil and \n                natural gas development;\n            (2) despite the recent oil and natural gas boom in the \n        United States, the number of acres of Federal land leased for \n        oil and natural gas exploration has decreased by 24 percent \n        since 2008;\n            (3) in 2013, the Federal Government leased only 36,000,000 \n        acres of Federal land, in contrast to the 131,000,000 acres \n        that were leased in 1984;\n            (4) the reduction in leasing of Federal land harms economic \n        growth and Federal revenues;\n            (5) in 2013, it took 197 days to process applications for \n        permits to drill on Federal land; and\n            (6) the States have extensive and sufficient regulatory \n        frameworks for permitting oil and natural gas development.\n\nSEC. 3.
