    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Unintended Pregnancy Reduction Act \nof 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Rates of unintended pregnancy in the United States \n        increased by nearly 30 percent among low-income women between \n        1994 and 2002, and a low-income woman today is 4 times as \n        likely to have an unintended pregnancy as her higher income \n        counterpart.\n            (2) Abortion rates decreased among higher income women but \n        increased among low income women between 1994 and 2002, and a \n        low income woman is more than 4 times as likely to have an \n        abortion as her higher income counterpart.\n            (3) Contraceptive use reduces a woman's probability of \n        having an abortion by 85 percent.\n            (4) Levels of contraceptive use among low-income women at \n        risk of unintended pregnancy declined significantly between \n        1994 and 2002, from 92 percent to 86 percent.\n            (5) Publicly funded contraceptive services have been shown \n        to prevent 1,300,000 unintended pregnancies each year, and in \n        the absence of these services the United States abortion rate \n        would likely be 40 percent higher than it is.\n            (6) By helping couples avoid unintended pregnancy, \n        Medicaid-funded contraceptive services are highly cost-\n        effective, and every public dollar spent on family planning \n        saves $3 in the cost of pregnancy-related care alone.\n            (7) Federal law requires State Medicaid programs to cover \n        pregnancy-related care for women with incomes up to 133 percent \n        of poverty, and 17 States have expanded this coverage to women \n        with incomes up to 200 percent of poverty.\n            (8) 18 States have expanded Medicaid coverage for family \n        planning services to the same level at which they provide \n        Medicaid funded pregnancy-related care.\n            (9) Equalizing the eligibility levels for family planning \n        and pregnancy-related care nationwide would maximize the cost-\n        savings to both the Federal and State Governments.\n            (10) A woman should have equal access to contraceptive \n        services to help prevent an unintended pregnancy and to \n        pregnancy-related care if she does become pregnant.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF COVERAGE OF FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES AND \n              SUPPLIES.\n\n    Section 1937(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396u-7(b)) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(5) Coverage of family planning services and supplies.--\n        Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this section, a \n        State may not provide for medical assistance through enrollment \n        of an individual with benchmark coverage or benchmark-\n        equivalent coverage under this section unless that coverage \n        includes family planning services and supplies as described in \n        section 1905(a)(4)(C).''.\n\nSEC. 4.
