FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) To protect the taxpayer and the Treasury, it is the \n        responsibility of the Congress to provide Federal agencies with \n        the financial resources necessary to enforce the laws of the \n        United States and to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of \n        taxpayer's dollars.\n            (2) For every $1 invested in the Department of Health and \n        Human Services and the Department of Justice for program \n        integrity efforts to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of \n        Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance \n        Program, approximately $1.55 will be saved, according to a \n        report issued by the Office of Management and Budget.\n            (3) Increased program integrity efforts by the Department \n        of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice can \n        provide an estimated savings of $4,470,000,000 on an investment \n        of $3,100,000,000 in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's \n        Health Insurance Program over the next 5 fiscal years and an \n        estimated savings of $9,870,000,000 on an investment of \n        $6,753,000,000 over the next 10 fiscal years, according to a \n        report issued by the Office of Management and Budget.\n            (4) For every $1 invested in the Social Security \n        Administration for program integrity efforts to increase the \n        volume of continuing disability reviews conducted pursuant to \n        section 221(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 421(i)) to \n        determine whether a recipient of disability insurance benefits \n        under section 223(a) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 423(a)) will \n        continue to be eligible for such benefits, approximately $10 \n        will be saved, according to a report issued by the Office of \n        Management and Budget.\n            (5) For every $1 invested in the Social Security \n        Administration for program integrity efforts to increase the \n        volume of continuing disability reviews conducted pursuant to \n        section 1631(j) of Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1383(j)) to \n        determine whether a recipient of supplemental security income \n        benefits under section 1611 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1382) will \n        continue to be eligible for such benefits, approximately $8 \n        will be saved, according to a report issued by the Office of \n        Management and Budget.\n            (6) Providing additional funding to the Social Security \n        Administration to increase the volume of continuing disability \n        reviews conducted pursuant to sections 221(i) and 1631(j) of \n        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 421(i), 1383(j), respectively) \n        can provide an estimated savings of $16,102,000,000 on an \n        investment of $3,953,000,000 over the next 5 fiscal years and \n        an estimated savings of $57,838,000,000 on an investment of \n        $10,252,000,000 over the next 10 fiscal years, according to a \n        report issued by the Office of Management and Budget.\n            (7) The tax gap, the difference between the annual amount \n        of Federal income taxes owed and the amount voluntarily paid on \n        time, places an undue burden upon the overwhelming majority of \n        taxpayers who fully and voluntarily pay their taxes on time.\n            (8) In a report released in 2009 by the Internal Revenue \n        Service, it was estimated that in 2005 (the most recent \n        estimate available) the gross tax gap was $345,000,000,000 and \n        the net tax gap (after the collection of late and enforced \n        payments) was $290,000,000,000.\n            (9) In 2009, for every $1 that was invested for the \n        purposes of enforcing the tax code, the Internal Revenue \n        Service returned an average of $4 to the Treasury, with some \n        enforcement activities returning as much as $11 for every $1 \n        invested, according to a report issued by the Office of \n        Management and Budget.\n            (10) By increasing overall tax enforcement efforts, the \n        Internal Revenue Service can provide an estimated savings of \n        $13,874,000,000 on an investment of $8,869,000,000 over the \n        next 5 fiscal years and an estimated savings of $62,217,000,000 \n        on an investment of $23,275,000,000 over the next 10 fiscal \n        years, according to a report issued by the Office of Management \n        and Budget.\n            (11) For each $1 invested to increase the volume of in-\n        person reemployment and eligibility assessments conducted by \n        States for the Department of Labor's unemployment insurance \n        program, approximately $3.19 will be saved over the next 10 \n        years, according to a report issued by the Office of Management \n        and Budget.\n            (12) States will save the Department of Labor's \n        unemployment insurance program an estimated $937,000,000 on an \n        investment of $325,000,000 by increasing the volume of in-\n        person reemployment and eligibility assessments over the next 5 \n        fiscal years and an estimated savings of $2,296,000,000 on an \n        investment of $720,000,000 over the next 10 fiscal years, \n        according to a report issued by the Office of Management and \n        Budget.\n            (13) The investments described in the preceding paragraphs, \n        if carried out, will save the taxpayers nearly $2,000,000,000 \n        during fiscal year 2011, while laying the foundations for \n        saving more than $35,000,000,000 over the next 5 fiscal years \n        and more than $132,000,000,000 over the next 10 fiscal years.\n\nSEC. 3.
