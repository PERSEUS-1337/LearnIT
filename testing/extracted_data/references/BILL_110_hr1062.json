FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The national security mission of the United States and \n        its coalition partners, having removed Saddam Hussein and his \n        regime from power, is to help establish a sovereign, free, \n        secure, and united Iraq at peace with its neighbors.\n            (2) The people of Iraq in 2005 went to the polls in great \n        numbers and in an historic democratic process elected an \n        interim government, voted on a new constitution, and elected a \n        permanent democratic government.\n            (3) Since its inception, Iraq's democratic government has \n        been under continuous attack from extremist insurgents, \n        terrorists, and, more recently, growing sectarian conflict.\n            (4) The increasing violence is now threatening Iraq's \n        government, endangering regional stability and creating the \n        opportunity for safe havens for terrorists.\n            (5) The National Intelligence Estimate for Iraq, released \n        February 2, 2007, stated: ``Coalition capabilities, including \n        force levels, resources, and operations, remain an essential \n        stabilizing element in Iraq.''. The National Intelligence \n        Estimate for Iraq stated further that if Coalition forces were \n        to withdraw rapidly, the intelligence community judges that \n        neighboring countries--invited by Iraqi factions or \n        unilaterally--might intervene openly in the conflict.\n            (6) There is evidence that the sectarian violence is \n        pulling in neighboring countries, with United States and \n        coalition commanders in Iraq, intelligence sources, and the \n        Iraq Study Group all affirming that Syria and Iran are actively \n        supporting efforts to undermine stability in Iraq, with \n        reporting attesting that Iran has provided arms, financial \n        support, and training for militias within Iraq and may be \n        supplying improvised explosive devices to groups that attack \n        United States forces.\n            (7) Israeli Prime Minister Olmert underscored the regional \n        consequences of a United States withdrawal from Iraq in a \n        December 11, 2006, interview with the Washington Post and \n        Newsweek saying: ``If there is a premature pullout before Iraq \n        has a robust government with a strong authority that can keep \n        the country from collapsing into an internal civil war, America \n        will have to think about the possible ramifications on \n        neighbouring Arab countries with moderate governments. . . . \n        How will it affect the stability of these countries against the \n        radical forces that might flourish as a result of a premature \n        pullout of America?''.\n            (8) Ayman al-Zawahiri has repeatedly stated the need to \n        extend the jihad beyond Iraq and wrote in an October 2005 \n        letter to the late al-Qaeda leader al-Zarqawi, that the \n        Islamist militant extremists ``must not have their mission end \n        with the expulsion of the Americans from Iraq, and then lay \n        down their weapons. . . . Instead, their ongoing mission is to \n        establish an Islamic state, and defend it, and for every \n        generation to hand over the banner to the one after it . . .''.\n            (9) This commitment to imposing militant extremist Islam \n        throughout the world was recently echoed by Iranian leader \n        Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was quoted as saying on January 5, \n        2007: ``We don't shy away from declaring that Islam is ready to \n        rule the world. . . . We must prepare ourselves to rule the \n        world.''.\n            (10) The failure to secure Iraq would threaten America's \n        vital national security interests, in a strategically important \n        region in the world, and our homeland security interests.\n            (11) Recognizing the investment of troops and resources had \n        outpaced results in Iraq, the President and a congressionally-\n        established commission, the Iraq Study Group, conducted \n        reappraisals of our policies and strategies in Iraq.\n            (12) The President outlined a new strategy on January 10, \n        2007, to immediately further United States national security \n        priorities, to provide greater security for the Iraqi \n        population, and to accelerate progress on essential political, \n        social, and economic reforms necessary to the long-term \n        stability of the central government and the country.\n            (13) On January 26, 2007, the United States Senate \n        unanimously confirmed General David H. Petraeus as the new \n        commander of United States and allied forces in Iraq. During \n        his confirmation hearings, General Petraeus addressed the \n        negative consequences a premature withdrawal would have on \n        United States interests and regional stability, as well as the \n        positive encouragement a congressionally-passed resolution of \n        disapproval regarding the new strategy would have on United \n        States enemies operating in Iraq.\n            (14) In addition, General Petraeus, as he himself has \n        stated, cannot accomplish his new mission without the \n        deployment of the additional troops, which would reinforce \n        United States and allied forces. It is not in the best national \n        security interests of the United States to support unanimously \n        a new commanding general given his mission and then deny him \n        the resources to be successful in that mission.\n            (15) Despite policy disagreements, all Members of Congress \n        support the members of the United States Armed Forces, who have \n        served honorably in their mission to fight terrorism and to \n        protect the security of the United States.\n            (16) The members of the Armed Forces and their families \n        have made sacrifices, in many cases the ultimate sacrifice, to \n        protect the security of the United States and the freedom of \n        its citizens.\n            (17) Failure to fully provide resources to military forces \n        deployed in support of operations in Iraq will negatively \n        impact our troops' morale and result in increasing casualties \n        and make the mission to secure Iraq impossible.\n\nSEC. 3.
