FINDINGS.\n\n        The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One of the primary duties of government is to protect \n        its citizens from armed violent criminals. America's cherished \n        liberty and the social and economic prosperity of its \n        communities are dependent upon government's ability to maintain \n        public safety.\n            (2) Criminals, by definition, operate outside the law and \n        routinely acquire firearms when they so desire. Banning \n        specific types of firearms has no effect on the moral behavior \n        of those who choose to inflict harm on innocent citizens.\n            (3) The most effective way to protect the public from gun-\n        wielding violent criminals is to arrest, convict, and \n        incarcerate such predators, and to ensure that they serve \n        sentences of sufficient length to prevent them from returning \n        quickly to the streets.\n\nSEC. 3. ARMED VIOLENT CRIMINAL APPREHENSION DIRECTIVE.\n\n        (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Attorney General of the United States shall \nestablish an armed violent criminal apprehension program consistent \nwith the following requirements:\n            (1) Each United States attorney shall designate at least 1 \n        assistant United States attorney to prosecute armed violent \n        criminals.\n            (2) Each United States attorney shall establish an armed \n        violent criminal apprehension task force comprised of \n        appropriate law enforcement representatives. The task force \n        shall develop strategies for removing armed violent criminals \n        from the streets, taking into consideration--\n                    (A) the importance of severe punishment in \n                deterring armed violent crime;\n                    (B) the effectiveness of Federal and State laws \n                pertaining to apprehension and prosecution of armed \n                violent criminals;\n                    (C) the resources available to each law enforcement \n                agency participating in the task force;\n                    (D) the nature and extent of the violent crime \n                occurring in the district for which the United States \n                attorney is appointed; and\n                    (E) the principle of limited Federal involvement in \n                the prosecution of crimes traditionally prosecuted in \n                State and local jurisdictions.\n            (3) Not less frequently than monthly, the Attorney General \n        shall require each United States attorney to report to the \n        Department of Justice the number of defendants charged with, or \n        convicted of, violating section 922(g) or 924 of title 18, \n        United States Code, in the district for which the United States \n        attorney is appointed.\n            (4) Not less frequently than twice annually, the Attorney \n        General shall submit to the Congress a compilation of the \n        information received by the Department of Justice pursuant to \n        paragraph (3) and a report on all waivers granted under \n        subsection (b).\n        (b) Waiver Authority.--\n            (1) Request for waiver.--A United States attorney may \n        request the Attorney General to waive the requirements of \n        subsection (a) with respect to the United States attorney.\n            (2) Provision of waiver.--The Attorney General may waive \n        the requirements of subsection (a) pursuant to a request made \n        under paragraph (1), in accordance with guidelines which shall \n        be established by the Attorney General.
