FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Report and Recommendations of the Westchester \n        County, New York, January ``B'' 2004 Grand Jury, entitled \n        ``Returning Abused Children to their Abusers: How Westchester \n        County's Child Protective System Fails the Children it Most \n        Needs to Protect'', identified 3 essential principles that \n        should guide child services programs, namely, maintaining that \n        the best interest of the child is paramount, ensuring \n        continuity in case supervision with all relevant parties \n        involved and all relevant information shared, and assigning \n        special priority to the identification of high-risk cases.\n            (2) Such report also observed that, because there is no \n        direct way for the State of New York to report an individual's \n        history of child abuse to another State, and a child may be \n        placed at greater risk if an offender with an established \n        history of child abuse moves to a State where his or her \n        history is unknown, a national central register of cases of \n        child abuse or neglect must be created.\n            (3) 896,000 children were determined to be victims of child \n        abuse or neglect in 2002.\n            (4) The rate of victimization per 1,000 children in the \n        national population has dropped from 13.4 children in 1990 to \n        12.3 children in 2002.\n            (5) 1,400 children died due to child abuse or neglect in \n        2002.\n            (6) A 2002 Department of Health and Human Services child \n        and family services review suggests that difficulties States \n        experience in preventing maltreatment recurrence may be due to \n        inadequate identification of abusers.\n            (7) When an individual is convicted of a crime in New York, \n        police in California know and are able to identify the \n        violator. Child abusers should be as easily identifiable for \n        State and local child protective services.\n            (8) Many States currently maintain a child maltreatment \n        registry that collects information about maltreated children \n        and individuals who were found to have abused or neglected \n        children, in order to protect children from contact with \n        individuals who may mistreat them.\n            (9) Some States that maintain such registries are \n        explicitly prohibited under State law from sharing this \n        important data with other States.\n\nSEC. 2.
