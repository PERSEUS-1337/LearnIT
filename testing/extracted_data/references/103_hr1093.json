FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States faces an unprecedented crisis arising \n        from the rapid decline of affordable housing,\n            (2) new construction of housing for low- and moderate-\n        income families is at a virtual standstill,\n            (3) according to a 1989 report of the Bureau of the Census, \n        the Nation's housing stock occupied by persons living in \n        poverty is 12.4 million units, of which 2.2 million units (or \n        18 percent) are substandard,\n            (4) by 1995, as many as 900,000 federally subsidized low-\n        income rental housing units could be lost as a result of the \n        prepayment of federally subsidized mortgages,\n            (5) scores of existing low-income housing units will \n        continue to disappear as older buildings are destroyed and in \n        their place are constructed higher priced rental units and \n        condominiums, creating an even greater shortage of affordable \n        housing,\n            (6) Federal expenditures to meet the housing needs of low- \n        and moderate-income persons declined 70 percent from \n        $30,200,000,000 billion in fiscal year 1981 to $7,500,000,000 \n        billion in fiscal year 1989, and such expenditures were \n        increased only to $8,900,000,000 billion in fiscal year 1990 \n        and to $9,500,000,000 billion in fiscal year 1991,\n            (7) an increasing number of Americans face the possibility \n        of homelessness unless existing low-income housing units are \n        rehabilitated and new housing units are constructed,\n            (8) the rising number of ill-housed and homeless families \n        is partially caused by displacement due to the rehabilitation \n        and gentrification of formerly low-income housing, and\n            (9) owners of substandard low-income housing units continue \n        to claim Federal tax deductions without making the necessary \n        repairs or renovations to bring their low-income housing \n        property up to State or local building codes.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to encourage the development of affordable, decent, \n        safe, and sanitary housing for low- and moderate-income \n        families,\n            (2) to rehabilitate and construct low-income rental housing \n        units by providing investment incentives to private developers \n        through a shortening of the depreciation recovery period on \n        low-income rental property to 20 years,\n            (3) to deny business-related tax deductions claimed by \n        owners of low-income rental housing units who consistently \n        violate State and local health, safety, and building codes by \n        maintaining substandard rental housing units, and\n            (4) to exempt from the passive loss limitation certain \n        deductions relating to low-income housing.\n\nSEC. 3.
