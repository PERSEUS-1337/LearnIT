FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Each year 3,400,000 pregnancies, or one-half of all \n        pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and 4 in 10 \n        of these unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n            (2) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency \n        contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended \n        pregnancy for women of reproductive potential and has approved \n        certain forms of emergency contraceptive for unrestricted sale \n        on pharmacy shelves to women of all ages.\n            (3) Research indicates that emergency contraception reduces \n        the risk of pregnancy by up to 95 percent and emergency IUD \n        insertion reduces the risk by 99 percent. Although more \n        effective the sooner it is taken, medical evidence indicates \n        that emergency contraception can be effective up to 5 days \n        after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure.\n            (4) Emergency contraception is a responsible means of \n        preventing pregnancy that works like other hormonal \n        contraceptives by suppressing or delaying ovulation, which \n        makes fertilization from unprotected intercourse unlikely if \n        the medication is taken within 120 hours. Emergency \n        contraception does not terminate an established pregnancy.\n            (5) Most brands of emergency contraception consist of the \n        same hormones found in other hormonal birth control.\n            (6) The percentage of sexually experienced women aged 15 to \n        44 in the United States who have ever used emergency \n        contraception increased from 4.2 percent in 2002 to 11 percent \n        in years 2006 through 2010.\n            (7) A recent study by the Guttmacher Institute demonstrates \n        that the rate of teen pregnancy in the United States has \n        reached a historic low, declining 51 percent since its peak in \n        1990. From 2008 to 2010, increasing proportions of women aged \n        18 and 19 reported becoming sexually active, yet fewer of them \n        got pregnant during this time period than in previous studies. \n        Research suggests that increasing rates of contraceptive use \n        may be associated with the decline in teen pregnancy.\n            (8) Despite an increase in use, significant disparities \n        exist for young, urban, minority women who lack general \n        knowledge about emergency contraception. In fact, 1 in 4 teens \n        remain completely unaware of the method and its use.\n            (9) Although the American College of Obstetricians and \n        Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that doctors routinely discuss \n        emergency contraception with women of reproductive age during \n        their clinical visits only half of obstetricians/gynecologists \n        offer emergency contraception to all of their patients in need \n        suggesting that greater provider and patient awareness and \n        education is needed.\n            (10) Nearly 1 out of 5 American women is a victim of rape. \n        It is estimated that 25,000 to 32,000 women become pregnant \n        each year as a result of rape, half of whom choose to terminate \n        their pregnancy. The risk of pregnancy after sexual assault has \n        been estimated to be 4.7 percent in adult survivors who were \n        not protected by some form of contraception at the time of the \n        attack. If used correctly, emergency contraception could help \n        many of these rape survivors avoid the additional trauma of \n        facing an unintended pregnancy.\n            (11) Only 18 States and the District of Columbia require \n        hospital emergency rooms to provide emergency contraception-\n        related services to survivors of sexual assault. Of those, only \n        13 States and the District of Columbia require hospital \n        emergency rooms to provide emergency contraception upon request \n        to survivors of sexual assault. Nine States have adopted \n        restrictions on emergency contraception, and six States \n        explicitly allow pharmacists to refuse to dispense emergency \n        contraception.\n            (12) In light of their safety and efficacy, the American \n        Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American \n        Women's Medical Association, Society for Adolescent Medicine, \n        and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n        have endorsed more widespread availability of emergency \n        contraceptives.\n            (13) Healthy People 2020, published by the Office of \n        Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP), establishes a \n        10-year national public health goal of increasing the \n        proportion of publicly funded health care providers who provide \n        emergency contraception to their patients, and reducing the \n        number of unintended pregnancies by 10 percent.\n            (14) Public awareness campaigns targeting women and health \n        care providers will help remove many of the barriers to \n        emergency contraception and will help bring this important \n        means of pregnancy prevention to women in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
