CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the people of the United States will find it \n        increasingly difficult to pay for their medical care if the \n        cost of such care continues to increase;\n            (2) in 1988, an estimated 37,000,000 individuals in the \n        United States lacked health insurance and another 50,000,000 \n        were underinsured, leading to high levels of uncompensated \n        medical care;\n            (3) there exists a tremendous need in the United States for \n        access to basic medical care services;\n            (4) as the average age of individuals in the United States \n        increases, there will be a growing demand for health care;\n            (5) in 1988, the average cost of a stay of 1 year in a \n        long-term health care facility was $25,000;\n            (6) adequate long-term health care insurance is \n        unavailable;\n            (7) the medical care system of the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs is not adequate to deal with the health care needs of \n        American veterans;\n            (8) 11 percent of the gross national product of the United \n        States is made up of spending for medical care;\n            (9) medical malpractice tort reform is necessary because \n        the high cost of malpractice insurance inflates medical costs;\n            (10) there is a shortage of prenatal, infant delivery, and \n        well-baby care services in the United States even though it has \n        been proven that such services reduce medical costs over the \n        long term;\n            (11) a large percentage of health care expenditures are \n        made for extraordinary medical procedures performed near the \n        end of individuals' lives rather than for preventative measures \n        early in their lives;\n            (12) Federal income tax incentives for employer-paid group \n        health insurance need to be improved;\n            (13) businesses that offer only self-insured health care \n        coverage for their employees need to have such coverage \n        regulated to guarantee adequate coverage, as such coverage is \n        the fastest growing segment of health care insurance;\n            (14) concern exists regarding the continued solvency of the \n        medicare system with physicians becoming reluctant to \n        participate because Federal payment rates are too low; and\n            (15) health care in many rural areas is inadequate and some \n        rural hospitals are closing.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``Health Care \nCrisis Policy Commission'' (in this Act referred to as the \n``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.
