BLACK CARBON.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Black carbon is a particulate pollutant that \n        contributes significantly to warming of the Earth's climate \n        system by absorbing radiation, converting it into heat, and \n        releasing heat energy into the atmosphere. The atmospheric \n        residence of black carbon is usually less than 2 weeks, making \n        this pollutant an important candidate for policy action to \n        immediately mitigate global warming, including the threat of \n        abrupt climate change.\n            (2) Black carbon has a particularly detrimental impact on \n        snow and ice-covered surfaces, such as the Arctic and the \n        Tibetan Plateau, by reducing surface reflectivity and \n        accelerating melting.\n            (3) Black carbon is a component of particulate matter \n        regulated under the Clean Air Act, however it is not explicitly \n        regulated as a global warming agent under United States law or \n        by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or \n        other international instruments.\n            (4) Through existing clean air programs, the United States \n        has substantially reduced black carbon emissions, but more can \n        be done.\n            (5) Internationally, governments should help spur \n        technological innovation and energy technology deployment in \n        countries where major black carbon emissions still occur \n        through industrial activities, vehicle emissions, agriculture \n        and forestry practices, and residential cooking and heating.\n            (6) Human exposure to black carbon is a serious threat to \n        public health in both developed and developing countries. \n        Actions to reduce exposure to black carbon will produce \n        immediate and significant public health benefits.\n            (7) Taking immediate cost-effective and technologically \n        feasible action to significantly reduce black carbon emissions \n        will help protect the Arctic and other areas that are \n        imminently threatened by warming.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to immediately take action to reduce black carbon \n        emissions;\n            (2) to identify cost-effective ways to achieve additional \n        reductions of domestic and international black carbon \n        emissions;\n            (3) to achieve the public health and environmental benefits \n        of reduced black carbon emissions, including contributing to a \n        reduction in the rate of global warming; and\n            (4) to take action to protect areas particularly affected \n        by black carbon emissions, such as the Arctic.\n    (c) Definitions.--As used in this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of \n        the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) The term ``black carbon'' means the light-absorbing \n        component of carbonaceous aerosols.\n    (d) Black Carbon Abatement Report.--Not later than one year after \nthe date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall, in \nconsultation with other appropriate Federal agencies, submit to \nCongress a report regarding black carbon emissions. The report shall \ninclude the following:\n            (1) A summary of the current research that identifies--\n                    (A) an inventory of the major sources of black \n                carbon emissions in the United States and throughout \n                the world, including--\n                            (i) an estimate of the quantity of current \n                        and projected future emissions; and\n                            (ii) the net climate forcing of the \n                        emissions from such sources, including \n                        consideration of co-emissions of other \n                        pollutants;\n                    (B) effective and cost-effective control \n                technologies, operations, and strategies for additional \n                domestic and international black carbon emissions \n                reductions, such as diesel retrofit technologies on \n                existing on-road and off-road engines and programs to \n                address residential cookstoves, forest burning, and \n                other agriculture-based burning;\n                    (C) potential metrics quantifying the climatic \n                effects of black carbon emissions, including its \n                radiative forcing and warming effects, that may be used \n                to compare the climate benefits of different mitigation \n                strategies, including an assessment of the uncertainty \n                in such metrics; and\n                    (D) the public health and environmental benefits \n                associated with additional controls for black carbon \n                emissions.\n            (2) Recommendations regarding--\n                    (A) development of additional emissions monitoring \n                techniques and capabilities, modeling, and other black \n                carbon-related areas of study;\n                    (B) areas of focus for additional study of \n                technologies, operations, and strategies with the \n                greatest potential to reduce emissions of black carbon; \n                and\n                    (C) actions, in addition to those identified by the \n                Administrator pursuant to subsections (e) and (f), the \n                Federal Government may take to encourage or require \n                reductions in black carbon emissions.\n    (e) Domestic Black Carbon Mitigation.--Not later than one year \nafter the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator, taking into \nconsideration the public health and environmental impacts of black \ncarbon emissions, including the effects on global warming, the Arctic, \nand other snow and ice-covered surfaces, shall propose regulations \nunder the existing authorities of the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions \nof black carbon or propose a finding that existing regulations \npromulgated pursuant to such Act adequately regulate black carbon \nemissions.
