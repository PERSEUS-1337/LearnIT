FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) California has experienced devastating wildfires that \n        have caused mudslides, burned public and private lands, \n        destroyed and damaged structures and homes, and taken the lives \n        of residents and first responders.\n            (2) On August 30, 2009, Fire Captain Tedmund ``Ted'' Hall, \n        47, and Firefighter Specialist Arnaldo ``Arnie'' Quinones, 34, \n        of the Los Angeles County Fire Department lost their lives \n        while battling the Station Fire.\n            (3) Coordination among Federal, State, and local agencies \n        is essential to effectively respond to emergencies and prevent \n        further loss of life from incidents in and around the Angeles \n        and San Bernardino National Forests.\n            (4) The Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests are \n        among the most widely visited national forests in the Nation.\n            (5) The Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests provide \n        families with a variety of recreational opportunities, \n        including hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, boating, swimming, \n        off-highway vehicle use, skiing and snowboarding, horseback \n        riding, camping, and picnicking.\n            (6) The Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests account \n        for approximately 70 percent of the open space and provide 35 \n        percent of the drinking water in Los Angeles County, the most \n        populous county in the Nation.\n            (7) Several private land holdings and cabin communities are \n        located within the Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests.\n            (8) The Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests are \n        also home to several rare and endangered plant and animal \n        species.\n            (9) Public safety, preserving recreational activities, and \n        the protection of our natural resources must remain the top \n        three priorities for these areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
