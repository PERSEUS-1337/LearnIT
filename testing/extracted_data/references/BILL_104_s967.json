FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Ia Drang Valley (Pleiku) campaign, carried out by \n        the Armed Forces of the United States in the Ia Drang Valley of \n        Vietnam from October 23, 1965, to November 26, 1965, pitted \n        forces of the United States Army against North Vietnamese Army \n        regulars in vicious battles in which many United States \n        soldiers displayed extraordinary heroism, sacrifice, and \n        bravery which has not yet been officially recognized through \n        award of appropriate decorations.\n            (2) One of those battles, a running 4-day battle fought \n        from November 14 to November 18, 1965, encompassed the first \n        battalion-sized Army engagement with North Vietnamese Army \n        regulars.\n            (3) The soldiers of the United States Army units engaged in \n        the battle encountered and fought valiantly against an \n        overwhelming force of more than 2,000 North Vietnamese Army \n        regulars for an extended period under notably difficult \n        conditions.\n            (4) Historical literature published in the early 1990s \n        authoritatively documents repeated acts of extraordinary \n        heroism, sacrifice, and bravery on the part of many of the \n        United States Army soldiers who were engaged in the battles of \n        the Ia Drang Valley (Pleiku) campaign, many of whom have never \n        been officially recognized for those acts.\n            (5) United States Army units involved in combat in the Ia \n        Drang Valley (Pleiku) campaign suffered substantial losses, \n        including casualties in excess of 90 percent of strength in the \n        case of some companies.\n            (6) The incidence of heavy casualties throughout the \n        campaign has inhibited the timely collection of comprehensive \n        and detailed information to support recommendations for awards \n        for the acts of heroism, sacrifice, and bravery performed in \n        the Ia Drang Valley (Pleiku) campaign engagements.\n            (7) Requests to the Secretary of the Army for review of \n        award recommendations for those acts have been denied because \n        of restrictions in law and Army regulations that relate to \n        timely filing of recommendations and requirements for \n        documented justification.\n            (8) Acts of heroism, sacrifice, and bravery performed in \n        combat by members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n        deserve appropriate and timely recognition by the people of the \n        United States.\n            (9) It is inappropriate for United States policy to \n        restrict recognition of military personnel for acts of \n        extraordinary heroism, sacrifice, or bravery that are \n        belatedly, but properly, documented by persons who witnessed \n        those acts.\n\nSEC. 2.
