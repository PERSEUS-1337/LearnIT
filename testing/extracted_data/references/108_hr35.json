    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n     This Act may be cited as the ``Family and Medical Leave \nClarification Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (hereinafter \n        referred to as the ``Act'') is not working as the Congress \n        intended when it passed the Act in 1993. Many employers, \n        including those employers that are nationally recognized as \n        having generous family-friendly benefit and leave programs, are \n        experiencing serious problems complying with the Act.\n            (2) The Secretary of Labor's overly broad regulations and \n        interpretations have caused many of these problems by greatly \n        expanding the Act's coverage to apply to many nonserious health \n        conditions.\n            (3) Between 1996 and 2002, six congressional hearings--two \n        in the Senate and four in the House of Representatives--\n        documented numerous implementation problems with the Act due to \n        the Department of Labor's misapplication of the Act through \n        some of its regulations and interpretations.\n            (4) Documented problems generated by the Act include \n        significant new administrative and personnel costs, loss of \n        productivity, scheduling difficulties, unnecessary paperwork \n        and recordkeeping, and other compliance problems.\n            (5) The Act often conflicts with employers' paid sick leave \n        policies, prevents employers from managing absences through \n        their absence control plans, and results in most leave under \n        the Act becoming paid leave.\n            (6) Administrative problems associated with the use of \n        intermittent leave under the Act are a well-documented issue. \n        Approximately three-quarters (76 percent) of respondents to a \n        2000 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management said \n        they would find compliance easier if the Department of Labor \n        allowed covered leave to be offered and tracked in half-day \n        increments rather than minutes.\n            (7) In 1996, the Commission on Leave, established by title \n        III of the Act (29 U.S.C. 2631 et seq.), reported few \n        compliance difficulties with the Act, but the Commission only \n        based its findings on leave taken between January 1994 and June \n        1995. Only after the final regulations became effective in \n        early 1995, and after the issuance of contradictory \n        interpretations of what constitutes a serious health condition, \n        did employers begin to encounter most compliance difficulties. \n        As a result, the Commission report failed to identify many \n        compliance problems, because the findings were primarily based \n        on leave taken before the final regulations became effective.\n            (8) A more recent Department of Labor survey, released in \n        January 2001 as an update requested by Congress to the 1996 \n        Commission on Leave report, found that between 1995 and 2000, \n        there had been a 21.5 percent decline in the share of covered \n        establishments reporting that it was somewhat easy or very easy \n        to comply with the Act.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION.\n\n     Section 101(11) of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 \nU.S.C. 2611(11)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n        (i) and (ii), respectively;\n            (2) by inserting ``(A)'' before ``The term'';\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(B) Such term includes an illness, injury, \n                impairment, or physical or mental condition that \n                involves care or treatment described in subparagraph \n                (a), such as a heart attack, a heart condition \n                requiring heart bypass or valve operations, a back \n                condition requiring extensive therapy or a surgical \n                procedure, a stroke, a severe respiratory condition, a \n                spinal injury, appendicitis, pneumonia, emphysema, \n                severe arthritis, a severe nervous disorder, an injury \n                caused by a serious accident on or off the job, an \n                ongoing pregnancy, a miscarriage, and a complication or \n                illness related to pregnancy (such as severe morning \n                sickness, a need for prenatal care, childbirth, and \n                recovery from childbirth); and\n                    ``(C) Such term does not include a short-term \n                illness, injury, impairment, or condition for which \n                treatment and recovery are very brief.''.\n\nSEC. 4. INTERMITTENT LEAVE.\n\n     Section 102(b)(1) of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 \nU.S.C. 2612(b)(1)) is amended by inserting before the period at the end \nof the second sentence the following: ``, as certified under section \n103 by the health care provider after each leave occurrence. An \nemployer may require an employee to take intermittent leave in \nincrements of up to half a workday. An employer may require an employee \nwho travels as part of the normal day-to-day work or duty assignment of \nthe employee and who requests intermittent leave or leave on a reduced \nschedule to take leave for the duration of that work or assignment if \nthe employer cannot reasonably accommodate the employee's request''.\n\nSEC. 5. REQUEST FOR LEAVE.\n\n     Section 102(e) of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 \nU.S.C. 2612(e)) is amended by inserting after paragraph (2) the \nfollowing:\n            ``(3) Request for leave.--If an employer does not exercise, \n        under subsection (d)(2), the right to require an employee to \n        substitute other employer-provided leave for leave under this \n        title, the employer may require the employee who wants leave \n        under this title to request the leave in a timely manner. if an \n        employer requires a timely request under this paragraph, an \n        employee who fails to make a timely request may be denied leave \n        under this title. For purposes of this paragraph, a request for \n        leave shall be considered timely if--\n                    ``(A) in the case of foreseeable leave, the \n                employee--\n                            ``(i) provides the applicable advance \n                        notice required by paragraphs (1) and (2); and\n                            ``(ii) submits any written application \n                        required by the employer for the leave not \n                        later than 5 working days after providing the \n                        notice to the employer; and\n                    ``(B) in the case of unforeseeable leave, the \n                employee--\n                            ``(i) notifies the employer orally of the \n                        need for the leave--\n                                    ``(I) not later than the date the \n                                leave commences; or\n                                    ``(II) during such additional \n                                period as may be necessary, if the \n                                employer is physically or mentally \n                                incapable of providing the \n                                notification; and\n                            ``(ii) submits any written application \n                        required by the employer for the leave--\n                                    ``(I) not later than 5 working days \n                                after providing the notice to the \n                                employer; or\n                                    ``(II) during such additional \n                                period as may be necessary, if the \n                                employee is physically or mentally \n                                incapable of submitting the \n                                application.''.\n\nSEC. 6.
