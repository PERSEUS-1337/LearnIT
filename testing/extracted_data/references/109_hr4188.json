    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Focus on Family Health Worldwide Act \nof 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since 1965, the people and Government of the United \n        States have supported international voluntary family planning \n        programs, increasing the use of modern contraceptives in the \n        developing world from fewer than 10 percent of couples in 1965 \n        to more than 40 percent of couples today.\n            (2) United States funding for international family planning \n        is today providing services to 20 million couples in the \n        world's poorest countries, contributing to family well-being by \n        improving maternal health, reducing maternal and infant deaths, \n        preventing abortions, and improving the lives of millions of \n        families.\n            (3) The United States spends on average three cents per \n        American per week for international family planning programs.\n            (4) In the developing world, the use of modern \n        contraceptives reduces unintended pregnancies and the \n        probability that a woman will have an abortion by 85 percent.\n            (5) President George W. Bush has stated that one of the \n        best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary \n        family planning programs.\n            (6) In developing countries at least 120 million married \n        couples who would like to postpone their next pregnancy, or \n        have no more children, do not have access to or are not using \n        modern contraception.\n            (7) In sub-Saharan Africa, 46 percent of women who desire \n        to delay or end childbearing remain without access to voluntary \n        family planning and at risk of unintended pregnancy.\n            (8) Each year more than 525,000 women die from causes \n        related to pregnancy and childbirth with 99 percent of these \n        deaths occurring in developing countries. An additional eight \n        million women each year suffer serious health complications \n        from pregnancy and childbirth.\n            (9) A lack of birth spacing resulting in birth intervals of \n        9 to 14 months increases the risk of maternal death by 250 \n        percent.\n            (10) Birth spacing of at least 36 months is associated with \n        the lowest mortality risk for infants and children under five \n        years of age.\n            (11) Approximately 10.8 million children under the age of \n        five die each year, more than 30,000 every day, frequently from \n        low birth-weight or from causes related to complications in the \n        mother's pregnancy.\n            (12) Providing access to modern contraception in less \n        developed countries could prevent 1.4 million infant deaths and \n        142,000 maternal deaths annually.\n            (13) Linking family planning programs with HIV/AIDS \n        prevention, care, and treatment programs helps to meet the \n        multiple health needs of couples while effectively using scarce \n        financial and human resources.\n            (14) For HIV-positive women, family planning is the most \n        efficacious and cost-effective intervention to prevent \n        unintended pregnancies, decrease the risk of maternal death, \n        and avoid the transmission of HIV from mother-to-child, \n        premature birth, low birth weight, or infant death.\n            (15) Rapid population growth over-stresses vital resources, \n        such as water, agricultural land, forests, and wildlife, \n        contributing to extreme poverty, infectious disease, limited \n        access to education, environmental destruction, food \n        insecurity, and resultant malnutrition.\n            (16) Malnutrition in children is a contributing factor to \n        more than one-half of all child mortality, and malnutrition in \n        mothers account for a substantial proportion of neonatal \n        mortality.\n            (17) United States-funded family planning programs have \n        been successfully linked with the conservation of natural \n        resources to ease growing population pressures, improve food \n        security, and keep families healthy and communities \n        economically viable.\n            (18) Between 2005 and 2050, if family planning needs remain \n        unmet, the population is expected to grow by more than 300 \n        percent in the developing countries of Afghanistan, Burkina \n        Faso, Burundi, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \n        Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, the \n        Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, and Uganda.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that it should be a United States \npolicy objective to--\n            (1) partner with developing countries to expand access to \n        voluntary family planning programs and the supply of modern \n        contraceptives in order to--\n                    (A) meet growing demand to allow couples to achieve \n                their desired family size;\n                    (B) reduce maternal and child mortality;\n                    (C) reduce unintended pregnancies and resulting \n                abortions;\n                    (D) reduce the incidence of HIV transmission from \n                mother-to-child and extend the lives of HIV-positive \n                women thus reducing the number of orphaned children;\n                    (E) conserve vital natural resources, including \n                water, agricultural land, and forested lands;\n                    (F) improve food security; and\n                    (G) enhance opportunities for lasting social and \n                economic development; and\n            (2) strengthen public heath initiatives worldwide by \n        provide training, research, and services for a wide variety of \n        modern contraceptives and family planning methods that are \n        designed and implemented based on--\n                    (A) community participation;\n                    (B) the needs and values of beneficiaries; and\n                    (C) adherence to the principles of voluntary \n                participation and informed consent.\n\nSEC. 4.
