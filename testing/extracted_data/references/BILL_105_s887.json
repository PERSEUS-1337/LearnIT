FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Underground Railroad, which flourished from the end \n        of the 18th century to the end of the Civil War, was 1 of the \n        most significant expressions of the American civil rights \n        movement during its evolution over more than 3 centuries;\n            (2) the Underground Railroad bridged the divides of race, \n        religion, sectional differences, and nationality, spanned State \n        lines and international borders, and joined the American ideals \n        of liberty and freedom expressed in the Declaration of \n        Independence and the Constitution to the extraordinary actions \n        of ordinary men and women working in common purpose to free a \n        people;\n            (3) pursuant to title VI of Public Law 101-628 (16 U.S.C. \n        1a-5 note; 104 Stat. 4495), the Underground Railroad Advisory \n        Committee conducted a study of the appropriate means of \n        establishing an enduring national commemorative Underground \n        Railroad program of education, example, reflection, and \n        reconciliation;\n            (4) the Underground Railroad Advisory Committee found \n        that--\n                    (A) although a few elements of the Underground \n                Railroad story are represented in existing National \n                Park Service units and other sites, many sites are in \n                imminent danger of being lost or destroyed, and many \n                important resource types are not adequately represented \n                and protected;\n                    (B) there are many important sites that have high \n                potential for preservation and visitor use in 29 \n                States, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin \n                Islands;\n                    (C) no single site or route completely reflects and \n                characterizes the Underground Railroad, since the \n                Underground Railroad's story and associated resources \n                involve networks and regions of the country rather than \n                individual sites and trails; and\n                    (D) establishment of a variety of partnerships \n                between the Federal Government and other levels of \n                government and the private sector would be most \n                appropriate for the protection and interpretation of \n                the Underground Railroad;\n            (5) the National Park Service can play a vital role in \n        facilitating the national commemoration of the Underground \n        Railroad; and\n            (6) the story and significance of the Underground Railroad \n        can best engage the American people through a national program \n        of the National Park Service that links historic buildings, \n        structures, and sites, routes, geographic areas, and corridors, \n        interpretive centers, museums, and institutions, and programs, \n        activities, community projects, exhibits, and multimedia \n        materials, in a manner that is both unified and flexible.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to recognize the importance of--\n                    (A) the Underground Railroad;\n                    (B) the sacrifices made by slaves who used the \n                Underground Railroad in search of freedom from tyranny \n                and oppression; and\n                    (C) the sacrifices made by the people who helped \n                those slaves; and\n            (2) to authorize the National Park Service to coordinate \n        and facilitate--\n                    (A) Federal and non-Federal activities to \n                commemorate, honor, and interpret the history of the \n                Underground Railroad;\n                    (B) the Underground Railroad's significance as a \n                crucial element in the evolution of the national civil \n                rights movement; and\n                    (C) the Underground Railroad's relevance in \n                fostering a spirit of racial harmony and national \n                reconciliation.\n\nSEC. 3.
