    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Build, Update, Improve, Lift, and \nDesign Health Centers Act of 2007'' or the ``BUILD Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Many health care experts believe that lack of access to \n        basic health services is our Nation's single most pressing \n        health care problem. There are 56,000,000 Americans that do not \n        have access to a primary care provider, whether they have \n        health insurance or not. In addition, more than 45,000,000 \n        Americans lack health insurance and have difficulty accessing \n        care due to the inability to pay for such care.\n            (2) Health centers, including community health centers, \n        migrant health centers, health centers for the homeless, and \n        public housing health centers, address the health care access \n        problem by providing primary care services in thousands of \n        rural and urban medically-underserved communities throughout \n        the United States.\n            (3) Health centers provide basic health care services to \n        16,000,000 Americans each year, including nearly 9,500,000 \n        minorities, 850,000 farmworkers, and 750,000 homeless \n        individuals. One in five children from low-income families \n        receives care through health centers.\n            (4) Studies show that health centers provide high-quality \n        and cost-effective health care. The average yearly cost for a \n        health center patient is approximately $1.25 per day.\n            (5) One of the most effective ways to address America's \n        health care access problem is by dramatically expanding access \n        to health centers, as both the Senate and the President have \n        proposed.\n            (6) Many existing health centers operate in facilities that \n        desperately need renovation or modernization. Thirty percent of \n        health centers are located in buildings that are more than 30 \n        years old, with 12 percent of such centers operating out of \n        facilities that are more than 50 years old. In a survey of \n        health centers in 11 States, 2/3 of those centers identified a \n        need to improve, expand, or replace their current facility. An \n        extrapolation based on this survey indicates there may be as \n        much as $2,200,000,000 in unmet capital needs in our Nation's \n        health centers.\n            (7) Dramatically increasing access to health centers \n        requires building new facilities in communities that have \n        access problems and lack a health center.\n            (8) Health centers often do not have the means to pay for \n        capital improvements or new facilities. While most health \n        centers raise some funds through private donations, it is \n        difficult to raise sufficient amounts for capital needs without \n        a middle-upper-class donor base similar to other nonprofit \n        organizations like universities and hospitals.\n            (9) Health centers have a limited ability to support loan \n        payments. Due to an increasing number of uninsured patients and \n        the fact that many health care reimbursements are less than the \n        cost of care, health centers rarely have more than minimal \n        positive operating margins. Yet lenders are rarely willing to \n        take risks on nonprofit organizations without these positive \n        margins.\n            (10) While the Federal Government currently provides grants \n        to health centers to assist with operational expenses used to \n        provide care to a medically underserved population, there is no \n        authority to provide grants to assist health centers to meet \n        capital needs, such as construction of new facilities or \n        modernization, expansion, or replacement of existing buildings.\n            (11) To assist health centers with their mission of \n        providing health care to the medically underserved, the Federal \n        Government should supplement local efforts to meet the capital \n        needs of health centers.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    (a) Health Care Facility Grants and Loan Guarantees.--Subpart I of \npart D of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 330R.
