FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the increasingly litigious nature of the legal \n        profession in the United States has created an unnecessary and \n        ultimately harmful barrier between the traditional desire of \n        individuals to help other individuals and their ability to act \n        on those desires;\n            (2) the cost of lawsuits, excessive, unpredictable, and \n        often arbitrary damage awards, and unfair allocations of \n        liability have a direct and chilling effect on the spirit of \n        volunteerism and the provision of charitable service in the \n        United States;\n            (3) arbitrary and capricious damage awards against \n        volunteers and charitable institutions have contributed \n        considerably to the high cost of liability insurance, making it \n        difficult and often impossible for volunteers and volunteer \n        service organizations to be protected from liability as those \n        volunteers and many volunteer service organizations serve the \n        public without regard to receiving any personal or \n        institutional economic benefits from that service;\n            (4) as a result, volunteer service organizations throughout \n        the United States have been adversely affected and often \n        debilitated as volunteers have refused to help because of a \n        fear of frivolous lawsuits;\n            (5) without a resurgence in volunteerism, the essential \n        services that volunteer service organizations provide, \n        including crisis counseling, volunteer rescue services, coaches \n        and referees for sports activities of children, and support for \n        the elderly, will continue to diminish;\n            (6) clarifying and limiting the personal liability risks \n        assumed by individuals and institutions who volunteer to help \n        others without benefit to themselves is an appropriate subject \n        for Federal legislation because--\n                    (A) of the national scope of the problems created \n                by the legitimate fears of volunteers about frivolous, \n                arbitrary, or capricious lawsuits; and\n                    (B) the citizens of the United States depend on, \n                and the Federal Government expends funds on, numerous \n                social programs that depend on the services of \n                volunteers; and\n                    (C) it is in the interest of the Federal Government \n                to encourage the continued operation of volunteer \n                service organizations and contributions of volunteers \n                because the Federal Government lacks the capacity to \n                carry out all of the services provided by such \n                organizations and volunteers; and\n            (7) liability reform for volunteer service organizations \n        will promote the free flow of goods and services, lessen \n        burdens on interstate commerce and uphold constitutionally \n        protected due process rights and that liability reform is thus \n        an appropriate use of the powers contained in article I, \n        section 8, clause 3 of the United States Constitution, and the \n        fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide protection \nfrom personal financial liability for volunteers and volunteer service \norganizations that provide volunteer services that are conducted in \ngood faith--\n            (1) to promote the interests of social service program \n        beneficiaries and taxpayers; and\n            (2) to sustain the availability of programs, volunteer \n        service organizations, and governmental entities that depend on \n        volunteer contributions and services; and\n            (3) to provide the protection by--\n                    (A) placing reasonable limits on punitive damages;\n                    (B) ensuring the fair allocation of liability in \n                certain civil actions; and\n                    (C) establishing greater fairness, rationality, and \n                predictability in the civil justice system of the \n                United States.\n\nSEC. 3.

APPLICATION BY COURT.\n\n    The application of the limitation imposed by section 6 may not be \ndisclosed to a jury by a court. Nothing in this section authorizes the \ncourt to enter an award of punitive damages in excess of the initial \naward of punitive damages awarded by a jury.\n\nSEC. 9. BIFURCATION AT REQUEST OF ANY PARTY.\n\n    (a) In General.--At the request of any party the trier of fact, in \nany action for punitive damages that is subject to this Act, shall \nconsider in a separate proceeding, held subsequent to the determination \nof the amount of compensatory damages, whether punitive damages are to \nbe awarded for the harm that is the subject of the action and the \namount of the award.\n    (b) Inadmissibility of Evidence Relevant Only to a Claim of \nPunitive Damages in a Proceeding Concerning Compensatory Damages.--If \nany party requests a separate proceeding under subsection (a), in a \nproceeding to determine whether the claimant may be awarded \ncompensatory damages, any evidence, argument, or contention that is \nrelevant only to the claim of punitive damages, as determined by \napplicable State law, shall be inadmissible.\n\nSEC. 10. LIABILITY FOR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--In any action described in subparagraph (A) or \n(B) of section 4(a)(1) brought against more than one defendant, the \nliability of each defendant for compensatory damages shall be \ndetermined in accordance with this section.\n    (b) Amount of Liability for Compensatory Damages.--\n            (1) In general.--Each defendant shall be liable only for \n        the amount of compensatory damages allocated by the trier of \n        fact to the defendant in direct proportion to the percentage of \n        responsibility of the defendant (determined in accordance with \n        paragraph (2)) for the harm to the claimant with respect to \n        which the defendant is found to be liable. The court shall \n        render a separate judgment against each defendant in an amount \n        determined pursuant to the preceding sentence.\n            (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n        determining the amount of compensatory damages allocated to a \n        defendant under this section, the trier of fact in an action \n        described in subsection (a) shall determine the percentage of \n        responsibility of each person responsible for the harm to the \n        claimant, without regard to whether that person is party to the \n        action.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        "
