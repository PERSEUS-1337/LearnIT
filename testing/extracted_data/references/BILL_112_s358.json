AGENCY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Federal Regulatory System.--The Federal regulatory system \nshall--\n            (1) protect the public health, welfare, safety, and the \n        environment of the United States, especially those promoting \n        economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation;\n            (2) be based on the best available science and information;\n            (3) allow for public participation and an open exchange of \n        ideas;\n            (4) promote predictability and reduce uncertainty, \n        including adherence to a clearly articulated timeline for the \n        release of regulatory documents at all stages of the regulatory \n        process;\n            (5) identify and use the best, most innovative, and least \n        burdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends;\n            (6) take into account benefits and costs, both quantitative \n        and qualitative;\n            (7) ensure that regulations are accessible, consistent, \n        written in plain language, and easy to understand; and\n            (8) measure, and seek to improve, the actual results of \n        regulatory requirements.\n    (b) Requirements.--Each agency shall--\n            (1) propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned \n        determination that the benefits of the regulation justify the \n        costs of the regulation to the extent permitted by law;\n            (2) tailor regulations of the agency to impose the least \n        burden on society, consistent with obtaining regulatory \n        objectives, taking into account, among other things, the costs \n        of cumulative regulations;\n            (3) select, in choosing among alternative regulatory \n        approaches, those approaches that maximize net benefits, \n        including potential economic, environmental, public health and \n        safety, and other advantages, distributive impacts, and equity;\n            (4) specify performance objectives, rather than specifying \n        the behavior or manner of compliance that regulated entities \n        are required to adopt;\n            (5) identify and assess available alternatives to direct \n        regulation, including providing economic incentives to \n        encourage the desired behavior, such as user fees or marketable \n        permits, or providing information upon which choices can be \n        made by the public; and\n            (6) use the best available techniques to quantify \n        anticipated present and future benefits and costs.\n\nSEC. 4. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Regulations shall be--\n            (1) adopted through a process that involves public \n        participation; and\n            (2) based, to the extent consistent with law, on the open \n        exchange of information and perspectives among State, local, \n        and tribal officials, experts in relevant disciplines, affected \n        stakeholders in the private sector, and the public as a whole.\n    (b) Opportunity To Participate.--Each agency shall--\n            (1) provide the public with an opportunity to participate \n        in the regulatory process;\n            (2) as authorized by law, afford the public a meaningful \n        opportunity to comment through the Internet on any proposed \n        regulation, with a comment period that shall begin on the date \n        on which the proposed regulation is published in the Federal \n        Register and be not less than 60 days, unless the relevant \n        regulation is designated by the Administrator of the Office of \n        Information and Regulatory Affairs to be an emergency rule;\n            (3) provide, for both proposed and final rules, timely \n        online access to the rulemaking docket on regulations.gov, \n        including relevant scientific and technical findings, in an \n        open format that can be easily searched and downloaded; and\n            (4) for proposed rules, provide access to include, to the \n        extent permitted by law, an opportunity for public comment on \n        all pertinent parts of the rulemaking docket, including \n        relevant scientific and technical findings.\n    (c) Seeking Affected Parties.--Before issuing a notice of proposed \nrulemaking, each agency shall, where appropriate, seek the views of \nthose who are likely to be affected, including those who are likely to \nbenefit from and those who are potentially subject to such rulemaking.\n    (d) Delay of Implementation.--\n            (1) In general.--An agency shall delay implementation of an \n        interim final rule until final disposition of a challenge is \n        entered by a court in the United States, if--\n                    (A) the agency excepted the rule from notice and \n                public procedure under section 553(b)(B) of title 5, \n                United States Code; and\n                    (B) the agency exception of the rule described \n                under paragraph (1) is challenged in a court in the \n                United States.\n            (2) Length of delay.--If implementation of an interim final \n        rule is delayed under paragraph (1), the delay shall continue \n        until a final disposition of the challenge is entered by the \n        court.\n\nSEC. 5. INTEGRATION AND INNOVATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) some sectors and industries face a significant number \n        of regulatory requirements, some of which may be redundant, \n        inconsistent, or overlapping; and\n            (2) greater coordination across agencies should reduce \n        these requirements, thus reducing costs and simplifying and \n        harmonizing rules.\n    (b) Promotion of Innovation.--In developing regulatory actions and \nidentifying appropriate approaches, each agency shall--\n            (1) promote coordination, simplification, and \n        harmonization; and\n            (2) identify means to achieve regulatory goals that are \n        designed to promote innovation.\n\nSEC. 6. FLEXIBLE APPROACHES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Each agency shall identify and consider regulatory \napproaches that reduce burdens, especially economic burdens, and \nmaintain flexibility and freedom of choice for the public.\n    (b) Contents.--The approaches described under subsection (a) shall \ninclude warnings, appropriate default rules, disclosure requirements, \nand the provision of information to the public in a form that is clear \nand intelligible.\n\nSEC. 7. SCIENCE.\n\n    Each agency shall ensure the objectivity of any scientific and \ntechnological information and processes used to support the regulatory \nactions of the agency.\n\nSEC. 8. RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES OF EXISTING RULES.\n\n    (a) Retrospective Analyses.--\n            (1) In general.--To facilitate the periodic review of \n        existing significant regulatory actions, agencies shall \n        consider how best to promote retrospective analysis of rules \n        that may be outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively \n        burdensome, and to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal such \n        regulations in accordance with what has been learned.\n            (2) Agreement.--Once every 5 years, each agency may enter \n        into an agreement with a qualified private organization to \n        conduct the retrospective analysis described in paragraph (1) \n        of the agency.\n            (3) Publication online.--Any retrospective analyses \n        conducted under this subsection, including supporting data, \n        shall be published online.\n    (b) Agency Plans.--\n            (1) Plan.--\n                    (A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the \n                date of enactment of this Act, each agency shall \n                develop and submit to the appropriate congressional \n                committees a preliminary plan for reviewing significant \n                regulatory actions issued by the agency, consistent \n                with law, under which the agency shall review its \n                existing significant regulatory actions once every 5 \n                years to determine whether such regulations should be \n                modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to \n                make the regulatory program of the agency more \n                effective or less burdensome in achieving the \n                regulatory objectives.\n                    (B) Repeal.--If the plan described in subparagraph \n                (A) includes suggestions for needed repeals a timeline \n                for such repeals shall also be included in the plan.\n            (2) Report.--Upon completion of a review under a plan \n        submitted under paragraph (1), each agency shall submit to the \n        appropriate congressional committees a report that--\n                    (A) describes the outcome of the review, including \n                which regulations were modified, streamlined, expanded, \n                or repealed;\n                    (B) describes the reasons for the modifications, \n                streamlining, expansions, or repeals described in \n                subparagraph (A); and\n                    (C) in any case where an agency did not take \n                action, describes the reasons why the agency did not \n                take action to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal \n                any significant regulatory actions."
