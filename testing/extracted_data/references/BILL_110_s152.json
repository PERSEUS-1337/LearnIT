FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A national commitment should be established that all \n        children have access to high quality early education.\n            (2) Research suggests that a child's early years are \n        critical to the development of the brain. Early brain \n        development is an important component of educational and \n        intellectual achievement.\n            (3) The National Research Council of the National Academy \n        of Sciences reported that early education opportunities are \n        necessary if children are going to develop the language and \n        literacy skills necessary to learn to read.\n            (4) Evaluations of early education programs demonstrate \n        that compared to children with similar backgrounds who have not \n        participated in early education programs, children who \n        participate in such programs--\n                    (A) perform better on reading and mathematics \n                achievement tests;\n                    (B) are more likely to stay academically near their \n                grade level and make normal academic progress \n                throughout elementary school;\n                    (C) are less likely to be held back a grade or \n                require special education services in elementary \n                school;\n                    (D) show greater learning retention, initiative, \n                creativity, and social competency; and\n                    (E) are more enthusiastic about school and are more \n                likely to have good attendance records.\n            (5) Studies have estimated that for every dollar invested \n        in quality early education, about 7 dollars are saved in later \n        costs.\n\nSEC. 3.
