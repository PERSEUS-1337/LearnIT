    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Maternal Motor Vehicle Crash Safety \nAct of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety \n        Administration.\n            (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee on \n        Appropriations and Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n        Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on \n        Appropriations and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the \n        House of Representatives.\n            (3) Biofidelic.--The term ``biofidelic'' means having the \n        property of responding to and being impacted by crash and other \n        external forces in a manner directly consistent with the way in \n        which a live human being would respond to and be impacted by \n        such forces.\n            (4) Data linkage system.--The term ``data linkage system'' \n        means an information system that is capable of accurately \n        tracking adverse health effects and birth outcomes for pregnant \n        women who are occupants of a motor vehicle that is involved in \n        a crash and the unborn children of such women, through the \n        connection and analysis of multiple data sources.\n            (5) Unborn child.--The term ``unborn child'' means a member \n        of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who \n        is carried in the womb.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Injuries are the leading cause of pregnancy-associated \n        deaths in the United States.\n            (2) Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of injury \n        deaths in women of reproductive age and the leading cause of \n        injury hospitalizations among pregnant women.\n            (3) Studies have indicated that motor vehicles are \n        estimated to account for up to 80 percent of injury related \n        deaths among unborn children.\n            (4) Transportation Research Board publications indicate \n        that deaths among unborn children due to motor vehicle crashes \n        are more frequent than several notable fatal childhood \n        injuries, including bicycle related deaths in children aged 0 \n        through 15, firearm related deaths in children aged 0 through \n        9, and motor vehicle crash related deaths in children aged 0 \n        through 1.\n            (5) Studies suggest that approximately 3 percent of all \n        babies born in the United States are involved in a motor \n        vehicle crash while in utero.\n            (6) Studies have shown that elevated risks of birth-related \n        threats and obstetric complications following crashes involving \n        pregnant women include--\n                    (A) premature childbirth;\n                    (B) low birth weight;\n                    (C) placental injury;\n                    (D) uterine rupture; and\n                    (E) amniotic rupture.\n            (7) Despite advances in vehicle safety, pregnant women have \n        not received the special attention and consideration needed to \n        understand, reduce, and prevent the risks of adverse pregnancy \n        outcomes related to crashes.\n            (8) There is a need for more research and application using \n        anthropometric test devices and computerized modeling systems \n        that represent pregnant women during all stages of pregnancy.\n            (9) During pregnancy, the risks of traumatic injury to a \n        woman is shared by the woman's unborn child. Assessing the \n        magnitude and characteristics of those risks through data \n        linkage systems, comparing the risks to other injuries and \n        diseases, and reducing them, are important unmet challenges for \n        improving maternal and child health.\n            (10) A better understanding is needed about what can happen \n        during, and after, a pregnant woman is involved in a motor \n        vehicle crash. This includes the effects of a crash on the \n        mother, the unborn child, and the delicate physiological \n        balance between the mother and child that separates healthy \n        from unhealthy pregnancies, including the effects of maternal \n        physiologic adaptations to trauma, fluid loss and shock, \n        effects from maternal stress, effects from diagnostic regimens, \n        medical or surgical procedures, or the wide variety of \n        prescription medicines, and other medication taken by the \n        mother.\n            (11) Despite the importance of the health of mothers and \n        unborn children involved in motor vehicle crashes, agencies and \n        data linkage systems responsible for tracking motor vehicle \n        injuries, deaths, and other measures of adverse outcome rarely \n        capture pregnancy status.\n            (12) Existing data collection and analysis systems \n        generally do not count unborn children involved in motor \n        vehicle crashes and do not follow them after their birth to \n        ascertain the effects of the crash on long-term neuro-\n        developmental and functional outcomes.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPROVEMENTS TO THE NATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE \n              SAMPLING SYSTEM CRASHWORTHINESS DATA SYSTEM.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the Administrator--\n            (1) should continue to include in the National Automotive \n        Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System maintained by the \n        Administrator data related to motor vehicle crashes that \n        involved a pregnant women; and\n            (2) should identify other means to advance the current \n        level of understanding regarding the number, nature, and impact \n        of motor vehicle crashes involving pregnant women and their \n        unborn children through data collection, data linkage systems, \n        and analysis systems.\n\nSEC. 5.
