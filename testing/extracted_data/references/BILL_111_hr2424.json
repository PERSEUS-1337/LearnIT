FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In August 2007, liquidity abruptly dried up in credit \n        and securities markets.\n            (2) This lack of access to affordable credit was initially \n        limited to financial firms with interests in mortgage-backed \n        securities that contained subprime and predatory mortgages.\n            (3) The lack of access to credit quickly spread throughout \n        the financial services industry, and eventually worldwide.\n            (4) At the inception of the financial crisis, the Board of \n        Governors of the Federal Reserve System responded by exercising \n        its authorities in the traditional manner to effect the Federal \n        funds rate target, which culminated in a December 16, 2008, \n        decision to establish a Federal funds rate target range of 0 \n        percent to 0.25 percent.\n            (5) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \n        as it employed its traditional tools to provide liquidity and \n        stability to the financial markets, came to acknowledge the \n        severity of the current crisis by exercising its authority to \n        act in response to ``unusual and exigent circumstances''.\n            (6) The Federal Reserve has exercised its authority to \n        address ``unusual and exigent circumstances'' no less than 11 \n        times since the beginning of the financial crisis.\n            (7) Before this financial crisis, the Board of Governors of \n        the Federal Reserve System last exercised its authority to \n        address ``unusual and exigent circumstances'' in 1934.\n            (8) In connection with the Board of Governors of the \n        Federal Reserve System's efforts to address unusual and exigent \n        circumstances, the Board extended assistance to nonmember \n        institutions, something it had not done since 1959.\n            (9) In connection with the Board of Governors of the \n        Federal Reserve System's efforts to address unusual and exigent \n        circumstances, the Board has purchased debt obligations from \n        government-sponsored enterprises, something it had not done \n        since 1981.\n            (10) In the course of the crisis, the Federal Reserve \n        established joint programs with the Department of the Treasury \n        to aid financial markets, such as the guarantee of Citigroup's \n        and Bank of America's assets, the Term Asset-Backed Securities \n        Lending Facility, and the Public-Private Partnership Investment \n        Program.\n            (11) On February 10, 2009, Chairman Ben Bernanke affirmed \n        his commitment to transparency when he testified to the \n        Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives \n        that ``the Federal Reserve is committed to keeping the Congress \n        and the public informed about its lending programs and balance \n        sheet''.\n\nSEC. 3.
