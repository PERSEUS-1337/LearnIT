FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) certain biological agents have the potential to pose a \n        severe threat to public health and safety;\n            (2) such biological agents can be used as weapons by \n        individuals or organizations for the purpose of domestic or \n        international terrorism or for other criminal purposes;\n            (3) the transfer and possession of potentially hazardous \n        biological agents should be regulated to protect public health \n        and safety; and\n            (4) efforts to protect the public from exposure to such \n        agents should ensure that individuals and groups with \n        legitimate objectives continue to have access to such agents \n        for clinical and research purposes.\n\nSEC. 3. CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    (a) Biological Weapons.--Chapter 10 of title 18, United States \nCode, is amended--\n            (1) in section 175(a), by inserting ``or attempts, \n        threatens, or conspires to do the same,'' after ``to do so,'';\n            (2) in section 177(a)(2), by inserting ``threat,'' after \n        ``attempt,''; and\n            (3) in section 178--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``or infectious \n                substance'' and inserting ``infectious substance, or \n                biological product that may be engineered as a result \n                of biotechnology, or any naturally occurring or \n                bioengineered component of any such microorganism, \n                virus, infectious substance, or biological product'';\n                    (B) in paragraph (2)--\n                            (i) by inserting ``the toxic material of \n                        plants, animals, microorganisms, viruses, \n                        fungi, or infectious substances, or a \n                        recombinant molecule'' after ``means'';\n                            (ii) by striking ``production--'' and \n                        inserting ``production, including--'';\n                            (iii) in subparagraph (A), by inserting \n                        ``or biological product that may be engineered \n                        as a result of biotechnology'' after \n                        ``substance''; and\n                            (iv) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``or \n                        biological product'' after ``isomer''; and\n                    (C) in paragraph (4), by inserting ``, or molecule, \n                including a recombinant molecule, or biological product \n                that may be engineered as a result of biotechnology,'' \n                after ``organism''.\n    (b) Terrorism.--Section 2332a(a) of title 18, United States Code, \nis amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``, threatens,'' after ``attempts''; and\n            (2) by inserting ``, including any biological agent, toxin, \n        or vector (as those terms are defined in section 178)'' after \n        ``destruction''.\n\nSEC. 4.
