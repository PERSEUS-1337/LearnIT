FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the public land in the Otay Mountain region of \n        California is one of the last remaining pristine locations in \n        western San Diego County, California;\n            (2) this rugged mountain adjacent to the United States-\n        Mexico border is internationally known for having a diversity \n        of unique and sensitive plants;\n            (3) this area plays a critical role in San Diego's multi-\n        species conservation plan, a national model made for \n        maintaining biodiversity;\n            (4) due to the proximity of the Otay Mountain region to the \n        international border, this area is the focus of important law \n        enforcement and border interdiction efforts necessary to \n        curtail illegal immigration and protect the area's wilderness \n        values; and\n            (5) the illegal immigration traffic, combined with the \n        rugged topography, present unique fire management challenges \n        for protecting lives and resources.\n\nSEC. 3.
