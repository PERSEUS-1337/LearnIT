    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Waste Terrorist Threat \nAssessment and Protection Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City, \n        Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania were the deadliest and \n        costliest terrorist attacks against the United States in its \n        history, resulting in the deaths of over 5,000 people at the \n        World Trade Center, Pentagon, and Pennsylvania crash site.\n            (2) The economic and cleanup costs as a result of the \n        September 11 terrorist attacks are estimated at \n        $100,000,000,000 in New York City alone.\n            (3) The attacks have resulted in massive economic \n        disruption to the United States. The New York Stock Exchange's \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 12 percent and the \n        NASDAQ market dropped 11.7 percent within the first 2 weeks \n        after the attacks.\n            (4) The September 11 attacks represent a dramatic expansion \n        in the ability of terrorists to inflict massive damage, \n        including the wide-scale loss of human life and economic \n        disruption to the United States and the world.\n            (5) Terrorists are willing to use any and all methods to \n        bring about their desire to destroy human life and property.\n            (6) The terrorists who attacked the United States have \n        demonstrated their willingness and desire to target innocent \n        civilians.\n            (7) Terrorists can be expected to continue to improve their \n        destructive capabilities. Their networks have become more \n        sophisticated and resourceful in carrying out heinous acts of \n        destruction.\n            (8) To counter this threat, the United States should take \n        every reasonable step, consistent with the principles upon \n        which this country was founded, to restrict terrorists' ability \n        to inflict damage against the United States.\n            (9) Instead of making the United States safer, the proposed \n        Yucca Mountain Project, as currently designed, would give \n        terrorists a huge, easy-to-attack target that, at any point, \n        could cause massive economic and civilian casualties within the \n        United States.\n            (10) The Yucca Mountain Project proposes to ship 77,000 \n        tons of deadly high-level radioactive nuclear waste throughout \n        the United States over the next 30 to 40 years. High-level \n        radioactive nuclear waste is one of the most toxic substances \n        known to mankind.\n            (11) The waste would be transported by rail and by truck \n        through at least 43 States, through hundreds of cities and \n        towns, and through more than 360 congressional districts.\n            (12) Findings of the Nevada State Nuclear Projects Agency \n        demonstrate that a July 18 train accident in a Baltimore tunnel \n        created a situation that would have been hot enough to breach a \n        nuclear waste cask and release a cloud of suspended, \n        radioactive particles. Such findings conclude that \n        contamination of this sort would spread over 33 square miles, \n        cost more than $13,000,000,000 to clean up, and cause up to \n        31,824 cancer-related deaths;\n            (13) At almost every stage of the Yucca Mountain Project, \n        high-level radioactive nuclear waste would be very vulnerable \n        to terrorist attacks. Terrorists could attack or steal the \n        waste as it travels on our roads, highways, railways, or \n        waterways, as it is stored or moved at intermodal storage \n        facilities, storage depots, or at the proposed repository \n        itself.\n            (14) The United States Government, in attempting to \n        implement the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, has not \n        sufficiently addressed the threat of terrorist attacks.\n            (15) The Department of Energy has failed to address the \n        Yucca Mountain Project's vulnerability to terrorism and \n        sabotage, intrusions, trespassing, vandalism, arson, and bomb-\n        related incidents, as expressed by the State of Nevada and \n        independent researchers throughout the country.\n            (16) The Department of Energy's methodology for assessing \n        risks seriously underestimates those associated with sabotage \n        and terrorism against radioactive shipments, waste stored at \n        intermodal storage facilities, storage depots, and at Yucca \n        Mountain itself.\n            (17) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the agency in \n        charge of protecting public health and safety and the \n        environment from the harmful effects of nuclear waste, has not \n        revised its rules regarding the transportation of nuclear waste \n        since the early 1970s. The antiquated rules do not address \n        modern-day threats and weapons, nor the increased risk posed by \n        today's most violent and maniacal terrorists.\n\nSEC. 3. YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT VULNERABILITY AND DEFENSE PLAN.\n\n    The Office of Homeland Security shall coordinate the development \nand implementation of an interagency plan, in conjunction with \nappropriate Federal, State, and local agencies and with public input, \nto prepare for and defend against Federal crimes of terrorism targeting \nany aspect of the Yucca Mountain Project. The interagency plan shall--\n            (1) include a comprehensive analysis of the safety and \n        vulnerability to Federal crimes of terrorism of the Yucca \n        Mountain Project;\n            (2) address attacks against--\n                    (A) rail, truck, and barge shipments of nuclear \n                waste;\n                    (B) facilities, equipment, infrastructure, and \n                vehicles used for such shipments of nuclear waste;\n                    (C) personnel working for the Yucca Mountain \n                Project;\n                    (D) all intermediary, staging, transfer, \n                intermodal, and temporary storage facilities used for \n                shipping nuclear waste to the Yucca Mountain \n                repository;\n                    (E) Yucca Mountain repository facilities, vehicles, \n                and equipment;\n                    (F) all water and power systems used by the Yucca \n                Mountain Project; and\n                    (G) nuclear waste containers for transportation, \n                transfer, or storage;\n            (3) give special emphasis to addressing--\n                    (A) the use of nuclear waste as a radiological \n                weapon;\n                    (B) the use of high-energy explosives, anti-tank \n                missiles, armor piercing technologies, and other \n                sophisticated technologies; and\n                    (C) sabotage or theft of high-level nuclear waste;\n            (4) include a comprehensive strategy for defending the \n        Yucca Mountain Project against all Federal crimes of terrorism, \n        which shall address--\n                    (A) vulnerabilities analyzed under paragraph (1);\n                    (B) the defense of the Yucca Mountain Project \n                against air and ground assaults, truck bombs, attacks \n                using sophisticated armor piercing technologies, \n                suicide attacks, and other potential military-style \n                attacks;\n                    (C) credible worst-case assumptions about the \n                timing and location of potential attacks;\n                    (D) the effects of weather conditions during and \n                after attacks;\n                    (E) the use of expanded no-fly zones, and the \n                development of policy regarding infractions of a no-fly \n                zone over key areas involved in the Yucca Mountain \n                Project, with emphasis paid to whether the size of the \n                no-fly zone is sufficient to protect against an \n                airborne attack, ways of defending against this type of \n                attack, and whether there is ample time for our \n                national defense to defend against an infraction of the \n                no-fly zone;\n                    (F) the use of background and security checks of \n                all personnel related to the transport of nuclear waste \n                to Yucca Mountain;\n                    (G) developing a uniform Federal standard for the \n                use of deadly force to protect all aspects of the Yucca \n                Mountain Project; and\n                    (H) specific rules of engagement for a potential \n                airborne attack; and\n            (5) an analysis of the economic, public health, and \n        environmental costs and impacts of implementing the plan.\n\nSEC. 4.
