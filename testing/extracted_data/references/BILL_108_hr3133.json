FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) on August 27, 2003, the United States Environmental \n        Protection Agency (EPA) finalized revisions to the new source \n        review regulations under the Clean Air Act excluding from \n        review equipment changes involving fixed capital costs and \n        repair costs that are 20 percent or less of the total \n        replacement value of the affected process unit;\n            (2) there are serious concerns about the expected air \n        pollution consequences of the revisions to the new source \n        review regulations and it is estimated that 17,000 industrial \n        facilities nationwide are affected by the regulatory revisions;\n            (3) in a report dated August 22, 2003, the United States \n        General Accounting Office found that EPA has relied on \n        anecdotal information from the industries most affected by the \n        new source review program to support its conclusion that the \n        program discouraged some energy efficiency projects because the \n        Agency lacked more comprehensive data;\n            (4) the National Academy of Public Administrators, an \n        independent, nonpartisan organization chartered by Congress to \n        improve government, issued an April 21, 2003 report examining \n        the new source review program and recommended that efforts to \n        reform the program should ensure both that new source review \n        provides enhanced protection of health and the environment and \n        should carefully avoid creating even broader loopholes or more \n        exemptions from the program's requirements;\n            (5) the EPA's August 27, 2003 final revisions to the new \n        source review regulations require adoption by states, Indian \n        tribes or municipalities having approved new source review \n        programs within three years and will automatically apply within \n        60 days of publication of the final revisions in states, Indian \n        tribes and municipalities not having an approved program;\n            (6) the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program \n        Administrators and the Association of Local Air Pollution \n        Control Officials have stated that states and local governments \n        should be allowed to make their own choices regarding the \n        adoption of EPA's revisions to the new source review program \n        based upon the state's or locality's own judgment of what will \n        best serve its local air quality needs; and\n            (7) States, Indian tribes, municipalities, and air \n        pollution control agencies should not be required to implement \n        EPA's August 27, 2003 new source review revisions if they \n        consider that the result would be to lessen the protection of \n        public health or the environment.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to preserve the ability of \nstates, Indian tribes, municipalities, and air pollution control \nagencies to protect the public health and the environment by affording \nthem discretion as to whether or not to implement the August 27, 2003 \nnew source review revisions.\n\nSEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF STATE AND TRIBAL AUTHORITY.\n\n    (a) Prohibitions.--(1) No State, Indian tribe, municipality, or air \npollution control agency shall be required to implement or to have \nimplemented in their jurisdiction, the Environmental Protection \nAgency's August 27, 2003 new source review revisions.\n    (2) No revision of a Federal implementation plan pursuant to the \nAugust 27, 2003 new source review revisions shall take effect until the \naffected State, Indian tribe, municipality, or air pollution control \nagency notifies the Environmental Protection Agency that it agrees to \nsuch revision.\n    (3) Failure of a State, Indian tribe, municipality, or air \npollution control agency to implement the August 27, 2003 new source \nreview revisions, or to consent to revision of a Federal implementation \nplan pursuant to the August 27, 2003 new source review revisions, shall \nnot subject such State, tribe, municipality, or agency to sanctions, \nthe revocation of an approved state implementation plan under the Clean \nAir Act, or imposition of a new or revised Federal implementation plan \nunder the Clean Air Act.\n    (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The terms ``air pollution control agency'', ``State'', \n        ``municipality'', and ``Indian tribe'' shall have the same \n        meaning as provided in subsections (b), (d), (f), and (r) of \n        section 302 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7602(b), (d), (f), \n        and (r)).\n            (2) The term ``August 27, 2003 new source review \n        revisions'' means the exclusion to the new source review \n        requirements under the Clean Air Act entitled ``Prevention of \n        Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New Source \n        Review (NSR): Equipment Replacement Provision of the Routine \n        Maintenance, Repair and Replacement Exclusion'' promulgated by \n        the Environmental Protection Agency on August 27, 2003.\n            (3) The term ``Federal implementation plan'' shall have the \n        same meaning as provided in subsection (c)(1) of section 110 of \n        the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7410(c)(1)) and subsection (y) of \n        section 302 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7602(y)).\n    (c) Effect of Act.--Nothing in this Act affects the retention of \nState authority under section 116 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n7416)."
