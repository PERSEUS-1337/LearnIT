FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The use of terrorism is detestable and an illegitimate \n        means of political expression.\n            (2) International terrorist organizations pose a direct \n        threat to the United States, and this threat is becoming more \n        acute and more difficult to prevent.\n            (3) The threat from international terrorism is made far \n        more dangerous by the proliferation of chemical, biological, \n        and radiological weapons and the means to produce those \n        weapons.\n            (4) The prosecution of the war against international \n        terrorist organizations must continue until those organizations \n        and the threat they pose to the people and interests of the \n        United States are eliminated.\n            (5) The United States can only win the war on terrorism if \n        it receives cooperation from other countries and entities.\n            (6) Protecting the United States homeland and United States \n        interests overseas from terrorism is of the highest priority in \n        the foreign relations of the United States.\n            (7) Cooperation in the global war against international \n        terrorism must be a primary focus of United States foreign \n        relations, United States assistance, and international security \n        relations.\n            (8) Winning the war on terrorism requires cooperation from \n        the international community, especially in the areas of \n        preventing the financing of terror, sharing information on \n        international terror networks, eliminating terror cells, and in \n        preventing the promotion of anti-Americanism and the \n        glorification of terrorism in state-owned media and state-\n        controlled schools.\n            (9) The promotion of terrorism, intolerance, and virulent \n        anti-Americanism in state-owned media and state-controlled \n        education systems is abhorrent and poses a long-term threat to \n        the safety and security of the United States as well as the \n        community of nations.\n            (10) All countries and entities must be encouraged to \n        cooperate in the global war on international terrorism.\n            (11) Many foreign governments and entities are doing little \n        to counter proterrorist and prointolerance messages to mass \n        audiences, including to school age children.\n            (12) Countries providing direct or indirect assistance to \n        international terrorist organizations undermine the direct \n        security interests of the United States.\n            (13) Countries demonstrating indifference to or providing \n        actual endorsement of international terror as a legitimate \n        political tool make a direct threat to the security interests \n        of the United States.\n            (14) The National Commission on Terrorism established by \n        section 591 of the Foreign Operations Export Financing, and \n        Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1999, as enacted by Public \n        Law 105-277 (112 Stat. 2681-210), concluded that the United \n        States should strengthen its efforts to discourage the broad \n        range of assistance that countries provide to international \n        terrorists.\n            (15) The National Commission on Terrorism further \n        recommends that the President make more effective use of \n        authority to designate foreign governments as ``not fully \n        cooperative'' with the United States counterterrorism efforts.\n            (16) United States assistance programs and the transfer of \n        United States Munitions List items are a critical tool of \n        United States foreign policy and winning the global war on \n        terrorism.\n            (17) Countries receiving United States assistance and the \n        export of items on the United States Munitions List must be \n        obligated to support the global war on international terror.\n            (18) Several existing laws, including the USA Patriot Act \n        of 2001, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n        1996, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export \n        Control Act, and the Export Administration Act of 1979 (or \n        successor statute), prohibit the provision of United States \n        assistance, and the licensing for export of items on the United \n        States Munitions List, to countries supporting terror or not \n        fully cooperating in antiterror efforts of the United States. \n        These laws should be expanded to include the definition of \n        ``fully cooperative in the global war against international \n        terrorism'' set forth in this Act, including preventing \n        promotion of terror in state-owned and controlled media and \n        educational systems.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States that--\n            (1) no United States assistance may be provided to any \n        foreign country or entity that is not making a maximum effort \n        to be fully cooperative in the global war against international \n        terrorism; and\n            (2) no license for export of an item on the United States \n        Munitions List to a country or entity may be issued if that \n        country or entity is not making a maximum effort to be fully \n        cooperative in the war against international terrorism.\n\nSEC. 4.
