    "content": "This report tracks and provides an overview of actions taken by the Administration and Congress to provide FY2015 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) accounts. It also provides an overview of enacted FY2014 appropriations for agencies and bureaus funded as a part of the annual appropriation for CJS.  The amounts in this report reflect only new appropriations. Therefore, the amounts do not include any rescissions of unobligated or de-obligated balances that may be counted as offsets to newly enacted appropriations, nor do they include any scorekeeping adjustments, such as the balance on the Crime Victims Fund. The FY2014-enacted amounts were taken from the joint explanatory statement to accompany P.L. 113-76 , printed in the January 15, 2014, Congressional Record (pp. H507-H532). The FY2015 requested amounts were taken from the report to accompany H.R. 4660 ( H.Rept. 113-448 ). The FY2015 House-passed amounts were taken from the text of H.R. 4660 and H.Rept. 113-448 . The amounts reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations were taken from the report to accompany S. 2473 ( S.Rept. 113-181 ). The FY2015-enacted amounts were taken from the joint explanatory statement to accompany P.L. 113-235 , printed in the December 11, 2014, Congressional Record . The annual CJS appropriations act provides funding for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, the science agencies, and several related agencies. Appropriations for the Department of Commerce include funding for agencies such as Census Bureau; the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Appropriations for the Department of Justice provide funding for agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Bureau of Prisons; the U.S. Marshals; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; along with funding for a variety of grant programs for state, local, and tribal governments. The vast majority of funding for the science agencies goes to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation. The annual appropriation for the related agencies includes funding for agencies such as the Legal Services Corporation and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  The mission of the Department of Commerce is to promote \"job creation, economic growth, sustainable development and improved standards of living ... by working in partnership with businesses, universities, communities and ... workers.\" The department has wide-ranging responsibilities including trade, economic development, technology, entrepreneurship and business development, monitoring the environment, and statistical research and analysis. The Department of Commerce affects trade and economic development by working to open new markets for U.S. goods and services and promoting pro-growth business policies. The department also invests in research in development to foster innovation. The Department of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, manages and monitors the nation's natural resources and assets to support both environmental and economic health. The department, through the Census Bureau, conducts the constitutionally mandated decennial census. Finally, the Department of Commerce operates the national patent system. The mission of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is to \"enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.\" The DOJ provides legal advice and opinions, upon request, to the President and executive branch department heads. The DOJ prosecutes individuals accused of violating federal laws and it represents the U.S. Government in court. The department enforces federal criminal and civil laws, including antitrust, civil rights, environmental, and tax laws. The department, through agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, investigates organized and violent crime, illegal drugs, and gun and explosives violations. The DOJ, through the U.S. Marshals Service, protects the federal judiciary, apprehends fugitives, and detains individuals who are not granted pretrial release. It incarcerates individuals convicted of violating federal laws. The DOJ also provides grants and training to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (P.L. 85-568) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities. It has four mission directorates. The Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate is responsible for human spaceflight activities, including the International Space Station and development efforts for future crewed spacecraft. The Science Mission Directorate manages robotic science missions, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Mars rover Curiosity, and satellites for Earth science research. The Space Technology Mission Directorate develops new technologies for use in future space missions, such as advanced propulsion and laser communications. The Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate conducts research and development on aircraft and aviation systems. In addition to the mission directorates, the Office of Education manages formal and informal education programs for school children, college and university students, and the general public. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in the non-medical sciences and engineering. Congress established the foundation as an independent federal agency in 1950 and directed it to \"promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.\" The NSF is a primary source of federal support for U.S. university research. It is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education program portfolio and federal STEM student aid and support.  Figure 1 shows the total appropriation, in both nominal and inflation-adjusted dollars, for the CJS act for FY2005-FY2014. The data show that nominal appropriations for CJS increased starting with FY2005, peaked in FY2010, and have generally declined since. After adjusting for inflation, FY2013 and FY2014 appropriations for CJS were generally at the same level they were at in FY2005. The data also show that the nominal increases in appropriations for CJS between FY2005 and FY2008 were generally in-line with inflation.  Figure 2 shows total appropriations for CJS for FY2005-FY2014 by major component (i.e., the Departments of Commerce and Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science Foundation). The data show that the increase in CJS appropriations in FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011 was the result of Congress appropriating more funding for the Department of Commerce in support of the 2010 decennial census. Since FY2010, total appropriations for CJS have been around $60 billion, with the exception of FY2013 when sequestration cut nearly $4 billion out of the total amount Congress appropriated for CJS for FY2013. While decreased appropriations for the Department of Commerce mostly explain the overall decrease in CJS appropriations since FY2010, there have also been cuts in funding for DOJ and NASA. The DOJ's FY2014 appropriation is 1.9% below its FY2010 appropriation, and NASA's FY2014 appropriation is 5.8% below its FY2010 appropriation. Recent reductions to NASA's appropriation has brought it more in-line with what the agency received in FY2005. However, even with recent cuts to DOJ's appropriation, Congress still appropriated $6.883 billion more for DOJ in FY2014 than it did in FY2005. Appropriations for DOJ increased because Congress appropriated a growing amount for federal law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and Congress appropriated increasing amounts for the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee and the Bureau of Prisons to cover expenses associated with a rising number of federal detainees and prisoners. For FY2015, the Administration requested a total of $62.397 billion for the agencies and bureaus funded as a part of the annual CJS bill. The Administration's request was 1.3%, or $774.4 million, more than the FY2014-enacted appropriation of $61.623 billion. The Administration's request included $8.746 billion for the Department of Commerce, $27.974 billion for the Department of Justice, $24.721 billion for the science agencies, and $956.1 million for the related agencies. On January 17, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-76 ). The act provided a total of $61.623 billion for CJS, of which $8.181 billion was for the Department of Commerce, $27.737 billion was for the Department of Justice, $24.824 billion was for the science agencies, and $881.8 million was for the related agencies. On May 15, 2014, the House Committee on Appropriations reported the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 ( H.R. 4660 ). The bill was passed by the House on May 30, 2014. The bill would have provided $62.559 billion for CJS, an amount that would have been 1.5% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and 0.3% more than the Administration's request. The House-passed bill included $8.231 billion for the Department of Commerce, $28.162 billion for the Department of Justice, $25.296 billion for the science agencies, and $870.9 million for the related agencies. On June 5, 2014, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2015 CJS appropriations bill ( S. 2437 ). The bill reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations would have provided a total of $62.636 billion for CJS, an amount that would have been 1.6% more than the FY2014 appropriation, 0.4% more than the Administration's request, and 0.1% more than the House-passed CJS appropriations bill. The bill included $8.556 billion for the Department of Commerce, $27.997 billion for the Department of Justice, $25.161 billion for the science agencies, and $923.0 million for the related agencies. On December 16, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ). The act provides a total of $61.753 billion for the agencies and bureaus funded by the annual CJS appropriations act. The FY2015 appropriation for CJS is 0.2% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, but it is 1.0% less than the Administration's request, 1.3% less than the House-passed amount, and 1.4% less than the amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The act provides $8.467 billion for the Department of Commerce, $27.030 billion for the Department of Justice, $25.360 billion for the science agencies, and $895.9 million for the related agencies.  Table 1 shows the FY2014-enacted appropriations, the Administration's FY2015 request, the amounts recommended by the House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations, and the FY2015-enacted appropriation for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, the science agencies, and the related agencies. Table 14 shows enacted appropriations for these agencies, in detail, for FY2005 through FY2014 (the FY2013 amounts shown in Table 14 reflect sequestration). Some of the issues Congress considered while debating the FY2015 funding levels for the departments and agencies funded as a part of the CJS appropriations bill are as follows: Whether it should have renamed the International Trade Administration (ITA) the International Trade and Investment Administration, as proposed by the President, to emphasize the agency's role in the complementary missions of export and business investment promotion, using both international advocacy and support for U.S. businesses at home. Whether it should have doubled funding for the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC) to $15.0 million, as requested in the ITA budget proposal, for the purpose of accelerating the operations of the ITEC. Whether it should have reduced funding for the Economic Development Administration's most highly funded program, public works grants, from $96.0 million in FY2014 to $85.0 million in FY2015, and increase funding to support regional innovation clusters and science parks from $10.0 million in FY2014 to $25.0 million in FY2015. Whether the Census Bureau would have received the funds requested to complete the research and testing necessary for a cost-effective 2020 census design, and to restore 12-month interviewing and the full American Community Survey sample size after a one-month break in data collection caused by the October 2013 federal government shutdown. Whether it should have funded the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) core laboratory and construction accounts at a level consistent with the goal of doubling funding for these and other targeted accounts, as proposed previously by President Obama and adopted implicitly in the America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ) and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ). Whether it should have provided $2.400 billion in funding to NIST for the President's proposed National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), included in the President's Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, to support the establishment of up to 45 centers to help accelerate innovation by investing in industrially relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications, and to support manufacturing technology commercialization by bridging the gap between the laboratory and the market. Whether the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would have received, in addition to the funding requested for the FY2015 budget, $180.0 million from the Administration's Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative and $75.0 million from the Climate Resilience Fund. Whether it should have funded the Administration's request for $22.6 million under the Administrative Review and Appeals account to assist the Executive Office of Immigration Review with managing its increasing caseload. Whether it should have provided the $147.0 million in gun- and school violence-related grant funding under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance the Administration requests as a part of its \"Now is the Time\" initiative, which is the Administration's effort to combat gun violence. Whether Congress should have provided the funding the Administration requested for DOJ for Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process reform. Whether the U.S. Marshals Service, in light of an increasing number of responsibilities, has the resources it needs to properly carry-out its mission. Whether the Bureau of Prisons has adequate resources to properly manage the growing number of inmates held in federal prisons. Whether it should have eliminated funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), as proposed by the Administration. Whether it should have adopted the Administration's proposal to consolidate funding for the drug, mental health, and veterans treatment courts programs into a \"problem solving courts\" program. Whether it should have funded the Administration's request for $35.0 million for Community Teams to Reduce the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Backlog and Improve Sexual Assault Investigations. Whether Congress should, as requested by the Administration, have reinstated funding for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program, a program Congress defunded last fiscal year. Whether it should have accepted the Administration's proposed $65.0 million increase in the obligation cap for the Crime Victims Fund for (1) enhancing formula-based awards to states to support victims' programs and provide additional funding for national scope training and technical assistance and demonstration programs; (2) enhancing services for domestic victims of human trafficking; and (3) supporting the implementation strategies outlined in the Vision 21: Transforming Victim Services report. Whether the current direction for the U.S. human spaceflight program, established in October 2010 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-267 ), can be implemented successfully in a period of increased budgetary constraint, as well as the potential impact of human spaceflight's funding needs on the availability of funding for other National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) programs, such as science, aeronautics, and education. Whether and how to prioritize research initiatives at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Whether it should continue efforts to double funding at NSF and other targeted accounts as previously proposed by the Administration and authorized by Congress, and if so, at what pace. Whether it should have adopted the Administration's proposed government-wide science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education program reorganization and consolidation, including proposed changes at NSF, NASA, and the Department of Commerce. Whether to continue to restrict the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) from engaging in certain activities with China or any Chinese-owned company by prohibiting, with limited exceptions, the use of appropriated funds for such activities. Whether Congress should, per the Administration's proposal, have eliminated the restriction that prevents the Legal Services Corporation's funding from being used for class action suits. Whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has the resources it needs to carry out its mission in light of increased workloads for investigators that resulted from furloughs and a hiring freeze in FY2013. Whether Congress should have adopted the Administration's proposal to focus the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's funding on technical innovation and hiring of new staff to help reduce backlogs for pending discrimination cases. The Department of Commerce (Commerce Department) originated in 1903 with the establishment of the Department of Commerce and Labor. The separate Commerce Department was established on March 4, 1913. The department's responsibilities are numerous and quite varied; its activities center on five basic missions: (1) promoting the development of U.S. business and increasing foreign trade; (2) improving the nation's technological competitiveness; (3) encouraging economic development; (4) fostering environmental stewardship and assessment; and (5) compiling, analyzing, and disseminating statistical information on the U.S. economy and population. The following agencies within the Commerce Department carry out these missions: International Trade Administration (ITA) seeks to develop the export potential of U.S. firms and improve the trade performance of U.S. industry; Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) enforces U.S. export laws consistent with national security, foreign policy, and short-supply objectives; Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides grants for economic development projects in economically distressed communities and regions; Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) seeks to promote private- and public-sector investment in minority businesses; Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) , excluding the Census Bureau, provides (1) information on the state of the economy through preparation, development, and interpretation of economic data and (2) analytical support to department officials in meeting their policy responsibilities; Census Bureau , a component of ESA, collects, compiles, and publishes a broad range of economic, demographic, and social data; National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) advises the President on domestic and international communications policy, manages the federal government's use of the radio frequency spectrum, and performs research in telecommunications sciences; United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) examines and approves applications for patents for claimed inventions and registration of trademarks; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) assists industry in developing technology to improve product quality, modernize manufacturing processes, ensure product reliability, and facilitate rapid commercialization of products on the basis of new scientific discoveries; and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides scientific, technical, and management expertise to (1) promote safe and efficient marine and air navigation; (2) assess the health of coastal and marine resources; (3) monitor and predict the coastal, ocean, and global environments (including weather forecasting); and (4) protect and manage the nation's coastal resources.   Table 2 presents the following funding information for the Department of Commerce as a whole and for each of its agencies or bureaus: the amounts provided under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-76 ), the Administration's request for FY2015, the amount recommended by the House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations, and the FY2015-enacted amount. For FY2015, the Administration requested a total of $8.746 billion for the Department of Commerce, a proposed 6.9% increase over the FY2014-enacted appropriation of $8.181 billion. The House recommended a total of $8.231 billion for the Department of Commerce. The House's proposal was 0.6% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, but it was 5.9% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $8.556 billion for the Department of Commerce. The amount recommended by the committee was 4.6% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and 4.0% greater than the House recommended amount, but it was 2.2% less than the Administration's request. For FY2015 Congress appropriated $8.467 billion for the Department of Commerce. This amount is 3.5% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, 3.2% less than the Administration's request, 2.9% greater than the House-passed amount, and 1.0% less than the amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The International Trade Administration (ITA) provides export promotion services, works to ensure compliance with trade agreements, administers trade remedies such as antidumping and countervailing duties, and provides analytical support for ongoing trade negotiations. ITA's mission is to improve U.S. prosperity by strengthening the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promoting trade and investment, and ensuring compliance with trade laws and agreements. It strives to accomplish this through several organizational units. ITA went through a major organizational change in October 2013 in which it consolidated four organizational units into three more functionally aligned units. The new organizational units consist of the following: (1) the Industry and Analysis unit, which brings together ITA's industry, trade, and economic experts to advance the competitiveness of U.S. industries through the development and execution of international trade and investment policies and export promotion strategies; (2) the Enforcement and Compliance unit, which is responsible for safeguarding and enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. industries against unfair trade practices through the enforcement of U.S. trade laws and for ensuring compliance with U.S. free trade agreements; and (3) the Global Markets unit, which assists and advocates for U.S. businesses in international markets to help foster U.S. economic prosperity. ITA's fourth organizational unit, the Executive and Administrative Directorate, is responsible for providing policy leadership, information technology support, and administration services for all of ITA. To emphasize the agency's role in the complementary missions of export and business investment promotion, using both international advocacy and support for U.S. businesses at home, the Administration's FY2015 budget proposed to rename the agency the International Trade and Investment Administration (ITIA). ITA received $460.6 million in direct appropriations for FY2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, anticipated the collection of $9.4 million in user fees, which would have resulted in $470.0 million in total resources for ITA programs in FY2014. The Administration's FY2015 request for ITA in direct appropriations was $497.3 million, a proposed increase of 8.0%. The request proposed to double funding for the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC) to $15.0 million, for the purpose of accelerating ITEC operations. The Administration anticipated the collection of $9.4 million in user fees, which would have raised total available funds for ITA to $506.7 million. The House recommended $460.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA, an amount 7.5% less than the Administration's request and 0.1% less than the enacted amount for FY2014. The House anticipated the collection of $10.0 million in user fees, which would have raised total available funds to $470.0 million. The amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations in direct appropriations was $470.0 million. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, provides $462.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA, an amount 7.1% less than the Administration's request and 0.3% more than the enacted amount for FY2014. The act anticipates the collection of $10.0 million in user fees, which would result in $472.0 million in total resources for ITA programs in FY2015, with up to $9.0 million for ITEC operations and $10.0 million for the SelectUSA program. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administers export controls on dual-use goods and technology through its licensing and enforcement functions. It cooperates with other nations on export control policy and provides assistance to the U.S. business community to comply with U.S. and multilateral export controls. BIS also administers U.S. anti-boycott statutes and is charged with monitoring the U.S. defense industrial base. Authorization for the activities of BIS, the Export Administration Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq .), last expired in August 2001. On August 17, 2001, President George W. Bush invoked the authorities granted by the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) to continue in effect the system of controls contained in the act and in the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R., Parts 730-799), and these authorities have been renewed yearly.  BIS received $101.5 million for FY2014. The Administration's request for FY2015 was $110.5 million, a proposed 9.0% increase. The House recommended $103.5 million, including $56.5 million for export administration, $41.5 million for export enforcement, and $5.5 million for policy coordination. The recommendation included funding for the placement of additional control officers in Germany, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $105.5 million. P.L. 113-235 appropriated $102.5 million, a 1.0% increase from FY2014, but 7.3% less than the President requested.  The Economic Development Administration (EDA) was created pursuant to the enactment of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, with the objective of fostering growth in economically distressed areas characterized by high levels of unemployment and low per-capita income levels. Federally designated disaster areas and areas affected by military base realignment or closure (BRAC) are also eligible for EDA assistance. EDA provides grants for public works, economic adjustment in case of natural disasters or mass layoffs, technical assistance, planning, and research. EDA received $246.5 million for FY2014, including $209.5 million for EDA programs and activities and $37.0 million for salaries and expenses. The Administration's FY2015 budget request for FY2015 was $248.2 million, including $210.0 million for EDA program and activities and $38.2 million for salaries and expenses. The President's budget request would have shifted funding priorities among program activities, while leaving total EDA funding relatively unchanged. The proposed budget would have reduced what is EDA's most highly funded program, public works grants, from $96.0 million in FY2014 to $85.0 million in FY2015. It would have also reduced funding for Trade Adjustment Assistance from $15.0 million in FY2014 to $10.0 million in FY2015. The proposed budget for FY2015 would have placed greater emphasis on projects intended to support job creation through regional innovation clusters and economic adjustment assistance. For FY2015, the Administration proposed a $15.0 million increase in funding for the Regional Innovation Strategies and Science Parks Loan Guarantees Program, from $10.0 million in FY2014 to $25.0 million in FY2015. The Administration also requested a $5.5 million increase in funding for Economic Adjustment Assistance grants, from $42.0 million in FY2014 to $47.5 million in FY2015. The specific programs and their requested funding levels for FY2015, as well as the enacted FY2014 and FY2015 amounts, are shown in Table 3 . The House-passed version of H.R. 4660 recommended $247.5 million in total FY2015 funding for EDA. This total would have included a marginal increase in funding for EDA programs and activities, specifically, $1.0 million more than the $209.5 million appropriated for FY2014, and $0.5 million more than the $210.0 million requested by the Administration. The bill did not recommend funding for the Regional Innovation Program (RIP), which received an appropriation of $10.0 million in FY2014, although the Administration requested $25.0 million for FY2015 for RIP activities. Consistent with the amount appropriated in FY2014, the bill recommended $37.0 million for salaries and expenses, $1.2 million less than requested by the Administration.  In addition, the report ( H.Rept. 113-448 ) accompanying H.R. 4660 included language that would have directed EDA to address documentation deficiencies in the award selection process identified in a 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report; included $10.0 million for EDA to develop a comprehensive strategy designed to assist coal mining communities that had experienced significant job losses since 2011; directed EDA to use $5.0 million in Economic Adjustment Assistance to continue encouraging U.S. firms to relocate manufacturing and services jobs back to the United States; provided $5.0 million to fund Innovative Manufacturing loan guarantees; and encouraged EDA to support global competitiveness of small and medium-sized manufacturers through improved access to information technology, education, and training. The FY2015 CJS appropriations bill, S. 2437 , reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $232.0 million in funding for EDA programs and salaries and expenses. This was $14.5 million less than approved for FY2014, $16.2 million less than requested by the President, and $15.5 million less than approved in the House-passed bill. S. 2437 , as reported, recommended $5.0 million more in funding for Trade Adjustment Assistance than was requested by the Administration or recommended by the House. It also recommended significantly higher funding for public works activities than the amount appropriated in FY2014 or requested by the Administration or recommended by the House for FY2015. In addition, the report ( S.Rept. 113-181 ) accompanying the bill included language that would have provided access to an additional $40.0 million in prior-year recoveries and unobligated balances; directed EDA to address documentation deficiencies in the award selection process identified in a 2014 GAO report, consistent with language included in the report accompanying the House-passed bill; included $5.0 million to support loan guarantees used to finance science park infrastructure projects and directed EDA to submit status reports on the creation and implementation of loan guarantee programs to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations committees every 180 days; directed EDA to help identify and develop best practices to aid communities facing nuclear power plant closures; provided no additional funds for FY2015 in support of the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership Program; directed EDA to use $5.0 million in Economic Adjustment Assistance to continue encouraging U.S. firms to relocate manufacturing and services jobs back to the United States; provided $5.0 million to fund Innovative Manufacturing loan guarantees; and encouraged EDA to support global competitiveness of small and medium-sized manufacturers through improved access to information technology, education, and training. P.L. 113-235 provides a higher funding level ($250.0 million) for EDA program activities and related salaries and expenses than the amount appropriated in FY2014 ($246.5 million), requested by the President for FY2015 ($248.2 million), approved by the House ($247.5 million), or recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations ($232.0 million). Although P.L. 113-235 increases total funding for EDA programs and activities by $3.5 million more than the $209.5 million appropriated in FY2014, it leaves the level of funding for salaries and expenses unchanged from the $37.0 million appropriated in FY2014. P.L. 113-235 shifts funding among EDA programs, including lower funding for Economic Adjustment Assistance activities than appropriated in FY2014, requested by the Administration for FY2015, approved by the House, or recommended by the Senate committee. The explanatory statement accompanying the act, published in the December 11, 2014, Congressional Record , directs EDA to use up to $5.0 million to fund Regional Innovation Program planning grants for science park infrastructure; $5.0 million for projects to facilitate the relocation, to the United States, of sources of employment located outside the United States; $4.0 million for Innovative Manufacturing loan guarantees; and $10.0 million for Regional Innovation Program grants. The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), established by Executive Order 11625 on October 13, 1971, is charged with the lead role in coordinating all of the federal government's minority business programs. As part of its strategic plan, MBDA seeks to develop an industry-focused, data-driven, technical assistance approach to give minority business owners the tools essential for becoming first- or second-tier suppliers to private corporations and the federal government in the new procurement environment. Progress is measured in increased gross receipts, number of employees, and size and scale of firms associated with minority business enterprise. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, provided $28.0 million for the MBDA account. For FY2015, the Administration requested $28.3 million, a 1.0% increase, in MBDA funding. According to the budget justification document, this proposed funding level would have assisted in the creation of 7,500 new jobs and $3.000 billion in contracts and financing. The House-passed bill recommended $30.0 million for MBDA activities. This was $2.0 million more than appropriated for FY2014, and $1.7 million more than requested by the Administration. The bill reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations would have provided $28.3 million for MBDA activities and would have directed the agency to continue to work with the International Trade Administration to support efforts to increase export opportunities and export-related jobs for minority-owned businesses. P.L. 113-235 provides $30.0 million for MBDA activities.  The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) provides economic data, analysis, and forecasts to government agencies and, when appropriate, to the public. ESA includes the Census Bureau (discussed separately) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). ESA has three core missions: to maintain a system of economic data, to interpret and communicate information about the forces at work in the economy, and to support the information and analytical needs of the executive branch. Funding for ESA includes two primary accounts: ESA headquarters and BEA. ESA headquarters staff provide economic research and policy analysis in support of the Secretary of Commerce, as well as oversight of the Census Bureau and BEA. The BEA account funds BEA activities, among which are producing estimates of national gross domestic product and related measures. ESA received $99.0 million in FY2014. The Administration's FY2015 request for ESA was $111.0 million, a proposed $12.0 million (12.2%) increase over the FY2014-enacted amount. As passed by the House, H.R. 4660 would have provided $99.0 million for ESA, an amount identical to that enacted for FY2014 and 10.8% less than requested for FY2015. The Senate Committee on Appropriations' FY2015 recommendation for ESA was $106.0 million, 7.1% more than enacted for FY2014, 4.5% below the FY2015 request, and 7.1% more than the House approved. P.L. 113-235 provides $100.0 million for ESA, 1.0% more than it received in FY2014, 9.9% less than the FY2015 request, and 1.0% above the House-passed amount. The U.S. Constitution requires a population census every 10 years, to serve as the basis for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives. Decennial census data also are used for within-state redistricting and in certain formulas that determine the annual distribution of more than $450 billion in federal funds to states and localities. The Census Bureau, established as a permanent office on March 6, 1902, conducts the decennial census under Title 13 of the U.S. Code , which also authorizes the bureau to collect and compile a wide variety of other demographic, economic, housing, and governmental data. The Census Bureau's enacted FY2014 appropriation was $945.0 million, divided between the bureau's two major accounts: $252.0 million for salaries and expenses, and $693.0 million for periodic censuses and programs. The Administration's FY2015 requested appropriation for the bureau was $1.211 billion, including $248.0 million under salaries and expenses, and $963.4 million under periodic censuses and programs. Although the total request was 28.2% greater than the FY2014-enacted amount, the request for salaries and expenses was 1.6% less than this account received in FY2014, largely due to expected administrative savings. Periodic censuses and programs would have received 39.0% more than in FY2014, but $1.6 million of the appropriation for this account would have been transferred to the Office of Inspector General for activities related to audits and investigations of the bureau.  Under periodic censuses and programs, the 2020 decennial census program would have received $689.0 million, with $443.2 million for the 2020 census itself and $245.8 million for the American Community Survey (ACS). In FY2015, the bureau expects to complete the research and testing necessary to contain the cost of the next census. The ACS request included \"funding to restore field data collection costs associated with a one-month break in data collection at the beginning of ... FY2014, as well as ... to conduct research on content, quality, efficiency, and reducing respondent burden and intrusiveness.\" Also funded under the periodic censuses and programs account are the economic census and the census of governments, which would have received $119.3 million and $9.1 million, respectively. In FY2015, the bureau expects to analyze and release products from the 2012 economic census, and begin planning for the 2017 economic census and census of governments. The House approved $973.5 million in FY2015 funding for the Census Bureau under H.R. 4660 . Of this total, salaries and expenses would have received the requested $248.0 million, 1.6% less than enacted for FY2014. Periodic censuses and programs would have received $725.5 million, 4.7% more than in FY2014. House action on H.R. 4660 , however, including the adoption of five amendments that would have transferred funds from periodic censuses and programs to accounts outside the Census Bureau, would have left periodic programs with 24.7% less than requested. H.R. 4660 passed the House with an additional amendment ( H.Amdt. 752 , Poe) that would have prohibited the use of funds to enforce Title 13, U.S. Code , Section 221, with respect to the ACS. Currently, anyone who, for example, refused to answer ACS questions could face a possible penalty under this section. In reporting S. 2437 , the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1.149 billion for the bureau in FY2015. The $252.2 million recommended for salaries and expenses exceeded the FY2014-enacted amount by 0.1%, the FY2015 request by 1.7%, and the House-passed amount by 1.7%. At the committee's direction, the increase in this account was to have been used to expand the sample for the Current Population Survey's (CPS's) annual social and economic supplement, to permit comparisons with 2010 and 2013 baseline data. The committee recommended $896.7 million for periodic censuses and programs, 29.4% more than enacted for FY2014, 6.9% less than the FY2015 request, and 23.6% more than the House approved. The recommendation would have provided $1.6 million for oversight and audits of periodic censuses by the Office of Inspector General. Under P.L. 113-235 , the Census Bureau's FY2015 funding is $1.088 billion, 15.1% more than in FY2014, 10.2% less than requested for FY2015, 11.8% above the House-passed amount, and 5.3% less than recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. P.L. 113-235 provides $248.0 million for salaries and expenses, which is 1.6% below the FY2014-enacted amount, matches the FY2015 request and the House-passed amount, and is 1.7% less than the Senate committee recommended. The law directs the bureau, in the annual CPS social and economic supplement, to use the same health insurance questions used in previous years, as well as the revised questions first used in February 2014, and adopts by reference the Senate language about comparisons with 2010 and 2013 baseline data. The periodic censuses and programs account is funded at $840.0 million, 21.2% above the FY2014-enacted amount, 12.8% below the FY2015 request, 15.8% more than the House approved, and 6.3% less than the Senate committee recommended. P.L. 113-235 does not include the Poe amendment to H.R. 4660 , Section 545 of the House-passed bill. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is the executive branch's principal advisory office on domestic and international telecommunications and information policies. Its mandate is to provide greater access for all Americans to telecommunications services; support U.S. efforts to open foreign markets; advise on international telecommunications negotiations; and fund research for new technologies and their applications. It is also responsible for managing spectrum use by federal agencies and, as part of this responsibility, identifying federal radio frequency spectrum that can be transferred to commercial use through the auction of spectrum licenses, conducted by the Federal Communications Commission. The NTIA plays a central role in representing U.S. interests in the Internet internationally, including an active role in the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is an international entity that develops policies to support the Internet worldwide. The NTIA actively participates in ICANN as a member of the Governmental Advisory Committee, which provides advice to ICANN. The NTIA also currently contracts with ICANN to manage the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and to perform other duties. In March 2014, the NTIA announced its intention to relinquish its authority over ICANN to a multi-stakeholder community when its current contract expires in September 2015. Title VI of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-96 ) gives the NTIA responsibilities for improving public safety communications. It is required to assist the development of the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), created by Congress to deploy a nationwide public safety broadband network. It is also required to assist in planning for Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG9-1-1) services, which refers to the transition to digital, Internet-based systems to replace existing analog systems. For FY2015, Congress appropriated $38.2 million for NTIA salaries and expenses. The Administration had proposed $51.0 million. This would have been an increase of $5.0 million (10.9%) over the enacted FY2014 budget amount of $46.0 million. The NTIA attributed the requested increase to an increased focus on policy oversight in two key areas: formulating domestic and international policies, and expanding the availability of broadband communications.  The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $48.5 million for the NTIA in FY2015, $2.5 million, or 4.9%, below the Administration's request; the House proposed $36.7 million, $14.3 million, or 28.0%, less than what the Administration requested. The enacted budget of $38.2 million for FY2015 is $7.8 million, or 17.0%, less than enacted for FY2014. The FY2015 budget amount eliminates $12.3 million associated with the conclusion of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program grant awards but includes up to $3.0 million to provide broadband technical assistance to communities. The NTIA is required to provide at least 45 days' notice to the appropriate congressional committees regarding actions taken related to its role in ICANN or IANA, among other reporting requirements, and places constraints on spending. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) examines and approves applications for patents on claimed inventions and administers the registration of trademarks. It also helps other federal departments and agencies protect U.S. intellectual property in the global marketplace. The USPTO has a somewhat unique funding mechanism\u2014it is funded by user fees paid by customers that are designated as \"offsetting collections\" and subject to spending limits set by Congress. For FY2015, the Administration requested the authority to spend fee collections of $3.458 billion, to fund daily operations of $3.220 billion, and deposit the remainder into the USPTO's operating reserve. The $3.458 billion was to be a 14.4% increase from the enacted USPTO budget of $3.024 billion in fee collections for FY2014. The USPTO contended that the increase in fee authority would reduce patent pendency and backlog, increase efficiencies in examination capacity, and enhance patent and trademark quality of measurement, as well as yield other benefits. The final FY2015 appropriation for the USPTO ( P.L. 113-235 ) matches the Administration's request, and the amount recommended by the House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations, and provides $3.458 billion in budget authority for USPTO for the current fiscal year. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a laboratory of the Department of Commerce with a mandate to increase the competitiveness of U.S. companies through appropriate support for industrial development of pre-competitive, generic technologies and the diffusion of government-developed technological advances to users in all segments of the American economy. NIST research also provides the measurement, calibration, and quality assurance techniques that underpin U.S. commerce, technological progress, improved product reliability, manufacturing processes, and public safety. P.L. 113-235 provides total appropriations of $863.9 million for NIST in FY2015, $13.9 million (1.6%) above its FY2014 funding level, $36.1 million less than the President's request, $8.1 million more than the House-passed bill, and $36.1 million less than the Senate committee-recommended amount.  Funding for NIST is generally provided through three accounts: Scientific and Technical Research and Services (STRS), Industrial Technology Services (ITS), and Construction of Research Facilities (CRF). For the STRS account, P.L. 113-235 provides $675.5 million for FY2015, $24.5 million (3.8%) more than in FY2014, $4.5 million less than the request, $9.5 million less than the Senate committee-recommended amount, and $5.0 million more than the House-passed bill.  The act provides $138.1 million for the ITS account in support of two activities: the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program and the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia (AMTech). The act provides $130.0 million for MEP in FY2015, $2.0 million (1.6%) more than in FY2014, $11.0 million below the request and the Senate committee-recommended level, and the same as the House-passed level. The act provides $8.1 million for AMTech in FY2015, $6.9 million (46.0%) below the FY2014 level, request, and Senate committee-recommended level, and $8.1 million more than the House-passed amount.  The act provides $50.3 million for the CRF account, $5.7 million (10.2%) below the FY2014 level, $8.7 million less than the request and the Senate committee-recommended level, and $5.0 million less than the House-passed amount.  The Senate committee-recommended funding level for NIST for FY2015 was $900.0 million, $50.0 million (5.9%) more than in FY2014, an amount equal to the request, and $44.2 million more than the House-passed level. The Senate committee-recommended funding level for FY2015 for STRS was $685.0 million, $34.0 million more than in FY2014, $5.0 million more than the request, and $14.5 million more than the House-passed level; MEP was $141.0 million, $13.0 million more than the FY2014 level, the same as the request, and $11.0 million more than the House-passed level; AMTech was $15.0 million, an amount equal to the FY2014 level and the request, and $15.0 million more than the House-passed level; and CRF was $59.0 million, $3.0 million more than the FY2014 level, equal to the request, and $3.7 million more than the House-passed amount.  Total funding for NIST in the House-passed bill was $855.8 million, $5.8 million (0.7%) more than in FY2014 and $44.2 million less than the request. The House-passed bill funding level for STRS was $670.5 million, $19.5 million more than the FY2014 level and $9.5 million below the request; MEP was $130.0 million, $2.0 million more than in FY2014 and $11.0 million below the request; and CRF was $55.3 million, $0.7 million less than the FY2014 level and $3.7 million less than the request. The House-passed bill included no funding for AMTech or coordination of manufacturing innovation institutes. Total funding in the President's request for NIST was $900.0 million, $50.0 million (5.9%) more than the FY2014 level. The requested funding level for STRS was $680.0 million, an increase of $29.0 million above the FY2014 level. The requested amount included an increase of $3.5 million for measurement science standards for forensic science infrastructure, $7.5 million for cyber-physical systems, $5.0 million for advanced materials, $7.0 million for synthetic biology, and $6.0 million for a lab-to-market initiative focused broadly on mechanisms to improve federal technology transfer. The requested funding for: MEP was $141.0 million, $13.0 million more than in FY2014; AMTech was $15.0 million, equal to its FY2014 funding level; and CRF was $59.0 million, $3.0 million more than in FY2014.  The President also requested $5.0 million in funding for the coordination of manufacturing innovation institutes, which had received no funding in FY2014. The NIST STRS and construction accounts had been targeted for doubling in recent years by President George W. Bush and President Obama, and implicitly in authorization levels established in the America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ) and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ). Funding for coordination of manufacturing innovation institutes was intended to support sharing of best practices, reduction of redundant start-up operations, and strengthening of cross-institute collaborations. Though the President's proposed National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) program has not been authorized or funded, several NNMI-like institutes have been awarded funding. These centers are led by the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, with additional funding and/or support being provided by NIST, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies. In addition to the appropriations requested in the base budget, the Administration had proposed an Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative (OGSI), which it described as a \"fully paid ... roadmap for how and where additional investments should be made in both domestic priorities and national security.\" The $56.000 billion proposal included $2.400 billion in NIST funding for the President's proposed NNMI to establish up to 45 manufacturing innovation institutes. In his FY2013 and FY2014 budgets, the President proposed $1.000 billion in mandatory funding for the NNMI to establish up to 15 institutes. The OGSI also sought an additional $115.0 million in funding for NIST research and development capabilities and facilities.  Under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-96 ), NIST is authorized $300.0 million from the proceeds of spectrum auctions devoted to the Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund. These funds are to be used to conduct public safety wireless communications research and development. According to NIST, the laboratory would receive the first $100.0 million after successful spectrum auctions of $7.200 billion or more, and would receive an additional $200.0 million if spectrum auctions net more than $27.600 billion. P.L. 113-76 appropriated $850.0 million in FY2014 funding for NIST. This amount included $651.0 million for the STRS account, $128.0 million for MEP, $15.0 million for AMTech, and $56.0 for the CRF account. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducts scientific research in areas such as ecosystems, climate, global climate change, weather, and oceans; supplies information on the oceans and atmosphere; and manages coastal and marine resources. NOAA was created in 1970 by Reorganization Plan No. 4. The reorganization plan was designed to unify a number of the nation's environmental activities and to provide a systematic approach for monitoring, analyzing, and protecting the environment. NOAA's current administrative structure has evolved into five line offices, which include the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS); the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); the National Ocean Service (NOS); the National Weather Service (NWS); and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR). In addition to NOAA's five line offices, Program Support (PS), a cross-cutting budget activity, includes the NOAA Education Program, Corporate Services, Facilities, and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, provided $5.315 billion for NOAA. The Administration's FY2015 request would have funded NOAA at $5.489 billion, which would have been a 3.3% increase over the FY2014 appropriation. The House-passed bill would have provided $5.337 billion for NOAA, an amount which would have been 0.4% more than the FY2014 appropriation, but 2.8% less than the Administration's FY2015 request. The amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations was $5.420 billion, which would have been 2.0% more than the FY2014 appropriation level, 1.3% less than the Administration's FY2015 request, and 1.6% more than the amount in the House-passed bill. P.L. 113-235 funds NOAA at $5.441 billion, which is 2.4% more than the FY2014 appropriation, 0.9% less than the FY2015 request, 1.9% more than the amount in the House-passed bill, and 0.4% more than the funding level recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations.  The NOAA budget is divided into two main accounts: Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction (PAC); and Operations, Research, and Facilities (ORF). For FY2015, the Administration requested $3.361 billion for the ORF account, which would have been 2.7% more than the FY2014 appropriation of $3.272 billion. The House-passed bill would have provided $3.217 billion for the ORF account, which was 1.7% less than the FY2014 appropriation and 4.3% less than the Administration's FY2015 request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $3.345 billion for the ORF account, which was 2.2% more than the FY2014 appropriation, 0.5% less than the Administration's request, and 4.0% more than the House-passed bill. The FY2015 CJS appropriations act funds ORF at $3.318 billion, which is 1.4% more than the FY2014 appropriation,1.3% less than the FY2015 request, 3.1% more than the House-passed bill, and 0.8% less than the funding level recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations.  For FY2015, the Administration requested $2.206 billion for the PAC account, which would have been 9.1% more than the FY2014 appropriation of $2.023 billion. The House-passed bill would have provided $2.176 billion for the PAC account, which was 7.6% more than the FY2014 appropriation, but 1.4% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.132 billion for the PAC account, which would have been 5.4% more than the FY2014 appropriation, 3.4% less than the Administration's request, and 2.0% less than the House approved. The FY2015 CJS appropriations act funds PAC at $2.179 billion, which is 7.7% more than the FY2014 appropriation,1.2% less than the FY2015 request, 0.1% more than the amount in the House-passed bill, and 2.2% more than the funding level recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations.  The Administration also requested $50.4 million to fund Other Fisheries Activities and -$6.0 million for the Fisheries Finance Program Account. The FY2015 CJS appropriations act funds Other Fisheries Activities at $65.4 million and the Fisheries Finance Program Account at -$6.0 million. These amounts are the same as the funding levels included in the House-passed bill and recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The FY2015 appropriation for Other Fisheries Activities includes $65.0 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund and $350,000 for the Fishermen's Contingency Fund. The Administration's FY2015 request for NESDIS satellite systems acquisition and construction was $2.057 billion, which would have been 8.5% more than the FY2014 appropriation of $1.896 billion. The House-passed bill would have provided $2.032 billion for satellite systems, which was 7.2% more than the FY2014 appropriation, but 1.2% less than Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding satellite systems at $1.987 billion, which would have been 4.8% more than the FY2014 appropriation, 3.4% less than the Administration's request, and 2.2% less than the House approved. The FY2015 CJS appropriations act funds satellite systems acquisition and construction at $2.036 billion, which is 7.4% more than the FY2014 appropriation,1.0% less than the FY2015 request, 0.2% more than the amount in the House-passed bill, and 2.4% more than the funding level recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. FY2015 funding for NESDIS satellite systems acquisition and construction is 93.4% of PAC account funding and 37.4% of the total NOAA appropriation. Most satellite funding is provided for the Geostationary Operation Environmental Satellite (GOES-R) program ($980.8 million) and the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) ($916.3 million). The appropriations agreement reiterates House and Senate Committees on Appropriations language that directs NOAA to provide quarterly updates regarding the satellite portfolio and steps being taken to address any potential gaps in weather satellite coverage. In addition to the funding requested for the FY2015 budget, NOAA would have received funding from the Administration's Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative and the Climate Resilience Fund (CRF). The initiative would have provided $180.0 million for expanded weather, climate, and oceans observations and research. The CRF would have provided $25.0 million for oceanic and atmospheric research grants to improve understanding of the effects of climate change on various sectors, and $50.0 million to improve coastal resilience by awarding competitive grants to state, local, and tribal governments and nonprofit organizations. It is possible that some activities related to these areas have been funded in FY2015, but it is not possible to determine specific programs or funding levels solely attributable to these initiatives. Established by an act of 1870 with the Attorney General at its head, DOJ provides counsel for the government in federal cases and protects citizens through law enforcement. It represents the federal government in all proceedings, civil and criminal, before the Supreme Court. In legal matters, generally, the department provides legal advice and opinions, upon request, to the President and executive branch department heads. The major functions of DOJ agencies and offices are described below. United States Attorneys prosecute criminal offenses against the United States; represent the federal government in civil actions; and initiate proceedings for the collection of fines, penalties, and forfeitures owed to the United States. United States Marshals Service (USMS) provides security for the federal judiciary, protects witnesses, executes warrants and court orders, manages seized assets, detains and transports unsentenced prisoners, and apprehends fugitives. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigates violations of federal criminal law; helps protect the United States against terrorism and hostile intelligence efforts; provides assistance to other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies; and shares jurisdiction with Drug Enforcement Administration over federal drug violations. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigates federal drug law violations; coordinates its efforts with state, local, and other federal law enforcement agencies; develops and maintains drug intelligence systems; regulates legitimate controlled substances activities; and conducts joint intelligence-gathering activities with foreign governments. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) enforces federal law related to the manufacture, importation, and distribution of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. It was transferred from the Department of the Treasury to DOJ by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ). Federal Prison System ( Bureau of Prisons, BOP ) provides for the custody and care of the federal prison population, the maintenance of prison-related facilities, and the boarding of sentenced federal prisoners incarcerated in state and local institutions. Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) coordinates legislative and other initiatives relating to violence against women and administers grant programs to help prevent, detect, and stop violence against women, including domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Office of Justice Programs (OJP) manages and coordinates the activities of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Institute of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, and the Office of Victims of Crime. Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) advances the practice of community policing by awarding grants to law enforcement agencies to hire and train community policing professionals, acquire and deploy crime-fighting technologies, and develop and test innovative policing strategies. Most crime control has traditionally been a state and local responsibility. With the passage of the Crime Control Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-351), however, the federal role in the administration of criminal justice has increased incrementally. Since 1984, Congress has approved five major omnibus crime control bills, designating new federal crimes, penalties, and additional law enforcement assistance programs for state and local governments. The FY2014-enacted appropriation for DOJ was $27.737 billion. The Administration requested a total of $27.974 billion for DOJ for FY2015 (see Table 4 ), which was a proposed 0.9%, or $237.0 million, increase over the FY2014-enacted appropriation. The Administration noted that DOJ would have received additional funding, though it did not specify what amount, under the proposed OGSI for the following purposes: investments in state and local justice assistance grants, including additional resources for the Comprehensive School Safety program and a new youth investment initiative; activating newly constructed or purchased prisons; and investigating and prosecuting financial fraud. The House-passed bill would have provided a total of $28.162 billion for the DOJ, an amount that would have been 1.5% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and 0.7% greater than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a total of $27.997 billion for the DOJ, an amount that was 0.9% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, 0.1% more than the Administration's request, but 0.6% less than the amount recommended by the House. The FY2015 appropriation for the DOJ is $27.030 billion, which is 2.5% below the FY2014 appropriation, 3.4% less than the Administration's request, 4.0% less than the House-passed amount, and 3.5% below the amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The General Administration account provides funds for salaries and expenses for the Attorney General's office, the Inspector General's office, and other programs designed to ensure that the collaborative efforts of DOJ agencies are coordinated to help represent the government and fight crime as efficiently as possible. The FY2014-enacted appropriation for the General Administration Account was $533.2 million. The Administration's FY2015 request included $590.3 million for General Administration, 10.7% more than the FY2014 appropriation. The House-passed bill would have provided $536.6 million for General Administration, 0.6% more than the FY2014 enacted amount but 9.1% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $576.5 for General Administration, 2.3% less than the Administration's request, but 8.1% more than the FY2014 appropriation and 7.4% more than the House-passed amount. The FY2015 appropriation for the General Administration account is $573.0 million. This amount is 2.9% less than the Administration requested and 0.6% less than the Senate Committee recommended, but it is 7.5% more than the FY2014 enacted appropriation and 6.8% more than the House-passed amount. The General Administration account includes funding for Salaries and Expenses for DOJ administration as well as for Justice Information Sharing Technology. Prior to the National Drug Intelligence Center's (NDIC's) closure, it was funded through the General Administration account. In addition, this account previously funded Law Enforcement Wireless Communications before funding for related activities was shifted to the FBI.  The FY2014 appropriation for Salaries and Expenses for DOJ administration and for Justice Information Sharing Technology was $135.8 million. The Administration's FY2015 request included nearly $154.7 million for these activities, 13.9% more than the FY2014 appropriation. The House-passed bill would have provided $116.6 million for this account, 14.1% less than the FY2014 enacted amount and 24.6% below the Administration's requested level. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $140.8 million for this account, 3.7% more than the FY2014 enacted amount, 9.0% less than that recommended by the Senate Committee, and 20.7% more than the House-passed amount. The FY2015 appropriation for DOJ administration Salaries and Expenses and for Justice Information Sharing Technology is $137.3. This amount is 11.2% less than the Administration requested and 2.5% less than the Senate Committee recommended, but it is 1.1% more than the FY2014 enacted appropriation and 17.7% more than the House-passed amount.  Administrative Review and Appeals (ARA) includes the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) and the Office of the Pardon Attorney (OPA). The Attorney General is responsible for the review and adjudication of immigration cases in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) efforts to secure the nation's borders. The EOIR handles these matters, and the OPA receives and reviews petitions for executive clemency. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided $311.0 million for ARA. The Administration's FY2015 request included $347.0 million for these activities, a proposed increase of 11.6% over the FY2014 appropriation. The Administration's request included an increase of $22.6 million to help the EOIR adjudicate an increasing immigration court caseload. The DOJ reported that the number of matters pending adjudication rose 57% from the end of FY2009 to the end of FY2013. Also, there were 249 EOIR immigration judges at the end of January 2014, down from a high of 272 in mid-December, 2010. In addition, DOJ reported that about one-third of immigration judges will be eligible to retire in FY2014. The proposed increase included $17.0 million to support an additional 35 Immigration Judge Teams and 15 Board of Immigration Appeals attorneys to help adjudicate rising immigration court caseloads; $2.8 million to expand EOIR's Legal Orientation Program (LOP), which improves immigration court proceedings by educating detained alien's about their rights and the overall process; and another $2.8 million to allow EOIR to continue the development and expansion of its pilot program that provides counsel to vulnerable populations, such as unaccompanied alien children. The House-passed bill would have provided $332.0 million for ARA, 6.8% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, but 4.3% less than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill would have provided $347.1 million for ARA, an amount equal to the Administration's request, but 4.5% less than the House-passed amount. The FY2015 appropriation for ARA is $347.1 million, equal to the Administration's request. The joint explanatory statement to accompany P.L. 113-235 notes that the appropriated amount includes funding for 35 additional Immigration Judge Teams.  The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is responsible for detecting and deterring waste, fraud, and abuse involving DOJ programs and personnel; promoting economy and efficiency in DOJ operations; and investigating allegations of departmental misconduct. The FY2014 enacted appropriation for the OIG was $86.4 million. The Administration's FY2015 request included nearly $88.6 million for the OIG, 2.5% more than the amount provided through the FY2014 appropriation. The House-passed bill would have provided $88.0 million for the OIG, 1.9% more than the FY2014 enacted amount but 0.7% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended nearly $88.6 million for the OIG, 2.5% more than the FY2014 enacted appropriation, the same amount as the Administration's request, and 0.7% more than the amount in the House-passed bill. The FY2015 appropriation for the OIG is nearly $88.6 million, equal to the Administration's request and to the amount recommended by the Senate Committee, though 2.5% more than the FY2014 enacted amount and 0.7% more than the House-passed amount.  The U.S. Parole Commission adjudicates parole requests for prisoners who are serving felony sentences under federal and District of Columbia code violations. The commission received $12.6 million for FY2014. The Administration's request for the commission for FY2015 was $13.3 million, a proposed increase of 5.6%. The House-passed bill included $13.3 million for the commission, which was equal to the Administration's request and 5.6% greater than the FY2014 appropriation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $13.3 million for the commission, the same as the amount recommended by the House. Congress appropriated $13.3 million for the commission for FY2015, an amount that is equal to the Administration's request and the amount recommended by the House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The Legal Activities account includes several subaccounts: general legal activities, U.S. Attorneys, and other legal activities. The FY2014 enacted appropriation provided nearly $3.181 billion for Legal Activities. The Administration's FY2015 request included almost $3.267 billion for this account, 2.7% more than the FY2014 appropriation. The House-passed bill would have provided $3.230 billion for Legal Activities, 1.5% more than the FY2014 enacted amount but 1.1% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended nearly $3.241 billion for Legal Activities for FY2015, 1.9% more than the FY2014 enacted amount, 0.8% less than the Administration's request, and 0.3% more than the House-passed amount. The FY2015 enacted amount for Legal Activities is $3.220 billion, 1.2% more than the FY2014 enacted amount, though 1.4% less than the Administration's request, 0.3% less than the House-passed amount, and 0.6% less than the Senate Committee-recommended amount.  The General Legal Activities account funds the Solicitor General's supervision of the department's conduct in proceedings before the Supreme Court. It also funds several departmental divisions (tax, criminal, civil, environment and natural resources, legal counsel, civil rights, INTERPOL, and dispute resolution). The FY2014 appropriation provided $867.0 million for General Legal Activities. The Administration's FY2015 request included nearly $935.9 million for this account, 7.9% over the FY2014 appropriation. The House-passed bill would have provided $884.1 million for General Legal Activities, 2.0% more than the FY2014 enacted amount but 5.5% below the Administration's requested level. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $915.0 million for this account, 5.5% more than the FY2014 enacted amount, 2.2% below the Administration's requested amount, and 3.5% more than the House-passed amount. The FY2015 enacted amount for the General Legal Activities account is $885.0 million, 2.1% more than the FY2014 enacted amount and 0.1% more than the House-passed amount, though 5.4% below the Administration's requested amount and 3.3% below the Senate Committee recommended level. As a part of its FY2015 budget request for this account, the Administration proposed a $2.6 million increase for the criminal division for 25 new positions to help the division combat cybercrime. According to the Administration, the additional funding would have increased the criminal division's capabilities in four areas: \"cybercrime investigations and prosecutions; advice and advocating legal tools and authorities; international cooperation and outreach; and forensic support.\"  The Administration also requested a $19.6 million increase for the criminal division as a part of the Administration's Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) reform efforts. MLAT requests are the way in which countries request assistance in obtaining evidence located in a foreign country for criminal investigations and proceedings located in another country, and, according to the Administration, difficulties in obtaining evidence through the MLAT process is starting to frustrate many of the United States' foreign law enforcement partners. The Administration is concerned that continued delays with processing MLAT requests could have adverse consequences for U.S. law enforcement, including, but not limited to, foreign countries reducing their compliance with MLAT requests and their cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies. The requested funding for the criminal division would be used to centralize the handling of MLAT requests, primarily through the division's Office of International Affairs (OIA); eliminating the backlog of pending cases; and enhancing the technological resources supporting the MLAT process and OIA's core functions. The FY2015 enacted amount does not include additional funding for these activities. The U.S. Attorneys enforce federal laws through prosecution of criminal cases and represent the federal government in civil actions in all of the 94 federal judicial districts. For FY2015, the President's budget request included $1.955 billion for the U.S. Attorneys, a proposed increase of 0.6% over the Office's FY2014 appropriation ($1.944 billion). Under the Administration's \"Smart on Crime Initiative,\" the FY2015 budget request included $15.0 million in reallocated resources to leverage efforts to lower recidivism through reentry courts, drug or other specialized courts, diversion programs, and prevention outreach. The request also included $1.3 million for MLAT reform. The objective of this reform is to strengthen law enforcement and administration of justice partnerships with foreign government, especially with regard to cyber security threats.  The House-passed bill would have provided the U.S. Attorneys with $1.971 billion for FY2015. This amount was 1.4% more than the FY2014 enacted appropriation and 0.8% more than the Administration's FY2015 request. The Senate-committee reported bill included $1.950 billion for the U.S. Attorneys, an amount that was 0.3% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, but 0.3% less than the Administration's request and 1.1% below the House-passed amount. The FY2015 appropriation for the U.S. Attorneys is $1.960 billion, which is 0.8% more than the FY2014 appropriation, 0.2% greater than the Administration's request, 0.5% more than the Senate-committee reported about, but 0.6% less than the House-recommended amount. In the joint explanatory statement to accompany P.L. 113-235 , the appropriators note that Congress provided funding for the U.S. Attorneys to enhance its MLAT processing and backlog reduction. Other Legal Activities includes the Antitrust Division, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund, the U.S. Trustee System Fund (which is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the U.S. bankruptcy system by, among other things, prosecuting criminal bankruptcy violations), the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, the Fees and Expenses of Witnesses, the Community Relations Service, and the Assets Forfeiture Fund. The FY2014 enacted appropriation included $369.8 million for the Other Legal Activities account. The Administration's FY2015 request included nearly $375.9 million for this account, 1.6% more than the FY2014 appropriation. The House-passed bill would have provided $374.9 million for Other Legal Activities, 1.4% more than the FY2014 enacted amount, but 0.3% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended nearly $375.9 million for this account, the same amount as requested by the Administration. The FY2015 enacted amount is almost $375.2 for Other Legal Activities, 0.2% less than the amount requested by the Administration and recommended by the Senate Committee, but 1.4% more than the FY2014 enacted amount and 0.1% more than the House-passed amount. The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) is responsible for the protection of the federal judicial process, including protecting judges, attorneys, witnesses, and jurors. In addition, the USMS provides physical security in courthouses, safeguards witnesses, transports prisoners from court proceedings, apprehends fugitives, executes warrants and court orders, and seizes forfeited property.  The USMS received a total of $2.728 billion under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, of which $1.185 billon was for the Salaries and Expenses (S&E) account and $1.533 billion was for the Federal Prisoner Detention account. For FY2015, the Administration requested a total of $2.790 billion for the USMS, which was 2.3% greater than the FY2014-enacted appropriation. The entire proposed increase for the USMS was the result of the Administration requesting $1.595 billion for the Federal Prisoner Detention account. The proposed increase in funding for the Federal Prisoner Detention account reflected the increased cost of the federal detention population. The Administration requested additional funding to help ensure that the USMS can pay for housing, medical, and transportation costs for the USMS detainee population. The USMS noted that expansion of illegal immigration enforcement activities along the southwest border has increased the service's workload in the region. The House-passed bill would have provided a total of $2.804 billion for the USMS, an amount that was 2.8% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and 0.5% greater than the Administration's request. The House recommended $1.199 billion for the USMS's S&E account (1.2% greater than the Administration's request) and $1.595 billion for the Federal Prisoner Detention account, which was equal to the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill included $2.790 billion for the USMS, an amount that was 2.3% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, equal to the Administration's request, and 0.5% below the amount in the House-passed bill. The amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations included $1.185 billion for the S&E account and $1.595 billion for the Federal Prisoner Detention account. The FY2015 appropriation for the USMS is $1.700 billion, which includes $1.195 billion for the S&E account and $495.3 million for the Federal Prisoner Detention Account. The FY2015 appropriation is 37.7% less than the FY2014 appropriation, 39.1% less than the Administration's request, 39.4% below the amount recommended by the House, and 39.1% below the Senate Committee on Appropriation's mark. However, P.L. 113-235 directs $1.100 billion in unobligated balances from the DOJ's Assets Forfeiture account to be transferred to the Federal Prisoner Detention account, which means the total budgetary resources available to the USMS for FY2015 is $2.800 billion. One issue Congress considered while it debated FY2015 funding for the USMS is whether it has the resources it needs in light of its expanded mission. As discussed previously, for FY2015 the Administration did not request an increase in funding for the number of positions funded by the USMS's Salaries and Expenses account. In addition to the increased workload along the Southwest border, the USMS reported that since 2000, it has been required to assist state and local law enforcement agencies with apprehending dangerous fugitives; has faced increasing demand for high-level security related to more federal terrorism-related prosecutions; and has been required to assist with the location and apprehension of individuals who fail to register as sex offenders. Congress did provide a 0.8% increase in the USMS's S&E account compared to the FY2014 appropriation. The joint explanatory statement to accompany P.L. 113-235 states that Congress wants the USMS to continue to carry out activities to implement the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-248 ) at no less than the FY2014 level. The National Security Division (NSD) coordinates DOJ's national security and terrorism missions through law enforcement investigations and prosecutions. The NSD was established in DOJ in response to the recommendations of the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD Commission), and authorized by Congress on March 9, 2006, in the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-177 ). Under the NSD, DOJ resources of the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review and the Criminal Division's Counterterrorism and Counterespionage Sections were consolidated to coordinate all intelligence-related resources and to ensure that criminal intelligence information is shared, as appropriate. For FY2015, the President's budget request included $91.8 million for the NSD, the same amount as appropriated by Congress for FY2014.  The House-passed bill would have provided the NSD with $94.8 million for FY2015. This amount was 3.3% more than either the FY2014 enacted appropriation or the Administration's FY2015 request. The Senate committee-reported bill included $91.8 million for the NSD, an amount equal to the Administration's request and 3.2% below the House-passed amount. The FY2015 appropriation for the NSD is $93.0 million, which is 1.3% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and the Administration's request, but 1.9% below the House-passed amount. The Interagency Law Enforcement account reimburses departmental agencies for their participation in the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program. Organized into nine regional task forces, this program combines the expertise of federal agencies with the efforts of state and local law enforcement to disrupt and dismantle major narcotics-trafficking and money-laundering organizations. From DOJ, the federal agencies that participate in OCDETF are the DEA; the FBI; the ATF; the USMS; the Tax and Criminal Divisions of DOJ; and the U.S. Attorneys. From the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Coast Guard participate in OCDETF. In addition, from the Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Office of Enforcement also participate in OCDETF. Moreover, state and local law enforcement agencies participate in approximately 90% of all OCDETF investigations.  The FY2014 enacted amount for the Interagency Law Enforcement account was $514.0 million. For FY2015, the Administration requested $505.0 million for this account, 1.8% less than the FY2014 appropriation. The House-passed bill would have provided $519.0 million for this account, 1.0% greater than the FY2014 enacted level and 2.8% greater than the Administration's requested amount. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $505.0 million for the Interagency Law Enforcement account, the same amount as requested by the Administration. The FY2015 enacted amount is nearly $507.2 million for this account, 1.3% less than the FY2014 enacted amount and 2.3% less than the House-passed amount, but 0.4% more than the Administration's request and Senate Committee recommended amount. The FBI is the lead federal investigative agency charged with defending the country against foreign terrorist and intelligence threats; enforcing federal laws; and providing leadership and criminal justice services to federal, state, municipal, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies and partners. Since the September 11, 2001 (9/11), terrorist attacks, the FBI has reorganized and reprioritized its efforts to focus on preventing terrorism and related criminal activities. From FY2001 to FY2015, Congress has nearly tripled direct appropriations for the FBI from $3.32 billion to $8.44 billion, or a 154% increase.  The House-passed bill would have provided the FBI with $8.468 billion for FY2015. This amount was 1.5% more than the amount Congress appropriated for the FBI for FY2014, and it was 1.4% more than the Administration's FY2015 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $8.385 billion for the FBI for FY2015. This amount was 0.5% more than both the FY2014 enacted amount and the Administration's FY2015 request. P.L. 113-235 provides 8.437 billion for the FBI, an amount 1.1% greater than both the FY2014 enacted amount and the President's FY2015 request. P.L. 113-235 includes $1.0 million to complete an ongoing review of the FBI's implementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. In addition, Congress specifies $8.5 million for the Nation Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC), and states that NGIC will coordinate intelligence on human trafficking. In addition, Congress states that NGIC \"shall include a National Sex Trafficking Threat Assessment reflecting detailed analysis of the trafficking carried out by gang organizations\" and directs NGIC to provide a briefing to appropriations committees not later than 180 days after enactment of P.L. 113-235 . The Administration's request included an increase of $15 million to fund operations and maintenance of the new Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC) facility in Alabama. While not providing this requested increase, in the language of P.L. 113-235 , Congress outlines the duties of TEDAC and directs DOJ to \"designate a single entity to lead the Counter IED [Improvised Explosive Devices] effort\" and requires DOJ to report to Congress within 30 days of enactment of P.L. 113-235 on the status of this designation. Congress also requested that DOJ describe its efforts to prevent duplicative actions in this area and ensure coordination and colaboration. In addition to these directives, Congress directs the FBI to prioritize sustaining financial and mortgage fraud investigations at not less than the FY2014 level. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the only single-mission federal agency tasked with enforcing the nation's controlled substance laws in order to reduce the availability and abuse of illicit drugs and the diversion of licit drugs for illicit purposes. DEA's enforcement efforts include the disruption and dismantling of drug trafficking and money laundering organizations through drug interdiction and seizures of illicit revenues and assets derived from these organizations. DEA continues to face evolving challenges in limiting the supply of illicit drugs as well as reducing drug trafficking from Mexico across the Southwest border into the United States. DEA plays a key role in the Administration's Southwest Border Initiative to counter drug-related border violence, focusing on the convergent threats of illegal drugs, drug-related violence, and terrorism in the region. DEA also has an active role in the Administration's Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan, targeting improper prescribing practices and promoting proper disposal of unused prescription drugs. The DEA received $2.018 billion for FY2014. The Administration's FY2015 budget request for the DEA proposed to maintain FY2014 appropriation levels at $2.018 billion. The House recommended $2.048 billion for the DEA, a proposed 1.5% increase over both the FY2014 enacted amount and the Administration's FY2015 requested amount. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $2.018 billion for the DEA for FY2015. This amount was equal to both the FY2014 enacted amount and the Administration's FY2015 request. The FY2015 enacted amount for the DEA is 2.033 billion, an amount 0.8% higher than both the FY2014 enacted amount and the Administration's FY2015 request. Of note, while the DEA highlights the recent rise in heroin abuse in the United States in their FY2015 Congressional budget submission, the Administration did not request additional funding to address this issue. The DEA combats the nation's supply of heroin through international and domestic enforcement and state and local assistance. In the report to accompany H.R. 4660 , the House Committee on Appropriations had expressed concern over the increase in prescription drug and heroin abuse, and directed the DEA to report on ways to address prescription drug and heroin abuse and provide more data on the numbers of heroin investigations. In an effort to curtail federal interference with state medical marijuana laws, Congress enacted as part of the FY2015 Appropriations Act language that prohibits DOJ from using funds provided in the act to \"prevent\" 32 states and the District of Columbia from \"implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.\" While media outlets and others have characterized this language as preventing DEA and other DOJ agencies from enforcing federal marijuana laws in states listed in the appropriations law, it remains unclear whether this language will stop DOJ from prosecuting individuals who are in compliance with state law but violating federal law (the Controlled Substances Act).  The FY2015 appropriations act included another change that may possibly affect the DEA's operations. P.L. 113-235 prohibits the use of funds \"in contravention of section 7606 (\"Legitimacy of Industrial Hemp Research\") of the Agricultural Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-79 ) by the Department of Justice or the Drug Enforcement Administration.\" Under the CSA, hemp is considered a Schedule I controlled substance, and there are strict controls on its production and the security conditions under which it may be grown; it is illegal to grow without a DEA permit. The Agricultural Act of 2014 included a provision allowing certain research institutions and also state departments of agriculture to grow industrial hemp, if allowed under state laws where the institution or state department of agriculture is located. The ATF enforces federal criminal law related to the manufacture, importation, and distribution of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. ATF works independently and through partnerships with industry groups; international, state, and local governments; and other federal agencies to investigate and reduce crime involving firearms and explosives, acts of arson, and illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products. From FY2001 through FY2014, Congress has increased the direct appropriation for ATF, from $771.0 million to $1.179 billion, a 52.9% increase.  For FY2015, Congress has appropriated ATF $1.201 billion, an increase of 1.9% over the amount appropriated by Congress for FY2014 ($1.179 billion), and nearly the same amount as requested by the Administration (less $4,000). According to DOJ, this increase ($22.0 million) is intended to allow ATF to improve its firearms enforcement and regulatory efforts. According to the Attorney General, DOJ was \"taking a hard look\" at federal laws and enforcement priorities to ensure that everything possible is being done to prevent drug traffickers and other criminals from acquiring firearms.  The House-passed bill would have provided ATF with $1.114 billion for FY2015. This amount was 5.5% less than the amount appropriated by Congress for FY2014, and was 7.2% less than the Administration's FY2015 request. Report language indicated that the House Committee on Appropriations had yet to receive a briefing and a report that are required as part of ATF's FY2014 appropriation. The briefing was to be on appropriations allocated by ATF for gun law enforcement in the following areas:  1. violent crime enforcement, 2. firearms regulatory efforts, 3. firearms tracing, and 4. ballistic imaging.  The report was to be on ATF's tobacco law enforcement posture and related appropriations allocations. Finally, the Committee voiced concern about increasing processing times (backlogs) for applications submitted under the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA), and applications for dealer, manufacturer, and importer licenses submitted under the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA). The Senate-reported bill would have appropriated ATF nearly the same amount as in the FY2015 request. Senate-report language indicated that the Committee on Appropriations supports ATF efforts to enforce existing firearms laws and combat weapons trafficking on the Southwest border. Senate report language also calls on the agency to report back to the Committee on its to efforts to see that federal law enforcement agencies submit ballistics evidence recovered at crime scenes to the ATF-administered National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN). Finally, Senate report language directed ATF to allocate $4.0 million in existing resources to advance the mission the National Center for Explosives Training and Research (NCETR) and to restart advanced training courses for arson investigators and bomb technicians. The FY2015 budget request collapsed the ATF budget decision units from three to two. For example, the ATF Congressional Budget Submission showed the FY2012 appropriation included $1.113 billion, which was allocated as follows: 1. Firearms ($876.7 million); 2. Arson & Explosives ($224.4 million); and 3. Alcohol & Tobacco ($12.0 million). By comparison the FY2014 appropriation ($1.179 billion) and FY2015 request ($1.201 billion) were shown allocated as follows: 1. Law Enforcement Operations ($1.019 billion for FY2014, and $1.039 billion for FY2015); and 2. Investigative Support Services ($159.5 million for FY2014, and $162.5 million for FY2015). Arguably, this new budget decision unit alignment could make it much more difficult for Congress to determine ATF's budget priorities for regulating the industries under its purview. In addition, the House-passed bill included several domestic gun control provisions directly related to ATF operations. These provisions included the following: Section 215 would have prohibited any federal agent from facilitating the transfer of an operable firearm to any individual associated with a drug cartel, unless that firearm were to be continuously monitored or under the federal agent's control at all times; Section 517 would have addressed the export of certain firearms parts and accessories to Canada; Section 518 would have addressed the importation of \"curios or relics\" firearms, parts, or ammunition; Section 533 would have prevented ATF from levying new restrictions on the importation of shotguns; and Section 539 would have prohibited the Attorney General from collecting multiple rifle and shotgun sales reports. With the exception of section 539, the Senate-reported bill included parallel provisions. Like last year, however, the House-passed bill included \"futurity\" language (\"in the current fiscal year and any fiscal year thereafter\") in sections 517 and 518, which appeared to be intended to make them permanent law. This \"futurity\" language was not included in last year's Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-76 ), the Senate-reported bill for FY2015, nor the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ). Section 539 of the House bill was not included in P.L. 113-235 , either.  It is noteworthy that on July 31, 2013, the Senate confirmed B. Todd Jones, the former U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, as ATF's Director. This confirmation ended a seven-year period, during which ATF was headed by five acting directors. In the area of firearms enforcement, ATF was the subject of congressional and departmental oversight for a Southwest border gun trafficking operation known as Fast and Furious and, more recently, several storefront undercover operations. The DOJ Office of Inspector General issued reports on these matters. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was established in 1930 to house federal inmates, to professionalize the prison service, and to ensure consistent and centralized administration of the federal prison system. The mission of the BOP is to protect society by confining offenders in prisons and community-based facilities that are safe, humane, cost-efficient, and appropriately secure, and that provide work and other self-improvement opportunities for inmates so that they can become productive citizens after they are released. The BOP currently operates 119 correctional facilities across the country. The BOP also contracts with Residential Re-entry Centers (RRCs) (i.e., halfway houses) to provide assistance to inmates nearing release. RRCs provide inmates with a structured and supervised environment along with employment counseling, job placement services, financial management assistance, and other programs and services. Congress funds the BOP's operations through two accounts under the Federal Prison System heading: Salaries and Expenses (S&E) and Buildings and Facilities (B&F). The S&E account (i.e., the operating budget) provides for the custody and care of federal inmates and for the daily maintenance and operations of correctional facilities, regional offices, and BOP's central office in Washington, DC. It also provides funding for the incarceration of federal inmates in state, local, and private facilities. The B&F account (i.e., the capital budget) provides funding for the construction of new facilities and the modernization, repair, and expansion of existing facilities. In addition to appropriations for the S&E and B&F accounts, Congress usually places a cap on the amount of revenue generated by the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) that can be used for administrative expenses in the annual CJS appropriations bill. Although Congress does not appropriate funding for the administrative expenses of FPI, the administrative expenses cap is scored as enacted budget authority. The BOP received a total of $6.862 billion for FY2014, the vast majority of which was for the S&E account ($6.769 billion). For FY2015, the Administration requested $6.897 billion, a proposed increase of 0.5%. All of the proposed increase in the BOP's funding was the result of the Administration requesting more for the BOP's S&E account ($6.804 billion). The Administration was requesting a $193.0 million base adjustment for the S&E account, of which $158.0 million would have been offset by \"proposed miscellaneous program and administrative reductions.\" The proposed increase in the S&E account was to pay for the increased costs associated with managing a growing federal prison population (e.g., increased pay and benefits for the current BOP workforce, higher rents, and increasing costs associated with providing for the care and management of inmates). The BOP did not request any additional full-time equivalents (FTEs) for FY2015.  The House-passed bill would have provided a total of $6.973 billion for the BOP. The amount recommended by the House was 1.6% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and 1.1% greater than the Administration's request. The House-passed bill included $6.863 billion for the BOP's S&E account (0.9% more than the Administration's request) and $107.3 million for the B&F account. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $6.912 billion for the BOP, of which, $6.804 billion was for the S&E account. The amount recommended by the committee would have been 0.7% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, 0.2% above the Administration's request, but 0.9% less than the House-passed amount. The FY2015 appropriation for the BOP is $6.924 billion, which includes $6.815 billion for the S&E account. The FY2015 appropriation is 0.9% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, 0.4% greater than the FY2015 request, 0.7% less than the House-passed amount, and 0.2% more than the amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. A recurring issue is whether the BOP has adequate resources, both in terms of personnel and infrastructure, to properly manage the burgeoning federal prison population. Prison population growth and prison crowding continue to be a major concern for the BOP. The number of inmates held in BOP facilities grew from 125,560 in FY2000 to 176,849 in FY2014. During that same time period, prison crowding grew from 32% over rated capacity to 36% over rated capacity, even though the BOP's capacity increased by approximately 35,000 beds. The BOP estimates that by FY2019 the federal prison system will be operating at 41% over rated capacity. However, despite the problem the BOP has with overcrowding, the Administration did not request funding under the B&F account to start work on any new prison construction. In addition, the BOP did not request any additional funding to expand the amount of contract bedspace. Congress appropriated $106.0 million for the B&F account for FY2015, a 17.8% increase over the FY2014 appropriation. The growing federal prison population has not only resulted in more crowded prisons, but it has also strained the BOP's ability to manage and care for federal inmates. The BOP reports that the staff-to-inmate ratio has increased from 3.6 to 1 in FY1997 to 4.8 to 1 in FY2013. The growing federal prison population has also required the BOP to dedicate more resources to caring (e.g., providing health care, food, and clothing) and providing programming (e.g., substance abuse treatment, educational programming, and work/vocational opportunities) for inmates. The BOP is statutorily required (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621) to provide residential drug abuse treatment to all inmates who volunteer and are eligible for the program. Prisoners who are convicted of nonviolent crimes and who successfully complete a residential substance abuse treatment program are eligible to have their sentence reduced by not more than one year; as such, the BOP notes, inmates are strongly motivated to participate. The BOP reported that due to limited capacity, inmates receive, on average, only a 10 month reduction. The BOP's budget request preserved funding Congress provided for FY2014 to expand the residential drug treatment program. The BOP reported that the expanded residential substance abuse treatment program will allow the BOP to treat all eligible inmates and extend sentence reductions for those who qualify from the current 10 months average to the full 12 months allowed by statute.  The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) was created to administer programs created under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 and subsequent legislation. These programs provide financial and technical assistance to communities around the country to facilitate the creation of programs, policies, and practices designed to improve criminal justice responses related to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. In FY2014, OVW received $417.0 million. The President's FY2015 budget request for OVW included $422.5 million, or a proposed 1.3% increase from the FY2014 enacted appropriation. The FY2015 request included a proposal to increase funds for the Legal Assistance for Victims, Grants to Support Families in the Justice System (+ $1.0 million), Violence on Campus (+ $2.0 million), and Transitional Housing (+ $0.25 million) programs and decrease funds (- $0.25 million) for Research and Evaluation of Violence Against Women. The House recommended $429.5 million for OVW which was 3.0% more than the FY2014-enacted amount and 1.7% more than the Administration's FY2015 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $430.0 million for OVW for FY2015. This amount was 3.1% higher than the FY2014 enacted amount and 1.8% higher than the Administration's FY2015 request. P.L. 113-235 includes $430.0 million for OVW, an increase of 3.1% over the FY2014 enacted amount and 1.8% more than the President's request. Of note, Congress specifies in the explanatory statement to P.L. 113-235 that OVW shall report within 90 days on its efforts \"to improve grant funding execution and efficiency\" and specifically addresses the allocation of resources for the Rural Domestic Violence Grant Program. In the requested report, Congress asked for an explanation as to how OVW is trying to raise awareness of the program in rural communities. The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) manages and coordinates the National Institute of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Office of Victims of Crimes, Bureau of Justice Assistance, and related grant programs. The FY2014-enacted appropriation for OJP was $1.643 billion. For FY2015, the Administration requested $1.567 billion, which was 4.7% less than the FY2014-enacted appropriation. H.R. 4660 included $1.722 billion for OJP, which would have been 4.8% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and 10.6% greater than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill included $1.609 billion for OJP, which would have been a 2.1% decrease compared to the FY2014 appropriation and 6.5% less than what the House recommended, but it would have been 3.4% greater than the Administration's request. The FY2015 appropriation for OJP is $1.691 billion, an amount that is 2.9% above the FY2014 appropriation, 8.6% greater than the Administration's request, 1.8% less than the House-passed amount, and 5.1% more than the amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account (formerly the Justice Assistance account), among other things, funds the operations of the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided $120.0 million for this account. The Administration requested $136.9 million for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account, an amount that was 14.1% greater than the FY2014-enacted appropriation. The House-passed bill would have provided $120.0 million for this account, which would have been the same as the FY2014 appropriation, and 12.3% less than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill included $115.0 million for this account, an amount that was 4.2% less than the FY2014 appropriation, 16.0% less than the Administration's request, and 4.2% below the House-passed amount. For FY2015, Congress appropriated $111.0 million for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account. The FY2015 appropriation is 7.5% less than the FY2014 appropriation, 18.9% less than the Administration's request, 7.5% less than the House-passed amount, and 3.5% below the Senate committee-reported amount. The State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance (S&LLEA) account includes funding for a variety of grant programs to improve the functioning of state, local, and tribal criminal justice systems. Some examples of programs that have traditionally been funded under this account include the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program, the Drug Courts program, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), and DNA backlog reduction grants. Congress appropriated $1.172 billion for the S&LLEA account for FY2014. The Administration's request for FY2015 was $1.033 billion, which was 11.8% less than the FY2014-enacted appropriation. The House recommended $1.291 billion for the S&LLEA account, which would have been 10.2% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and 25.0% greater than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1.150 billion for this account, an amount that was 1.9% less than the FY2014 appropriation, 11.3% greater than the Administration's request, and 11.0% below the Senate committee-reported amount. The FY2015 appropriation for the S&LLEA account is $1.241 billion. The FY2015 appropriation is 5.9% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, 20.1% greater than the Administration's request, 3.9% below the House-passed amount, and 8.0% greater than the amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. For FY2015, the Administration proposed to eliminate several grant programs, including, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). SCAAP provides partial reimbursement to states and localities for prior year costs of incarcerating illegal aliens with at least one felony or two misdemeanor convictions for violations of state or local law, and who are incarcerated at least four consecutive days. In justifying the proposal to eliminate SCAAP, the Administration noted that the program does not promote correctional reforms or offer strategies or tools that will help jurisdictions reduce corrections costs or improve public safety. However, this is the one source of federal funding to help state correctional systems and county jails offset the cost of incarcerating individuals who are not legally in the country. Congress did not accept the Administration's proposal and instead provided $185.0 million for SCAAP for FY2015.  The Administration also proposed to consolidate funding for the drug and mental health courts into a \"problem solving justice\" program. The Administration requested $44.0 million for this program. The proposed program would have assisted state, local, and tribal governments with developing and implementing strategies, including specialized courts, which can divert offenders with drug, mental health, and special needs away from prosecution and incarceration. Congress did not adopt the Administration's proposal. Instead, Congress provided funding for individual problem-solving court programs for FY2015, including $8.5 million for mental health courts, $4.0 million for drug courts, and $5.0 million for veterans' treatment courts. For FY2015, the Administration requested $35.0 million for Community Teams to Reduce the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Backlog and Improve Sexual Assault Investigations (hereinafter, \"Community Teams program\"). Proposed funding under this program could be used for a wide variety of purposes, including the following: supporting law enforcement to conduct inventories of untested kits; assessment of current sexual assault investigation practices and identification of law enforcement training needs to improve current practices; strategic planning to determine the extent to which the kits need to be tested; development and/or implementation of evidence-tracking systems; sexual assault kit testing; enhancement of investigative and prosecutorial resources needed to follow up on the outcomes of increased sexual assault testing and/or implement new investigative or prosecutorial practices in sexual assault; development or strengthening of cold case units and systems for communication between laboratories, prosecutors, and law enforcement regarding the status of evidence; law enforcement training on recent findings in neurobiology of trauma to help them work more effectively with victims of sexual assault; development of victim notification procedures; and enhancement of victim services for past and current victims of sexual assault. Funding from the Community Teams program may also be used to support further research by the National Institute of Justice on issues related to preventing sexual assault and improving the system's response to sexual assault victims. The House recommends $41.0 million for the Community Teams program. Congress provided $41.0 million for this program for FY2015. The Administration also requested a total of $147.0 million under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account for grants to support its \"Now is the Time\" initiative, which focuses on decreasing gun violence across the country. This amount included $15.0 million for the VALOR program (a set-aside under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program), $75.0 million for the comprehensive school safety program, $5.0 million for NICS Act Record Improvement Program (NARIP) Grants, and $50.0 million for the National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP). Congress included the $15.0 million set-aside under the JAG program for the VALOR program and $75.0 million for the comprehensive school safety program in the FY2015 CJS appropriation act. Congress also provided $78.0 million for a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Initiative (which would combine the NCHIP and NARIP programs) and a $3.0 million set-aside under the JAG program for grants for firearms safety materials and gun locks. The Administration requested funding for several programs that could be used to address issues related to drug abuse. As previously discussed, the Administration requested funding for drug courts under its proposed problem solving justice program. In addition, the Administration requested $14.0 million for the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) program, which provides funding to state and local governments for substance abuse treatment for prison and jail inmates, and $7.0 million for prescription drug monitoring programs. Congress provided $10.0 million for RSAT and $11.0 million for prescription drug monitoring programs. The Juvenile Justice Programs account includes funding for grant programs to reduce juvenile delinquency and help state, local, and tribal governments improve the functioning of their juvenile justice systems.  The FY2014 enacted appropriation included $254.5 million for juvenile justice programs. For FY2015, the Administration's request included $299.4 million for this account, what would have been an increase of 17.6% over the FY2014 level. Of note, the FY2014 enacted appropriation had eliminated funding for the long-funded Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) Program. The Administration's FY2015 request would have reinstated funding for JABG. The House-passed bill would have provided $223.5 million for juvenile justice programs, which would have been 12.2% less than the FY2014 enacted amount and 25.4% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $257.5 million for juvenile justice programs, 1.2% more than the FY2014 enacted amount, $14% less than the Administration's request, and 15.2% more than the House-passed amount. The FY2015 enacted funding includes $251.5 million for juvenile justice programs, 1.2% less than the FY2014 enacted level, 16.0% less than the Administration's request, 12.5% more than the House-passed amount, and 2.3% less than the Senate Committee recommended amount. Notably, the FY2015 juvenile justice appropriation does not reinstate funding for the JABG program as had been requested by the Administration.  The Public Safety Officers Benefits (PSOB) program provides three different types of benefits to public safety officers and their survivors: death, disability, and education. The PSOB program is intended to assist in the recruitment and retention of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders and to offer peace of mind to men and women who choose careers in public safety. The FY2014-enacted appropriation for PSOB was $97.3 million. The Administration requested $87.3 million for PSOB for FY2015, an amount that was 10.3% below the FY2014 appropriation. The House and the Senate Committee on Appropriation's recommendations for the PSOB program were equal to the Administration's request. The FY2015 appropriation for PSOB is $87.3 million, the same as the FY2015 request. The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office awards grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies throughout the United States so they can hire and train law enforcement officers to participate in community policing, purchase and deploy new crime-fighting technologies, and develop and test new and innovative policing strategies. Congress appropriated $214.0 million for the COPS program for FY2014. The Administration proposed a $60.0 million, or 28.0%, increase in funding for the COPS program for FY2015. Language in the Administration's FY2015 request would have allowed up to $50.0 million of the $247.0 million requested for the COPS hiring program to be used for hiring non-sworn law enforcement personnel (such as crime and intelligence analysts). The House-passed bill included $209.5 million for the COPS account, which would have been 2.1% less than the FY2014 appropriation and 23.5% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $224.0 million for COPS, an amount that was 4.7% more than the FY2014 appropriation, 18.2% less than the Administration's request, and 6.9% greater than the House-passed amount. The FY2015 appropriation for COPS is $208.0 million, which is 2.8% less than the FY2014 appropriation, 24.1% less than the FY2015 request, 0.7% less than the House-passed amount, and 7.1% less than the Senate Committee reported amount. The FY2015 CJS appropriations act does not include language that would allow funds under the hiring program to be used to hire non-sworn personnel. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) was established by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 ( P.L. 98-473 , VOCA). It is administered by the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), and provides funding to the states and territories for victim compensation and assistance programs. This account does not receive appropriations but instead is largely funded by criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalties, and special assessments that are collected by U.S. Attorneys' Offices, U.S. courts, and the BOP. In FY2014, the obligation cap on the CVF was set at $745.0 million. In the FY2015 Budget Request, the Administration requested to raise the cap by $65.0 million to a total of $810.0 million. The House recommended $770.0 million which was 3.4% greater than the FY2014 amount and 4.9% less than the Administration's FY2015 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $775.0 million the CVF cap for FY2015. This amount was 4.0% higher than the FY2014 enacted amount and 4.1% lower than the Administration's FY2015 request. The FY2015 enacted amount for the CVF cap is $2.361 billion, a 216.9% increase over the FY2014 enacted amount and an amount 191.5% higher than the Administration's request. The Administration had proposed an increase for the Crime Victims Fund in order to (1) enhance formula-based awards to states to support victims' programs and provide additional funding for national scope training and technical assistance and demonstration programs; (2) enhance services for domestic victims of human trafficking; and (3) support the implementation strategies outlined in the Vision 21: Transforming Victim Services report. In the report to accompany H.R. 4660 , the House Committee on Appropriations stated that OVC may implement Vision 21 within available resources. In an unprecedented move, Congress more than tripled the CVF cap. The CVF currently has a balance of nearly $13 billion, which indicates that receipts to the fund are exceeding the congressionally specified cap each year. Congress did not specify directions for the increase in CVF funds, which will be distributed to crime victims programs according to a formula established by VOCA. The Science Agencies fund and otherwise support research and development (R&D) and related activities across a wide variety of federal missions, including national competitiveness, energy and the environment, and fundamental discovery.  The science agencies received a total of $24.824 billion under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-76 ). For FY2015, the Administration requested a total of $24.721 billion for the science agencies, a proposed 0.4% reduction. The House-passed bill included a total of $25.296 billion for the science agencies, which would have been 1.9% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and 2.3% more than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee-reported bill included a total of $25.161 billion for the science agencies, an amount that was 1.4% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and 1.8% more than the 2015 request, but 0.5% less than the amount recommended by the House. The FY2015 appropriation for the science agencies is $25.360 billion. The FY2015 appropriation is 2.2% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, 2.6% more than the Administration's request, 0.3% greater than the House-passed amount, and 0.8% greater than the Senate Committee-reported amount. Congress established the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) through the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 ( P.L. 94-282 ). The act states that \"the primary function of the OSTP director is to provide, within the Executive Office of the President, advice on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of issues that require attention at the highest level of Government.\" The OSTP director, often referred to informally as the President's science advisor, also manages the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), which coordinates science and technology policy across the executive branch of the federal government, and co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), a council of external advisors that provides advice to the President on matters related to science and technology policy. OSTP is one of two offices in the Executive Office of the President (EOP) that is funded in the CJS appropriations bill. P.L. 113-235 provides $5.6 million for OSTP, the same as the Administration's request and the FY2014 appropriation. The joint explanatory statement approves all report language from the House and Senate bills unless changed by the joint explanatory statement. The only report language expressly addressed refers to public access to federally funded research, which states that OSTP shall report quarterly and include cost information as described in the Senate report. The House-passed bill would have provided $5.6 million for OSTP, the same as the Administration's request and the FY2014 appropriation. The report accompanying the House-passed bill urged OSTP to begin implementing key recommendations made by the Interagency Working Group on Neuroscience and to brief the House Committee on Appropriations within 120 days on the prioritization and implementation status of these recommendations. It also urged OSTP to promote and encourage international collaboration in neuroscience and to brief the House Committee on Appropriations within 180 days on the results of these efforts. In addition, the report encouraged OSTP to establish a committee to coordinate federal investments in medical imaging research and develop a roadmap for the full scope of imaging research and development. Finally, the report directed OSTP to report semiannually to the House Committee on Appropriations regarding the progress made by each major federal research agency in developing, finalizing and implementing its plan to enable public access to federally funded research findings. The amount recommended for OSTP by the Senate Committee on Appropriations was $5.6 million, the same as the Administration's request and the FY2014 appropriation. The report accompanying the Senate-committee recommended bill directed OSTP to report quarterly to the committee on timelines for implementation of open access to federal research, including cost estimates. Also, the report directed OSTP to establish an NSTC subcommittee on medical imaging and develop a roadmap for the full scope of imaging research and development. In addition, the report directed OSTP to report to Congress on revising the National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing, including identifying relevant agencies, topics, stakeholders, international perspectives, resources, and metrics for inclusion in the strategy development process. Finally, the report encourages OSTP to work with non-federal education and outreach communities in order to preserve effective science, technology, engineering, and math education programs designed to directly support the STEM-related mission needs of the agencies administering the programs. The Administration's request for FY2015 was $5.6 million, the same as appropriated for FY2014. According to the Administration, its request would have enabled \"OSTP to carry out its significant national security emergency preparedness communications responsibilities that must be performed in times of national crisis,\" and supported the director of OSTP, the federal Chief Technology Officer, three Senate-confirmed associate directors, and other professional staff members. Congress has for several years restricted OSTP from engaging in certain activities with China or any Chinese-owned company by prohibiting the use of appropriated funds for these activities. The OSTP may proceed with activities that it certifies pose no risk of transferring technology or information with security implications to China and will not involve knowing interactions with officials who have been determined by the United States to have direct involvement with violations of human rights. Such certification must be submitted to the House and Senate Committees at least 30 days prior to such activities. Congress may continue its interest in the debate over its ability to restrict the activities of OSTP and the scope of such restrictions. P.L. 113-235 continues this restriction through FY2015. The House-passed bill would have continued this restriction through FY2015. The Senate committee-recommended bill was silent on the topic. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created in 1958 by the National Aeronautics and Space Act (P.L. 85-568) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities. Congress appropriated $17.647 billion for NASA for FY2014. The Administration's request for FY2015 was $17.461 billion, a proposed decrease of 1.1%. In addition to the regular budget request, NASA would have received $885.5 million under the President's proposed Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative (OGSI). The House-passed bill would have provided $17.896 billion. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $17.900 billion. The final appropriation was $18.010 billion. See Table 11 for a breakdown of these amounts by appropriations account. There is no authorized level for NASA funding in FY2015; the most recent authorization act (the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, P.L. 111-267 ) authorized appropriations through FY2013. The FY2015 request for Science was $4.972 billion, a decrease of 3.5%.The House-passed bill would have provided $5.193 billion. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $5.200 billion. The final appropriation for FY2015 was $5.245 billion. In Planetary Science, an element of the Science account, the request of $1.280 billion, down from $1.345 billion in FY2014, included $15.0 million for continued study of a potential future mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. Congress provided $69.7 million in FY2013 and $80.0 million in FY2014 for formulation of a Europa mission, which was a high priority of the 2011 National Research Council (NRC) decadal survey of planetary science. The NRC expressed reservations, however, at the mission's estimated a cost of $4.7 billion, and in April 2014, NASA issued a request for information seeking Europa mission concepts costing less than $1 billion. The House-passed bill for FY2015 would have provided $100.0 million for \"a mission that meets the science goals outlined for the Jupiter Europa mission in the most recent planetary science decadal survey,\" plus an additional $18.0 million for assessment and development of related technologies. The House report stated that \"the Committee has not seen any credible evidence\" that a $1 billion cost is feasible and directed NASA \"not to use further project resources in pursuit of such an unlikely outcome.\" The Senate report directed NASA to use the Space Launch System as the baseline launch vehicle for planning a Europa mission in order to maximize the scientific return. The heavy lift capability of this rocket suggested Senate support for a larger-scale Europa mission. Congress ultimately appropriated $100 million for FY2015 for planning a Europa mission in line with the planetary science decadal survey. The explanatory statement directed NASA to evaluate use of the Space Launch System as the launch vehicle for such a mission.  In Astrophysics, also funded in the Science account, the request of $607.0 million, down from $668.0 million in FY2014, included $12.3 million for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). SOFIA reached full operating capability in February 2014, and previous budgets envisioned 20 years of operations at a cost of about $85 million per year. According to NASA, however, \"because SOFIA development has taken much longer than originally envisioned ... the observatory will no longer provide the kind of scientific impact and synergies with other missions as once planned.\" NASA proposed to place the SOFIA aircraft in storage unless international partners could support the U.S. share of its operating costs. The House report rejected NASA's proposal to terminate SOFIA, recommended $70.0 million for the project, and directed NASA to \"continue seeking third-party partners whose additional funding support would restore SOFIA's budget to its full operational level.\" The Senate report also disagreed with the proposal to terminate SOFIA; it recommended $87 million. Congress ultimately appropriated $70 million for FY2015 for SOFIA to maintain core operations. The explanatory statement directed NASA to \"continue to seek partners to restore SOFIA to its full operational level\" and stated that \"any science mission terminations should be made only after a senior review that evaluates the relative scientific benefit and return on investment.\" The OGSI proposal included an additional $187.3 million for Science, above the Administration's base request. Although the House and Senate bills included comparable amounts above the request, their increases did not appear to correspond closely to the content of the OGSI. For example, the House report did not mention the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3), which would have received $29.3 million under the OGSI, or the Pre-Aerosols, Carbon, and Ecosystems (PACE) mission, which would have received an additional $50 million. While the Senate report recommended $25 million for PACE, it also included funds for Jason-3 and DSCOVR, two Earth science satellites that the Administration proposed to fund through the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) budget rather than NASA's. The final explanatory statement included $20 million for PACE for FY2015 and funded Jason-3 and DSCOVR in the NOAA budget. The FY2015 request for Aeronautics was $551.1 million, a decrease of 2.6%. NASA proposed reorganizing its aeronautics research to align with a new strategic vision announced in August 2013. Following this realignment, most individual projects were to continue, but funding for rotorcraft research was to decrease by $7.9 million. The OGSI proposal included an additional $43.9 million for Aeronautics and would have restored the proposed reduction in rotorcraft funding. The House-passed bill would have provided $666.0 million. The House report accepted the proposed restructuring and directed NASA to allocate the recommended funding increase proportionally across the new programs. It did not mention rotorcraft. The Senate bill would have provided $551.0 million. Like the House report, the Senate report supported the proposed reorganization, but it expressed disappointment with the requested reduction for rotorcraft research. The final appropriation for FY2015 was $651.0 million, with the increase above the request to be applied proportionally across the restructured programs. The FY2015 request for Space Technology was $705.5 million, an increase of 22.5%. Support for the Asteroid Redirect Mission, including the accelerated development of high-power solar electric propulsion technology for future spacecraft, was proposed to increase from $38.0 million to $93.0 million. The OGSI proposal included an additional $100.0 million for Space Technology. The House-passed bill would have provided $627.0 million. Noting several specific examples, the House report encouraged the Space Technology Mission Directorate to prioritize technologies that have \"the broadest applicability across [its] customer base.\" Separately, the report found it unclear whether Congress will commit to the Asteroid Redirect Mission and directed NASA to spend funds on that mission only in areas that \"are also applicable to other current NASA programs, clearly extensible to other potential future exploration missions ... or have broad applicability to other future non-exploration activities.\" The Senate bill would have provided $580 million. The Senate report directed NASA to prioritize ongoing activities, recommended continued funding for the development of satellite servicing technology, and directed NASA to increase its focus on Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards to companies with fewer than 50 employees. The final appropriation for FY2015 was $596.0 million. The FY2015 request for Exploration was $3.976 billion, a decrease of 3.3%. This account funds development of the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and the Space Launch System (SLS) heavy-lift rocket, which were mandated by the 2010 authorization act for human exploration beyond Earth orbit. The account also funds development of a commercial crew transportation capability for future U.S. astronaut access to the International Space Station. The request of $2.784 billion for Orion, the SLS, and related ground systems (known collectively as Exploration Systems Development) was a decrease of 10.6%, while the request of $848.0 million for commercial crew was an increase of 21.8%. The OGSI proposal included an additional $100.0 million for SLS and Orion and an additional $250.0 million for commercial crew. As in past years, many in Congress saw the budget request as evidence of a difference in human spaceflight priorities between Congress and the Administration, and this perceived difference was controversial. The House-passed bill would have provided $4.167 billion for Exploration, including $3.055 billion for Exploration Systems Development and $785.0 million for commercial crew. The House report expressed frustration with the \"arbitrarily reduced funding levels for SLS\" and the increased request for commercial crew. It stated that the recommended funding for commercial crew was intended to support only one provider (in September 2014, NASA awarded commercial crew contracts to two providers). The Senate bill would have provided $4.368 billion for Exploration, including $3.251 billion for Exploration Systems Development and $805 million for commercial crew. The Senate report stated that the request for Orion and the SLS had \"again fallen below what is necessary\" and \"far short of requirements.\" For commercial crew, the Senate report would have required certified cost and pricing data for commercial crew contracts. Advocates of this language described it as promoting transparency. Others, noting that it was drawn from federal cost-plus contracting, argued that it was not suitable for the fixed-price commercial approach that NASA is using for the commercial crew program. The final appropriation for FY2015 of $4.357 billion included $3.245 billion for Exploration Systems Development and $805 million for commercial crew. The explanatory statement did not include the Senate language about certified cost and pricing data. The FY2015 request for Space Operations was $3.905 billion, an increase of 3.4%. Although the request of $3.051 billion for the International Space Station (ISS) was a 3.2% increase, NASA planned to eliminate one previously planned cargo flight to the ISS in FY2015. The OGSI proposal included an additional $100.6 million and would have funded the restoration of the eliminated ISS cargo flight. The House-passed bill would have provided $3.878 billion for Space Operations, including $3.040 billion for the ISS. The Senate bill would have provided $3.831 billion, including $3.013 billion for the ISS. The final appropriation for FY2015 was $3.828 billion; the explanatory statement did not specify how much of that total was for the ISS. The FY2015 request for Education was $88.9 million, a decrease of 23.8%. NASA education programs are affected by a government-wide consolidation and reorganization of activities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Among the programs included in the FY2015 request for the Education account were the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program ($24.0 million), the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR, $9.0 million), and the Minority University Research Education Program (MUREP, $30.0 million). In addition, the request for the Science account included $6.0 million for the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program and $15.0 million for other STEM education and public outreach activities. However, the previous Science Mission Directorate policy, under which 1% of all Science mission funding was allocated to education and public outreach, has been terminated. The OGSI proposal included an additional $10.0 million for Education; it would not have affected education activities funded in other NASA accounts. The House-passed bill would have provided $106.0 million for the Education account, including $30.0 million for Space Grant, $9.0 million for EPSCoR, and $32.0 million for MUREP. It would also have provided $30.0 million, double the request, for general STEM education and public outreach activities in the Science account. The Senate bill would have provided $108.0 million in the Education account, including $40.0 million for Space Grant, $18.0 million for EPSCoR, and $30.0 million for MUREP, plus $42.0 million in the Science account. The final appropriation for FY2015 was $119.0 million, including $40.0 million for Space Grant, $18.0 million for EPSCoR, and $32.0 million for MUREP, plus $42.0 million in the Science account. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in the non-medical sciences and engineering. Congress established the foundation as an independent federal agency in 1950 and directed it to \"promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.\" The NSF is a primary source of federal support for U.S. university research. It is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education program portfolio and federal STEM student aid and support. P.L. 113-235 provides $7.344 billion to the NSF in FY2015. This amount is $172.3 million (2.4%) more than the FY2014 estimated level of $7.172 billion. The House sought $7.394 billion for NSF in FY2015. The Senate Committee on Appropriations would have provided the requested level ($7.255 billion). (See Table 12 .) As requested, NSF's FY2015 program priorities included four programs that were also foundation priorities in FY2013 and FY2014: Cyber-enabled Materials, Manufacturing, and Smart Systems (CEMMSS, $213.2 million); Cyberinfrastructure Framework for 21 st Century Science, Engineering, and Education (CIF21, $124.8 million); Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES, $139.0 million); and Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC, $99.8 million). The Administration added Cognitive Science and Neuroscience ($29.0 million) in its FY2015 request. Of these programs and activities, the Administration sought an increase over FY2014 estimated levels for only Cognitive Science and Neuroscience. The House report recommended $35.0 million for Cognitive Science and Neuroscience in FY2015, $21.2 million (152.5%) more than the FY2014 estimate of $13.9 million. The explanatory statement, which accompanied P.L. 113-235 , endorses the House recommendation for neuroscience. The Senate report recommended the full request ($139.0 million) for SEES.  Congress typically appropriates to NSF at the major account level. NSF's major accounts are Research and Related Activities (R&RA); Education and Human Resources (E&HR); Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC); Agency Operations and Awards Management (AOAM); National Science Board (NSB); and Office of Inspector General (OIG).  R&RA is the largest NSF account and the primary source of research funding at the NSF. P.L. 113-235 provides $5.934 billion to R&RA in FY2015. This amount is $124.7 million (2.1%) over the FY2014 estimated funding level of $5.809 billion. The House-passed bill would have provided $5.974 billion to R&RA in FY2015. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $5.839 billion.  The Administration's request held six of eight R&RA subaccounts at close to FY2014 levels (actual range: -1.8% to 0.8%) in FY2015. Two subaccounts, Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) and the U.S. Artic Research Commission would have increased by more substantial percentages: 6.0% and 8.5%, respectively, with SBE receiving the largest increase by amount\u2014$15.4 million over the FY2014 estimate. Most of the SBE increase ($11.5 million) was intended for the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.  The enduring debate over NSF support for research in the social sciences\u2014which dates to NSF's establishment\u2014resurfaced in the 113 th Congress. For example, during consideration of the FY2013 CJS Appropriations Act ( P.L. 113-6 ), legislators debated funding for NSF's Political Science program and ultimately restricted it to projects that met certain national interests. In FY2015, the House report recommended that any R&RA appropriations above the request \"shall be applied to math and physical sciences [MPS], computer and information science and engineering [CISE], engineering [ENG], and biological sciences [BIO].\" This language appears to be designed to prevent R&RA accounts in the geosciences (GEO) and international and integrative activities (IIA), as well as SBE and the U.S. Arctic Research Commission (USARC), from receiving increases over requested levels. The House report further notes both the \"intrinsic value in SBE sciences,\" while recognizing \"longstanding Congressional concerns\" about SBE-funded activities. A House floor amendment to H.R. 4660 sought to effectively hold funding for SBE at the FY2014 level ($256.9 million). (Some House authorizers also sought to make similar changes in proposed NSF reauthorization bills during the 113 th Congress. ) P.L. 113-235 does not incorporate language from the House floor amendment to H.R. 4660 that would have held SBE at FY2014 levels; but, the explanatory statement effectively adopts House report language requiring NSF to apply any funding increases it receives for R&RA (above requested levels) to MPS, CISE, ENG, and BIO.  Widely tracked R&RA programs include the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and Advanced Manufacturing programs. P.L. 113-235 provides $159.7 million to EPSCoR in FY2015; which is the same as the request, House recommendation, and Senate Committee on Appropriations' recommendation. EPSCoR received $158.2 million in FY2014 (estimated). For Advanced Manufacturing, the House report recommended the FY2014 current plan funding level ($164.7 million) in FY2015. The Senate report further recommended that NSF target $15.0 million of the funding it receives for Advanced Manufacturing to biomanufacturing. P.L. 113-235 provides $866.0 million to E&HR, NSF's main education account, in FY2015; including $60.9 million for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (NOYCE). The FY2015 enacted funding level for E&HR is $19.5 million (2.3%) more than the FY2014 estimated funding level of $846.5 million. The House-passed bill would have provided $876.0 million to E&HR in FY2015. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the request ($889.8 million).  By amount, the largest requested E&HR increase was for Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE). The FY2014 IUSE estimate was $74.1 million. The Administration sought $99.1 million for IUSE in FY2015, a proposed increase of $25.0 million (33.7%).  Some of the most widely tracked E&HR programs include the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF), the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship or IGERT (now called the NSF Research Traineeship or NRT), and the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program. The FY2015 request for the GRF was $333.4 million, about 11.1% over the FY2014 estimate. (NSF also sought to increase the GRF stipend from $32,000 to $34,000 in FY2015.) The FY2015 request for NRT was $58.0 million, an increase of 7.8% over the FY2014 estimate. The FY2015 request for ATE was $64.0 million, the same as the FY2014 estimate. The House report recommended $66.0 million for ATE in FY2015; the Senate report recommended $64.0 million. The explanatory statement endorses the House recommendation. Other widely tracked E&HR programs include those that are commonly referred to as \"broadening participation\" programs. These include the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP), and Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP). The FY2015 requests for these broadening participation programs were the same as the FY2014 estimated levels\u2014$31.9 million (HBCU-UP), $13.5 million (TCUP) and $45.6 million (LSAMP). The House and Senate reports both recommended $32.0 million for HBCU-UP, $13.5 million for TCUP, and $46.0 million for LSAMP in FY2015. The Senate report also recommended $8.0 million for the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) and $24.0 million for the Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) in FY2015. The explanatory statement provides $32.0 million for HBCU-UP, $13.5 million for TCUP, and $46.0 million for LSAMP; as well as $8.0 million for AGEP and $24.0 million for CREST.  In addition to these programs, the House report directed NSF to provide at least $30.0 million in \"targeted opportunities\" for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). (Legislators had previously encouraged NSF to establish a separate HSI program. However, according to the House report, NSF has not done so due to \"technical challenges.\") The Senate report, on the other hand, specifically provided $5.0 million for a separate HSI program at NSF. The explanatory statement endorses the House recommendation. NSF's MREFC account supports large construction projects and scientific instruments. P.L. 113-235 provides $200.8 million to MREFC in FY2015; a small increase over the FY2014 estimated level of $200.0 million. The request notes that MREFC will support three projects in FY2015. Historically, this account has typically supported between four and six projects per fiscal year.  The FY2015 Administration request for AOAM was $338.2 million, or $40.2 million (13.5%) more than the FY2014 estimate. Most of this increase was intended to fund the next phase of NSF's headquarters relocation effort. P.L. 113-235 provides $325.0 million to AOAM in FY2015. The annual CJS appropriations act includes funding for seven related agencies with missions or responsibilities similar to those of the Departments of Commerce and Justice or the science agencies. The related agencies funded as a part of the annual CJS appropriations act are: the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; the International Trade Commission; the Legal Services Corporation; the Marine Mammal Commission; the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative; and the State Justice Institute. The related agencies received a total of $881.8 million under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. For FY2015, the Administration requested a total of $956.1 million for the related agencies, which represented a proposed 8.4% increase in appropriations. The House-passed bill would have provided a total of $870.9 million for the related agencies, a proposed decrease of 1.2% compared to the FY2014 appropriation and an amount that would be 8.9% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee-reported bill would have provided $923.0 million for the related agencies, which would have been 4.7% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and 6.0% greater than the House-passed amount, but 3.5% below the Administration's request. The FY2015 appropriations act provides $895.9 million for the related agencies, an amount that is 1.6% greater than the FY2014 appropriation, 6.3% below the Administration's request, 2.9% greater than the House-passed amount, and 2.9% less than the amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. Established by the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (the commission)  investigates allegations of citizens who may have been denied the right to vote based on color, race, religion, or national origin; studies and gathers information on legal developments constituting a denial of the equal protection of the laws; assesses the federal laws and policies in the area of civil rights; and submits reports on its findings to the President and Congress when the commission or the President deems it appropriate. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, the commission received $9.0 million. The Administration requested $9.4 million for the commission, a proposed 4.4% increase compared to the FY2014-enacted appropriation. H.R. 4660 included $9.0 million for the commission, an amount equal to the FY2014 appropriation and 4.3% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $9.4 million for the commission, an amount that is equal to the Administration's request. For FY2015, Congress provides $9.2 million for the commission, an amount that is 2.2% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and the House-passed amount, but 2.1% less than the Administration's request and the Senate committee-reported amount. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces several laws that ban employment discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. In recent years, appropriators were particularly concerned about the agency's ability to reduce the pending inventory of charges due to rising caseloads and limited staff. Due to new hires of enforcement staff and developments in technology, the EEOC continues to reduce the pending inventory of cases.  The FY2015 CJS appropriations act provided $364.5 million for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, $0.5 million more than the FY2014 amount of $364.0 million. Of the funds provided in FY2015, up to $30.0 million would be for payments to state and local entities with which the agency has work-sharing agreements to address workplace discrimination within their jurisdictions (i.e., Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs) and Tribal Employment Rights Organizations (TEROs)).  The amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations for FY2015 was $365.0 million or $0.5 million more than the FY2015 amount. The House-passed bill would have provided $364.0 million for the EEOC in FY2015, $0.5 million less than the FY2015 amount. The Administration had recommended $365.5 for the EEOC in FY2015.  Although the pending inventory of private sector cases filed with the EEOC was reduced from 78,136 at the end of FY2011 to 70,312 at the end of FY2012, the inventory increased slightly in FY2013 to 70,781. The increase in FY2013 reflects hiring freezes imposed by the FY2013 budget cycle. The FY2015 request includes 60 additional investigators and 6 mediator hires, positions which help the agency improve staffing levels and subsequent workloads. The EEOC federal sector hearings workload was 15,301 hearings in FY2013 and estimated to increase slightly to 15,500 in FY2014. The commission continues to implement technology initiatives to support the federal sector program, such as the ongoing development of the EEOC File Exchange (EFX) web-based portal system. The commission also continues to expand the use of the HotDocs commercial document assembly software, which streamlines the writing phase of the hearings process. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) is an independent, quasi-judicial federal agency with broad investigative responsibilities on matters related to international trade. The ITC's activities include investigating the effects of dumped and subsidized imports on domestic industries; conducting global safeguard investigations; and adjudicating disputes involving imported goods that allegedly infringe U.S. intellectual property rights. The ITC also serves as a federal resource for trade data and other trade policy information. It makes most of its information and analyses available to the public to promote understanding of competitiveness, international trade issues, and the role that international trade plays in the U.S. economy. The ITC has two strategic goals that guide its programmatic activities: (1) to produce sound, objective, and timely determinations in investigations; and (2) to produce objective, high-quality, and responsive analysis and information on tariffs, trade, and competitiveness. As a matter of policy, its budget request is submitted to Congress by the President without revision. The ITC received $83.0 million for FY2014. The Administration's request for the ITC for FY2015 was $86.5 million, a proposed increase of 4.2%. The House-passed bill would have provided $86.0 million for ITC, 0.5% less than the Administration's request and 3.6% more than the enacted amount for FY2014. The amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations was $85.0 million, 1.7% less than the Administration's request and 2.4% more than the FY2014 enacted amount. The FY2015 CJS Appropriations Act provided $84.5 million for the ITC, an amount 2.3% less than the Administration's request and 1.8% above the FY2014 enacted amount. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is a private, nonprofit, federally funded corporation that provides grants to local offices that, in turn, provide legal assistance to low-income people in civil (noncriminal) cases. The LSC has been controversial since its incorporation in the early 1970s and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980. There have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake. In annual appropriations bills, Congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of LSC-funded grantees, such as prohibiting any lobbying activities or prohibiting representation in certain types of cases.  The authorization of appropriations for the LSC expired at the end of FY1980. Since then the LSC has operated under annual appropriations laws. The LSC received $365.0 million for FY2014. The Obama Administration's budget request for the LSC for FY2015 was $430.0 million, a proposed increase of 17.8%. The Administration's FY2015 budget request included $395.0 million for basic field programs and required independent audits, $20.0 million for management and grants oversight, $4.8 million for client self-help and information technology, $4.4 million for the Office of the Inspector General, $1.0 million for loan repayment assistance, and $4.9 million for a pro bono innovation fund. The Obama Administration also proposed that LSC restrictions on class action suits and attorneys' fees be eliminated. The House-passed bill would have provided $350.0 million for the LSC for FY2015. This amount is 4.1% less than the FY2014-enacted amount and 18.6% less than the Administration's FY2015 budget request. The amount recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations was $400.0 million. This amount is 9.6% more than the FY2014-enacted amount and 7.0% less than the Administration's FY2015 budget request. Pursuant to P.L. 113-235 , the LSC received $375 million for FY2015. This amount is 2.7% more than the FY2014-enacted amount, 7.1 % more than the House-passed amount, and 12.8% less than the Administration's FY2015 budget request. The FY2015 LSC appropriation included $343.2 million for basic field programs and required independent audits, $18.5 million for management and grants oversight, $4.0 million for client self-help and information technology, $4.4 million for the Office of the Inspector General, $1.0 million for loan repayment assistance, and $4.0 million for a pro bono innovation fund. The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) is an independent agency of the executive branch, established under Title II of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA; P.L. 92-522). The MMC and its Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals provide oversight and recommend actions on domestic and international topics to advance policies and provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. As funding permits, the Marine Mammal Commission supports research to further the purposes of the MMPA. The FY2014-enacted appropriation for the MMC was $3.3 million. The Administration proposed a 5.6% increase for MMC for FY2015. The House recommended $3.3 million for the MMC for FY2015. The House's recommendation would have been the same as the FY2014 appropriation and 5.3% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $3.4 million for the MMC, equal to the Administration's request. The FY2015 appropriation for the MMC is $3.3 million, which is 2.8% greater than the FY2014 appropriation and the House-passed amount, but 2.7% less than the Administration's request and the Senate committee-reported amount. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), located in the Executive Office of the President, is responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade and direct investment policies. The USTR is the President's chief negotiator for international trade agreements, including commodity and direct investment negotiations. USTR also conducts U.S. affairs related to the World Trade Organization. The USTR is leading the negotiations for the United States for the ongoing talks for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP) and for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP).  The USTR received $52.6 million for FY2014. The Administration's request for USTR was $56.2 million, a proposed increase of 6.8%. The House-passed bill would have provided $53.5 million for USTR, 4.8% less than the Administration's request and 1.7% more than the FY2014 enacted amount. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $55.0 million for the USTR for FY2015, the same amount as the Administration's request and 4.6% above the FY2014 enacted amount. The FY2015 CJS Appropriations Act provided $54.3 million for the USTR, an amount 3.4% less than the Administration's request and 3.1% more than the FY2014 enacted amount. The State Justice Institute (SJI) is a nonprofit corporation that makes grants to state courts and funds research, technical assistance, and informational projects aimed at improving the quality of judicial administration in state courts across the United States. It is governed by an 11-member board of directors appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Under the terms of its enabling legislation, SJI is authorized to present its budget request directly to Congress, apart from the President's budget. For FY2014 the SJI received $4.9 million. The Administration requested $5.1 million for FY2015, a proposed 4.5% increase in funding. The House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills would have provided a total of $5.1 million for SJI, equal to the Administration's request . The FY2015 appropriation for SJI is equal to the Administration's request."
