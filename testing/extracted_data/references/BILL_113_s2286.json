FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since 2002, the Department of Defense has spent more \n        than $2,000,000,000,000 on service contractors.\n            (2) The decade-long trend of outsourcing work has created a \n        shadow government of service contractors that are largely \n        dependent on the taxpayers as their sole source of revenue.\n            (3) Studies show that service contractors can cost \n        taxpayers up to twice what it costs for members of the Armed \n        Forces to perform the work.\n            (4) In 2013, the Department of Defense spent nearly \n        $180,000,000,000 on service contractors, making it the largest \n        buyer of services in the Federal Government.\n            (5) Approximately 30 percent of the intelligence community \n        workforce is made up of service contractors, employees that \n        work for companies whose primary goal is to make a profit and \n        have never sworn an oath to defend and protect the United \n        States.\n            (6) Since 2002, Congress has repeatedly enacted legislation \n        to improve the Department of Defense's management of service \n        contractors. However, in 2013 the Government Accountability \n        Office (GAO) found that, while the Department has taken action \n        to address such legislative requirements, there are no metrics \n        in place to determine the effects of those actions.\n\nSEC. 3.
