    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``NATO-Western Balkans Support Act of \n2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The commitment of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization (NATO) to mutual defense and the territorial \n        integrity of its members has advanced the democratic \n        transformation of Central and Eastern Europe and significantly \n        enhanced the security of Europe. Nowhere in Europe has the \n        search for sustainable peace been more challenging than in the \n        Western Balkans. NATO has the ability to encourage the \n        countries of the Western Balkans to embrace collective \n        security, consolidate their democratic gains, and extend their \n        commitment to integration in Euro-Atlantic institutions.\n            (2) NATO membership offers the ultimate protection against \n        perceived external threats and has demonstrated its role in \n        lowering regional tensions. Croatia's successful accession to \n        NATO has encouraged other states of the Western Balkans to \n        consider the possibility of their own membership more \n        seriously. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro are already \n        seriously engaged in the process of meeting NATO membership \n        criteria as active members of the Partnership for Peace and \n        Intensified Dialogue with NATO.\n            (3) In Western Balkan states like Bosnia and Herzegovina \n        and Montenegro, the process of NATO accession can provide focus \n        for ongoing efforts to improve the functionality and efficiency \n        of the armed forces and the state more broadly. In Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina, many reforms necessary to improve the \n        functionality of the state, such as resolution of the defense-\n        related property issue, are also necessary for NATO membership.\n            (4) The success of Serbia is central to the success of the \n        Western Balkans. The United States Government welcomes the \n        decision of the democratically elected Government of Serbia to \n        join the Partnership for Peace Program in 2006 and encourages \n        as strong a relationship as is possible between NATO and the \n        Government and people of Serbia. As Vice President Joseph Biden \n        said in Belgrade on May 20, 2009, ``The United States strongly \n        supports Serbian membership in the European Union and expanding \n        security cooperation between Serbia, the United States, and our \n        allies. We will use our influence, our energy, and our \n        resources to promote Serbia's Euro-Atlantic aspirations.''.\n            (5) In the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of \n        Public Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress declared \n        that ``full and active participants in the Partnership for \n        Peace in a position to further the principles of the North \n        Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North \n        Atlantic area should be invited to become full NATO members in \n        accordance with Article 10 of such Treaty at an early date''.\n            (6) Under the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (as \n        enacted into law by section 101(c) of title I of division A of \n        Public Law 104-208; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress called for \n        the prompt admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, \n        and Slovenia to NATO, and declared that ``in order to promote \n        economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, \n        Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine . . \n        . the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies \n        in Central and Eastern Europe should not be limited to \n        consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, \n        and Slovenia as full members of the NATO Alliance''.\n            (7) In the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of \n        division G of Public Law 105-277; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), \n        Congress declared that ``Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n        Republic should not be the last emerging democracies in Central \n        and Eastern Europe invited to join NATO''.\n            (8) In the Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act \n        of 2002 (Public Law 107-187; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress \n        endorsed ``. . . the vision of further enlargement of the NATO \n        Alliance articulated by President George W. Bush on June 15, \n        2001, and by former President William J. Clinton on October 22, \n        1996.''.\n            (9) At the Madrid Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization in July 1997, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n        Republic were invited to join NATO, and the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization heads of state and government issued a \n        declaration stating, ``The alliance expects to extend further \n        invitations in coming years to nations willing and able to \n        assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership . . . \n        No European democratic country whose admission would fulfill \n        the objectives of the [North Atlantic] Treaty will be excluded \n        from consideration''.\n            (10) At the Washington, DC, Summit of the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization in April 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization heads of state and government issued a communique \n        declaring, ``We pledge that NATO will continue to welcome new \n        members in a position to further the principles of the [North \n        Atlantic] Treaty and contribute to peace and security in the \n        Euro-Atlantic area . . . The three new members will not be the \n        last . . . No European democratic country whose admission would \n        fulfill the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded from \n        consideration, regardless of its geographic location''.\n            (11) On June 15, 2001, in a speech in Warsaw, Poland, \n        President George W. Bush stated, ``All of Europe's new \n        democracies, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that lie \n        between, should have the same chance for security and freedom--\n        and the same chance to join the institutions of Europe--as \n        Europe's old democracies have . . . I believe in NATO \n        membership for all of Europe's democracies that seek it and are \n        ready to share the responsibilities that NATO brings . . .''.\n            (12) On October 22, 1996, in a speech in Detroit, Michigan, \n        former President William J. Clinton stated, ``NATO's doors will \n        not close behind its first new members . . . NATO should remain \n        open to all of Europe's emerging democracies who are ready to \n        shoulder the responsibilities of membership . . . No nation \n        will be automatically excluded . . . No country outside NATO \n        will have a veto . . . A gray zone of insecurity must not \n        reemerge in Europe.''.\n            (13) At the Prague Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization in November 2002, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n        Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia were invited to join \n        NATO in the second round of enlargement of the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization since the end of the Cold War, and the \n        North Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of state and \n        government issued a declaration stating, ``NATO's door will \n        remain open to European democracies willing and able to assume \n        the responsibilities and obligations of membership, in \n        accordance with Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.''.\n            (14) At the Istanbul Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization in June 2004, the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization heads of state and government issued a communique \n        reaffirming that NATO's door remains open to new members, \n        declaring, ``We celebrate the success of NATO's Open Door \n        Policy, and reaffirm today that our seven new members will not \n        be the last. The door to membership remains open.''.\n            (15) At the Riga Summit of the NATO Alliance November 2006, \n        NATO heads of state and government affirmed in their \n        declaration that ``Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and \n        Serbia can offer valuable contributions to regional stability \n        and security'' and that NATO should ``encourage further \n        positive developments in the region on its path towards Euro-\n        Atlantic integration''. It was at Riga that Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia were offered membership in \n        the Partnership for Peace and Euro-Atlantic Partnership \n        Council.\n            (16) At the Bucharest Summit of the NATO Alliance in April \n        2008, the NATO heads of state and government issued a \n        declaration stating that in the Balkans, ``Euro-Atlantic \n        integration, based on democratic values and regional \n        cooperation, remains necessary for lasting peace and \n        stability.'' The Declaration also noted that ``we have decided \n        to invite Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to begin an \n        Intensified Dialogue on the full range of political, military, \n        financial, and security issues relating to their aspirations to \n        membership''.\n            (17) At the Strasbourg/Kehl NATO Summit, the heads of state \n        and government participating in the meeting of the North \n        Atlantic Council on April 4, 2009, reiterated that ``[i]n \n        accordance with Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, NATO's \n        door will remain open to all European democracies which share \n        the values of our Alliance, which are willing and able to \n        assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, and \n        whose inclusion can contribute to common security and \n        stability''.\n            (18) The Summit Declaration also acknowledged the progress \n        of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina on ``cooperation \n        with NATO, including through implementation of its current \n        IPAP, and the country's expressed intention to apply for MAP at \n        an appropriate time.'' The declaration also urged ``Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina's political leaders to take further genuine steps \n        to strengthen state-level institutions and reinvigorate the \n        reform process to advance the country's Euro-Atlantic \n        aspirations.''.\n            (19) With respect to Montenegro, the NATO heads of state \n        and government declared at the 2009 Strasbourg/Kehl NATO \n        Summit, ``We welcome Montenegro's successful and active \n        implementation of its current Individual Partnership Action \n        Plan (IPAP) with NATO. We are encouraged by the reforms it has \n        made in a number of areas that are essential to its Euro-\n        Atlantic integration and also by its contributions to \n        cooperation and security in the region. We are looking forward \n        to Montenegro's further determined efforts in this regard. The \n        Council in permanent session is keeping Montenegro's progress \n        under active review and will respond early to its request to \n        participate in the Membership Action Plan (MAP), on its own \n        merits.''.\n            (20) Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro deserve \n        recognition for their cooperation with the International \n        Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Although \n        Serbia has not yet completely fulfilled its ICTY obligations, \n        the continued support of the Government of Serbia for the \n        process until its conclusion is the best way to ensure the \n        peace and to prepare the way to full participation of Serbia in \n        European institutions.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress--\n            (1) supports the commitment to further enlargement of the \n        North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina and Montenegro, as European democracies, that are \n        able and willing to meet the responsibilities of membership, as \n        expressed by NATO in its Madrid Summit Declaration of 1997, its \n        Washington, DC, Summit Communique of 1999, its Prague Summit \n        Declaration of 2002, its Istanbul Summit Communique of 2004, \n        its Riga Summit Declaration of 2006, its Bucharest Summit \n        Declaration of 2008, and its Strasbourg/Kehl Declaration of \n        2009;\n            (2) encourages United States allies in the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization to utilize the opportunity of the ongoing \n        Strategic Concept review to reinvigorate and transform NATO's \n        approach to its commitment to the peace, stability, and \n        democratic success of the Western Balkans;\n            (3) endorses cooperation with representatives of the \n        Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to determine a realistic \n        timetable and plan, constructed in conjunction with other NATO \n        allies, for Bosnia and Herzegovina to meet the criteria for \n        NATO membership, with the goal of improving the functionality \n        of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina through the \n        achievement of the commonly accepted political, military, \n        economic, and social standards;\n            (4) declares that United States support for Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina's membership should be contingent upon thorough \n        achievement of these exacting requirements, and that NATO \n        membership criteria must not be compromised;\n            (5) calls for the timely admission of Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina and Montenegro contingent upon their continued \n        implementation of democratic, defense, and economic reform, and \n        their willingness and ability to meet the responsibilities of \n        membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a \n        clear expression of national intent to do so; and\n            (6) reaffirms the need for engagement with the \n        democratically elected government of Serbia and amelioration of \n        past bilateral tensions with greater interaction between the \n        people of the United States and Serbia, including support by \n        the United States Government for the process of including \n        Serbia in trans-Atlantic institutions as the Government of \n        Serbia fulfills the necessary criteria.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the existing position of political advisor within the \n        NATO Mission in Sarajevo should be filled by an ambassadorial-\n        level United States diplomat as ``senior civilian \n        representative'' to the NATO Mission in Sarajevo;\n            (2) this senior civilian representative should have primary \n        responsibility for defense and security sector reform and NATO/\n        Partnership for Peace integration;\n            (3) the position requires coordination with international \n        organizations and national authorities in Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina;\n            (4) it is important that this effort have civilian \n        leadership and the senior civilian representative should work \n        in conjunction with the senior military representative and lead \n        the political-military staff;\n            (5) the substantial credibility in Bosnia and Herzegovina \n        enjoyed by the United States should be harnessed to facilitate \n        the fulfillment by the Government of Bosnia and Herzogovina of \n        NATO membership criteria; and\n            (6) the Secretary of State should provide a regular \n        briefing, not less than annually, to the Committee on Foreign \n        Relations of the Senate on the progress of the efforts required \n        under this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.
