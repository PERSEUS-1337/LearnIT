PROMOTION OF CARE FOR THE FRAIL ELDERLY.\n\n    (a) Revisions to Risk Adjustment Methodology.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall revise the risk \n        adjustment methodology under section 1853(a)(3) of the Social \n        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-23(a)(3)) applicable to payments \n        to Medicare+Choice organizations offering, whether directly or \n        under a contract, specialized programs for frail elderly or at-\n        risk beneficiaries to take into account variations in costs \n        incurred by such organizations.\n            (2) Methods considered.--In revising the risk adjustment \n        methodology under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider--\n                    (A) hybrid risk adjustment payment systems, such as \n                partial capitation;\n                    (B) new diagnostic and service markers that \n                accurately predict high risk;\n                    (C) including structural components to reduce \n                payment lag and to account for specific risk factors, \n                such as high end-of-life costs and high death rates;\n                    (D) providing for adjustments to payment amounts \n                for beneficiaries with comorbidities;\n                    (E) testing concurrent risk adjustment \n                methodologies;\n                    (F) testing payment methods using data from \n                specialized programs for frail elderly or at-risk \n                beneficiaries; and\n                    (G) the recommendations contained in the report \n                required to be submitted under subsection (e)(2).\n            (3) Implementation.--The Secretary shall implement the \n        revisions required under paragraph (1) not later than January \n        1, 2006.\n    (b) Interim Continuation of Blended Rate for Specialized Programs \nfor Frail Elderly and At-Risk Medicare Beneficiaries Residing in \nInstitutions.--In the case of a Medicare+Choice organization that \noffers a Medicare+Choice plan that offers, either directly or under a \ncontract, a specialized program for frail elderly or at-risk \nbeneficiaries that exclusively serves beneficiaries in institutions or \nbeneficiaries who are entitled to medical assistance under a State plan \nunder title XIX, notwithstanding section 1853(a)(3)(C)(ii) of the \nSocial Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-23(a)(3)(C)(ii)), such \norganization shall be paid according to the method described in \nsubclause (I) of such section until such time as the Secretary has \nimplemented the revised risk adjustment methodology required under \nsubsection (a).\n    (c) Interim Continuation of Payment Methodologies for Demonstration \nPrograms.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, payment \nmethodologies for medicare demonstration programs for specialized \nprograms for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries (as defined in \nsubsection (f)) shall continue under the terms and conditions of the \ndemonstration authority for such programs in effect during 2002, \nincluding the risk adjustment factors and formula used for paying such \ndemonstration programs. Such terms and conditions shall continue to \napply with respect to each specialized program for frail elderly or at-\nrisk beneficiaries offered by a Medicare+Choice organization that \nparticipated in a demonstration program after the termination of such \nprogram until such time as the Secretary has implemented the revised \nrisk adjustment methodology required under subsection (a).\n    (d) Demonstration Program for Medicare+Choice Payment Reform for \nSpecialized Programs.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a 5-year \n        demonstration program to develop and evaluate--\n                    (A) payment models that pay appropriately for \n                specialized Medicare+Choice plans that exclusively \n                serve, or serve a disproportionate number of, frail \n                elderly or at-risk beneficiaries (either directly or \n                under a contract); and\n                    (B) clinical models that improve outcomes.\n            (2) Requirements.--A Medicare+Choice organization that \n        offers, either directly or under a contract, a specialized \n        program for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries may \n        participate in the demonstration program under this subsection \n        if such Medicare+Choice organization meets the following \n        requirements:\n                    (A) Plan composition.--The specialized program for \n                frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries shall--\n                            (i) serve frail elderly or at-risk \n                        beneficiaries exclusively;\n                            (ii) serve a disproportionate number of \n                        frail or at-risk beneficiaries; or\n                            (iii) serve a disproportionate number of \n                        frail or at-risk beneficiaries who are also \n                        entitled to benefits under a State plan under \n                        title XIX.\n                    (B) Clinical capacity.--The specialized program for \n                frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries shall employ a \n                clinical delivery system that  meets the needs of frail \nelderly or at-risk beneficiaries, including--\n                            (i) initiatives to prevent, delay, or \n                        minimize the progression of chronic disease and \n                        disabilities;\n                            (ii) high-risk screening to identify risk \n                        of hospitalization, nursing home placement, \n                        functional decline, death, and other factors \n                        that increase the costs of care provided;\n                            (iii) staff with special training in \n                        chronic care and geriatric care such as \n                        geriatricians, geriatric nurse practitioners, \n                        and geriatric care managers;\n                            (iv) initiatives for promoting integration \n                        of care, financing, and administrative \n                        functions across health care settings; and\n                            (v) clinical protocols for specific high \n                        cost conditions identified by the Secretary for \n                        which outcomes will be evaluated as part of the \n                        demonstration program under this subsection.\n                    (C) Data collection.--Each Medicare+Choice \n                organization that participates in the demonstration \n                program under this subsection shall collect such data \n                in such format as the Secretary may require to monitor \n                the quality of services provided, outcomes, and costs, \n                including functional and diagnostic data and \n                information collected through the Health Outcomes \n                Survey or another appropriate mechanism.\n                    (D) Quality assurance.--Each Medicare+Choice \n                organization that participates in the demonstration \n                program under this section shall employ such quality \n                standards and track such quality indicators as the \n                Secretary may specify that are relevant to the special \n                needs of enrollees.

enrolled in a specialized program \n                for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries offered by \n                such organization than would have been paid with \n                respect to such beneficiaries if such beneficiaries \n                received benefits under the original medicare fee-for-\n                service program under parts A and B of title XVIII of \n

            benefits.\n                    (E) Frailty adjuster.--The Secretary shall \n                establish and apply a frailty adjuster that is \n                structured as an add-on payment
