SENSE OF THE CONGRESS THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT \n              PARTICIPATE IN THE LATEST ROUND OF THE IMF GENERAL \n              AGREEMENTS TO BORROW.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the International Monetary Fund (IMF) operates outside \n        of public scrutiny, releasing almost no information to the \n        public, thereby avoiding adequate accountability for its \n        programs;\n            (2) to ensure that it gets repaid, the IMF frequently \n        imposes ``conditionality'' on its loans--policy changes that \n        borrowing countries must undertake to receive a loan;\n            (3) frequently, the IMF has forced developing nations to \n        enact unsound economic policies, which have led to tax \n        increases on the poor, draconian currency devaluations, and \n        resource exploitation;\n            (4) the IMF will do considerable harm to developing \n        countries by continuing to make loans to their governments;\n            (5) bailing out these governments only encourages them to \n        continue policies detrimental to their citizens, such as \n        destroying scarce natural resources, maintaining bloated \n        bureaucracies, operating money-losing state-sponsored \n        industries, and spending too much on their militaries; and\n            (6) new IMF funding to developing countries frequently ends \n        up substituting IMF debt for reschedulable commercial bank \n        debt.\n    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that \nthe United States should not participate in the latest round of the \nGeneral Agreements to Borrow, commonly referred to as the ``New \nArrangements to Borrow''.\n\nSEC. 403. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT \n              PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE IMF ENHANCED \n              STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT FACILITY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) of \n        the International Monetary Fund makes low interest loans to the \n        poorest developing countries that cannot pay their bills;\n            (2) countries that borrow from the ESAF must be prepared to \n        adopt multi-year economic and structural ``reform'' programs, \n        which have frequently done the countries more harm than good; \n        and\n            (3) despite 10 years of ESAF lending, poverty continues to \n        increase in many countries that are eligible for loans from the \n        ESAF.\n    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that \nthe United States should not provide additional resources to the \nEnhanced Structural Adjustment Facility.\n\n                    TITLE V--TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS\n\nSEC. 501. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING HIGHWAY DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.\n\n    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n        1991 (ISTEA) included a five-fold increase in demonstration \n        projects compared to the Surface Transportation and Uniform \n        Relocation Assistance Act of 1987;\n            (2) highway demonstration projects provide limited economic \n        benefits; and\n            (3) highway demonstration projects frequently are not \n        consistent with key transportation priorities, do not appear on \n        State or regional transportation plans, and draw funds away \n        from other major Federal-aid highway programs.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is therefore the sense of Congress that \nhighway demonstration projects should not be required by Federal law.\n\nSEC. 502. ELIMINATION OF APPALACHIAN DEVELOPMENT HIGHWAY SYSTEM \n              PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Repeal.--Section 201 of the Appalachian Regional Development \nAct of 1965 (40 U.S.C. App. 201) is repealed.\n    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 401 of such Act (40 U.S.C. App. \n401) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``in section 201 for the Appalachian \n        Development Highway System and Local Access Roads, and''; and\n            (2) by striking ``and in section 201(g) for the Appalachian \n        development highway system and local access roads,''."
