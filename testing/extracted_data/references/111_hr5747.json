    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Families Beyond Bars Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that \n        1,500,000 children in the United States have at least one \n        incarcerated parent, and an estimated 10,000,000 more \n        individuals have at least one parent who was incarcerated at \n        some point during the individual's childhood.\n            (2) In 2006, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated \n        that 75 percent of incarcerated women were mothers, two-thirds \n        of whom were mothers of children under the age of 18, and an \n        estimated 32 percent of incarcerated men were fathers of \n        children under the age of 18.\n            (3) The trauma associated with having an incarcerated \n        parent has been well-documented, and includes depression, \n        aggression, low self-esteem, poor academic performance, \n        truancy, attention deficit disorders, substance abuse, teen \n        pregnancy, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n            (4) The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that \n        children with imprisoned parents may be almost 6 times more \n        likely than their peers to be incarcerated.\n            (5) Increased visitation between incarcerated parents and \n        their children can reduce the anxiety and sense of loss \n        children of incarcerated parents experience. This beneficial, \n        low-cost activity may also contribute to a reduction in future \n        crime committed by, and incarceration of, children of \n        incarcerated parents.\n            (6) Participation in a comprehensive visitation program \n        allows children of incarcerated parents to build relationships \n        with caring adults and experience opportunities for meaningful \n        involvement and membership, helping to reduce the negative \n        effects of parent-child separation.\n            (7) The incarceration of women who are mothers introduces \n        significant changes to the family structure, income level, \n        living arrangements, and emotional support systems of their \n        children. The incarceration of mothers is often more disruptive \n        than the incarceration of fathers, because an estimated two-\n        thirds of mothers who are incarcerated serve as the primary \n        caregiver for at least one child before arrest.\n            (8) Incarceration can present an opportunity to enhance \n        parenting skills, encourage children to resist peer pressure, \n        and foster high parental expectations for their children's \n        school work.\n\nSEC. 3.
