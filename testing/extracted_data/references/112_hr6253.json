    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Ports-to-Forts Act of 2012''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Seaports serve vital national interests by supporting \n        the mobilization and deployment of United States troops, \n        facilitating the flow of trade, and creating jobs.\n            (2) The Commercial Strategic Seaport Grant Program is \n        designed to facilitate the movement of military forces securely \n        through United States seaports with minimal disruptions to \n        commerce.\n            (3) The exponential growth of commercial cargo over the \n        past 20 years has generated concern over the potential for \n        conflict between military and commercial needs and about the \n        future adequacy of the commercial strategic seaport \n        infrastructure to meet national security requirements.\n            (4) The existing infrastructure at seaports may not be \n        readily available when required by the Department of Defense.\n\nSEC. 3.
