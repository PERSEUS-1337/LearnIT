    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Value and Quality \nDemonstration Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Senate makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States Government should reward physicians, \n        hospitals, and other health care providers that provide high-\n        quality, cost-effective health care to beneficiaries under the \n        medicare program.\n            (2) The Journal of the American Medical Association has \n        published quality indicators in an article entitled ``Quality \n        of Medical Care Delivered to Medicare Beneficiaries: A Profile \n        at State and National Levels''.\n            (3) The cost of health care is--\n                    (A) reflected in the type and volume of physicians' \n                services and in physician ordering and prescribing \n                behavior; and\n                    (B) reflected in the amount of the average payment \n                to hospitals under the medicare program for each \n                medicare beneficiary in each State.\n            (4) Physician and hospital practice patterns contribute to \n        the total cost and quality of care for each medicare \n        beneficiary in each State.\n            (5) The original medicare fee-for-service program under \n        parts A and B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act does \n        not include a mechanism to pay for interventions designed to \n        improve quality of care. While the framework for payments to \n        managed care organizations under the Medicare+Choice program \n        under part C of such title allows for the reallocation of \n        capitation revenues to cover such things as disease state \n        management and quality improvement infrastructure, even the \n        most optimistic projections for managed care enrollment leave \n        the majority of medicare beneficiaries in the original medicare \n        fee-for-service program.\n\nSEC. 3.
