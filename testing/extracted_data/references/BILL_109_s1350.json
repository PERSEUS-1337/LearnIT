FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there are roughly 150 million wireless subscribers in \n        the United States, up from approximately 15 million subscribers \n        just a decade ago;\n            (2) wireless phone service has proven valuable to millions \n        of Americans because of its mobility, and the fact that \n        government policies have expanded opportunities for new \n        carriers to enter the market, offering more choices and ever \n        lower prices for consumers;\n            (3) in addition to the benefits of competition and \n        mobility, subscribers also benefit from the fact that wireless \n        phone numbers have not been publicly available;\n            (4) up until now, the privacy of wireless subscribers has \n        been safeguarded and thus vastly diminished the likelihood of \n        subscribers receiving unwanted or annoying phone call \n        interruptions on their wireless phones;\n            (5) moreover, because their wireless contact information, \n        such as their phone number, have never been publicly available \n        in any published directory or from any directory assistance \n        service, subscribers have come to expect that if their phone \n        rings it's likely to be a call from someone to whom they have \n        personally given their number;\n            (6) the wireless industry is poised to begin implementing a \n        directory assistance service so that callers can reach wireless \n        subscribers, including subscribers who have not given such \n        callers their wireless phone number;\n            (7) while some wireless subscribers may find such directory \n        assistance service useful, current subscribers deserve the \n        right to choose whether they want to participate in such a \n        directory;\n            (8) because wireless users are typically charged for \n        incoming calls, consumers must be afforded the ability to \n        maintain the maximum amount of control over how many calls they \n        may expect to receive and, in particular, control over the \n        disclosure of their wireless phone number;\n            (9) current wireless subscribers who elect to participate, \n        or new wireless subscribers who decline to be listed, in any \n        new wireless directory assistance service directory, including \n        those subscribers who also elect not to receive forwarded calls \n        from any wireless directory assistance service, should not be \n        charged for exercising such rights;\n            (10) the marketplace has not yet adequately explained an \n        effective plan to protect consumer privacy rights;\n            (11) Congress previously acted to protect the wireless \n        location information of subscribers by enacting prohibitions on \n        the disclosure of such sensitive information without the \n        express prior authorization of the subscriber; and\n            (12) the public interest would be served by similarly \n        enacting effective and industry-wide privacy protections for \n        consumers with respect to wireless directory assistance \n        service.\n\nSEC. 3. CONSUMER CONTROL OF WIRELESS PHONE NUMBERS.\n\n    Section 332(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(9) Wireless consumer privacy protection.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--A provider of commercial mobile \n                services, or any direct or indirect affiliate or agent \n                of such a provider, may not include the wireless \n                telephone number information of any subscriber in any \n                wireless directory assistance service database unless--\n                            ``(i) the mobile service provider provides \n                        a conspicuous, separate notice to the \n                        subscriber informing the subscriber of the \n                        right not to be listed in any wireless \n                        directory assistance service; and\n                            ``(ii) the mobile service provider obtains \n                        express prior authorization for listing from \n                        such subscriber, separate from any \n                        authorization obtained to provide such \n                        subscriber with commercial mobile service, or \n                        any calling plan or service associated with \n                        such commercial mobile service, and such \n                        authorization has not been subsequently \n                        withdrawn.\n                    ``(B) Cost-free de-listing.--A provider of \n                commercial mobile services, or any direct or indirect \n                affiliate or agent of such a provider, shall remove the \n                wireless telephone number information of any subscriber \n                from any wireless directory assistance service database \n                upon request by that subscriber and without any cost to \n                the subscriber.\n                    ``(C) Wireless accessibility.--A provider of \n                commercial mobile services, or any direct or indirect \n                affiliate or agent of such provider, may connect a \n                calling party from a wireless directory assistance \n                service to a commercial mobile service subscriber only \n                if--\n                            ``(i) such subscriber is provided prior \n                        notice of the calling party's identity and is \n                        permitted to accept or reject the incoming call \n                        on a per-call basis;\n                            ``(ii) such subscriber's wireless telephone \n                        number information is not disclosed to the \n                        calling party; and\n                            ``(iii) such subscriber has not declined or \n                        refused to participate in such database.\n                    ``(D) Protection of wireless phone numbers.--A \n                telecommunications carrier shall not disclose in its \n                billing information provided to customers wireless \n                telephone number information of subscribers who have \n                indicated a preference to their commercial mobile \n                services provider for not having their wireless \n                telephone number information disclosed.
