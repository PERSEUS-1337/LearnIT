WELLNESS TRUST FUND.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is hereby created on the books of the \nTreasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the \n``Wellness Trust Fund''. The Wellness Trust Fund shall consist of such \ngifts and bequests as may be made and such amounts as may be deposited \nin, or appropriated to, such fund.\n    (b) There are hereby appropriated to the Trust Fund for each year 4 \npercent of all health care premiums, as well as 4 percent of all \nFederal expenditures on health care for populations served outside of \nhealth care plans.\n\nSEC. 3. WELLNESS PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Wellness Voucher.--The Secretary shall issue to each enrollee \nsatisfying the conditions of paragraph (b) a wellness voucher card \nwhich may be used for identification, verifying eligibility for \nbenefits under this section, and processing of payments under this \nsection to participating wellness providers selected by the enrollee. \nThe wellness voucher card shall bear an indication of its total value \nas computed under paragraph (g), the portion of its value used and the \nportion remaining at any time. The wellness voucher card function may \nbe incorporated into the health security card.\n    (b) Eligibility.--Those eligible for wellness benefits are:\n            (1) Any enrollee thirty years of age or older;\n            (2) Any enrollee under thirty years of age who is certified \n        by his or her primary care provider as in special need of \n        wellness benefits as a result of unusual physical \n        characteristics or conditions; or\n            (3) Any enrollee under thirty years of age who uses \n        tobacco, for the purpose of a tobacco-use-cessation program; or \n        whose cholesterol condition is certified by his primary care \n        provider to place him or her at high health risk, for the \n        purpose of a weight-loss, nutrition, or exercise program; or \n        whose body weight is certified by his primary care physician to \n        place him or her at high health risk, for the purpose of a \n        weight-loss, nutrition or exercise program.\n    (c) Benefits.--Benefits provided under this section are intended to \npromote greater health and reduced injury and illness through programs \nwhich increase general health status, or promote healthier lifestyles \nby changing health related behaviors, such as hygiene or nutritional \neducation programs. They are not intended to duplicate or substitute \nfor therapeutic or rehabilitative services more properly included in \ntreatments for illnesses, injuries or conditions covered by medical \nbenefits. In addition to the activities specified in paragraph (b)(3), \nStates shall periodically determine the range of other services \neligible for reimbursement from wellness voucher funds. Enrollees \neligible under paragraph (b)(2) are eligible only for such benefits \nrelated to the characteristic or condition certified by the primary \ncare provider.\n    (d) Enrollee Use.--An eligible enrollee obtains benefits under this \nsection by presenting the wellness voucher card to a participating \nwellness provider in return for covered benefits up to the total value \nremaining on the card. Covered benefits costing more than the value \nremaining on the card may be purchased, but the enrollee is personally \nresponsible for the portion of the cost which exceeds the value \nremaining on the voucher card.\n    (e) Participating Providers.--\n            (1) Wellness providers must be licensed under any \n        applicable State laws relating to the activities provided. The \n        States may establish standards for minimum solvency and \n        insurance (which may include bonding) for participating \n        providers.\n            (2) As a condition of participation in the program \n        established by this section, providers agree to provide a \n        defined course of covered benefits in return for the payment \n        made by the Secretary under this section, to provide covered \n        benefits in return for payment in full by the Secretary from a \n        portion of the value of the wellness voucher, or to provide \n        covered benefits to be paid in part by payment from the \n        Secretary under this section.\n            (3) As a condition of participation in the program \n        established by this section, providers must agree to inform the \n        enrollee's primary care physician of the services rendered and \n        consult with the primary care physician if requested on any \n        ongoing course of services.\n            (4) Each State shall maintain a list of wellness providers \n        satisfying the requirements of this Act, which it shall make \n        public and shall transmit to the Secretary, and shall promptly \n        notify the Secretary of any additions thereto or deletions \n        therefrom.\n    (f) Payment.--The Secretary shall establish a mechanism for paying \nto participating providers from the Wellness Trust Fund the cost of \ncovered benefits under this section as they are provided, and as claims \nfor same are made. In no event shall the Secretary be liable for so \nmuch of claims which individually or in the aggregate exceed the value \nof the enrollee's wellness voucher.\n    (g) Computation of Wellness Voucher Value.--Prior to the beginning \nof each year, the Secretary shall project the total income to the \nWellness Trust Fund for the coming year, and shall divide this figure, \nless a contingency reserve not to exceed 2 percent, by the number of \nenrollees whom the Secretary projects will be eligible for benefits \nunder this section in that year. The quotient is the value of the \nwellness voucher of each eligible enrollee for that year, except that \nthe Secretary may adjust the value of wellness vouchers relative to \neach other to take into consideration differences in the cost of \nservices among States or alliance service areas. Such process of \nadjustment shall not increase the total aggregate value of all wellness \nvouchers.\n\nSEC. 4.
