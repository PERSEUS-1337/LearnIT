SHORT TITLE; REFERENCE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Health Information \nIndependence Act of 2001''.\n    (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \nexpressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other \nprovision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \nother provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n    (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; reference; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Definitions.\nSec. 4. Health claims.\nSec. 5. Independent scientific review.\nSec. 6. Legal effect of health claim recommendation by Independent \n                            Scientific Reviewers.\nSec. 7. Department of Health and Human Services budget allocation for \n                            independent scientific reviews.\n\n SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Access to accurate information at the point of sale \n        concerning the effect of nutrients on disease is indispensable \n        to the exercise of informed consumer choice in the marketplace \n        and to the health and welfare of the American people.\n            (2) In 1999, 2000, and 2001, Federal courts have held that \n        Food and Drug Administration suppression of nutrient-disease \n        information is a violation of the First Amendment to the United \n        States Constitution.\n            (3) Despite those holdings and despite the courts' orders, \n        the Food and Drug Administration continues to suppress \n        nutrient-disease information that could improve public health, \n        reduce the costs of health care, and promote the welfare of the \n        American people.\n            (4) The history of the Food and Drug Administration review \n        of nutrient-disease relationships reveals a strong and \n        unscientific bias against food and dietary supplement health \n        claims in direct violation of the constitutional mandates of \n        Federal courts and the intent of Congress.\n            (5) The Food and Drug Administration favors suppression of \n        health claims over disclosure, despite court imposed \n        constitutional requirements to the contrary.\n            (6) To ensure that health claims are evaluated rationally, \n        fairly, and in compliance with constitutional requirements and \n        the intent of Congress, jurisdiction over health claims \n        evaluation must be removed from the Food and Drug \n        Administration and placed in the hands of Independent \n        Scientific Reviewers who do not harbor a bias against food and \n        dietary supplement health claims.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 201 (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(kk) The term `Independent Scientific Reviewer' means a person \nwho--\n            ``(1) holds a Ph.D., an M.D., or both, and has been \n        employed full-time for at least the past 5 consecutive years as \n        a professor or assistant or associate professor in a department \n        of medicine, biochemistry, epidemiology, pharmacology, \n        pharmacognosy, or nutrition at a university that is accredited \n        by an organization recognized by the Department of Education of \n        the United States;\n            ``(2) has never been employed by, and has never been \n        contracted to do work for, the Food and Drug Administration or \n        any other agency or office of the Department of Health and \n        Human Services (except to review health claim petitions under \n        section 403D);\n            ``(3) has never been employed by, and has never been \n        contracted to do work for, the health claim petitioner;\n            ``(4) signs an oath pledging to evaluate the health claim \n        petition provided to him or her by the Secretary in strict \n        accordance with the criteria specified in section 403D;\n            ``(5) signs an oath pledging not to discuss with any person \n        the fact that he or she is reviewing the health claim petition \n        or the substance of the petition or the substance of the \n        evaluation before the results of the scientific review are \n        supplied in a complete written evaluation to the Secretary;\n            ``(6) signs an oath pledging to supply complete copies of \n        all publicly available scientific evidence reviewed along with \n        a complete written evaluation of the health claim to the \n        Secretary no later than 180 days after receipt of the health \n        claim petition from the Secretary; and\n            ``(7) signs an oath pledging to exercise independent \n        professional judgment, free of any external influence and any \n        unscientific bias that might interfere with the objective \n        evaluation of the health claim.''.\n\nSEC. 4. HEALTH CLAIMS.\n\n    Section 403(r) (21 U.S.C. 343(r)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (1)--\n                    (A) in the matter preceding clause (A)--\n                            (i) by striking ``food intended'' and \n                        inserting ``food or dietary supplement \n                        intended''; and\n                            (ii) by striking ``food which'' and \n                        inserting ``food or dietary supplement which''; \n                        and\n                    (B) in clause (B)--\n                            (i) by inserting after ``health-related \n                        condition'' the following: ``(including any \n                        statement that the nutrient prevents, treats, \n                        or cures a disease)''; and\n                            (ii) by striking ``or (5)(D)'';\n            (2) in subparagraph (3), by amending clause (B) to read as \n        follows:\n    ``(B)(i) The Secretary shall promulgate no later than 30 days after \nreceiving an evaluation from an Independent Scientific Reviewer \nregulations that authorize use on labels and in labeling of all claims \nof the type described in subparagraph (1)(B) recommended for approval \nby the Independent Scientific Reviewer together with such disclaimer or \ndisclaimers as the Independent Scientific Reviewer may also recommend.\n    ``(ii) The duties of the Secretary described in subclause (i) are \nnondelegable and may be discharged only by the Secretary.'';\n            (3) by striking subparagraph (4) and redesignating \n        subparagraph (5) as subparagraph (4); and\n            (4) in subparagraph (4) (as so redesignated), by striking \n        clause (D).\n\nSEC. 5. INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC REVIEW.\n\n    Chapter IV (21 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by inserting after \nsection 403C the following new section:\n\n                    ``independent scientific review\n\n    ``Sec. 403D.

LEGAL EFFECT OF HEALTH CLAIM RECOMMENDATION BY INDEPENDENT \n              SCIENTIFIC REVIEWERS.\n\n    Chapter IV (21 U.S.C. 341 et seq.), as amended by section 5 of this \nAct, is amended by inserting after section 403D the following new \nsection:\n\n             ``legal effect of health claim recommendations\n\n    ``Sec. 403E.
