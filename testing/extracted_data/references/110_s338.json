    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Long-Term Care Hospital \nImprovement Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Long-term care hospitals (in this Act referred to as \n        ``LTCHs'') serve a valuable role in the post-acute care \n        continuum by providing care to medically complex patients \n        needing long hospital stays.\n            (2) The Medicare program should ensure that patients \n        receive post-acute care in the most appropriate setting. The \n        use of additional certification criteria for LTCHs, including \n        facility and patient criteria, will promote the appropriate \n        placement of severely ill patients into LTCHs. Further, patient \n        admission, continued stay, and discharge screening tools can \n        guide appropriate patient placement.\n            (3) Measuring and reporting on quality of care is an \n        important function of any Medicare provider and a national \n        quality initiative for LTCHs should be similar to short-term \n        general acute care hospitals in the Medicare program.\n            (4) To conform the prospective payment system for LTCHs \n        with certain aspects of the prospective payment system for \n        short-term general acute care hospitals and promote payment \n        stability, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this \n        Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') should--\n                    (A) perform an annual market basket update;\n                    (B) conduct the long term care diagnosis related \n                groups (in this Act referred to as ``LTCDRGs'') \n                reweighting and wage level adjustments in a budget \n                neutral manner each year;\n                    (C) not perform a proposed one-time budget \n                neutrality adjustment; and\n                    (D) not extend the 25-percent limitation on \n                reimbursement of co-located hospital patient admissions \n                to freestanding LTCHs.\n            (5) LTCHs co-located with another hospital in underserved \n        areas, including rural areas and areas with an urban single or \n        MSA dominant hospital, should be afforded greater relief from \n        the 50 percent limitation on reimbursement of co-located \n        hospital patient admissions.\n\nSEC. 3. NEW DEFINITION OF A LONG-TERM CARE HOSPITAL WITH FACILITY AND \n              PATIENT CRITERIA.\n\n    (a) Definition.--Section 1861 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395x) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n\n                       ``Long-Term Care Hospital\n\n    ``(ccc) The term `long-term care hospital' means an institution \nwhich--''\n            ``(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the \n        supervision of physicians, to medically complex inpatients \n        needing long hospital stays--\n                    ``(A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services \n                for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, \n                disabled, or sick persons;

and\n                    ``(E) the institution maintains adequate staffing \n                levels of licensed health care professionals, as \n                determined by the Secretary, to ensure that long-term \n                care hospitals provide the intensive level of care that \n                is sufficient to meet the needs of medically complex \n                patients needing long hospital stays;
