It is the leading cause of \n        death and disability in young Americans.\n            (2) 1,500,000 traumatic brain injuries occur each year. \n        1,000,000 of those injuries are serious enough to require \n        treatment in hospital emergency departments. An estimated \n        5,300,000 Americans live with a disability as a result of brain \n        injury. The annual cost to society is estimated conservatively \n        at $38,700,000,000.\n            (3) Traumatic brain injury often results in significant \n        impairment of an individual's physical, cognitive, and \n        psychosocial functioning requiring access to an array of health \n        care, education, social services and long-term supports from \n        acute care to rehabilitation to community re-entry and \n        participation.\n    (b) Purposes.--In is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \n        working in cooperation with other Federal agencies, to study \n        and monitor the incidence and prevalence of traumatic brain \n        injury and conduct national education activities to increase \n        awareness of the causes and consequences of traumatic brain \n        injury;\n            (2) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n        cause to be identified best practices in diagnosis, emergent \n        care, special education, and rehabilitation with the ultimate \n        goal of independent functioning within the community;\n            (3) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n        encourage States to build capacity and enhance community based \n        service delivery systems to provide adequate, appropriate, and \n        accessible services to individuals with traumatic brain injury \n        and their families; and\n            (4) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n        conduct basic and applied research regarding traumatic brain \n        injury, including diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation.\n\nSEC. 3.
