FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Lake Pontchartrain Basin forms one of the largest \n        natural estuaries in the continental United States;\n            (2) the Basin drains an area of almost 5,000 square miles \n        from 16 Louisiana parishes and 4 Mississippi counties;\n            (3) the ecology of the Basin provides the diverse essential \n        habitat that supports countless species of fish, birds, \n        mammals, and plants;\n            (4) the extensive wetland of the Basin provides the primary \n        nursery for much of the seafood harvested in the Gulf Coast;\n            (5) conditions resulting from urbanization, increasing \n        population growth and development, sewage and septic tank \n        discharges, animal waste, herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers, \n        stormwater runoff, sediments from construction, and sewage from \n        fishing camps and residences should be addressed to improve the \n        environment and ecology of the Basin;\n            (6) a major source of pollution in the Basin is raw or \n        partially treated human waste from--\n                    (A) communities with poor sewer systems or without \n                sewer systems; and\n                    (B) septic tank systems that are not operating \n                properly;\n            (8) stormwater discharges that combine with effluent from \n        sanitary discharges from broken lines are channeled directly \n        into Lake Pontchartrain or adjacent bodies of water;\n            (7) a number of local government agencies are working on \n        restoration efforts that have a direct impact on water quality \n        in the Basin, including the Department of Environmental Quality \n        of Louisiana, the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board, \n        Jefferson Parish, and other governmental agencies;\n            (8) a number of non-regulating organizations, such as the \n        Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation and the University of New \n        Orleans, are playing substantial, essential roles in \n        restoration efforts;\n            (9) the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, the University \n        of New Orleans, and the Regional Planning Commission for \n        Jefferson, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, and St. Tammany \n        Parishes, Louisiana, have entered into a memorandum of \n        understanding to better facilitate the restoration and \n        preservation of water quality and habitats throughout the \n        Basin; and\n            (10) the programs and activities of the various Federal \n        agencies involved with administration of laws, programs, and \n        assets that affect the water quality of the Basin, including \n        the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of \n        Engineers, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the \n        Interior, and other agencies, lack coordination and sufficient \n        resources to measure and remediate water quality problems in \n        the Basin.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to coordinate the restoration efforts of Federal, \n        State, and local agencies and organizations in the restoration \n        of the Basin;\n            (2) to establish the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration \n        Program in the office of the Environmental Protection Agency; \n        and\n            (3) to authorize and provide resources for restoration \n        projects in the Basin.\n\nSEC. 3.
