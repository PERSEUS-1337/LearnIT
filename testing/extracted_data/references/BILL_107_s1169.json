FINDINGS.\n\n    The Senate makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Outcomes Assessment and Information Set (in this \n        section referred to as ``OASIS'') includes information \n        regarding the health and functional status of patients of home \n        health agencies, the use of health services by such patients, \n        the living conditions of such patients, and the social support \n        provided to such patients, that is necessary to assess the \n        quality of care being provided to medicare and medicaid \n        patients by home health agencies.\n            (2) According to the Comptroller General of the United \n        States, the average additional time that is necessary for a \n        home health agency to comply with the OASIS requirement for a \n        start-of-care assessment is 61 minutes more than the amount of \n        time to comply with such requirement estimated by the Centers \n        for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n            (3) Existing Federal regulations and associated paperwork \n        requirements are excessively straining home health agencies and \n        their clinical staff, and are often reported by nurses to be \n        the primary contributors to their decreased job satisfaction.\n            (4) Many nurses and home health aides are leaving the home \n        health care profession and patients are staying in the hospital \n        longer than necessary.\n            (5) A 2000 national survey of home health agencies by the \n        Hospital and Healthcare Compensation Service reported a 21 \n        percent turnover rate for registered nurses, a 24 percent \n        turnover rate for licensed practical nurses, and a 28 percent \n        turnover rate for home health aides.\n            (6) In its May 17, 2001 report titled ``Nursing Workforce--\n        Recruitment and Retention of Nurses and Nurse Aides Is a \n        Growing Concern'', the General Accounting Office reported that \n        the jobs for nurse aides working in home health care are \n        projected to increase by 58 percent, from 746,000 in 1998 to \n        1,200,000 in 2008.\n\nSEC. 3.
