    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians \nLand Exchange Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since time immemorial, the ancestors of the Eastern \n        Band of Cherokee Indians have lived in the Great Smoky \n        Mountains of North Carolina. The Eastern Band's ancestral \n        homeland includes substantial parts of seven eastern States and \n        the land that now constitutes the Great Smoky Mountains \n        National Park.\n            (2) The Eastern Band has proposed a land exchange with the \n        National Park Service and has spent over $1,500,000 for studies \n        to thoroughly inventory the environmental and cultural \n        resources of the proposed land exchange parcels.\n            (3) Such land exchange would benefit the American public by \n        enabling the National Park Service to acquire the Yellow Face \n        tract, comprising 218 acres of land adjacent to the Blue Ridge \n        Parkway.\n            (4) Acquisition of the Yellow Face tract for protection by \n        the National Park Service would serve the public interest by \n        preserving important views for Blue Ridge Parkway visitors, \n        preserving habitat for endangered species and threatened \n        species including the northern flying squirrel and the rock \n        gnome lichen, preserving valuable high altitude wetland seeps, \n        and preserving the property from rapidly advancing residential \n        development.\n            (5) The proposed land exchange would also benefit the \n        Eastern Band by allowing it to acquire the Ravensford tract, \n        comprising 143 acres adjacent to the Tribe's trust territory in \n        Cherokee, North Carolina, and currently within the Great Smoky \n        Mountains National Park and Blue Ridge Parkway. The Ravensford \n        tract is part of the Tribe's ancestral homeland as evidenced by \n        archaeological finds dating back no less than 6,000 years.\n            (6) The Eastern Band has a critical need to replace the \n        current Cherokee Elementary School, which was built by the \n        Department of the Interior over 40 years ago with a capacity of \n        480 students. The school now hosts 794 students in dilapidated \n        buildings and mobile classrooms at a dangerous highway \n        intersection in downtown Cherokee, North Carolina.\n            (7) The Eastern Band ultimately intends to build a new \n        three-school campus to serve as an environmental, cultural, and \n        educational ``village,'' where Cherokee language and culture \n        can be taught alongside the standard curriculum.\n            (8) The land exchange and construction of this educational \n        village will benefit the American public by preserving Cherokee \n        traditions and fostering a vibrant, modern, and well-educated \n        Indian nation.\n            (9) The land exchange will also reunify tribal reservation \n        lands now separated between the Big Cove Community and the \n        balance of the Qualla Boundary, reestablishing the territorial \n        integrity of the Eastern Band.\n            (10) The Ravensford tract contains no threatened species or \n        endangered species listed pursuant to the Endangered Species \n        Act of 1973. The 218-acre Yellow Face tract has a number of \n        listed threatened species and endangered species and a higher \n        appraised value than the 143-acre Ravensford tract.\n            (11) The American public will benefit from the Eastern \n        Band's commitment to mitigate any impacts on natural and \n        cultural resources on the Ravensford tract, by among other \n        things reducing the requested acreage from 168 to 143 acres.\n            (12) The Congress and the Department of the Interior have \n        approved land exchanges in the past when the benefits to the \n        public and requesting party are clear, as they are in this \n        case.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To acquire the Yellow Face tract for protection by the \n        National Park Service, in order to preserve the Waterrock Knob \n        area's spectacular views, endangered species and high altitude \n        wetland seeps from encroachment by housing development, for the \n        benefit and enjoyment of the American public.\n            (2) To transfer the Ravensford tract, to be held in trust \n        by the United States for the benefit of the Eastern Band of \n        Cherokee Indians, in order to provide for an education facility \n        that promotes the cultural integrity of the Eastern Band and to \n        reunify two Cherokee communities that were historically \n        contiguous, while mitigating any impacts on natural and \n        cultural resources on the tract.\n            (3) To promote cooperative activities and partnerships \n        between the Eastern band and the National Park Service within \n        the Eastern Band's ancestral homelands.\n\nSEC. 3.
