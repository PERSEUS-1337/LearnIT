    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Preservation of Antibiotics for \nHuman Treatment Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Several antibiotics and classes of antibiotics, \n        particularly penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides (including \n        but not limited to erythromycin and tylosin), lincomycin, \n        bacitracin, virginiamycin, aminoglycosides, and sulfonamides, \n        that either are used in or are related to antibiotics used in \n        humans to treat infectious diseases are also routinely \n        administered to healthy agricultural animals, generally via \n        feed or water, in order to promote the animals' growth or to \n        prevent disease. Such uses do not require a veterinarian's \n        prescription.\n            (2) Mounting scientific evidence shows that this \n        nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in agricultural animals can \n        lead to development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can \n        be transferred to people, making it harder to treat certain \n        infections.\n            (3) In 1969, the Swann Committee was formed in the United \n        Kingdom to examine the public health effects of use of \n        antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals. The Committee \n        recommended that antimicrobials be divided into ``feed'' and \n        ``therapeutic'' classes of drugs and that the ``feed'' class \n        not include drugs used therapeutically in humans or animals. \n        Most developed countries in the world, with the exception of \n        the United States and Canada, restrict the use of \n        antimicrobials in animal production systems for growth \n        promotion.\n            (4) In 1997, the World Health Organization recommended that \n        antibiotics used to treat humans should not also be used to \n        promote animal growth, although such antibiotics could still be \n        used to treat ill animals.\n            (5) In July 1998, the National Academy of Sciences, in a \n        report prepared at the request of the United States Department \n        of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, concluded \n        ``there is a link between the use of antibiotics in food \n        animals, the development of bacterial resistance to these \n        drugs, and human disease''.\n            (6) In December 1998, health ministers for the European \n        Union countries voted to ban the remaining human-use \n        antibiotics still in use to promote animal growth. The ban on \n        using virginiamycin, tylosin, spiramycin, and bacitracin in \n        animal feed became effective for the 15 member states of the \n        European Union on July 1, 1999. Prior to that action, \n        individual European countries, including the United Kingdom, \n        Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, had banned the use in animal feed \n        of specific antibiotics.\n            (7) An April 1999 study by the General Accounting Office \n        concluded that resistant strains of three microorganisms that \n        cause foodborne illness or disease in humans--salmonella, \n        campylobacter, and E. coli--are linked to the use of \n        antibiotics in animals.\n            (8) In October 2000, the Food and Drug Administration \n        issued a notice announcing its intention to withdraw approvals \n        for use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in poultry, in light of \n        the fact that increased resistance to fluoroquinolones in \n        certain bacteria followed approval of those antibiotics for \n        such use in the mid-1990s. While one company (Abbott \n        Laboratories) immediately agreed to voluntarily withdraw its \n        product, the only other manufacturer (Bayer Corp.) is \n        contesting FDA's proposed withdrawal and continues to market \n        its product. Previous proceedings by FDA to withdraw approval \n        of animal drugs have taken substantial amounts of time \n        following initiation of formal action by FDA, including 6 years \n        in one instance and 20 in another.\n            (9) In November 2000, the American Medical Association, \n        American Public Health Association, and other health \n        organizations urged Bayer Corp. to comply voluntarily with \n        FDA's proposed ban.\n            (10) In June 2001, the American Medical Association adopted \n        a resolution opposing nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials in \n        animal agriculture. Organizations that have taken a similar \n        position include the American College of Preventive Medicine, \n        the American Public Health Association, and the Council of \n        State and Territorial Epidemiologists.\n            (11) In October 2001, the New England Journal of Medicine \n        published a guest editorial titled ``Antimicrobials in Animal \n        Feed--Time to Stop''. The editorial urged a ban on \n        nontherapeutic use in animals of medically important \n        antibiotics, and on use in animals of fluoroquinolones.\n            (12) In January 2001, a Federal Interagency Task Force \n        released an Action Plan, which notes that ``drug-resistant \n        pathogens are a growing menace to all people, regardless of \n        age, gender, or socioeconomic background. If we do not act to \n        address the problem... [d]rug choices for the treatment of \n        common infections will become increasingly limited and \n        expensive--and, in some cases, nonexistent.''.\n            (13) Scientific studies have shown that resistance traits \n        can be transferred among unrelated species of bacteria, \n        including from nonpathogens to pathogens.\n\nSEC. 3.
