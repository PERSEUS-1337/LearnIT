The Director shall make awards from \n        amounts available under paragraph (1) for research on cancer.\n    ``(d) Supplement Not Supplant.--Amounts provided to an institute or \ncenter under subsection (c) shall be used to supplement and not \nsupplant other research conducted with Federal funds.\n    ``(e) Limitation.--No expenditure shall be made under subsection \n(c)(1) during any fiscal year in which the annual amount appropriated \nfor the National Institutes of Health is less than the amount so \nappropriated for the prior fiscal year.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
