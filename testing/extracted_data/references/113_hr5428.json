FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In January 1993, the active mission of the Fort Wingate \n        Activity Depot located in McKinley County, New Mexico (in this \n        Act referred to as ``Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity''), \n        ceased, and the installation was closed pursuant to title II of \n        the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and \n        Realignment Act (Public Law 100-526; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).\n            (2) The lands occupied by the Former Fort Wingate Depot \n        Activity were originally the ancestral lands of both the Zuni \n        Tribe and Navajo Nation, as indicated by the ancestral history \n        and large number of archaeological and cultural sites \n        identified on the lands.\n            (3) The Secretary of the Interior, with the support of the \n        Zuni Tribe, the Navajo Nation, and other concerned parties, \n        determined that upon completion of environmental remediation of \n        Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity, lands no longer needed by \n        the Department of the Army would be transferred to the \n        Secretary of the Interior and held in trust by the United \n        States for the benefit of the Zuni Tribe and the Navajo Nation.\n            (4) On July 8, 2013, the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation, \n        acting through the respective tribal leadership, who received \n        authority from their tribal governments to enter into good \n        faith discussions, and through their respective legal \n        representatives, met in the Capitol office of Congressman Don \n        Young, with Congressman Ben Ray Lujan and Congressman Steve \n        Pearce present, for final discussions to fairly divide Former \n        Fort Wingate Depot Activity.\n            (5) In the resulting discussions, the tribal leaders \n        informally agreed to the property divisions reflected in the \n        map titled ``Fort Wingate Depot Activity Negotiated Property \n        Divisions July 2013'' prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers \n        (in this Act referred to as the ``Map''), and the land division \n        outlined in section 3 was created in consultation with the Zuni \n        Tribe and the Navajo Nation.\n            (6) This Act achieves the goal of fairly dividing Former \n        Fort Wingate Depot Activity for the benefit of the Zuni Tribe \n        and the Navajo Nation.\n\nSEC. 3.
