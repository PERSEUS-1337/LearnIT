FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Dutch involvement in North America started with Henry \n        Hudson's 1609 voyage on the ship, Half Moon, employed by the \n        Dutch East India Company.\n            (2) After 1640, New Netherland gradually began to transform \n        from a chain of trading posts into a settlement colony.\n            (3) As Dutch and English settlers moved closer to one \n        another, they began to assimilate in what would later become \n        Queens County.\n            (4) The Dutch and English settlements had not been without \n        conflict. Although the Dutch Republic was well known for its \n        toleration of other faiths, Director General Peter Stuyvesant \n        and his council thought that liberty of worship should not be \n        granted to Quakers.\n            (5) When Quakers began to arrive in Flushing, the colonial \n        government issued an ordinance that formally banned the \n        practice of all religions outside of the Dutch Reformed Church.\n            (6) On December 27, 1657, 30 Flushing residents signed what \n        was later called the Flushing Remonstrance, objecting to this \n        order. None of the remonstrance's authors were Quakers.\n            (7) Dutch colonial authorities proceeded to arrest the \n        signers of the Flushing Remonstrance. In 1662, John Bowne \n        defied the ban and allowed Quakers to hold services in his \n        house. Bowne was fined and banished to the Dutch Republic for \n        showing contempt for secular authority.\n            (8) Bowne was later exonerated after appealing to the \n        guarantees of religious liberty before the Dutch West India \n        Company and returned to Flushing in 1664. The colony later fell \n        to British control on September 24, 1664.\n            (9) The Flushing Remonstrance is now considered by many to \n        be instrumental in the development of religious liberty in the \n        United States and a precursor to the First Amendment to the \n        United States Constitution.\n            (10) In 1957, the United States Postal Service released a \n        3-cent postage stamp commemorating the 300th Anniversary of the \n        signing of the Flushing Remonstrance which read, ``Religious \n        Freedom in America''.\n            (11) Queens remained rural and agricultural through the \n        18th and 19th Centuries. Although its Dutch identity \n        diminished, the tolerance of diversity that has harbored \n        Quakers and other religious sects in the Dutch Colonial period \n        continues to this day. Queens is the most ethnically diverse \n        urban area in the world, with a population of over 2,200,000 \n        representing over 100 different nations and speaking over 138 \n        different languages.\n\nSEC. 3.
