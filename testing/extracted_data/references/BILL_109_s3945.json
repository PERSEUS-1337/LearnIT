FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is estimated that 25,000 to 32,000 women become \n        pregnant each year as a result of rape or incest. An estimated \n        22,000 of these pregnancies could be prevented if rape or \n        incest survivors had timely access to emergency contraception.\n            (2) A 1996 study of pregnancies resulting from rape or \n        incest (published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and \n        Gynecology) found that 50 percent of the pregnancies described \n        in paragraph (1) ended in abortion.\n            (3) Surveys have shown that many hospitals do not routinely \n        provide emergency contraception to women seeking treatment \n        after being sexually assaulted.\n            (4) The risk of pregnancy after sexual assault has been \n        estimated to be 4.7 percent in survivors who were not protected \n        by some form of contraception at the time of the attack.\n            (5) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency \n        contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended \n        pregnancy, reducing the risk by as much as 89 percent if taken \n        within days of unprotected intercourse and up to 95 percent if \n        taken in the first 24 hours after unprotected intercourse.\n            (6) Medical research strongly indicates that the sooner \n        emergency contraception is administered, the greater the \n        likelihood of preventing unintended pregnancy.\n            (7) In light of the safety and effectiveness of emergency \n        contraceptive pills, both the American Medical Association and \n        the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have \n        endorsed more widespread availability of such pills.\n            (8) The American College of Emergency Physicians and the \n        American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists agree that \n        offering emergency contraception to female patients after a \n        sexual assault should be considered part of the standard of \n        care.\n            (9) Approximately 30 percent of United States women of \n        reproductive age are unaware of the availability of emergency \n        contraception.\n            (10) New data from a survey of women having abortions \n        estimates that 51,000 abortions were prevented by use of \n        emergency contraception in 2000 and that increased use of \n        emergency contraception accounted for 43 percent of the \n        decrease in total abortions between 1994 and 2000.\n            (11) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n        emergency medical treatment provide emergency contraception as \n        a treatment option to any woman who has been sexually \n        assaulted, so that she may prevent an unintended pregnancy.\n            (12) Victims of sexual assault are at increased risk of \n        contracting sexually transmitted diseases.\n            (13) Some sexually transmitted infections cannot be \n        reliably cured if treatment is delayed, and may result in high \n        morbidity and mortality. HIV has killed over 520,000 \n        individuals in the United States, and the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention currently estimates that over 1,000,000 \n        individuals in the United States are infected with the virus. \n        Even modern drug treatment has failed to cure infected \n        individuals. Nearly 80,000 individuals in the United States are \n        infected with hepatitis B each year, with some individuals \n        unable to fully recover. An estimated 1,250,000 individuals in \n        the United States remain chronically infected with the \n        hepatitis B virus and at present, 1 in 5 of those infected \n        individuals may expect to die of liver failure.\n            (14) It is possible to prevent some sexually transmitted \n        diseases by treating an exposed individual promptly. The use of \n        post-exposure prophylaxis using antiretroviral drugs has been \n        demonstrated to effectively prevent the establishment of HIV \n        infection. Hepatitis B infection may also be eliminated if an \n        exposed individual receives prompt treatment.\n            (15) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n        recommended risk evaluation and appropriate application of \n        post-exposure treatment for victims of sexual assault. For such \n        individuals, immediate treatment is the only means to prevent a \n        life-threatening infection.\n            (16) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n        emergency medical treatment provide assessment and treatment of \n        sexually transmitted infections to minimize the harm to victims \n        of sexual assault.\n\nSEC. 3.
