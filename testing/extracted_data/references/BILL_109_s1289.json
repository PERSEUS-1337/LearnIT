FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The development of uterine fibroids is a common and \n        significant health problem, affecting women, primarily of \n        reproductive age, across all ages, racial backgrounds, and \n        socioeconomic levels.\n            (2) It is estimated that between 20 and 30 percent of women \n        of reproductive age have clinically recognized uterine \n        fibroids, and screening studies indicate the prevalence of \n        uterine fibroids in women may be much higher.\n            (3) Minority women are more likely to develop uterine \n        fibroids, and through ultrasound screening of African American \n        and Caucasian women for fibroids, it is estimated that more \n        than 80 percent of African Americans and about 70 percent of \n        Caucasians develop fibroids by the time they reach menopause \n        and the tumors develop at younger ages in African Americans.\n            (4) Symptomatic uterine fibroids can cause heavy bleeding, \n        pain, and reproductive problems, including infertility. There \n        is no known cause of uterine fibroids.\n            (5) The presence of uterine fibroids is the most common \n        reason for hysterectomies, accounting for approximately one-\n        third of hysterectomies, or 200,000 procedures annually and 22 \n        percent of African American women and 7 percent of Caucasians \n        have hysterectomies for fibroids.\n            (6) Over five billion dollars are spent annually on \n        hysterectomies, at approximately $6,000 for each surgery.\n            (7) The Evidence Report and Summary on the Management of \n        Uterine Fibroids, as compiled by the Agency for Healthcare \n        Research and Quality of the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, held that there is a ``remarkable lack of high \n        quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of most \n        interventions for symptomatic fibroids''.\n            (8) Current research and available data do not provide \n        adequate information on the rates of prevalence and incidents \n        of fibroids in Asian, Hispanic, and other minority women, the \n        costs associated with treating fibroids, and the methods by \n        which fibroids may be prevented in these women.\n\nSEC. 3. RESEARCH WITH RESPECT TO UTERINE FIBROIDS.\n\n    (a) Research.--The Director of the National Institutes of Health \n(in this section referred to as the ``Director of NIH'') shall expand, \nintensify, and coordinate programs for the conduct and support of \nresearch with respect to uterine fibroids.\n    (b) Administration.--The Director of NIH shall carry out this \nsection through the appropriate institutes, offices, and centers of the \nNational Institutes of Health, including the National Institute of \nChild Health and Human Development, the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences, the Office of Research on Women's \nHealth, and the National Center on Minority Health and Health \nDisparities.\n    (c) Coordination of Activities.--The Office of Research on Women's \nHealth shall coordinate activities under subsection (b) among the \ninstitutes, offices, and centers of the National Institutes of Health.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying \nout this section, there are authorized to be appropriated $30,000,000 \nfor each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.\n\nSEC. 4.

Such information shall include the \nelevated risk for minority women to develop uterine fibroids and the \nrange of available options for the treatment of symptomatic uterine \nfibroids.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying \nout this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as \nmay be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.\n\nSEC. 6.
