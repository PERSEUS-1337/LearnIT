FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Great apes are highly intelligent and social animals \n        and research laboratory environments involving invasive \n        research cannot meet their complex social and psychological \n        needs.\n            (2) Invasive research performed on great apes, and the \n        breeding of great apes for these purposes, are economic in \n        nature and substantially affect interstate commerce.\n            (3) The majority of invasive research and testing conducted \n        on great apes in the United States is for the end purpose of \n        developing drugs, pharmaceuticals, and other products to be \n        sold in the interstate market.\n            (4) The total costs associated with great ape research have \n        a direct economic impact on interstate commerce.\n            (5) An overwhelming majority of invasive research \n        procedures performed on great apes involves some element of \n        interstate commerce, such that great apes, equipment, and \n        researchers have traveled across State lines.\n            (6) The regulation of animals and activities as provided in \n        this Act are necessary to effectively regulate interstate and \n        foreign commerce.\n            (7) The National Research Council report entitled \n        ``Chimpanzees in Research--Strategies for their Ethical Care, \n        Management, and Use'' concluded that--\n                    (A) there is a ``moral responsibility'' for the \n                long-term care of chimpanzees used for scientific \n                research;\n                    (B) there should be a moratorium on further \n                chimpanzee breeding;\n                    (C) euthanasia should not be used as a means to \n                control the size of the great ape population; and\n                    (D) sanctuaries should be created to house \n                chimpanzees in a manner consistent with high standards \n                of lifetime care, social enrichment, and cognitive \n                development.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) prohibit invasive research on great apes and the use of \n        Federal funding of such research, both within and outside of \n        the United States;\n            (2) prohibit the transport of great apes for purposes of \n        invasive research;\n            (3) prohibit the breeding of great apes for purposes of \n        invasive research; and\n            (4) require the provision of lifetime care of great apes \n        that are owned by or under the control of the Federal \n        Government in a suitable sanctuary through the permanent \n        retirement of such apes.\n\nSEC. 3.
