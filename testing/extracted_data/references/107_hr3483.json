    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Intergovernmental Law Enforcement \nInformation Sharing Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Governors and mayors are responsible for the protection \n        of their constituents, and State and local agencies are \n        typically the first responders to emergencies. Therefore, State \n        and local officials and agencies must be able to receive \n        information regarding potential threats within their \n        jurisdictions.\n            (2) Most State and local law enforcement authorities \n        currently have mechanisms in place to receive and protect \n        classified information provided by Federal officials. These \n        mechanisms must be supplemented to include elected officials \n        and additional senior law enforcement officials in every State.\n            (3) Expanding the issuance of security clearances, \n        consistent with all applicable Federal standards and \n        investigative requirements, is an important means of improving \n        information sharing among Federal, State, and local officials.\n            (4) There is a need for a comprehensive review of \n        procedures within Federal law enforcement agencies in order to \n        identify and remedy unnecessary barriers to information sharing \n        among Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. SECURITY CLEARANCES AND ENHANCED INFORMATION SHARING.\n\n    Chapter 65 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by adding at \nthe end the following new section:\n``Sec. 6509. Intergovernmental cooperation to enhance the sharing of \n              law enforcement information\n    ``(a) The Attorney General shall expeditiously carry out security \nclearance investigations for the persons identified in subsection (b), \nand shall grant appropriate security clearances to all such persons who \nqualify for clearances under the standards set forth in applicable laws \nand Executive orders.\n    ``(b) The persons referred to in subsection (a) are:\n            ``(1) Every Governor of a State or territory who applies \n        for a security clearance.\n            ``(2) Every chief elected official of a political \n        subdivision of a State or territory with a population exceeding \n        30,000 who applies for a security clearance.\n            ``(3) At least one senior law enforcement official for each \n        State or territory, as designated by the Governor of such State \n        or territory.\n            ``(4) At least one senior law enforcement official for each \n        political subdivision described in paragraph (2), as designated \n        by the chief elected official of such subdivision.\n            ``(5) Law enforcement officers from State, territorial, and \n        local agencies that participate in Federal counter-terrorism \n        working groups, joint or regional terrorism task forces, and \n        other activities involving the combined efforts of Federal and \n        non-Federal law enforcement agencies.\n            ``(6) The chiefs, commissioners, sheriffs, or comparable \n        officials who head each State, territorial, and local agency \n        that participates in a working group, task force, or similar \n        activity described in paragraph (5).\n    ``(c)(1) The Attorney General may charge State, territorial, and \nlocal governments, in whole or in part, for the costs of carrying out \nsecurity clearance investigations and granting security clearances \nunder this section. Such charges may not exceed the amounts charged for \ncarrying out such investigations and granting such clearances for \nFederal employees.\n    ``(2) The Attorney General may waive any charges that would \notherwise apply under paragraph (1) to a State, territorial, or local \ngovernment if such government agrees to promptly provide Federal \nofficials, without charge, access to the criminal databases of such \ngovernment for the purpose of conducting personnel security background \ninvestigations for military, civilian, and contract employees.\n    ``(d) To the maximum extent practicable, the Attorney General shall \nensure that information systems, including databases, are configured to \nallow efficient and effective sharing of information among appropriate \nFederal, State, territorial, and local officials and agencies.''.\n\nSEC. 4. STUDY BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\n\n    (a) Study Required.--The Attorney General shall conduct a study of \nmethods to enhance the sharing of sensitive Federal law enforcement \ninformation with State, territorial, and local law enforcement \nofficials. The study shall review--\n            (1) appropriate safeguards to protect confidential sources \n        and methods;\n            (2) mechanisms for determining the credibility of \n        information relating to potential threats;\n            (3) restrictions on access to Federal databases by State, \n        territorial, and local elected officials and law enforcement \n        personnel; and\n            (4) any other matter that the Attorney General considers \n        appropriate.\n    (b) Participation.--The Attorney General shall ensure that \nofficials from State, territorial, and local law enforcement agencies \nparticipate in the study.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a report \ncontaining the findings and recommendations of the study to the \nCommittee on Government Reform and the Committee on the Judiciary of \nthe House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs \nand the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate.\n\nSEC. 5. DISCLAIMER.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the authority of \nthe head of a Federal agency to classify information or to continue the \nclassification of information previously classified by an agency."
