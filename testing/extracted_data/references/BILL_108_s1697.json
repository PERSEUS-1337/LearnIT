FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) there are at least 34,100,000 Americans who are 65 \n        years of age and older, and persons who are 85 years of age or \n        older comprise almost one-quarter of that population;\n            (2) the Bureau of the Census of the Department of Commerce \n        estimates that, by 2030, the elderly population will double to \n        70,000,000 persons;\n            (3) according to the Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report ``Housing Our Elders--A Report Card on the \n        Housing Conditions and Needs of Older Americans'', the largest \n        and fastest growing segments of the older population include \n        many people who have historically been vulnerable economically \n        and in the housing market--women, minorities, and people over \n        the age of 85;\n            (4) many elderly persons are at significant risk with \n        respect to the availability, stability, and accessibility of \n        affordable housing;\n            (5) one-third of public housing residents are approximately \n        62 years of age or older, making public housing the largest \n        Federal housing program for senior citizens;\n            (6) the elderly population residing in public housing is \n        older, poorer, frailer, and more racially diverse than the \n        elderly population residing in other assisted housing;\n            (7) two-thirds of the public housing developments for the \n        elderly, including those that also serve the disabled, were \n        constructed before 1970 and are in dire need of major \n        rehabilitation and configuration, such as rehabilitation to \n        provide new roofs, energy-efficient heating, cooling, utility \n        systems, accessible units, and up-to-date safety features;\n            (8) many of the dwelling units in public housing \n        developments for elderly and disabled persons are undersized, \n        are inaccessible to residents with physical limitations, do not \n        comply with the requirements under the Americans with \n        Disabilities Act of 1990, or lack railings, grab bars, \n        emergency call buttons, and wheelchair accessible ramps;\n            (9) a study conducted for the Department of Housing and \n        Urban Development found that the cost of the basic \n        modernization needs for public housing for elderly and disabled \n        persons exceeds $5,700,000,000;\n            (10) a growing number of elderly and disabled persons face \n        unnecessary institutionalization because of the absence of \n        appropriate supportive services and assisted living facilities \n        in their residences;\n            (11) for many elderly and disabled persons, independent \n        living in a non-institutionalization setting is a preferable \n        housing alternative to costly institutionalization, and would \n        allow public monies to be more effectively used to provide \n        necessary services for such persons;\n            (12) congregate housing and supportive services coordinated \n        by service coordinators is a proven and cost-effective means of \n        enabling elderly and disabled persons to remain in place with \n        dignity and independence;\n            (13) the effective provision of congregate services and \n        assisted living in public housing developments requires the \n        redesign of units and buildings to accommodate independent \n        living;\n            (14) most of the elderly who reside in public housing are \n        eligible for Medicaid to pay for the cost of their being \n        institutionalized in nursing homes;\n            (15) nursing home costs now exceed 42 percent of the entire \n        Medicaid program; and\n            (16) by providing a nursing home resident the choice of \n        assisted living in public housing instead, the Federal \n        Government can save as much as three-quarters of the long term \n        per capita Medicaid costs and at the same time allow a frail \n        senior to age in place.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish a demonstration program to make \n        competitive grants to provide state-of-the-art, health-\n        supportive housing with assisted living opportunities for \n        elderly and disabled persons;\n            (2) to provide funding to enhance, make safe and \n        accessible, and extend the useful life of public housing \n        developments for the elderly and disabled and to increase their \n        accessibility to supportive services;\n            (3) to provide elderly and disabled public housing \n        residents a readily available choice in living arrangements by \n        utilizing the services of service coordinators and providing a \n        continuum of care that allows such residents to age in place;\n            (4) to incorporate congregate housing service programs more \n        fully into public housing operations; and\n            (5) to accomplish such purposes and provide such funding \n        under existing provisions of law that currently authorize all \n        activities to be conducted under the program.\n\nSEC. 3.
