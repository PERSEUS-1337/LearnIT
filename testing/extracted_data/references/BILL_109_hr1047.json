FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Construction of the Pentagon was completed in the midst \n        of World War II on January 15, 1943.\n            (2) September 11, 2001, marks a tragic day in the history \n        of the United States and the Pentagon Building located in \n        Arlington, Virginia.\n            (3) 184 individuals ages 3 to 71 lost their lives through \n        the horrific event that unfolded at the Pentagon on September \n        11, 2001.\n            (4) An appropriate memorial reminding us of the brave men, \n        women, and children who perished has been designed and is to be \n        built on 1.93 acres located on the western side of the Pentagon \n        Building.\n            (5) The target completion date for the construction of the \n        Pentagon Memorial park is late fall 2006.\n            (6) Almost $30,000,000 will need to be raised from the \n        private sector in order to begin construction of the memorial \n        and to maintain it upon completion.\n            (7) The surcharge proceeds from the sale of a commemorative \n        coin, which would have no net cost to the taxpayers, would \n        raise valuable funding for the construction and maintenance of \n        the Pentagon Memorial in remembrance of those who lost their \n        lives at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.\n\nSEC. 3.
