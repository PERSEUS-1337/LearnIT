AUTHORITY TO COMPLETE THIRD PHASE OF UMATILLA BASIN PROJECT.\n\n    The Umatilla Basin Project Act (102 Stat. 2791) is amended by \nadding at the end the following new sections:\n\n``SEC. 215. UMATILLA BASIN PROJECT PHASE III EXCHANGE.\n\n    ``(a) Authorization of Project Construction.--(1) Effective upon \nthe boundary adjustments under section 216(a), the Secretary is \nauthorized to construct a third and final phase of the Umatilla Basin \nProject to provide additional flows in the Umatilla River for \nanadromous fish through a water exchange with Westland Irrigation \nDistrict.\n    ``(2) Prior to construction, the Secretary shall complete a \nfeasibility study to identify alternatives to provide Westland \nIrrigation District and other Umatilla River Basin water users with \nexchange flows of approximately 220 cubic feet per second to restore \nthe Umatilla River fishery, as determined through analysis in a \nfeasibility study under paragraph (3).\n    ``(3)(A) The feasibility study for the Phase III exchange \nfacilities shall examine engineering, environmental, and economic \nfactors associated with project alternatives, including but not limited \nto: technical engineering and hydrologic analyses pertinent to the \nidentification and design of alternatives; biological analyses of \ninstream flow levels to optimize anadromous fish restoration; and \nassessment of the best biological value per unit expenditure among the \nalternatives.\n    ``(B) The feasibility study shall also include an analysis of \ninclusion of other irrigators in the exchange; consolidation of \nirrigation delivery facilities; potential for voluntary water \ntransfers; optimization of water delivery scheduling for all four \nirrigation districts; appropriate backup systems; water conservation \nopportunities; and such other analyses as the Secretary may consider \nappropriate to improve the exchange project for fishery restoration \npurposes.\n    ``(4) Prior to completion of Phase III facilities, the Secretary \nshall negotiate and execute an exchange agreement with the Westland \nIrrigation District to allow the use of Columbia River water in \nexchange for an equivalent amount of Umatilla River or McKay Reservoir \nwater. Additional exchange agreements with other water users may be \nexecuted either before or after the completion of Phase III. The \nexchange agreement shall incorporate water delivery scheduling \noptimization, conservation, water transfer, and other technical \noperational measures recommended in the feasibility study.\n    ``(b) Operation and Maintenance Costs.--All exchange system \noperation and maintenance costs and any increased operation and \nmaintenance costs to the project caused by the Phase III exchange shall \nbe the responsibility of the Federal Government and shall be \nnonreimbursable.\n    ``(c) Power for Project Pumping.--The Administrator of the \nBonneville Power Administration (hereinafter in this subsection \nreferred to as the `Administrator'), consistent with provisions of the \nColumbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program established pursuant to \nthe Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (94 \nStat. 2697), shall provide for project power needed to effect the Phase \nIII water exchange for purposes of mitigating anadromous fishery \nimpacts.
