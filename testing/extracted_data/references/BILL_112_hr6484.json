FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) For over 60 years, the Bureau of Reclamation has used \n        the channels and sloughs of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to \n        facilitate the delivery of water to the Federal Central Valley \n        Project pumps located in the southern edge of the Delta.\n            (2) The movement of water through these waterways has \n        created stress, degradation, and weakening of the levees that \n        are intended to protect adjacent land from flooding.\n            (3) On July 25, 2012, the Secretary of the Interior \n        announced details of Federal support for a proposed water \n        project entitled the Bay Delta Conservation Plan, which calls \n        for a dual conveyance system that would transport water around \n        the Delta using an isolated conveyance facility, while also \n        continuing to move water through the Delta's interior.\n            (4) Under the Bay Delta Conservation Plan, the Bureau of \n        Reclamation will continue to rely on the Delta and its levees \n        to facilitate water deliveries to exporters until and after an \n        isolated conveyance facility is built.\n            (5) Despite the Bureau of Reclamation's vested stake in the \n        stability of these levees, the Department of the Interior has \n        failed to address levee stability in the Bay Delta Conservation \n        Plan or through any other rudimentary maintenance measures.\n            (6) To ensure that Central Valley Project water deliveries \n        are not disrupted due to levee failure, the Bureau of \n        Reclamation should provide financial assistance to public levee \n        owners for maintenance and levee improvements.\n\nSEC. 3. SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN DELTA LEVEE STABILITY IMPROVEMENTS \n              RELATED TO BUREAU OF RECLAMATION CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT \n              WATER DELIVERIES.\n\n    Section 103 of the Calfed Bay-Delta Authorization Act (title I of \nPublic Law 108-361; 118 Stat. 1683) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (e)(2), by striking ``paragraphs (1), \n        (2), and (4) of subsection (f)'' and inserting ``paragraphs \n        (1), (2), (4), and (5) of subsection (f)''; and\n            (2) in subsection (f), by adding at the end the following \n        new paragraph:\n            ``(5) Delta levee stability maintenance and improvements \n        related to bureau of reclamation central valley project water \n        deliveries.--\n                    ``(A) Program required.--The Secretary shall \n                establish a program to provide assistance to non-\n                Federal interests for stability maintenance and \n                improvement on levees within the Sacramento-San Joaquin \n                Delta (as defined in Cal. Water Code Sec. 12220) that \n                facilitate Bureau of Reclamation water deliveries to \n                Central Valley Project contractors. The Secretary shall \n                prioritize the projects for which assistance will be \n                provided under this paragraph based on the extent to \n                which the levees covered by the projects are necessary \n                for Bureau of Reclamation water deliveries.\n                    ``(B) Form of assistance.--Assistance provided \n                under this paragraph may be in the form of financial \n                assistance for water-supply reliability related levee \n                maintenance and improvements within the Delta.\n                    ``(C) Limitations; continued liability.--The \n                Secretary may provide assistance for a levee stability \n                maintenance and improvement project under this \n                paragraph only if the levee directly facilitates \n                deliveries of water for the Central Valley Project and \n                is publically owned. The provision of Federal \n                assistance shall not be construed to change liability \n                associated with the levee.\n                    ``(D) Federal share.--The Federal share of the cost \n                of a levee stability maintenance and improvement \n                project under this paragraph may not exceed 50 percent \n                of the total project costs. The assistance may be \n                provided in the form of grants or reimbursements of \n                project costs.\n                    ``(E) Implementation costs.--Costs associated with \n                implementation of the program under this paragraph may \n                be considered a reimbursable Federal expenditure \n                allocable to Central Valley Project subunits south of \n                the Delta that receive and benefit from water conveyed \n                through the Delta.
