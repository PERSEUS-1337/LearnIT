    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as ``Post-Conflict Trade Recovery Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n        countries emerging from political instability, civil strife, or \n        armed conflict, to promote stable and sustainable growth and \n        development of such countries;\n            (2) democratization and economic progress in countries \n        emerging from political instability, civil strife, or armed \n        conflict are important elements of a policy to address \n        terrorism and endemic instability;\n            (3) preferential trade and market access arrangements are \n        not a substitute for, but a complement to, necessary political \n        and economic reforms that lead to political liberalization and \n        economic freedom;\n            (4) countries in the developing world, and in particular \n        countries emerging from political instability, civil strife, or \n        armed conflict, experience deepening poverty, slow job \n        creation, and a declining share of world trade and investment, \n        while at the same time tend to have population growth rates \n        among the highest in the world;\n            (5) such economic conditions are in part the result of \n        barriers to trade and investment, a failure to engage fully in \n        the global trading system, lack of participation in the World \n        Trade Organization, and, often, a lack of economic \n        diversification and over-reliance on the energy sector;\n            (6) offering enhanced trade preferences to countries \n        emerging from political instability, civil strife, or armed \n        conflict will encourage higher levels of trade and direct \n        investment and help bring such countries more fully into the \n        global trading system;\n            (7) higher levels of trade and investment and greater \n        involvement in the global trading system can lead to increased \n        economic development, which can in turn lead to more jobs for \n        people in countries emerging from political instability, civil \n        strife, or armed conflict; and\n            (8) encouraging the reduction of trade and investment \n        barriers will enhance the benefits of trade and investment for \n        all participating countries, as well as enhance commercial and \n        political ties between the United States and such participating \n        countries.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress supports--\n            (1) encouraging increased trade and investment between the \n        United States and countries emerging from political \n        instability, civil strife, or armed conflict;\n            (2) reducing tariff and nontariff barriers and other \n        obstacles to trade between the United States and countries \n        emerging from political instability, civil strife, or armed \n        conflict;\n            (3) strengthening and expanding the private sector and \n        accelerating the rate of job creation in countries emerging \n        from political instability, civil strife, or armed conflict;\n            (4) promoting the rule of law, economic reform, political \n        liberalization, respect for human rights, and the eradication \n        of poverty in such countries;\n            (5) facilitating the development of civil societies and \n        political freedom in such countries;\n            (6) promoting sustainable development, and protecting and \n        preserving the environment in a manner consistent with economic \n        development; and\n            (7) encouraging such countries to diversify their \n        economies, implement domestic economic reforms, open to trade, \n        and adopt anticorruption measures, including through accession \n        to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \n        (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public \n        Officials in International Business Transactions.\n\nSEC. 4.
