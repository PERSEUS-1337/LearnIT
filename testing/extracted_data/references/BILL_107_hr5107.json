FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) senior citizens in the United States have significant \n        out-of-pocket costs for medical expenses, especially for \n        prescription drugs;\n            (2) 3 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries do not have dependable, \n        affordable, prescription drug coverage;\n            (3) as medical costs continue to rise, many senior citizens \n        are forced to make the difficult choice between purchasing \n        prescription drugs and purchasing food;\n            (4) the commodity supplemental food program provides \n        supplemental nutritious foods to senior citizens in a number of \n        States and localities;\n            (5) under the commodity supplemental food program--\n                    (A) women, infants, and children with household \n                incomes up to 185 percent of the Federal Poverty Income \n                Guidelines published annually by the Department of \n                Health and Human Services may be eligible for \n                supplemental foods; but\n                    (B) senior citizens are ineligible for supplemental \n                foods if their household incomes are greater than 130 \n                percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines;\n            (6) during fiscal year 2000--\n                    (A) an average of more than 388,000 people each \n                month participated in the commodity supplemental food \n                program; and\n                    (B) the majority of those participants, 293,000, \n                were senior citizens; and\n            (7) in order to serve the neediest senior citizens, taking \n        into account their high out-of-pocket medical (including \n        prescription drug) expenses, the eligibility requirements for \n        the commodity supplemental food program should be modified to \n        make more senior citizens eligible for the supplemental foods \n        provided under the program.\n\nSEC. 3.
