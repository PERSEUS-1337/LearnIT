FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) national studies indicate that Indian women experience \n        domestic and sexual assaults at a far greater rate than other \n        groups of women in the national population;\n            (2) there is relatively little data on the rate of domestic \n        violence perpetrated upon Indian women in Indian country or the \n        costs associated with responding to acts of domestic violence \n        in Indian country;\n            (3) Indian tribes have criminal jurisdiction to prosecute \n        Indians who commit violations of tribal law;\n            (4) the Federal Government has jurisdiction to prosecute \n        specific enumerated crimes that arise in Indian country under \n        section 1153 of title 18, United States Code (commonly known as \n        the Major Crimes Act);\n            (5) the Major Crimes Act does not include provisions to \n        provide Federal prosecutors the ability to prosecute domestic \n        violence assaults unless they rise to the level of serious \n        bodily injury or death;\n            (6) national studies conducted by law enforcement \n        organizations show that domestic violence disturbance calls are \n        the most dangerous situations and pose the highest risk to \n        responding law enforcement officers;\n            (7) the limited arrest authority of the Bureau of Indian \n        Affairs and Indian tribal law enforcement agencies impacts the \n        ability of law enforcement to properly respond to acts of \n        domestic violence; and\n            (8) Federal and tribal prosecutors and law enforcement \n        services are hampered in their efforts to address domestic \n        violence by the lack of available criminal history information \n        for tribal ordinance offenders.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To obtain data on the rates of domestic violence \n        perpetrated upon Indian women in Indian country.\n            (2) To close existing gaps in Federal criminal laws to \n        enable Federal, State, and tribal law enforcement, prosecution \n        agencies, and courts to address incidents of domestic violence.\n            (3) To address the public safety concerns experienced by \n        tribal police officers that arise in responding to incidents of \n        domestic violence.\n            (4) To prevent the serious injury or death of Indian women \n        subject to domestic violence.\n\nSEC. 4.
