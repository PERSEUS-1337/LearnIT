FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Small communities are vital components of the nation's \n        economic, social, agricultural, historic, and cultural fabric.\n            (2) Our national character has been shaped by and is \n        forever tied to the landscape in and surrounding small \n        communities.\n            (3) A growing number of small communities are facing \n        significant challenges that place their long-term viability at \n        risk, including economic hardship, declining population, \n        eroding tax bases, and environmental pressures.\n            (4) Revitalizing and strengthening small communities begins \n        by helping residents of those communities to articulate and \n        formalize their vision for the future and to develop an action \n        plan to achieve that vision, including in the areas of economic \n        development, agriculture, tourism, transportation, land use, \n        education, recreation, and culture, and by understanding the \n        amenity characteristics of landscapes.\n            (5) In many cases, a community's vision for the future is \n        rooted in and inseparable from the landscape, including the \n        natural and built environments.\n            (6) Landscape architects have the education, training, and \n        skills, including in the areas of community involvement and \n        public participation, land use planning, design, project \n        visualization techniques, scenic resource assessment, mapping \n        and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), environmental \n        analysis, and environmental psychology, that ideally qualify \n        them to lead community visioning efforts.\n            (7) Expanding Federal support for small community visioning \n        is an investment in the future of small communities and will \n        leverage additional public and private sector participation in \n        such efforts.\n            (8) Successful community visioning efforts have yielded \n        tangible results with regard to the enhancement of \n        transportation corridors, economic development initiatives, \n        land use policies, conservation of natural and community \n        resources, community master plans, and park and recreation \n        plans.\n\nSEC. 3. COMMUNITY VISIONING PILOT INITIATIVE.\n\n    (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--\n            (1) develop and facilitate innovative visions that help \n        small communities to address pressing local needs;\n            (2) facilitate coordination between small communities, \n        land-grant and other universities, and design professionals;\n            (3) encourage public-private partnerships; and\n            (4) translate the small community's vision into images of \n        design projects that integrate physical planning and design \n        techniques, with sustainable community action, at the \n        appropriate geographic scale.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) The term ``small community visioning process'' means \n        the process described in subsection (c)(2).\n            (2) The term ``small community'' means a political \n        subdivision of a State with a population less than 25,000 \n        individuals, an Indian tribe (as defined by section 2(7) of the \n        Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act), a \n        native Hawaiian organization (as defined by paragraph (11) of \n        such section), or an Alaskan native village (as defined by \n        section 3(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act).\n            (3) The term ``design professional'' means a landscape \n        architect licensed pursuant to State law or other individual \n        with demonstrated skills, training, and education in community \n        involvement and public participation, land use planning, \n        design, project visualization techniques, scenic resource \n        management, mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), \n        environmental analysis, and environmental psychology.\n            (4) The term ``eligible grant recipient'' means a small \n        community, a land grant university or college established \n        pursuant to the Morrill Act, an institution of higher education \n        (as defined in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of \n        1965), or an economic or community development entity \n        authorized by a State or political subdivision of a State.\n            (5) The term ``construction documents'' means technical \n        documents, drawings, and designs which contain dimensions, \n        measurements, material specifications, and other technical \n        information necessary to complete design plans.\n            (6) The term ``Department'' means the Department of \n        Agriculture.\n            (7) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture.\n    (c) Grant Authority.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall make grants to \n        eligible grant recipients for the purposes of carrying out \n        small community visioning processes.\n            (2) Small community visioning process.--In order to be \n        eligible for a grant under this section, the applicant must use \n        a small community visioning process that includes the \n        following:\n                    (A) Soliciting and organizing public \n                participation.--The broadest segment of the public is \n                invited to participate, and the process is structured \n                to maximize participation and maintain efficiency.\n                    (B) Needs determination.--The small community \n                determines whether the community requires assistance \n                through this process with a broad-based needs \n                assessment or whether it has identified a specific need \n                through a prior community-based process that the \n                community wants to address through the small community \n                visioning process. Needs may include the areas of \n                economic development, transportation, land use, \n                agriculture, and the natural, cultural, and aesthetic \n                values of the community.\n                    (C) Developing design options.--Members of the \n                community engage in a series of discussions to \n                articulate their vision for addressing the identified \n                need. Design professionals facilitate the discussions, \n                help members of the community identify areas of \n                consensus, and begin translating the vision into \n                images, including sketches, maps, digital images, \n                computer simulations, and design concepts. The vision \n                and design options are refined in an ongoing dialogue \n                until community consensus is reached and physical \n                designs for 1 or more projects are finalized.\n                    (D) Implementation planning.--Design professionals, \n                members of the public, and others develop and finalize \n                a plan that describes the specific steps the community \n                would take to achieve its vision. At a minimum, the \n                plan should identify--\n                            (i) projects relating to that vision, \n                        including projects the community can undertake \n                        and complete with existing resources, \n                        personnel, and funding, and projects which the \n                        community could undertake and complete only \n                        with the infusion of additional resources, \n                        personnel, and funding;\n                            (ii) government agencies, nongovernmental \n                        entities, and other potential partners that \n                        could participate in implementation; and\n                            (iii) possible sources of public and \n                        private funding to achieve the vision.\n    (d) Application Processes.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the Secretary \n        issues final regulations under subsection (h), the Secretary \n        shall solicit applications for grants from eligible grant \n        recipients.
