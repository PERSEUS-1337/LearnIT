FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Government appropriately requires States \n        that accept funds under the Individuals with Disabilities \n        Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) to make available a free \n        appropriate public education to all children with disabilities.\n            (2) While Congress committed to contribute up to 40 percent \n        of the national average per pupil expenditure to assist States \n        and local educational agencies with the excess costs of \n        educating children with disabilities, the Federal Government \n        has never contributed more than 14.9 percent of the national \n        average per pupil expenditure under the Individuals with \n        Disabilities Education Act.\n            (3) If Congress fully funded the Federal Government's \n        obligation under the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n        Act, States and local educational agencies would have \n        significantly greater resources to reduce class size, improve \n        school facilities, provide local tax relief, and otherwise \n        redirect resources to areas based on local need.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide by fiscal year \n2005 40 percent of the national current average per pupil expenditure \nto assist States and local educational agencies with the excess costs \nof educating children with disabilities under part B of the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.)\n\nSEC. 3.
