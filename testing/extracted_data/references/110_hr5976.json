FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1808, Albert Gallatin, while serving as President \n        Thomas Jefferson's Secretary of the Treasury, reported to \n        Congress on the infrastructure investments needed by the young \n        Nation.\n            (2) Gallatin's plan built on President George Washington's \n        vision of connecting the interior settlements of the Nation \n        with the markets and ports of the East Coast through a network \n        of roads and canals, and provided a roadmap for infrastructure \n        development in the 19th century.\n            (3) In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt convened a \n        conference of State and territorial governors, members of his \n        Cabinet and Congress, professional organizations, private \n        citizens, and government agencies to plan for the United States \n        conservation and infrastructure needs in the 20th century.\n            (4) The resulting plan laid the groundwork for many of the \n        critical investments initiated by President Franklin D. \n        Roosevelt to jumpstart the Nation's recovery from the Great \n        Depression.\n            (5) Today, as in 1808 and 1908, the United States is faced \n        with significant economic, environmental, and demographic \n        challenges.\n            (6) To stave off the worst effects of global warming, the \n        United States will need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \n        significantly.\n            (7) The Nation's population is projected to increase to 420 \n        million by 2050, which is nearly a 50 percent increase from the \n        Nation's population size in 2000.\n            (8) By 2050, more than 70 percent of the Nation's \n        population growth and economic growth is expected to take place \n        in extended networks of metropolitan regions linked by \n        environmental systems, transportation networks, economies, and \n        culture.\n            (9) The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue \n        Study Commission recently calculated that maintaining the \n        Nation's existing transportation system over the next 50 years \n        will require $225 billion annually. The latest transportation \n        authorization, SAFETEA-LU, provided only $244 billion total for \n        the 5 years ending with fiscal year 2009.\n            (10) The American Society of Civil Engineers has given the \n        Nation's public infrastructure, consisting of water, sewer, and \n        transportation systems, a grade of D-minus, estimating that it \n        will cost $1.6 trillion over the next 5 years merely to repair \n        the Nation's existing infrastructure.\n            (11) The Nation's decaying water infrastructure and a lack \n        of available funding to maintain and upgrade the Nation's \n        wastewater infrastructure pose a serious threat to water \n        quality. More than 72,000 miles of municipal water and sewer \n        pipe are more than 80 years old, threatening the health, \n        environment, and economy of communities large and small.\n            (12) Population growth and associated development will \n        place the Nation's water resources under increasing stress, \n        including increased pollutant loads, increased potential for \n        flooding, diminished drinking water supplies, loss of aquatic \n        habitat, and stream scouring and erosion. Global warming will \n        exacerbate existing water challenges and make other changes to \n        the natural hydrology, including more extreme storm events, \n        more frequent droughts, higher air and water temperatures, \n        changes in timing of stream flows, and sea level rise. New \n        technologies and a comprehensive strategy will be needed to \n        overcome these challenges and ensure a safe, adequate, \n        reliable, and sustainable water supply.\n            (13) The Environmental Protection Agency, the Congressional \n        Budget Office, and other stakeholders have identified a funding \n        gap of between $300 billion and $400 billion over the next 20 \n        years for the restoration and replacement of wastewater \n        infrastructure, and an additional $250 billion over the next 30 \n        years will be needed to replace worn-out drinking water pipes \n        and associated structures.\n            (14) From 1999 to 2009, the Nation's electricity demand \n        rose by nearly 20 percent while transmission capacity grew by \n        only 3.5 percent. To accommodate increased demand, and to \n        accommodate increased electrical supply from renewable sources \n        by 2050, electrical transmission infrastructure requires \n        significant investment.\n            (15) The Nation's rural economy is dependant on \n        transportation and communications networks to grow and compete \n        in an increasingly globalized market.\n            (16) Significant under-investment in public lands \n        infrastructure jeopardizes the tremendous conservation, \n        environmental, and mixed use benefits that these lands provide \n        the public.\n            (17) Much of the Nation's infrastructure was built in the \n        last half of the 20th century and will reach its capacity \n        limits early in the 21st century. Unless new capacity is \n        created in roads, rails, airports, seaports, and other systems, \n        the Nation's economic potential will be artificially limited.\n            (18) Since 1980, the number of miles people in the United \n        States drive has grown 3 times faster than the Nation's \n        population. Residents of walkable cities, however, drive 26 \n        percent fewer miles per day than those living in the most \n        sprawling areas.\n            (19) By 2050, 89 million new or replaced homes as well as \n        190 billion square feet of new offices, stores, and other \n        nonresidential buildings will be constructed.\n            (20) By 2050, smart growth building policies could reduce \n        total transportation-related CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; emissions by 7 to \n        10 percent.\n            (21) Development of a bold national plan to overcome these \n        challenges by 2050 will allow the United States to respond in \n        the most economically and environmentally sustainable way.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``United \nStates Commission on Rebuilding America for the 21st Century'' (in this \nAct referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.
