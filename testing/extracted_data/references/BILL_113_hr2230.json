FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Department of Defense, 3,374 sexual \n        assault cases involving a member of the Armed Forces were \n        reported in fiscal year 2012, a 6 percent increase in the \n        number of reported cases in fiscal year 2011.\n            (2) However, approximately 26,000 members of the Armed \n        Forces made an anonymous report of a sexual assault in fiscal \n        year 2012, a substantial increase from fiscal year 2011.\n            (3) According to the Department of Defense, of the 6.1 \n        percent of female members of the Armed Forces who experienced \n        ``unwanted sexual contact'' in fiscal year 2012, 77 percent \n        also experienced sexual harassment and, of the 1.2 percent of \n        male members of the Armed Forces who experienced ``unwanted \n        sexual contact'' in fiscal year 2012, 52 percent also \n        experienced sexual harassment.\n            (4) Sixty-two percent of those members who experienced \n        unwanted sexual contact also perceived some form of social, \n        administrative, or professional retaliation.\n            (5) Climate assessments are required by law and commanders \n        at all levels must comply as it is their core responsibility to \n        create a safe and healthy environment for the unit.\n            (6) Trends in bad behavior and reoccurring actions that \n        harm the members of the unit, such as sexual harassment and \n        sexual assault, must be identified earlier through improved \n        performance assessments and better reporting by commanders at \n        all levels.\n            (7) According to a recent Government Accountability Office \n        report, two of the primary reasons why members decide not to \n        report sexual harassment and sexual assault incidents are \n        because they do not think anything will be done about the \n        incident if they report it and they think that reporting the \n        incident will adversely impact their military career.\n            (8) As long as commanders at any level continue to condone \n        or ignore certain types of sexual misconduct, this behavior \n        will continue to be prevalent in the military obstructing the \n        change in culture.\n\nSEC. 3.
