If \n        either committee chair fails to introduce the bill within the \n        30-day period, the ranking minority party member of the \n        respective committee may instead introduce a bill that will \n        qualify for the expedited procedure provided in this section.\n            (3) Qualified bill.--\n                    (A) In general.--In order to qualify as a qualified \n                bill--\n                            (i) the title of the bill shall be ``To \n                        reform the system of the United States and to \n                        provide insurance coverage for all \n                        Americans.''; and\n                            (ii) the bill shall reach the goal of \n                        providing health care coverage to 95 percent of \n                        Americans within 10 years.\n                    (B) Determination.--Whether or not a bill meets the \n                criteria in subparagraph (A) shall be determined by the \n                Chair of the Senate Budget Committee, relying on \n                estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, subject \n                to the final approval of the Senate.\n    (b) Referral.--\n            (1) Committee bills.--Upon introduction, the bill authored \n        by the Chair of the Senate Committee on Finance shall be \n        referred to that Committee and the bill introduced by the Chair \n        of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n        Pensions shall be referred to that committee. If either \n        committee has not reported the bill referred to it (or another \n        qualified bill) by the end of a 60 calendar-day period \n        beginning on the date of referral, the committee is, as of that \n        date, automatically discharged from further consideration of \n        the bill, and the bill is placed directly on the chamber's \n        legislative calendar. In calculating the 60-day period, \n        adjournments for more than 3 days are not counted.\n            (2) Leader bills.--The bills introduced by the Senate \n        Majority Leader and the Senate Minority Leader shall, on \n        introduction, be placed directly on the Senate Calendar of \n        Business.\n    (c) Motion To Proceed.--\n            (1) In general.--On or after the third day following the \n        committee report or discharge or upon a bill being placed on \n        the calendar under subsection (b)(2), it shall be in order for \n        any Member, after consultation with the Majority Leader, to \n        move to proceed to the consideration of any qualified bill. \n        Notice shall first be given before proceeding. This motion to \n        proceed to the consideration of a bill can be offered by a \n        Member only on the day after the calendar day on which the \n        Member announces his or her intention to offer it.\n            (2) Consideration.--The motion to proceed to a given \n        qualified bill can be made even if a motion to the same effect \n        has previously been rejected.

The \n        motion is not debatable, is not amendable, and is not subject \n        to a motion to postpone.\n            (4) No other business or reconsideration.--The motion is \n        not subject to a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n        other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the \n        motion to proceed is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n    (d) Consideration of Qualified Bill.--\n            (1) In general.--If the motion to proceed is adopted, the \n        chamber shall immediately proceed to the consideration of a \n        qualified bill without intervening motion, order, or other \n        business, and the bill remains the unfinished business of the \n        Senate until disposed of. A motion to limit debate is in order \n        and is not debatable.\n            (2) Only business.--The qualified bill is not subject to a \n        motion to postpone or a motion to proceed to the consideration \n        of other business before the bill is disposed of.\n            (3) Relevant amendments.--Only relevant amendments may be \n        offered to the bill.\n\nSEC. 3.
