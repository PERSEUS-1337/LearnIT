FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The evidence for human-induced climate change is \n        overwhelming and undeniable.\n            (2) Atmospheric carbon can be significantly reduced through \n        conservation, by shifting to renewable energy sources such as \n        solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal, and by increasing the \n        efficiency of buildings, including domiciles, and \n        transportation.\n            (3) Providing clear information about climate change, in a \n        variety of forms, can remove the fear and the sense of \n        helplessness, and encourage individuals and communities to take \n        action.\n            (4) Implementation of measures that promote energy \n        efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy will greatly \n        reduce human impact on the environment.\n            (5) Informing people of new technologies and programs as \n        they become available will ensure maximum understanding and \n        maximum effect of those measures.\n            (6) More than 3,000,000 students graduate from high schools \n        and colleges each year, armed with attitudes, skills, and \n        knowledge about the climate that inform their actions.\n            (7) The effect on the climate, positive or negative, of \n        each of those 3,000,000 students lasts beyond a lifetime.\n            (8) Those students need to be prepared to implement changes \n        in professional and personal practices, to support and help \n        develop new technology and policy, and to address the coming \n        social and economic challenges and opportunities arising from a \n        changing climate.\n            (9) It has been demonstrated that the people of the United \n        States overwhelmingly support teaching students about the \n        causes, consequences, and potential solutions to climate change \n        in all 50 States and more than 3,000 counties across the United \n        States.\n            (10) Only 30 percent of middle school and 45 percent of \n        high school science teachers understand the extent of the \n        scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nSEC. 3.
