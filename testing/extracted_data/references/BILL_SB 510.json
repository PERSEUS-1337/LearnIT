As used in this section, a motor vehicle speed contest includes a motor vehicle race against another vehicle, a clock, or other timing device. For purposes of this section, an event in which the time to cover a prescribed route of more than 20 miles is measured, but the vehicle does not exceed the speed limits, is not a speed contest.\n(b) A person shall not aid or abet in any motor vehicle speed contest on any highway.\n(c) A person shall not engage in a motor vehicle exhibition of speed on a highway, and a person shall not aid or abet in a motor vehicle exhibition of speed on any highway.\n(d) A person shall not, for the purpose of facilitating or aiding or as an incident to any motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition upon a highway, in any manner obstruct or place a barricade or obstruction or assist or participate in placing a barricade or obstruction upon any highway.\n(e) (1) A person convicted of a violation of subdivision (a) shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not less than 24 hours nor more than 90 days or by a fine of not less than three hundred fifty-five dollars ($355) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment. That person shall also be required to perform 40 hours of community service.

The person\u2019s privilege to operate a motor vehicle may be restricted for 90 days to six months to necessary travel to and from that person\u2019s place of employment and, if driving a motor vehicle is necessary to perform the duties of the person\u2019s employment, restricted to driving in that person\u2019s scope of employment. This subdivision does not interfere with the court\u2019s power to grant probation in a suitable case.\n(2) If a person is convicted of a violation of subdivision (a) and that violation proximately causes bodily injury to a person other than the driver, the person convicted shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not less than 30 days nor more than six months or by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment.\n(f) (1) If a person is convicted of a violation of subdivision (a) for an offense that occurred within five years of the date of a prior offense that resulted in a conviction of a violation of subdivision (a), that person shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not less than four days nor more than six months, and by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).\n(2) If the perpetration of the most recent offense within the five-year period described in paragraph (1) proximately causes bodily injury to a person other than the driver, a person convicted of that second violation shall be imprisoned in a county jail for not less than 30 days nor more than six months and by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).\n(3) If the perpetration of the most recent offense within the five-year period described in paragraph (1) proximately causes serious bodily injury, as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (f) of Section 243 of the Penal Code, to a person other than the driver, a person convicted of that second violation shall be imprisoned in the state prison, or in a county jail for not less than 30 days nor more than one year, and by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).\n(4) The court shall order the privilege to operate a motor vehicle of a person convicted under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) suspended for a period of six months, as provided in paragraph (9) of subdivision (a) of Section 13352. In lieu of the suspension, the person\u2019s privilege to operate a motor vehicle may be restricted for six months to necessary travel to and from that person\u2019s place of employment and, if driving a motor vehicle is necessary to perform the duties of the person\u2019s employment, restricted to driving in that person\u2019s scope of employment.\n(5) This subdivision does not interfere with the court\u2019s power to grant probation in a suitable case.\n(g) If the court grants probation to a person subject to punishment under subdivision (f), in addition to subdivision (f) and any other terms and conditions imposed by the court, which may include a fine, the court shall impose as a condition of probation that the person be confined in a county jail for not less than 48 hours nor more than six months.

Upon correction, the violation issued pursuant to 40303.5 shall be dismissed pursuant to Section 40522.\n(3) A vehicle seized and impounded pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be released to the legal owner of the vehicle, or the legal owner\u2019s agent, on or before the 30th day of impoundment if all of the following conditions are met:\n(A) The legal owner is a motor vehicle dealer, bank, credit union, acceptance corporation, or other licensed financial institution legally operating in this state, or is another person, not the registered owner, holding a security interest in the vehicle.\n(B) The legal owner or the legal owner\u2019s agent pays all towing and storage fees related to the impoundment of the vehicle.
