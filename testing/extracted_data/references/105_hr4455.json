FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Thousands of computer systems, software programs, and \n        semiconductors are not capable of recognizing certain dates in \n        1999 and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the \n        Year 2000 and thereafter as if they represent the year 1900 or \n        thereafter or will fail to process such dates. This problem and \n        resulting system failures could incapacitate systems that are \n        essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, consumer \n        products, utilities, government, and safety systems in the \n        United States and throughout the world. Reprogramming or \n        replacing affected systems before this problem incapacitates \n        essential systems is a matter of national and global interest.\n            (2) The prompt, candid, and thorough disclosure and \n        exchange of information related to Year 2000 readiness of \n        entities, products, and services would greatly enhance the \n        ability of public and private entities to improve their Year \n        2000 readiness and, thus, is a matter of national importance \n        and a vital factor in minimizing disruption to the nation's \n        economic well-being and security.\n            (3) Concern about the potential for legal liability \n        associated with the disclosure and exchange of Year 2000 \n        compliance information is impeding the disclosure and exchange \n        of such information.\n            (4) The capability to freely disseminate and exchange \n        information relating to Year 2000 readiness with the public and \n        with other companies without undue concern about litigation is \n        critical to the ability of public and private entities to \n        address Year 2000 needs in a timely manner.\n            (5) The national interest will be served by uniform legal \n        standards in connection with the disclosure and exchange of \n        Year 2000 readiness information that will promote disclosures \n        and exchanges of such information in a timely fashion.\n    (b) Purposes.--Based upon the powers contained in article I, \nsection 8, clause 3 of the United States Constitution, the purposes of \nthis Act are to promote the free disclosure and exchange of information \nrelated to Year 2000 readiness and to lessen burdens on interstate \ncommerce by establishing certain uniform legal principles in connection \nwith the disclosure and exchange of information related to Year 2000 \nreadiness.\n\n SEC. 3.
