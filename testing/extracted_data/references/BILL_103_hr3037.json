Factors to be considered in determining whether a sentence \n              of death is justified\n    ``(a) Mitigating Factors.--In determining whether a sentence of \ndeath is justified for any offense, the jury, or if there is no jury, \nthe court, shall consider each of the following mitigating factors and \ndetermine which, if any, exist:\n            ``(1) Mental capacity.--The defendant's mental capacity was \n        significantly impaired, although the impairment was not such as \n        to constitute a defense to prosecution.\n            ``(2) Duress.--The defendant was under unusual and \n        substantial duress, although not such duress as would \n        constitute a defense to prosecution.\n            ``(3) Participation in offense minor.--The defendant was an \n        accomplice whose participation in the offense was relatively \n        minor.\nThe jury, or if there is no jury, the court, shall consider whether any \nother mitigating factor exists.\n    ``(b) Aggravating Factors.--In determining whether a sentence of \ndeath is justified the jury, or if there is no jury, the court, shall \nconsider each of the following aggravating factors and determine which, \nif any, exist:\n            ``(1) Previous conviction of offense for which a sentence \n        of death or life imprisonment was authorized.--The defendant \n        has previously been convicted of another Federal or State \n        offense resulting in the death of a person, for which a \n        sentence of life imprisonment or death was authorized by \n        statute.\n            ``(2) Previous conviction of other serious offenses.--The \n        defendant has previously been convicted of two or more Federal \n        or State offenses, each punishable by a term of imprisonment of \n        more than one year, committed on different occasions, involving \n        controlled substances or the infliction of, or attempted \n        infliction of, serious bodily injury or death upon another \n        person.\n            ``(3) Grave risk of death to additional persons.--The \n        defendant, in the commission of the offense, knowingly created \n        a grave risk of death to one or more persons in addition to the \n        victim of the offense.\n            ``(4) Heinous, cruel, or depraved manner of commission.--\n        The defendant committed the offense in an especially heinous, \n        cruel, or depraved manner.\n            ``(5) Procurement of the offense by payment.--The defendant \n        procured the commission of the offense by payment, or promise \n        of payment, of anything of pecuniary value.\n            ``(6) Commission of the offense for payment.--The defendant \n        committed the offense as consideration for the receipt, or in \n        the expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value.\n            ``(7) Substantial planning and premeditation.--The \n        defendant committed the offense after substantial planning and \n        premeditation.\n            ``(8) Vulnerability of victim.--The victim was particularly \n        vulnerable due to old age, youth, or infirmity.\nThe jury, or if there is no jury, the court, may consider whether any \nother aggravating factor exists.\n``Sec. 3593.

Before such a hearing, no \npresentence report shall be prepared by the United States Probation \nService, notwithstanding the provisions of the Federal Rules of \nCriminal Procedure. The hearing shall be conducted--\n            ``(1) before the jury that determined the defendant's \n        guilt;\n            ``(2) before a jury impaneled for the purpose of the \n        hearing if--\n                    ``(A) the defendant was convicted upon a plea of \n                guilty;\n                    ``(B) the defendant was convicted after a trial \n                before the court sitting without a jury;\n                    ``(C) the jury that determined the defendant's \n                guilt was discharged for good cause; or\n                    ``(D) after initial imposition of a sentence under \n                this section, reconsideration of the sentence under the \n                section is necessary; or\n            ``(3) before the court alone, upon motion of the defendant \n        and with the approval of the attorney for the Government.\nA jury impaneled pursuant to paragraph (2) shall consist of 12 members, \nunless, at any time before the conclusion of the hearing, the parties \nstipulate, with the approval of the court, that it shall consist of a \nlesser number.\n    ``(c) Proof of Mitigating and Aggravating Factors.--At the hearing, \ninformation may be presented as to any matter relevant to the sentence, \nincluding any mitigating or aggravating factor permitted or required to \nbe considered under section 3592 of this title. Information presented \nmay include the trial transcript and exhibits if the hearing is held \nbefore a jury or judge not present during the trial. Any other \ninformation relevant to a mitigating or aggravating factor may be \npresented by either the attorney for the Government or the defendant, \nregardless of its admissibility under the rules governing admission of \nevidence at criminal trials, except that information may be excluded if \nits probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair \nprejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. The attorney \nfor the Government and for the defendant shall be permitted to rebut \nany information received at the hearing, and shall be given fair \nopportunity to present argument as to the adequacy of the information \nto establish the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factor, and \nas to the appropriateness of imposing a sentence of death in the case. \nThe attorney for the Government shall open the argument. The defendant \nshall be permitted to reply. The attorney for the Government shall then \nbe permitted to reply in rebuttal. The burden of establishing the \nexistence of an aggravating factor is on the Government, and is not \nsatisfied unless the existence of such a factor is established beyond a \nreasonable doubt. The burden of establishing the existence of any \nmitigating factor is on the defendant, and is not satisfied unless the \nexistence of such a factor is established by a preponderance of the \ninformation.\n    ``(d) Return of Special Findings.--The jury, or if there is no \njury, the court, shall consider all the information received during the \nhearing. It shall return special findings with respect to the \nmitigating and aggravating factors concerning which information is \nreceived at the hearing, stating--\n            ``(1) whether some mitigating factor required to be \n        considered under section 3592 exists;\n            ``(2) whether some aggravating factor required to be \n        considered under section 3592 exists; and\n            ``(3) which specific mitigating or aggravating factor or \n        factors exist.\nA finding under paragraph (1) or (2) that some mitigating or \naggravating factor exists must be unanimous. A finding under paragraph \n(3) that a specific mitigating or aggravating factor exists may be made \nby a majority of at least nine members of the jury.\n    ``(e) Return of a Finding Concerning a Sentence of Death.--If, in \nthe case of an offense described in section 3591, an aggravating factor \nrequired to be considered under section 3592 is found to exist, the \njury, or if there is no jury, the court, shall then consider whether \nthe aggravating factor or factors found to exist sufficiently outweigh \nall the mitigating factors found to exist to justify a sentence of \ndeath, or, in the absence of a mitigating factor, whether the \naggravating factor or factors alone are sufficient to justify a \nsentence of death. Based upon this consideration, the jury by unanimous \nvote, or if there is no jury, the court, shall return a finding as to \nwhether a sentence of death is justified. The jury or the court, \nregardless of its findings with respect to aggravating and mitigating \nfactors, is never required to impose a death sentence and the jury \nshall be so instructed.\n    ``(f) Special Precaution to Assure Against Discrimination.--In a \nhearing held before a jury, the court, before the return of a finding \nunder subsection (e) of this section, shall instruct the jury that, in \nconsidering whether a sentence of death is justified, it shall not \nconsider the race, color, national origin, creed, or sex of the \ndefendant or of any victim. The jury, upon return of a finding under \nsubsection (e) of this section, shall also return to the court a \ncertificate, signed by each juror, that consideration of the race, \ncolor, national origin, creed, or sex of the defendant or any victim \nwas not involved in reaching the juror's individual decision.\n``Sec. 3594. Imposition of a sentence of death\n    ``Upon a finding under section 3593(e) of this title that a \nsentence of death is justified, the court shall sentence the defendant \nto death. Upon finding under section 3593(e) of this title that no \naggravating factor required to be found exists or that a sentence of \ndeath is not justified, the court shall impose any sentence other than \ndeath that is authorized by law.\n``Sec. 3595. Review of a sentence of death\n    ``(a) Appeal.--In a case in which a sentence of death is imposed, \nthe sentence shall be subject to review by the court of appeals upon \nappeal by the defendant. Notice of appeal must be filed within the time \nspecified for the filing of a notice of appeal. An appeal under this \nsection may be consolidated with an appeal of the judgment of \nconviction and shall have priority over all other cases.\n    ``(b) Review.--The court of appeals shall review the entire record \nin the case, including--\n            ``(1) the evidence submitted during the trial;\n            ``(2) the information submitted during the sentencing \n        hearing;\n            ``(3) the procedure employed in the sentencing hearing; and\n            ``(4) the special findings returned under section 3593(d) \n        of this title.\n    ``(c) Decision and Disposition.--\n            ``(1) If the court of appeals determines that--\n                    ``(A) the sentence of death was not imposed under \n                the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other \n                arbitrary factor; and\n                    ``(B) the information supports the special findings \n                of the existence of an aggravating factor or factors;\n        it shall affirm the sentence.\n            ``(2) In any other case, the court of appeals shall remand \n        the case for reconsideration under section 3593 or for \n        imposition of another authorized sentence as appropriate.\n            ``(3) The court of appeals shall state in writing the \n        reasons for its disposition of an appeal of sentence of death \n        under this section.\n``Sec. 3596. Implementation of sentence of death\n    ``A person who has been sentenced to death pursuant to this chapter \nshall be committed to the custody of the Attorney General until \nexhaustion of the procedures for appeal of the judgment of conviction \nand for review of the sentence. When the sentence is to be implemented, \nthe Attorney General shall release the person sentenced to death to the \ncustody of a United States marshal, who shall supervise implementation \nof the sentence in the manner prescribed by law of the State in which \nthe sentence is imposed. If the law of such State does not provide for \nimplementation of a sentence of death, the court shall designate \nanother State, the law of which does so provide, and the sentence shall \nbe implemented in the manner prescribed by such law. A sentence of \ndeath shall not be carried out upon a person who lacks the mental \ncapacity to understand the death penalty and why it was imposed on that \nperson, or upon a woman while she is pregnant.\n``Sec. 3597. Use of State facilities\n    ``A United States marshal charged with supervising the \nimplementation of a sentence of death may use appropriate State or \nlocal facilities for the purpose, may use the services of an \nappropriate State or local official or of a person such as an official \nemployed for the purpose, and shall pay the costs thereof in the amount \napproved by the Attorney General.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment to Chapter Analysis.--Title 18, United \nStates Code, is amended in the chapter analysis of part II, by adding \nthe following new item after the item relating to chapter 227:\n\n``228.
