FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Child marriage, also known as ``forced marriage'' or \n        ``early marriage'', is a harmful traditional practice that \n        deprives girls of their dignity and human rights.\n            (2) Child marriage as a traditional practice, as well as \n        through coercion or force, is a violation of article 16 of the \n        Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, ``Marriage \n        shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of \n        intending spouses''.\n            (3) According to the United Nations Children's Fund \n        (UNICEF), an estimated 60,000,000 girls in developing countries \n        now ages 20 through 24 were married under the age of 18, and if \n        present trends continue more than 100,000,000 more girls in \n        developing countries will be married as children over the next \n        decade, according to the Population Council.\n            (4) Between \\1/2\\ and \\3/4\\ of all girls are married before \n        the age of 18 in Niger, Chad, Mali, Bangladesh, Guinea, the \n        Central African Republic, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, and Nepal, \n        according to Demographic Health Survey data.\n            (5) Factors perpetuating child marriage include poverty, a \n        lack of educational or employment opportunities for girls, \n        parental concerns to ensure sexual relations within marriage, \n        the dowry system, and the perceived lack of value of girls.\n            (6) Child marriage has negative effects on the health of \n        girls, including significantly increased risk of maternal death \n        and morbidity, infant mortality and morbidity, obstetric \n        fistula, and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.\n            (7) According to the United States Agency for International \n        Development (USAID), increasing the age at first birth for a \n        woman will increase her chances of survival. Currently, \n        pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of \n        death for women 15 to 19 years old in developing countries.\n            (8) Most countries with high rates of child marriage have a \n        legally established minimum age of marriage, yet child marriage \n        persists due to strong traditional norms and the failure to \n        enforce existing laws.\n            (9) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated that \n        child marriage is ``a clear and unacceptable violation of human \n        rights'', and that ``the Department of State categorically \n        denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse''.\n            (10) According to an International Center for Research on \n        Women analysis of Demographic and Health Survey data, areas or \n        regions in developing countries in which 40 percent or more of \n        girls under the age of 18 are married are considered high-\n        prevalence areas for child marriage.\n            (11) Investments in girls' schooling, creating safe \n        community spaces for girls, and programs for skills building \n        for out-of-school girls are all effective and demonstrated \n        strategies for preventing child marriage and creating a pathway \n        to empower girls by addressing conditions of poverty, low \n        status, and norms that contribute to child marriage.\n\nSEC. 3. CHILD MARRIAGE DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``child marriage'' means the marriage of a \ngirl or boy, not yet the minimum age for marriage stipulated in law in \nthe country in which the girl or boy is a resident or, where there is \nno such law, under the age of 18.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) child marriage is a violation of human rights, and the \n        prevention and elimination of child marriage should be a \n        foreign policy goal of the United States;\n            (2) the practice of child marriage undermines United States \n        investments in foreign assistance to promote education and \n        skills building for girls, reduce maternal and child mortality, \n        reduce maternal illness, halt the transmission of HIV/AIDS, \n        prevent gender-based violence, and reduce poverty; and\n            (3) expanding educational opportunities for girls, economic \n        opportunities for women, and reducing maternal and child \n        mortality are critical to achieving the Millennium Development \n        Goals and the global health and development objectives of the \n        United States, including efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS.\n\nSEC. 5.
