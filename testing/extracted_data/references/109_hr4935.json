DESIGNATION OF ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK WILDERNESS.\n\n    (a) Designation.--In furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness \nAct (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), certain lands within the Rocky Mountain \nNational Park, Colorado, which comprise approximately 249,339 acres, as \ngenerally depicted on the map titled ``Rocky Mountain National Park, \nColorado Wilderness Boundaries'' and dated February 2006, are hereby \ndesignated as wilderness and, therefore, as a component of the National \nWilderness Preservation System. The designated lands shall be known as \nthe Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness.\n    (b) Map and Description.--\n            (1) Preparation and submission.--As soon as practicable \n        after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n        the Interior shall prepare a map and a boundary description of \n        the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness designated by \n        subsection (a) and file the map and boundary description with \n        the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and \n        the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate. \n        The map and boundary description shall be on file and available \n        for public inspection in the office of the Director of the \n        National Park Service, Department of the Interior.\n            (2) Treatment.--The map and boundary description prepared \n        under paragraph (1) shall have the same force and effect as if \n        included in this Act. The Secretary of the Interior may correct \n        clerical and typographical errors in the map and description.\n    (c) Potential Wilderness Lands.--\n            (1) Definition.--In this section, the term ``potential \n        wilderness lands'' means--\n                    (A) lands identified as potential wilderness on the \n                map referred to in subsection (a); and\n                    (B) lands and interests therein acquired by the \n                United States on or after the date of the enactment of \n                this Act that are located within the boundaries of the \n                Rocky Mountain National Park and are contiguous with \n                lands designated as wilderness by this Act.\n            (2) Inclusion in wilderness.--Upon publication in the \n        Federal Register of a notice by the Secretary of the Interior \n        that all uses of a parcel of potential wilderness lands \n        inconsistent with the Wilderness Act have ceased, the parcel \n        shall be included in the Rocky Mountain National Park \n        Wilderness designated by subsection (a) and managed as provided \n        in section 3. The Secretary of the Interior shall modify the \n        map and boundary description prepared under subsection (b) to \n        reflect the inclusion of the parcel in the Rocky Mountain \n        National Park Wilderness.\n    (d) Exclusion of Certain Lands.--The boundaries of the Rocky \nMountain National Park Wilderness and the potential wilderness lands \nspecifically exclude the following:\n            (1) The Grand Ditch (including both the main canal of the \n        Grand Ditch and a branch thereof known as the specimen Ditch) \n        and its right-of-way as well as associated appurtenances, \n        structures, buildings, camps, and worksites in existence as of \n        June 1, 1998.\n            (2) Lands owned by the St. Vrain & Left Hand Water \n        Conservancy District, including Copeland Reservoir and the \n        Inlet Ditch to such reservoir from the North St. Vrain Creek, \n        amounting to approximately 35.38 acres.\n            (3) Lands owned by the Wincentsen-Harms Trust, amounting to \n        approximately 2.75 acres.\n            (4) Lands within the area depicted as ``East Shore Trail \n        Area'' on the map described in subsection (b).\n    (e) East Shore Trail Area.--\n            (1) Alignment line and trail.--\n                    (A) Not later than one year after the date of the \n                enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish an \n                alignment line for a trail, to be known as the East \n                Shore Trail, located within the East Shore Trail Area, \n                to maximize the opportunity for sustained use of the \n                trail without harm to affected resources or conflicts \n                among users. After establishing the alignment line, the \n                Secretary shall identify the boundaries of the trail, \n                but the trail shall not extend more than 25 feet east \n                of the alignment line or be located within the Rocky \n                Mountain National Park Wilderness.\n                    (B) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \n                require the construction of a trail along the alignment \n                line established pursuant to this paragraph or to limit \n                the extent to which any otherwise applicable laws or \n                policies shall apply with respect to any decision \n                regarding construction of such a trail.\n            (2) Map adjustment.--After establishing the alignment line \n        of the East Shore Trail, the Secretary shall adjust the map of \n        the wilderness area designated by subsection (a) so that the \n        western boundary of the wilderness is 50 feet east of the \n        alignment line.\n            (3) Other adjustments.--To the extent necessary to protect \n        National Park resources, the Secretary from time to time may \n        adjust the boundaries of the East Shore Trail, but no \n        adjustment shall have the effect of placing any portion of such \n        trail within the boundary of the wilderness area.\n            (4) Time limitation for authorization of use by \n        nonmotorized bicycles.--If the East Shore Trail has not been \n        constructed and authorized for use by nonmotorized bicycles on \n        or before the date that is 25 years after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act, the East Shore Trail Area shall be \n        included in the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness \n        designated by subsection (a) and managed as provided in section \n        3, and the Secretary shall modify the map and boundary \n        description of such wilderness area to reflect the inclusion of \n        such lands in wilderness.\n    (f) Relation to Lands Outside Wilderness.--\n            (1) Use of lands.--Except as provided in this subsection, \n        nothing in this Act shall affect the management or use of any \n        lands not included within the boundaries of the Rocky Mountain \n        National Park Wilderness or the potential wilderness lands.\n            (2) Use of motorized vehicles.--Until the date that is 25 \n        years after the date of the enactment of this Act, no use of \n        motorized vehicles or other motorized machinery not permitted \n        on March 1, 2006, shall be allowed in the East Shore Trail \n        Area, except as may be necessary for constructing or \n        maintaining the East Shore Trail, if such construction is \n        authorized by the Secretary.\n            (3) Management of pending wilderness.--Pending their \n        inclusion in wilderness pursuant to subsection (c)(2), the \n        potential wilderness lands shall be managed to protect any \n        wilderness characteristics and to maintain their suitability \n        for inclusion in wilderness.\n\nSEC. 3.

In \n        implementing this paragraph, the Secretary shall not establish \n        any restrictions on the activities that would prevent the \n        occurrence of such necessary activities or that would reduce \n        the water supply provided by the Colorado-Big Thompson Project \n        or the Windy Gap Project.\n            (3) Relation to authority in act establishing park.--\n        Nothing in the first section of the Act of January 26, 1915 (16 \n        U.S.C. 191), shall be construed to allow development within the \n        lands designated as wilderness by section 2 of any reclamation \n        project not in existence as of the date of the enactment of \n        this Act.\n    (d) No Buffer Zones.--Congress does not intend that the designation \nby this Act of the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness creates or \nimplies the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around \nthe wilderness area. The fact that nonwilderness activities or uses can \nbe seen or heard from within the wilderness area shall not, of itself, \npreclude such activities or uses up to the boundary of the wilderness \narea.\n\nSEC. 4.
