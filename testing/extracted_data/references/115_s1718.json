FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States entered World War II as a result of \n        the surprise Japanese attack against our fleet at Pearl Harbor, \n        Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, which killed 2,403 people of the \n        United States;\n            (2) the United States joined the wartime Allied cause \n        against the militarist, fascist, and racist dictatorships of \n        Germany, Japan, and Italy (the Axis), fighting for President \n        Franklin D. Roosevelt's ``Four Freedoms'' (freedom of speech, \n        of worship, from want, and from fear);\n            (3) the United States placed no more than 16,000,000 of its \n        citizens into uniform in the course of the struggle, enduring a \n        string of early defeats, recovering to conduct a total war on \n        land, sea, and air, and eventually establishing total dominance \n        over its enemies;\n            (4) the war took the lives of 405,399 United States \n        military personnel, fellow citizens who made the supreme \n        sacrifice in a perilous moment in the history of the United \n        States, giving their lives for the cause of democracy and \n        peace;\n            (5) the conflict led to a comprehensive transformation of \n        the home front from a civilian economy dedicated to peacetime \n        production into the mightiest engine of military might in human \n        history (labeled the ``Arsenal of Democracy''), demanding the \n        participation of the entire citizenry and thus leading to \n        increased opportunities for racial minorities and women;\n            (6) the war ended on September 2, 1945, after the \n        unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and \n        Imperial Japan, and a total victory for the United States and \n        the Allies;\n            (7) Allied victory in World War II transformed the United \n        States into the leader of the ``free world,'' a community of \n        countries dedicated to democratic principles and to resisting \n        all forms of tyranny, including authoritarian, militarist, or \n        communist, and an international order founded on open \n        societies, liberal economies, and the peaceful resolution of \n        disputes;\n            (8) participation in the wartime struggle emboldened women, \n        African Americans and other previously marginalized groups to \n        seek equal rights, encouraged the growth of the civil rights \n        movement, and thus contributed to the development of ``a more \n        perfect union,'' guaranteeing freedom, justice, and equality \n        for all;\n            (9) the generation of United States citizens who fought \n        World War II is passing away with the march of time, and that \n        therefore the urgent need to give honor to those who served is \n        all the more critical; and\n            (10) the period from May 8, 2020, to September 2, 2020, \n        will mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the involvement of \n        the United States in World War II and the surrender of Nazi \n        Germany and Imperial Japan, respectively.\n\nSEC. 3.
