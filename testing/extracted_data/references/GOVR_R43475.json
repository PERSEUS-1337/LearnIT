    "content": "The President's budget for FY2020 consists of a multivolume set of materials issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The materials contain information on new budget proposals, summ ary tables, detailed financial information on individual programs and accounts, economic analysis, historical data, explanations of the budget processes, and supporting documents. Every year the President submits these materials to Congress at the start of the budget cycle for the next fiscal year. The President's submission is required on or after the first Monday in January, but no later than the first Monday in February (31 U.S.C. \u00a71105(a)). However, incoming presidential Administrations do not generally release multivolume budget sets in February. This year the President released the budget submission, in two installments, on March 11, and March 18, 2019.  Other budget-related documents include the annual Economic Report of the President , issued by the Council of Economic Advisors, and the Budget and Economic Outlook , an annual publication issued by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Details on these publications are included in this report. Both OMB and the Government Publishing Office (GPO) provide internet access to the main and supporting budget documents, spreadsheet files, the public budget database, and budget amendments and supplementals proposed by the President; see http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget and https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/BUDGET , respectively. OMB provides additional summary table information on agency budgets and key issues in the form of fact sheets, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fact-sheets/ . Information on purchasing print copies of these documents appears below, along with a brief description of the contents of each document.  The annual budget volume contains information, charts, and graphs pertaining to the President's new budget proposals and overviews of government activities by topic (e.g., \"Modernizing Government\" and \"A Budget for a Better American\") within the FY2020 Budget volume. Summary Tables (pp. 105-139) contain projections of budget baselines, receipts, and outlays; deficits; debt; discretionary spending; and economic projections from FY2019 to FY2029. Federal programs that have been recommended by the Administration for termination or reduction are detailed in the document entitled Major Savings and Reforms , available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/msar-fy2020.pdf . (GPO stock number 041-001-00731-8, 150 pages, $22) The FY20 20 Budget CD-ROM contains the full content of the budget documents and most supporting documents for the budget in PDF files. Some data files are also included in spreadsheet format. The CD-ROM provides software to search, display, and print. (GPO stock number and ordering information not yet available) This volume includes economic, accounting, and crosscutting analyses of government programs and activities designed to highlight specific subject areas. It also includes information on federal receipts and collections, analysis of federal spending, detailed information on federal borrowing and debt, baseline or current service estimates, and other technical presentations. Chapter 17, \"Aid to State and Local Governments,\" contains a series of tables (pp. 231-247) that provide selected grant and other federal assistance data by state. The FY2020 Analytical Perspectives volume contains supplemental materials including tables showing the budget by agency and account and by function, subfunction, and program. The supplemental materials also include data on direct and guaranteed loan transactions of the federal government. The supplemental material is available on a CD-ROM, in the printed document, or on the GPO website at https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/BUDGET . (GPO stock number 041-001-00732-6, $52, 360 pages) Designed primarily for the use of the House and Senate appropriations committees, the Appendix contains more detailed financial information on individual programs and appropriations accounts than any of the other budget documents submitted by the President. In many presidential budget submissions, the volume often provides the following information for agencies: proposed text of the appropriation language, budget schedules for each account, new legislative proposals, explanations of the work to be performed and the funds needed, and proposed general provisions applicable to the appropriations of entire agencies or groups of agencies. Typically, elements within this information are distinguished by varying font, so that, for example, proposed appropriations (italics) and prior year funding (brackets and no italics) can be compared at a glance: For expenses necessary for the administration of the Department of Justice, [$111,500,000] $125,896,000 , of which not to exceed $4,000,000 for security and construction of Department of Justice facilities shall remain available until expended. ( Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 2016 ) Note that the FY2020 budget appendix does not pair prior year funding figures with proposed appropriations. (GPO stock number 041-001-00733-4, $82, 1,3 20 pages) These detailed tables cover budget deficit/surplus, outlays, receipts, discretionary and mandatory spending, federal debt, federal employment, payments for individuals, spending by function and agency, and grants to states and local governments. These tables provide some data from 1940 (or earlier) and estimates through FY2024. Historical data are adjusted by OMB to be consistent with data in the FY2020 budget and to provide comparability over time. This year the Historical Tables are available online in spreadsheet and PDF instead of print. The Historical Tables are available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/ .  This year's annual Economic Report of the President was submitted by the Council of Economic Advisers and transmitted to Congress in March 2019. It presents the Administration's economic policies and contains the annual report of the Council of Economic Advisers. It also presents an overview of the nation's economic progress using text and extensive data appendices. Appendix B of the Economic Report includes current and historical statistics on major aspects of economic activity (pp. 625-705). Statistics include national income and expenditures, government finance, population, employment, wages, productivity, prices, debt measures, corporate finance, and international statistics. The report is also available from the GPO website at https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/ERP/ . A searchable database of the Economic Report of the President for each year from 1995 to the present is also available at this site. Spreadsheet files from Appendix B of the report can be accessed at the link above . (GPO stock number and ordering information not yet available) OMB issues revised estimates of budget receipts, outlays, and budget authority in the Mid-Session Review . This annual document is typically released in the summer following the President's budget submission. The FY2020 document is not currently available, but should be available in the summer on the OMB website . (GPO stock number and ordering information not yet available) After the President's budget documents are released, Congress begins to hold hearings on agency budget requests. Agencies must submit their budget justifications to the appropriations subcommittees holding the hearings. Budget justifications generally contain more detailed descriptions of an agency's proposals and programs than are provided in the President's budget documents. As mandated by OMB in Section 22.6 of the 2006 edition of Circular A-11 and subsequent editions, executive agencies are required to post their congressional budget justification materials on the internet within two weeks of transmittal to Congress. Typically, Administration budget requests appear along with actual numbers for the previous fiscal year. The content and structure of these submissions may vary and some materials may not correspond exactly with the data and information provided to Congress in other fiscal years. A short overview on the agency budget justification request can be found within CRS Report RS20268, Agency Justification of the President's Budget , by Michelle D. Christensen.  OMB produces a number of additional documents that further examines certain budgetary categories, including the Federal Credit Supplement , which provides summary information on certain federal loan and loan guarantee programs through a series of detailed tables; Object Class Analysis , a report on the federal government's obligations as broken out by object classifications; and Balances of Budget Authority , which provides data on unobligated balances carried forward to the start of the next fiscal year. All three documents are available online at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/supplemental-materials/ . OMB also maintains a publicly accessible database in Excel and comma delimited format called the Public Budget Database . This resource provides account level detail data on budget authority for the years FY1976 to FY2024, and budget outlays and budget receipts for FY1962 to FY2024. This resource is available on the GPO FY2020 budget website at https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/BUDGET/ . A user's guide in PDF format is also available on this site by clicking on the expandable tab for the document. This report provides an analysis of the President's budgetary proposals and CBO's updated baseline budget projections. The FY2020 report should be forthcoming. (GPO ordering information is currently not available.) CBO's baseline budget projections typically span 11 fiscal years in its reports. The Budget and Economic Outlook includes separate chapters on the economic outlook, outlays, and receipts. This document is typically released in January, and it usually includes discussions on current economic conditions. The FY2019 report is available on the CBO website at https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54918 . CBO issues an annual summer update of the Budget and Economic Outlook with adjusted projections. This document and other budget and economic information, including CBO's monthly budget review are available at http://www.cbo.gov/topics/budget .
