FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Under section 2576a of title 10, United States Code, \n        the Department of Defense is authorized to provide excess \n        property to local law enforcement agencies. The Defense \n        Logistics Agency, administers such section by operating the Law \n        Enforcement Support Office program.\n            (2) New and used material, including mine-resistant ambush-\n        protected vehicles and weapons determined by the Department of \n        Defense to be ``military grade'' are transferred to local and \n        Federal law enforcement agencies through the program.\n            (3) As a result local law enforcement agencies, including \n        police and sheriff's departments, are acquiring this material \n        for use in their normal operations.\n            (4) As a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \n        military equipment purchased for, and used in, those wars has \n        become excess property and has been made available for transfer \n        to local and Federal law enforcement agencies.\n            (5) According to public reports, approximately 12,000 \n        police organizations across the country were able to procure \n        nearly $500,000,000 worth of excess military merchandise \n        including firearms, computers, helicopters, clothing, and other \n        products, at no charge during fiscal year 2011 alone.\n            (6) More than $4,000,000,000 worth of weapons and equipment \n        have been transferred to police organizations in all 50 states \n        and four territories through the program.\n            (7) In May 2012, the Defense Logistics Agency instituted a \n        moratorium on weapons transfers through the program after \n        reports of missing equipment and inappropriate weapons \n        transfers.\n            (8) Though the moratorium was widely publicized, it was \n        lifted in October 2013 without adequate safeguards.\n            (9) As a result, Federal, State, and local law enforcement \n        departments across the country are eligible again to acquire \n        free ``military-grade'' weapons and equipment that could be \n        used inappropriately during policing efforts in which citizens \n        and taxpayers could be harmed.\n            (10) Pursuant to section III(J) of a Defense Logistics \n        Agency memorandum of understanding, property obtained through \n        the program must be placed into use within one year of receipt, \n        possibly providing an incentive for the unnecessary and \n        potentially dangerous use of ``military grade'' equipment by \n        local law enforcement.\n            (11) The Department of Defense categorizes equipment \n        eligible for transfer under the 1033 program as ``controlled'' \n        and ``un-controlled'' equipment. ``Controlled equipment'' \n        includes weapons, explosives such as flash-bang grenades, mine \n        resistant ambush protected vehicles, long range acoustic \n        devices, aircraft capable of being modified to carry armament \n        that are combat coded, and silencers, among other military \n        grade items.\n\nSEC. 3.

and\n            (5) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new \n        subsections:\n    ``(d) Annual Certification Accounting for Transferred Property.--\n(1) For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \ncertification in writing that each Federal or State agency to which the \nSecretary has transferred property under this section--\n            ``(A) has provided to the Secretary documentation \n        accounting for all controlled property, including arms and \n        ammunition, that the Secretary has transferred to the agency, \n        including any item described in subsection (f) so transferred \n        before the date of the enactment of the Stop Militarizing Law \n        Enforcement Act;
