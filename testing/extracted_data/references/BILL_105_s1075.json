FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Increasingly, children are raised in families with only \n        1 parent present, usually the mother, and these single-parent \n        families are 5 times as likely to be poor as 2-parent families.\n            (2) The failure of noncustodial parents to pay their fair \n        share of child support is a significant contributor to poverty \n        among single-parent families.\n            (3) In 1990, there was a $33,700,000,000 gap between the \n        amount of child support that was received and the amount that \n        could have been collected.\n            (4) In 1991, the aggregate child support income deficit was \n        $5,800,000,000.\n            (5) As of spring 1992, only 54 percent, or 6,200,000, of \n        custodial parents received awards of child support. Of the \n        6,200,000 custodial parents awarded child support, 5,300,000 \n        were supposed to receive child support payments in 1991. \n        Approximately \\1/2\\ of the parents due child support received \n        full payment; the remaining \\1/2\\ were divided equally between \n        those receiving partial payment (24 percent) and those \n        receiving nothing (25 percent).\n            (6) Custodial parents who are poor are much more likely to \n        receive no child support. Of the 3,700,000 custodial parents \n        who were poor in 1991, over \\3/4\\ received no child support. \n        Only 34 percent of poor custodial parents had child support \n        awards and were supposed to receive child support payments in \n        1991. Of those parents, only 40 percent received full payment, \n        29 percent received partial payment, and 32 percent received \n        nothing.\n            (7) The percentage of poor women who were awarded child \n        support in 1991, 39 percent, was significantly lower than the \n        65 percent award rate for nonpoor women.\n            (8) Families fare better with child support than without \n        that support. In 1991, 43 percent of custodial parents who did \n        not have child support orders were poor.\n            (9) In 1991, the average total money income of custodial \n        parents receiving child support due was 21 percent higher than \n        that received by parents who did not receive child support due \n        and was 45 percent higher than that received by custodial \n        parents with no child support award at all.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to enable participating \nStates to establish child support assurance systems in order to improve \nthe economic circumstances of children who do not receive a minimum \nlevel of child support in a given month from the noncustodial parents \nof such children, to strengthen the establishment and enforcement of \nchild support awards, and to promote work by custodial and noncustodial \nparents.\n\nSEC. 3.
