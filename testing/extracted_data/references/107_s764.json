    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) prices in the spot market for electric energy in the \n        western energy market have consistently remained at levels that \n        are multiples of energy prices prevailing before 2000;\n            (2) the price increases began in California and spread \n        throughout the western energy market;\n            (3) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in an order \n        issued November 1, 2000, found that prices in California and \n        the western energy market are unjust and unreasonable; and\n            (4) the high and volatile prices for natural gas are \n        reflected in the costs of producing electricity.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal \n        Energy Regulatory Commission.\n            (2) Cost-of-service based rate.--The term ``cost-of-service \n        based rate'' means a rate, charge, or classification for the \n        sale of electric energy that is equal to--\n                    (A) all the reasonable variable costs for producing \n                the electric energy;\n                    (B) all the reasonable fixed costs for producing \n                the electric energy;\n                    (C) a reasonable risk premium or return on invested \n                capital; and\n                    (D) all other reasonable costs associated with the \n                production, acquisition, conservation, and transmission \n                of electric power.\n            (3) Load-differentiated demand rate.--The term ``load-\n        differentiated demand rate'' means a rate, charge, or \n        classification for the sale of electric energy that reflects \n        differences in the demand for electric energy during various \n        times of day, months, seasons, or other time periods.\n            (4) Public utility.--The term ``public utility'' has the \n        meaning given the term in section 201 of the Federal Power Act \n        (16 U.S.C. 824).\n            (5) Western energy market.--The term ``western energy \n        market'' means the area within the United States that is \n        covered by the Western Systems Coordinating Council.\n\nSEC. 3. WHOLESALE ELECTRIC ENERGY RATES OF REGULATED ENTITIES IN THE \n              WESTERN ENERGY MARKET.\n\n    (a) Imposition of Wholesale Electric Energy Rates.--Not later than \n60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall \nimpose just and reasonable load-differentiated demand rates or cost-of-\nservice based rates on sales by public utilities of electric energy at \nwholesale in the western energy market.\n    (b) Limitations.--\n            (1) In general.--A load-differentiated demand rate or cost-\n        of-service based rate shall not apply to a sale of electric \nenergy at wholesale for delivery in a State that, after the date of \nenactment of this Act--\n                    (A) prohibits the State public utility commission \n                from approving the passing through to retail consumers \n                of cost-of-service based rates or load-differentiated \n                demand rates approved by the Commission; or\n                    (B) imposes a price limit on the sale of electric \n                energy at retail that precludes a public utility (or \n                any entity that is authorized to purchase electricity \n                on behalf of a public utility or a State) from making a \n                payment when due to any entity within the western \n                energy market from which the public utility purchases \n                electric energy for resale at retail within the western \n                energy market.\n            (2) No orders to sell without a reasonable assurance of \n        payment.--Notwithstanding section 302 of the Natural Gas Policy \n        Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. 3362), section 202(c) of the Federal \n        Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824a(c)), or section 101 of the Defense \n        Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App. 2071), neither the \n        Secretary of Energy nor the Commission may issue an order that \n        requires a seller of electric energy or natural gas to sell, on \n        or after the date of enactment of this Act, electric energy or \n        natural gas to a buyer in a State described in paragraph (1) \n        unless there is a reasonable assurance that the Commission \n        determines is sufficient to ensure that the seller will be \n        paid--\n                    (A) the full purchase price when due, as agreed to \n                by the buyer and seller; or\n                    (B) if the buyer and seller are unable to agree on \n                a price--\n                            (i) a fair and equitable price for natural \n                        gas, as determined by the President under \n                        section 302 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of \n                        1978 (15 U.S.C. 3362); or\n                            (ii) a just and reasonable price for \n                        electric energy, as determined by the Secretary \n                        of Energy or the Commission, as appropriate, \n                        under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act \n                        (16 U.S.C. 824a(c)).\n            (3) Requirement to meet in-state demand.--Notwithstanding \n        any other provision of law, a State public utility commission \n        in the western energy market may prohibit any utility subject \n        to the jurisdiction of the State public utility commission from \n        making any sale of electric energy to a purchaser outside the \n        service area of the utility at any time at which the State \n        public utility commission has reason to believe that delivery \n        of the electric energy would impair the ability of the utility \n        to meet, at or after the time of the delivery, the demand for \n        electric energy in the service area of the utility.\n    (c) Authority of State Regulatory Authorities.--This section does \nnot diminish or have any other effect on the authority of a State \nregulatory authority (as defined in section 3 of the Federal Power Act \n(16 U.S.C. 796)) to regulate rates and charges for the sale of electric \nenergy to consumers, including the authority to determine the manner in \nwhich wholesale rates shall be passed through to consumers (including \nthe setting of tiered pricing, real-time pricing, and baseline rates).\n    (d) Repeal.--Effective March 1, 2003, this section is repealed, and \nany load-differentiated demand rate or cost-of-service based rate \nimposed under this section that is then in effect shall no longer be \neffective.\n\nSEC. 4. NATURAL GAS RATES.\n\n    (a) Inapplicability of Waiver of Maximum Rate Ceiling Provision to \nTransportation of Natural Gas Into the State of California.--Effective \nbeginning on the date of enactment of this Act, paragraph (i) of \nsection 284.8 of title 18, Code of Federal Regulations, shall not apply \nto the transportation of natural gas into the State of California from \noutside the State.\n    (b) Disclosure of Commodity Portion and Transportation Portion of \nSale Price in Bundled Natural Gas Transactions.--\n            (1) Definition of bundled transaction.--In this subsection, \n        the term ``bundled transaction'' means a transaction for the \n        sale of natural gas in which the sale price includes both the \n        cost of the natural gas and the cost of transporting the \n        natural gas.\n            (2) Disclosure.--Exercising authority under section 4 of \n        the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717c), not later than 60 days \n        after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall \n        promulgate a regulation that requires any person that sells \n        natural gas in a bundled transaction under which the natural \n        gas is to be transported into the State of California from \n        outside the State to file with the Commission, not later than a \n        date specified by the Commission, a statement that discloses--\n                    (A) the portion of the sale price that is \n                attributable to the price paid by the seller for the \n                natural gas; and\n                    (B) the portion of the sale price that is \n                attributable to the price paid for transportation of \n                the natural gas.\n\nSEC. 5. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE BONNEVILLE POWER \n              ADMINISTRATION.\n\n    It is the sense of the Senate that the Bonneville Power \nAdministration should--\n            (1) take steps to reduce its wholesale electric power \n        purchase needs in the rate period beginning October 1, 2001; \n        and\n            (2) undertake other actions to minimize its potential \n        wholesale electric rate increase due to take effect October 1, \n        2001.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECT OF ACT.\n\n    Nothing in this Act--\n            (1) affects any energy production that, as of the date of \n        enactment of this Act, is not online and for which an \n        application for a permit to produce electricity has not been \n        filed;\n            (2) affects any contract for the purchase of electric \n        energy except a contract for a spot market purchase; or\n            (3) prohibits a State or other entity from appearing in a \n        Federal court in any instance in which it is alleged that the \n        Commission is not enforcing the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. \n        791a et seq.)."
