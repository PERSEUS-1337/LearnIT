REFERENCES.\n\n    A reference in this Act to ``the Act'' shall be a reference to the \nNational Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. \n285g note; Public Law 99-660; 100 Stat. 3752).\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) infant mortality is largely preventable with early, \n        regular, and comprehensive prenatal care, good nutrition, \n        healthy behaviors during pregnancy, and preventive well baby \n        care;\n            (2) while the United States' infant mortality rate is \n        slowly improving, the Nation still lags behind most other \n        developed nations, and the advances that are being made \n        continue to be due mostly to improved technology that saves low \n        birthweight and otherwise at-risk newborns rather than making \n        sure all babies are born as healthy as possible in the first \n        place;\n            (3) children born at low birthweight and otherwise at-risk \n        not only are more likely to die, but also are much more likely \n        to suffer long-term disabilities and require costly medical \n        interventions, special education, and other services;\n            (4) in 1988, the National Commission to Prevent Infant \n        Mortality developed a strategic national plan to reduce infant \n        mortality, and submitted such plan to the Congress and the \n        President in a report entitled ``Death Before Life: The Tragedy \n        of Infant Mortality'';\n            (5) the report's many recommendations centered on \n        fundamental solutions to the problem of infant mortality that \n        have existed for decades, including recommendations that all \n        pregnant women and infants must have universal access to the \n        range of necessary services, and that the health and well-being \n        of mothers and children must become a high national priority;\n            (6) since issuing such report, the Commission has continued \n        to promote specific actions, based on the report's \n        recommendations, for Congress and all sectors of society to \n        take to improve the health and well-being of all infants, \n        children, and pregnant women;\n            (7) despite considerable effort and success by many \n        throughout the Nation to improve the accessibility of services \n        and to raise awareness about healthy behaviors, numerous \n        financial and nonfinancial barriers still exist in the service \n        delivery system, the public continues to lack the information \n        and often motivation needed to make healthy choices, and the \n        infant mortality rate, low birthweight rate, and other \n        indicators continue to be far too high; and\n            (8) to help assure that the Nation reaches the goal of \n        universal access to care and that the health and well-being of \n        all infants, children, and pregnant women becomes a high \n        national priority, the need for the Commission continues.\n\nSEC. 4.
