FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The lack of high quality digital content continues to \n        hinder consumer adoption of broadband Internet service and \n        digital television products.\n            (2) Owners of digital programming and content are \n        increasingly reluctant to transmit their products unless \n        digital media devices incorporate technologies that recognize \n        and respond to content security measures designed to prevent \n        theft.\n            (3) Because digital content can be copied quickly, easily, \n        and without degradation, digital programmers and content owners \n        face an exponentially increasing piracy threat in a digital \n        age.\n            (4) Current agreements reached in the marketplace to \n        include security technologies in certain digital media devices \n        fail to provide a secure digital environment because those \n        agreements do not prevent the continued use and manufacture of \n        digital media devices that fail to incorporate such security \n        technologies.\n            (5) Other existing digital rights management schemes \n        represent proprietary, partial solutions that limit, rather \n        than promote, consumers' access to the greatest variety of \n        digital content possible.\n            (6) Technological solutions can be developed to protect \n        digital content on digital broadcast television and over the \n        Internet.\n            (7) Competing business interests have frustrated agreement \n        on the deployment of existing technology in digital media \n        devices to protect digital content on the Internet or on \n        digital broadcast television.\n            (8) The secure protection of digital content is a necessary \n        precondition to the dissemination, and on-line availability, of \n        high quality digital content, which will benefit consumers and \n        lead to the rapid growth of broadband networks.\n            (9) The secure protection of digital content is a necessary \n        precondition to facilitating and hastening the transition to \n        high-definition television, which will benefit consumers.\n            (10) Today, cable and satellite have a competitive \n        advantage over digital television because the closed nature of \n        cable and satellite systems permit encryption, which provides \n        some protection for digital content.\n            (11) Over-the-air broadcasts of digital television are not \n        encrypted for public policy reasons and thus lack those \n        protections afforded to programming delivered via cable or \n        satellite.\n            (12) A solution to this problem is technologically feasible \n        but will require government action, including a mandate to \n        ensure its swift and ubiquitous adoption.\n            (13) Consumers receive content such as video or programming \n        in analog form.\n            (14) When protected digital content is converted to analog \n        for consumers, it is no longer protected and is subject to \n        conversion into unprotected digital form that can in turn be \n        copied or redistributed illegally.\n            (15) A solution to this problem is technologically feasible \n        but will require government action, including a mandate to \nensure its swift and ubiquitous adoption.\n            (16) Unprotected digital content on the Internet is subject \n        to significant piracy, through illegal file sharing, \n        downloading, and redistribution over the Internet.\n            (17) Millions of Americans are currently downloading \n        television programs, movies, and music on the Internet and by \n        using ``file-sharing'' technology. Much of this activity is \n        illegal, but demonstrates consumers' desire to access digital \n        content.\n            (18) This piracy poses a substantial economic threat to \n        America's content industries.\n            (19) A solution to this problem is technologically feasible \n        but will require government action, including a mandate to \n        ensure its swift and ubiquitous adoption.\n            (20) Providing a secure, protected environment for digital \n        content should be accompanied by a preservation of legitimate \n        consumer expectations regarding use of digital content in the \n        home.\n            (21) Secure technological protections should enable content \n        owners to disseminate digital content over the Internet without \n        frustrating consumers' legitimate expectations to use that \n        content in a legal manner.\n            (22) Technologies used to protect digital content should \n        facilitate legitimate home use of digital content.\n            (23) Technologies used to protect digital content should \n        facilitate individuals' ability to engage in legitimate use of \n        digital content for educational or research purposes.\n\nSEC. 3. ADOPTION OF SECURITY SYSTEM STANDARDS AND ENCODING RULES.\n\n    (a) Private Sector Efforts.--\n            (1) In general.--The Federal Communications Commission, in \n        consultation with the Register of Copyrights, shall make a \n        determination, not more than 12 months after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, as to whether--\n                    (A) representatives of digital media device \n                manufacturers, consumer groups, and copyright owners \n                have reached agreement on security system standards for \n                use in digital media devices and encoding rules; and\n                    (B) the standards and encoding rules conform to the \n                requirements of subsections (d) and (e).\n            (2) Report to the commerce and judiciary committees.--\n        Within 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n        Commission shall report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n        Science and Transportation, the Senate Committee on the \n        Judiciary, the House of Representatives Committee on Commerce, \n        and the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary as \n        to whether--\n                    (A) substantial progress has been made toward the \n                development of security system standards and encoding \n                rules that will conform to the requirements of \n                subsections (d) and (e);\n                    (B) private sector negotiations are continuing in \n                good faith;\n                    (C) there is a reasonable expectation that final \n                agreement will be reached within 1 year after the date \n                of enactment of this Act; and\n                    (D) if it is unlikely that such a final agreement \n                will be reached by the end of that year, the deadline \n                should be extended.\n    (b) Affirmative Determination.--If the Commission makes a \ndetermination under subsection (a)(1) that an agreement on security \nsystem standards and encoding rules that conform to the requirements of \nsubsections (d) and (e) has been reached, then the Commission shall--\n            (1) initiate a rulemaking, within 30 days after the date on \n        which the determination is made, to adopt those standards and \n        encoding rules; and\n            (2) publish a final rule pursuant to that rulemaking, not \n        later than 180 days after initiating the rulemaking, that will \n        take effect 1 year after its publication.\n    (c) Negative Determination.--If the Commission makes a \ndetermination under subsection (a)(1) that an agreement on security \nsystem standards and encoding rules that conform to the requirements of \nsubsections (d) and (e) has not been reached, then the Commission--\n            (1) in consultation with representatives described in \n        subsection (a)(1)(A) and the Register of Copyrights, shall \n        initiate a rulemaking, within 30 days after the date on which \n        the determination is made, to adopt security system standards \n        and encoding rules that conform to the requirements of \n        subsections (d) and (e); and\n            (2) shall publish a final rule pursuant to that rulemaking, \n        not later than 1 year after initiating the rulemaking, that \n        will take effect 1 year after its publication.\n    (d) Security System Standards.--In achieving the goals of setting \nopen security system standards that will provide effective security for \ncopyrighted works, the security system standards shall ensure, to the \nextent practicable, that--\n            (1) the standard security technologies are--\n                    (A) reliable;\n                    (B) renewable;\n                    (C) resistant to attack;\n                    (D) readily implemented;\n                    (E) modular;\n                    (F) applicable to multiple technology platforms;\n                    (G) extensible;\n                    (H) upgradable;\n                    (I) not cost prohibitive; and\n            (2) any software portion of such standards is based on open \n        source code.\n    (e) Encoding Rules.--\n            (1) Limitations on the exclusive rights of copyright \n        owners.--In achieving the goal of promoting as many lawful uses \n        of copyrighted works as possible, while preventing as much \n        infringement as possible, the encoding rules shall take into \n        account the limitations on the exclusive rights of copyright \n        owners, including the fair use doctrine.\n            (2) Personal use copies.--No person may apply a security \n        measure that uses a standard security technology to prevent a \n        lawful recipient from making a personal copy for lawful use in \n        the home of programming at the time it is lawfully performed, \n        on an over-the-air broadcast, premium or non-premium cable \n        channel, or premium or non-premium satellite channel, by a \n        television broadcast station (as defined in section \n        122(j)(5)(A) of title 17, United States Code), a cable system \n        (as defined in section 111(f) of such title), or a satellite \n        carrier (as defined in section 119(d)(6) of such title).\n    (f) Means of Implementing Standards.--The security system standards \nadopted under subsection (b), (c), or (g) shall provide for secure \ntechnical means of implementing directions of copyright owners for \ncopyrighted works.\n    (g) Commission May Revise Standards and Rules Through Rulemaking.--\n            (1) In general.--The Commission may conduct subsequent \n        rulemakings to modify any security system standards or encoding \n        rules established under subsection (b) or (c) or to adopt new \n        security system standards that conform to the requirements of \n        subsections (d) and (e).\n            (2) Consultation required.--The Commission shall conduct \n        any such subsequent rulemaking in consultation with \n        representatives of digital media device manufacturers, consumer \n        groups, and copyright owners described in subsection (a)(1)(A) \n        and with the Register of Copyrights.\n            (3) Implementation.--Any final rule published in such a \n        subsequent rulemaking shall--\n                    (A) apply prospectively only;
