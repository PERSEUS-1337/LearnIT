SHORT TITLE, ETC.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Alternative Fuel \nUtilization and Infrastructure Development Incentives Act of 2005''.\n    (b) Amendment of 1986 Code.--Except as otherwise expressly \nprovided, whenever in this division an amendment or repeal is expressed \nin terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other \nprovision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \nother provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n    (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title, etc.\nSec. 2. Purpose.\nSec. 3. Findings.\nSec. 4. Incentives for the installation of alternative fuel refueling \n                            stations.\nSec. 5. Incentives for the retail sale of alternative fuels as motor \n                            vehicle fuel.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to decrease the dependence of the United \nStates on foreign oil by increasing the use of high ratio blends of \ngasoline with a minimum 85 percent domestically derived ethanol content \n(E-85) as an alternative fuel and providing greater access to this fuel \nfor American motorists.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The growing United States reliance on foreign produced \n        petroleum and the recent escalation of crude oil prices demands \n        that all prudent measures be undertaken to increase United \n        States refining capacity, domestic oil production, and expanded \n        utilization of alternative forms of transportation fuels and \n        infrastructure.\n            (2) Recent studies confirm the environmental and overall \n        energy security benefits of high ratio blends of gasoline with \n        a minimum 85 percent domestically derived ethanol content (E-\n        85), especially with regard to the reduction of greenhouse gas \n        emissions from the national on-road passenger car vehicle \n        fleet.\n            (3) The market penetration of E-85 capable Flexible Fuel \n        Vehicles (FFVs) now exceeds 5,000,000 with an additional \n        1,000,000 or more FFVs expected to be added annually as \n        automakers continue to respond positively to congressionally \n        provided production incentives.\n            (4) It is further recognized that actual implementation of \n        the use of E-85 fuel has been significantly underutilized due \n        primarily to the lack of E-85 refueling infrastructure \n        availability and promotion and that such utilization rate will \n        continue to lag unless resources are provided to substantially \n        accelerate national refueling infrastructure development.\n            (5) Additionally, incentives in the form of tax credits can \n        serve to stimulate infrastructure development and E-85 fuel \n        utilization.\n\nSEC. 4. INCENTIVES FOR THE INSTALLATION OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL REFUELING \n              STATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \n(relating to foreign tax credit, etc.) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following new section:\n\n``SEC. 30B.
