BURDEN OF PROOF.\n\n    (a) Conditions for Granting Asylum.--Section 208(b) of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``The Attorney General'' \n        and inserting the following:\n                    ``(A) Eligibility.--The Secretary of Homeland \n                Security or the Attorney General''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(B) Burden of proof.--The burden of proof is on \n                the applicant to establish that the applicant is a \n                refugee within the meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A). To \n                establish that the applicant is a refugee within the \n                meaning of this Act, the applicant must establish that \n                race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular \n                social group, or political opinion was or will be the \n                central motive for persecuting the applicant. The \n                testimony of the applicant, only if it is credible, is \n                persuasive, and refers to specific facts that \n                demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee, may be \n                sufficient to sustain such burden without \n                corroboration. Where the trier of fact finds that it is \n                reasonable to expect corroborating evidence for certain \n                alleged facts pertaining to the specifics of the \n                applicant's claim, such evidence must be provided \n                unless a reasonable explanation is given as to why such \n                information is not provided. The credibility \n                determination of the trier of fact may be based, in \n                addition to other factors, on the demeanor, candor, or \n                responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the \n                consistency between the applicant's or witness's \n                written and oral statements, whether or not under oath, \n                made at any time to any officer, agent, or employee of \n                the United States, the internal consistency of each \n                such statement, the consistency of such statements with \n                the country conditions in the country from which the \n                applicant claims asylum, as presented by the Department \n                of State, and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such \n                statements. These factors may be considered \n                individually or cumulatively.''.\n    (b) Standard of Review for Orders of Removal.--Section 242(b)(4) of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(4)) is amended by \nadding after subparagraph (D) the following flush language:\n        ``No court shall reverse a determination made by an adjudicator \n        with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence as \n        described in section 208(b)(1)(B), unless the court finds that \n        a reasonable adjudicator is compelled to conclude that such \n        corroborating evidence is unavailable.''.\n    (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (b) shall \ntake effect upon the date of enactment of this Act and shall apply to \ncases in which the final administrative removal order was issued \nbefore, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take effect upon \nthe date of enactment of this Act."
