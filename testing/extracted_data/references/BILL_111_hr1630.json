DEFINITION OF AFFECTED AREA TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL DOWNWIND \n              AREA EXPOSED TO IONIZING RADIATION (NUCLEAR FALLOUT).\n\n    Section 4(b)(1) of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 \nU.S.C. 2210 note) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (B); and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(D) the Territory of Guam; and''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States conducted testing of atomic nuclear \n        weapons on Enewetak and Bikini Atolls in the Marshall Islands, \n        from 1946 to 1962. A total of sixty-seven (67) atomic and \n        thermonuclear bombs were detonated which resulted in fallout \n        across a wide area in the Pacific.\n            (2) The Atomic Energy Commission detonated sixty-seven (67) \n        nuclear devices with a total yield of one hundred eight \n        thousand four hundred ninety-two point two (108,492.2) kilotons \n        in or around the Marshall Islands.\n            (3) There were at least ten (10) detonations that had a \n        yield necessary of five (5) to ten (10) megatons to project \n        material from the center of the explosion to the height of \n        between twelve (12) to fifty-five (55) miles into the jet-\n        stream.\n            (4) On October 31, 1952 (GMT), the first true H-Bomb, Ivy \n        Mike was detonated at Elugelab (``Flora'') Island, Enewetak \n        Atoll. The 10.4 megaton device was the fourth largest device \n        ever tested by the United States. The mushroom cloud climbed to \n        57,000 feet in only 90 seconds entering the stratosphere. One \n        minute later it reached 108,000 feet, eventually stabilizing at \n        a ceiling of 120,000 feet. Half an hour after the test, the \n        mushroom stretched sixty (60) miles across, with the base of \n        the mushroom head joining the stem at 45,000 feet.\n            (5) On April 27, 2005, the National Research Council of the \n        National Academies submitted to Congress a report on the \n        Assessment of the Scientific Information for the Radiation \n        Exposure Screening and Education Program.\n            (6) The National Research Council stated in their report on \n        ``ADDITIONAL POPULATIONS ENVIRONMENTALLY AT RISK FOR RADIATION \n        EXPOSURE'', Nuclear Testing: Downwinders and Onsite \n        Participants, that the Committee to Assess the Scientific \n        Information for the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education \n        Program reviewed the locations where nuclear-weapons tests were \n        performed, and that ``The current RECA downwinder population is \n        concentrated in the area around the NTS, and the 1997 NCI 131 I \n        report (NCI, 1997) dealt with emissions from the NTS. In RECA, \n        Congress found that fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests \n        exposed people to radiation that is presumed to have caused an \n        excess of cancer and that this risk was borne by these people \n        to serve the national security interests of the United States. \n        The United States has conducted nuclear-weapons tests in areas \n        other than NTS, and populations exposed to fallout from these \n        tests may also be considered as possible candidates for RECA \n        compensation, if Congress so chooses. The tests in question \n        include the Trinity test near Alamogordo, New Mexico, and the \n        Pacific tests. Onsite participants in the tests are already \n        included under RECA, but RECA coverage may be extended to the \n        downwinder populations in those areas. Over the last several \n        years, there has been a concern about the health effects \n        associated with radioactive fallout that reached Guam during \n        the testing of nuclear weapons in Micronesia. The Pacific \n        Association for Radiation Survivors was formed. In 2002, a blue \n        ribbon panel, authorized by the Government of Guam, submitted \n        the Committee Action Report on Radioactive Contamination in \n        Guam between 1946 and 1958.''.\n            (7) The National Research Council's assessment and \n        recommendation for Guam is stated on page 200 of the \n        ``Assessment of the Scientific Information for the Radiation \n        Exposure Screening and Education Program'', which reads: \n        ``Conclusions. As a result of its analysis, the committee \n        concludes that Guam did receive measurable fallout from \n        atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific. \n        Residents of Guam during that period should be eligible for \n        compensation under RECA in a way similar to that of persons \n        considered to be downwinders.''.\n            (8) In 1974, the Laboratory of Radiation Ecology began a \n        program to determine the radionuclides found in food, plants, \n        animals, and soils of the Central Pacific. As part of this \n        program, the study was undertaken to determine the \n        radionuclides found in common foods and soils in Guam. All \n        samples were analyzed for gamma-emitting radionuclides while \n        some were also analyzed for Strontium 90 or Plutonium 239,240. \n        Cesium 137,210 PB and 235 U were also on the soil on Guam. \n        ``Plants; Most values of 137 Cs were less than 1 pCi/g, but a \n        value of 18. pCi/g was measured in the edible portion of a \n        pandanus fruit from Guam. The inedible portion of this fruit \n        also had a high 137 Cs value, 16 pCi/g.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
