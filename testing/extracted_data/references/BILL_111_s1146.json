FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., a nonprofit corporation \n        described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n        1986 and headquartered in New York, has since 1998 educated and \n        supported the community, law enforcement, criminal justice, and \n        government agencies on issues related to sex offender \n        registration, notification, responsible use of information, \n        sexual abuse and abduction prevention, Internet Safety, and \n        crime victim support.\n            (2) Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., established and operates \n        the National Megan's Law Helpline, a free confidential \n        telephone helpline that provides information, support, and \n        criminal justice referrals, nationally and internationally, on \n        sex offender management issues. Parents for Megan's Law, Inc. \n        is a certified rape crisis center and provides support and \n        assistance to child and adult victims of sexual abuse and all \n        victims of violent crime. Research suggests that sexual assault \n        victims who receive counseling support are more likely to \n        report their attack to the police and participate in the \n        prosecution of the offender.\n            (3) The National Megan's Law Helpline has generated over \n        70,000 requests for assistance, information, or follow-up \n        contacts on sex offender management, crime victim support, and \n        prevention education issues. Helpline requests utilize the \n        Helpline's resources and often entail coordination with outside \n        resources, follow-up calls, or actual referrals to any or all \n        of the following: law enforcement and other criminal justice \n        agencies, state and local crime victims assistance agencies and \n        organizations, social service and human service providers, and \n        other service provider organizations.\n            (4) The Internet website of Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., \n        serves as a clearinghouse and national resource for information \n        related to sex offender registration, notification, sexual \n        abuse and abduction prevention, and crime victims' support and \n        referrals. Such Internet website is also utilized by the public \n        to anonymously report Internet child pornography and child sex \n        tourism and as a resource for Internet Safety education. \n        Reports are forwarded to local law enforcement for appropriate \n        follow-up.\n            (5)(A) With limited resources, the National Megan's Law \n        Helpline has provided the public with a resource for \n        confidentially reporting registered sex offenders failing to \n        comply with registration requirements, supervision, or \n        employment restrictions or who are in positions of trust where \n        potential child victims can be accessed. Confidential tips are \n        triaged, crime victim support is provided, and referrals are \n        made to the appropriate criminal justice agency for follow-up \n        action.\n            (B) In fact, because of anonymous tips to the Helpline, \n        actions have been taken to mitigate potentially dangerous \n        situations, including--\n                    (i) sending a registered sex offender back to \n                prison after he was identified as residing in a \n                registered child day care center where he could access \n                potential child victims;\n                    (ii) preventing a convicted former middle school \n                teacher required to register as a sex offender and give \n                up his teacher's license, from gaining employment as an \n                in home children's tutor for a reputable tutoring \n                company where he could gain unsupervised access to \n                potential child victims;\n                    (iii) having a registered sex offender who targeted \n                a child, and subsequently was barred from using the \n                Internet to develop online relationships, removed from \n                an Internet Dating service where he attempted to \n                develop a relationship with whom he believed was a \n                single woman with children;\n                    (iv) sending a registered sex offender, who was on \n                parole for a weapons charge and restricted from \n                entering school grounds, back to prison for entering \n                school grounds and drug possession;\n                    (v) identifying and reporting a registered sex \n                offender, convicted of sexually victimizing a 4-year-\n                old boy while baby-sitting, who had absconded and \n                failed to register; and\n                    (vi) identifying, locating and reporting registered \n                sex offenders in violation of conditions of probation, \n                parole, local employment or other restriction laws.\n            (6) A national Sex Offender Registration Compliance survey \n        conducted by Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., in 2003, indicated \n        that, 24 percent of (or over 100,000) registered sex offenders \n        were not complying with sex offender registration laws. Sex \n        offender registry information provides parents and community \n        members an opportunity to protect themselves, their children, \n        and their communities from sexual victimization, but that \n        information, in order to be of value, requires labor intensive \n        follow-up intervention and proactive maintenance to be kept \n        current.\n            (7) Access to the National Criminal Information databases \n        is necessary for Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., to effectively \n        evaluate the veracity of tips received, proactively research \n        noncompliant registrants or registrants engaged in criminal \n        activities and provide law enforcement with viable accurate \n        information for follow-up action.\n            (8) The Sex Offender Registration Tips (SORT) Program will \n        reduce sexual victimization and increase sex offender \n        registration compliance through community tips and proactive \n        maintenance.\n            (9) Authorizing federal funds for the SORT Program will \n        reduce criminal sexual victimization by--\n                    (A) supporting crime victims seeking assistance;\n                    (B) supporting sex offender registration, \n                notification, and sexual abuse and abduction prevention \n                education and Internet Safety inquiries; and\n                    (C) providing the public two interactive \n                confidential resources, the Helpline and Internet \n                website, for the public to provide information--\n                            (i) about registered sex offenders who are \n                        believed to be out of compliance with \n                        registration requirements, supervision, or \n                        employment restrictions and who are in \n                        positions of trust where potential child \n                        victims can be accessed; or\n                            (ii) concerning sex offender activities \n                        that indicate a heightened risk of re-\n                        offending.\n            (10)(A) The SORT program will serve as a powerful national \n        tool supporting communities and crime victims while assisting \n        and advancing the mission of Federal, state, and local law \n        enforcement in combating sexual victimization.\n            (B) The SORT program and the National Megan's Law Helpline \n        is unique in the following ways:\n                    (i) It provides up to date sexual abuse prevention \n                information, deters vigilantism, and reinforces \n                responsible use of information.\n                    (ii) It provides victims who come forth with needed \n                information with an infrastructure of advocacy, \n                enforcement, and therapeutic support.\n                    (iii) It maximizes law enforcement's already \n                strained resources by screening anonymous tips promptly \n                and effectively through the use of trained \n                investigators with access to public, private and law \n                enforcement databases.\n\nSEC. 3.
