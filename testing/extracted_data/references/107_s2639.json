FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) every industrialized country in the world except the \n        United States guarantees the fundamental right to health care \n        to all its citizens;\n            (2) more than 40,000,000 Americans are without health \n        insurance coverage;\n            (3) the number of uninsured Americans is growing;\n            (4) the vast majority of uninsured Americans are workers or \n        dependents of workers;\n            (5) lack of health insurance is a major cause of poor \n        access to health care, delayed or substandard treatment, and \n        unnecessary death;\n            (6) for more than half a century, Congress has enacted laws \n        to ensure that work is appropriately rewarded, including laws \n        establishing a minimum wage and a 40 hour work week, laws \n        ensuring safe and healthy working conditions, and laws \n        requiring employers to contribute to the cost of retirement \n        security through Social Security and Medicare;\n            (7) the vast majority of large employers provide health \n        insurance coverage to their employees and the dependents of \n        those employees; and\n            (8) the minority of large employers that do not provide \n        such coverage should be expected to assume this social \n        responsibility.\n\nSEC. 3.
