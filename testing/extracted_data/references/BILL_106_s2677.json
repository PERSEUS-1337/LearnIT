FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Deliberate and systematic violence, intimidation, and \n        killings have been orchestrated and supported by the Government \n        of Zimbabwe and the ruling ZANU-PF party against members, \n        sympathizers, and supporters of the democratic opposition, \n        farmers, and employees. The violence has resulted in death, a \n        breakdown in the rule of law, and further collapse of \n        Zimbabwe's economy.\n            (2) The lawlessness, harassment, violence, intimidation, \n        and killings directed at the opposition and their supporters, \n        farmers and farm employees continues at President Mugabe's \n        explicit and public urging despite two court rulings that the \n        occupations are illegal and must be ended.\n            (3) The breakdown in the rule of law has jeopardized \n        Zimbabwe's future, including international support for programs \n        which provide land ownership for the large number of poor and \n        landless Zimbabweans, other donor programs, economic stability, \n        and direct investment.\n            (4) The orchestrated violence and intimidation directed at \n        opposition supporters has created and fostered an environment \n        which seriously compromises the possibility of free and fair \n        elections.\n            (5) The crisis in Zimbabwe is further exacerbated by the \n        fact that Zimbabwe is spending millions of dollars each month \n        on its involvement in the civil war in the Democratic Republic \n        of Congo. Those resources could finance equitable and \n        transparent land reform, other programs to promote economic \n        growth and alleviate poverty, and programs to combat the spread \n        and effects of the world's highest HIV infection rate.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is therefore the policy of the United \nStates to support the people of Zimbabwe in their struggles to effect \npeaceful, democratic change, achieve broad-based and equitable economic \ngrowth, and restore the rule of law.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE OR DEBT RELIEF.\n\n    (a) Prohibition on Assistance.--Except as provided in subsection \n(b)--\n            (1) no United States assistance may be provided for the \n        Government of Zimbabwe;\n            (2) no indebtedness owed by the Government of Zimbabwe to \n        the United States Government may be canceled or reduced; and\n            (3) the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United \n        States Executive Director to each international financial \n        institution to oppose and vote against--\n                    (A) any extension by the respective institution of \n                any assistance of any kind to the Government of \n                Zimbabwe, except for assistance to meet basic human \n                needs and for good governance; and\n                    (B) any cancellation or reduction of indebtedness \n                owed by the Government of Zimbabwe to that institution.\n    (b) Conditions for Restoration of Eligibility for Assistance and \nDebt Relief.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall apply until the \nPresident certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that--\n            (1) the rule of law has been restored in Zimbabwe, \n        including respect for ownership and title to property held \n        prior to January 1, 2000, freedom of speech and association, \n        and an end to the lawlessness, violence, and intimidation \n        sponsored, condoned, or tolerated by the Government of \n        Zimbabwe, the ruling party, and their supporters or entities;\n            (2) Zimbabwe has held parliamentary elections which are \n        widely accepted by the participating parties and the duly \n        elected are free to assume their offices;\n            (3)(A) Zimbabwe has held a presidential election which is \n        widely accepted by the participating parties and the president-\n        elect is free to assume the duties of the office;
