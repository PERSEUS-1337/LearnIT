FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) private sector business concerns, which are free to \n        respond to the private or public demands of the marketplace, \n        constitute the strength of the American economic system;\n            (2) competitive private enterprises are the most \n        productive, efficient, and effective sources of goods and \n        services;\n            (3) Government competition with the private sector of the \n        economy is detrimental to the American economic system;\n            (4) Government competition with the private sector of the \n        economy is at an unacceptably high level, both in scope and in \n        dollar volume;\n            (5) current law and policy have failed to address \n        adequately the problem of Government competition with the \n        private sector of the economy; and\n            (6) it is in the public interest that the Government \n        establish a consistent policy to rely on the private sector of \n        the economy to provide goods and services necessary for or \n        beneficial to the operation and management of Government \n        agencies and to avoid Government competition with the private \n        sector of the economy.\n\nSEC. 3. PROCUREMENT FROM PRIVATE SOURCES.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nexcept as provided in subsection (b), each agency shall obtain all \ngoods and services necessary for or beneficial to the accomplishment of \nits authorized functions by procurement from private sources.\n    (b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) does not apply to the following \ngoods and services required by an agency:\n            (1) Goods or services that are required by a law enacted \n        after the date of the enactment of this Act to be produced or \n        performed, respectively, by the agency.\n            (2) Any goods or services for which the head of the agency \n        determines and certifies to Congress in accordance with \n        regulations promulgated by the Director of the Office of \n        Management and Budget that--\n                    (A) it is necessary in the interests of national \n                security that the Government produce, manufacture, or \n                provide the goods or services;\n                    (B) the goods or services are so inherently \n                governmental in nature that it is in the public \n                interest to require production or performance, \n                respectively, by Government employees; or\n                    (C) commercial practices are not sufficient to \n                satisfy unique requirements of the agency for the goods \n                or services.\n\nSEC. 4. PROCUREMENTS FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n    In any case in which the head of an agency determines that goods or \nservices required by the agency are so inherently governmental in \nnature that it is in the public interest to require production or \nperformance, respectively, by Government employees, the head of the \nagency shall determine whether the requirements of the agency for such \ngoods or services can be satisfied by a State or local government and, \nif so, shall attempt to procure the goods or services from that source.\n\nSEC. 5.
