FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Emergency medical services play a critically important \n        role in health care, public health, and public safety by \n        frequently providing immediate lifesustaining care and making \n        decisions with limited time and information.\n            (2) Between 1993 and 2003, the population of the United \n        States grew by 12 percent and hospital admissions increased by \n        13 percent, yet emergency department visits rose by more than \n        25 percent during this same period of time, from 90,300,000 \n        visits in 1993 to 113,900,000 visits in 2003.\n            (3) The demand for emergency care in the United States \n        continues to grow at a rapid pace.\n            (4) In 2003, hospital emergency departments received nearly \n        114,000,000 visits, which is more than 1 visit for every 3 \n        people in the United States, however, between 1993 and 2003, \n        the number of emergency departments declined by 425.\n            (5) Many emergency medical services are highly fragmented, \n        overburdened, poorly equipped, and insufficiently prepared for \n        day-to-day operations and response to major disasters.\n            (6) There are more than 6,000 Public Safety Answering \n        Points that receive 9-1-1 calls.\n            (7) These Public Safety Answering Points are often operated \n        by police departments, fire departments, city or county \n        governments, or other local entities, which makes attempts to \n        coordinate efforts between locations very difficult.\n            (8) Regionalized, accountable systems of emergency care \n        show substantial promise in improving the day-to-day system-\n        wide coordination essential to assure that Public Safety \n        Answering Points, emergency medical services organizations, \n        public safety agencies, public health agencies, medical \n        facilities, and others coordinate their activities to ensure \n        that patients receive the appropriate care at the scene, are \n        transported to the most appropriate facility in the shortest \n        time, and receive excellent care at the destination medical \n        facility.\n            (9) Regionalized, accountable systems of emergency care \n        also show promise in management of the special problems of \n        disaster preparation and response, including management of \n        patient surge, tracking of patients, and coordination and \n        allocation of medical resources.\n            (10) While there are potentially substantial benefits to be \n        derived from regionalized, accountable emergency care systems, \n        little is known about the most effective and efficient methods \n        of regional emergency care system development.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to design, implement, \nand evaluate regionalized, comprehensive, and accountable systems of \nemergency care that--\n            (1) support and improve the day-to-day operations and \n        coordination of a regional emergency medical care system;\n            (2) increase disaster preparedness and medical surge \n        capacity;\n            (3) include different models of regionalized emergency care \n        systems, including models for urban and rural communities;\n            (4) can be implemented by private or public entities; and\n            (5) meet quality and accountability standards for the \n        operation of emergency care systems and the impact of such \n        systems on patient outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF REGIONALIZED SYSTEMS FOR EMERGENCY \n              CARE.\n\n    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 314 the following:\n\n``SEC. 315.
