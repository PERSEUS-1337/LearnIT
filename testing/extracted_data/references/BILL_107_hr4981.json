FIRE SAFETY STANDARD.\n\n    The Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.) is \namended--\n            (1) in section 3(a)(1)(B) (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)(1)(B)) by \n        inserting ``, except as provided in section 7A'' before the \n        semicolon; and\n            (2) by adding after section 7 (15 U.S.C. 2056) the \n        following:\n\n                         ``fire safety standard\n\n    ``Sec. 7A. (a) Consumer Product Safety Rule.--Not later than 18 \nmonths after the date of enactment of this section, the Commission \nshall by rule issue a consumer product safety standard for cigarettes \nto reduce the risk of fire. In establishing the standard, the \nCommission shall do the following:\n            ``(1) Use the testing methodology for determining ignition \n        propensity of cigarettes referenced in `Relative Ignition \n        Propensity of Test Market Cigarettes--National Institute of \n        Standards and Technology--NIST Technical Note 1436, January, \n        2001--Appendix D: Cigarette Extinction Method', with the \n        modifications and specifications described in this subsection. \n        Testing shall be conducted on 3 layers of filter paper, as \n        described in the referenced test method. Forty replicate tests \n        shall be required to comprise a complete test trial for each \n        cigarette tested. Test results and the application of pass/fail \n        criteria shall be derived only for complete test trials \n        comprised of at least 40 replicate individual tests.\n            ``(2) Establish the following ignition propensity \n        performance requirement for cigarettes using such methodology: \n        A test failure shall consist of more than 50 percent of the \n        cigarettes tested in a test trial failing to self-extinguish \n        prior to burning the full length of the tobacco column.\n            ``(3) For cigarette designs that cannot be tested using the \n        specified method because of unique or nontraditional \n        characteristics, the Commission shall accept test methods and \n        acceptance criteria that are proposed by manufacturers when the \n        cigarette with unique or nontraditional characteristics is \n        found by the Commission, after review of the application of the \n        test method and acceptance criteria, to have an equivalent or \n        lesser ignition propensity. In establishing the standard for \n        cigarettes, the Commission shall have the authority to regulate \n        the ignition propensity of cigarette paper for roll-your-own \n        tobacco products.\n    ``(b) Revision of Rule.--If the sponsor of the referenced test \nmethod revises it in any material respect, the sponsor shall notify the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission of the revision and the revision may \nbe incorporated in the consumer product safety rule under subsection \n(a) if the Commission determines that such revision is in the public \ninterest. The Commission is also authorized to revise the rule, \nincluding the performance requirements specified in subsection (a)(2), \nin whole or in part, without regard to the referenced test method, if \nit finds that compliance with such revision is technically feasible and \nprovides a higher degree of protection from fire ignited by cigarettes.\n    ``(c) Manufacturers.--Manufacturers of cigarettes shall identify \nfor the Commission any measures the manufacturers will take to meet the \nconsumer product safety standard for cigarettes promulgated by the \nCommission. Based on information that shall be submitted by the \nmanufacturers of cigarettes and other appropriate information available \nto the Commission, the Commission shall determine whether each such \nmeasure does or does not increase the toxicity of cigarettes. No \ncigarette shall be deemed to meet such standard unless the Commission \nhas determined that the measures taken by the manufacturer of such \ncigarette to meet the standard do not increase the toxicity of the \ncigarette.\n    ``(d) Procedures.--The Commission shall promulgate the standard \nunder subsections (a) and (b) in accordance with section 553 of title \n5, United States Code, and shall--\n            ``(1) consult with the National Institute of Standards and \n        Technology, the American Society of Testing and Materials, and \n        the National Fire Protection Association, and seek the advice \n        and expertise of other Federal and State agencies; and\n            ``(2) take into account all findings in the final report to \n        the Congress made by the Commission, in consultation with the \n        Technical Advisory Group established under section 3 of the \n        Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1990 (15 U.S.C. 2054 note), in which \n        it was found that cigarettes with a low ignition propensity are \n        already on the market.\n    ``(e) Stockpiling.--The Commission shall include in the standard a \nprohibition of stockpiling of cigarettes to which such standard will \napply. For purposes of this subsection, the term `stockpiling' means \nthe manufacturing or importing of a cigarette which would not comply \nwith such standard between the date such standard is promulgated under \nsubsection (a) and the date the standard is to take effect at a rate \ngreater than the rate that cigarettes were manufactured or imported for \nthe 1-year period ending on the date such standard was promulgated.\n    ``(f) Inapplicable.--The following shall not apply to the \npromulgation of a standard under subsections (a) and (b):\n            ``(1) Sections 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of this Act.\n            ``(2) Chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code.\n            ``(3) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n        U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\n            ``(4) The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \n        Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-121) and the amendments made by \n        such Act.\n    ``(g) Consumer Product.--The standard promulgated under this \nsection shall be a consumer product safety standard promulgated under \nthis Act. A cigarette shall be deemed a `consumer product' under \nsection 3(a)(1)(B) only for the purpose of enforcing compliance with \nthis section and the standard promulgated under this section and with \nrespect to section 26 of this Act.\n    ``(h) Limit on Jurisdiction.--Except as expressly provided in this \nsection and in section 3(a)(1)(B), the Commission shall have no \njurisdiction over tobacco or tobacco products.\n    ``(i) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n            ``(1) the term `cigarette' has the meaning prescribed by \n        section 3(1) of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising \n        Act (15 U.S.C. 1332(1)); and\n            ``(2) the term `cigarette paper' has the meaning prescribed \n        by section 5702(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n    ``(j) Modification of Law.--Nothing in this Act nor the application \nof this Act to tobacco products shall be construed to modify any \nprovision of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (15 \nU.S.C. 1331 et seq.).\n    ``(k) Effective Date.--The Commission shall prescribe the effective \ndate of the consumer product safety standard promulgated for cigarettes \nexcept that such date shall be at least 180 days and no more than 12 \nmonths after the date of the promulgation of the standard unless the \nCommission, for good cause shown, determines that an earlier effective \ndate is in the public interest.''."
