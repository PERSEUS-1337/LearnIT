FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the ability of the United States to deliver more \n        effective educational services to citizens, especially \n        disadvantaged citizens, is of primary importance to the \n        national and economic security of the United States;\n            (2) fundamental reform is needed in our Nation's \n        educational system in order to release the creative energies of \n        teachers, students, parents, and communities;\n            (3) market forces of competition and choice can have a \n        positive influence in promoting fundamental reform; however, \n        choice is incomplete without the availability of more \n        educational choices for all students, including disadvantaged \n        students and historically underserved students;\n            (4) the exclusive franchise that local educational agencies \n        have traditionally had on the creation of new public schools \n        has served to limit the number and variety of school choices \n        available to parents and students; and\n            (5) public education should be defined by outcomes and \n        requirements that protect and promote the public interest, not \n        solely by the ownership or control of facilities and programs \n        by a local educational agency or other public agency.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) encourage States to offer teachers, parents, and local \n        communities the opportunity to establish new and more effective \n        public schools;\n            (2) provide Federal assistance and flexibility to encourage \n        States to assist teachers, parents, and communities to develop \n        such schools; and\n            (3) provide criteria for States, teachers, parents, and \n        communities to use in establishing new and more effective \n        public schools.\n\nSEC. 4.
