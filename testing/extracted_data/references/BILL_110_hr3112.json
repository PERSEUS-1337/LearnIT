FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Pregnant women who choose to undergo prenatal genetic \n        testing should have access to timely, scientific, and \n        nondirective counseling about the conditions being tested for \n        and the accuracy of such tests, from health care professionals \n        qualified to provide and interpret these tests. Informed \n        consent is a critical component of all genetic testing.\n            (2) A recent, peer-reviewed study and two reports from the \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on prenatal testing \n        found a deficiency in the data needed to understand the \n        epidemiology of prenatally diagnosed conditions, to monitor \n        trends accurately, and to increase the effectiveness of health \n        intervention.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act, after the diagnosis \nof a fetus with Down syndrome or other prenatally diagnosed conditions, \nto--\n            (1) increase patient referrals to providers of key support \n        services for women who have received a positive test diagnosis \n        for Down syndrome, or other prenatally diagnosed conditions, as \n        well as to provide up-to-date, science-based information about \n        life-expectancy, development potential, and quality of life for \n        a child born with Down syndrome or other prenatally diagnosed \n        condition;\n            (2) provide networks of support through a Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention patient and provider outreach \n        program;\n            (3) improve available data by incorporating information \n        directly revealed by prenatal testing into existing State-based \n        surveillance programs for birth defects and prenatally \n        diagnosed conditions; and\n            (4) ensure that patients receive up-to-date, scientific \n        information about the accuracy of the test.\n\nSEC. 3.
