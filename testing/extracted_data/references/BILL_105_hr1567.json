    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Eastern Wilderness Act of 1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. INCLUSION OF AREAS IN WILDERNESS SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Purpose and Intent.--In order to assure that an increasing \npopulation, accompanied by expanding settlement and growing \nmechanization, does not occupy and modify all areas within the United \nStates and its possessions, leaving no lands designated for \npreservation and protection in their natural condition, it is necessary \nto increase and expand the existing wilderness areas in the eastern \nUnited States. These wilderness areas shall be administered for the use \nand enjoyment of the American people in such manner as will leave them \nunimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wilderness, and so as to \nprovide for the protection of these areas, the preservation of their \nwilderness character, and for the gathering and dissemination of \ninformation regarding their use and enjoyment as wilderness. As the \nbulk of wilderness lands exist in the western United States, the \npurpose and intent of this Act is to provide the means to designate \nadditional qualifying lands as wilderness in the eastern United States.\n    (b) Management.--The inclusion of an area of Federal lands in the \nNational Wilderness Preservation System pursuant to this Act \nnotwithstanding, the area shall continue to be managed by the \ndepartment or agency having administrative jurisdiction thereover \nimmediately before its inclusion in the National Wilderness \nPreservation System unless otherwise provided by Act of Congress. If \nthe area was previously private or State land, the area shall be \nmanaged by the department or agency with the largest presence in the \narea.\n    (c) Wilderness.--For purposes of this Act, a wilderness, in \ncontrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the \nlandscape, is recognized as an area where the earth and its community \nof life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does \nnot remain. An area of wilderness is further defined as an area of \nundeveloped Federal, State, or private land retaining its primeval \ncharacter and influence, without permanent improvements or human \nhabitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its \nnatural conditions and which--\n            (1) generally appears to have been affected primarily by \n        the forces of nature, with the imprint of man's work \n        substantially unnoticeable;\n            (2) has outstanding opportunities for solitude or a \n        primitive and unconfined type of recreation;\n            (3) is east of the 100th meridian and has at least 500 \n        acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable \n        its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition;\n            (4) may also contain ecological, geological, or other \n        features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical \n        value; and\n            (5) if significantly trammeled by man, could otherwise \n        qualify as wilderness through natural reclamation.\nFor the purposes of this Act, the term ``natural reclamation'' means a \nprocess whereby, with minimal assistance or interference from man, land \nmay in time, through the natural physical and biological processes of \necological succession, be restored to a state where man's imprint is \nsubstantially unnoticeable.\n    (d) Scope of Act and Relationship to Other Law.--This Act shall \napply only to lands east of the 100th meridian and nothing in this Act \nshall apply to any lands designated as components of the national \nwilderness preservation system before the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY.\n\n    The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior are \nhereby directed to study and inventory all Federal lands of 500 acres \nor greater which are east of the 100th meridian and which qualify as \nwilderness according to the definition of wilderness in section 2(c) \nabove.\n\nSEC. 4. REVIEW.\n\n    (a) Study.--Within 10 years after the date of approval of this Act, \nthe Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior shall \nreview those areas identified as having wilderness characteristics \nduring the inventory required in section 3 and shall from time to time \nreport to the President their recommendation as to the suitability or \nnonsuitability of each such area for preservation as wilderness.\n    (b) Procedure.--\n            (1) The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the \n        Interior shall, prior to submitting any recommendations to the \n        President with respect to the suitability of any area for \n        preservation as wilderness--\n                    (A) give such public notice of the proposed action \n                as they deem appropriate, including publication in the \n                Federal Register and in a newspaper having general \n                circulation in the area or areas in the vicinity of the \n                affected land;\n                    (B) hold a public hearing or hearings at a location \n                or locations convenient to the area affected. The \n                hearings shall be announced through such means as the \n                respective Secretaries involved deem appropriate, \n                including notices in the Federal Register and in \n                newspapers of general circulation in the area: \n                Provided, That if the lands involved are located in \n                more than one State, at least one hearing shall be held \n                in each State in which a portion of the land lies; and\n                    (C) at least 30 days before the date of a hearing, \n                advise the Governor of each State and the governing \n                board of each county in which the lands are located, \n                and Federal departments and agencies concerned, and \n                invite such officials and Federal agencies to submit \n                their views on the proposed action at the hearing or by \n                no later than 30 days following the date of the \n                hearing.\n            (2) Any views submitted to the appropriate Secretary under \n        the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect \n        to any area shall be included with any recommendations to the \n        President and to Congress with respect to such area.\n    (c) Recommendation.--The President shall advise the President of \nthe Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of his \nrecommendations with respect to designation as wilderness of each such \narea, together with a map thereof and a definition of its boundaries. \nSuch advice by the President shall be given within 2 years of the \nreceipt of each report from the Secretaries. A recommendation of the \nPresident for designation as wilderness shall become effective only if \nso provided by an Act of Congress.\n    (d) Management of Study Areas.--During the period of review of such \nareas and until Congress has determined otherwise, the appropriate \nSecretary shall continue to manage such public lands under his \nauthority under this Act and other applicable law in a manner so as not \nto impair the suitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness: \nProvided, That, in managing the public lands the Secretary shall by \nregulation or otherwise take any action required to prevent unnecessary \nor undue degradation of the lands and their resources or to afford \nenvironmental protection. Such lands shall continue to be subject to \nsuch appropriation during the period of review unless withdrawn by the \nSecretary under the procedures of section 204 of the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act of 1976 for reasons other than preservation \nof their wilderness character. Once an area has been designated for \npreservation as wilderness under this Act, the provisions of this Act \nshall apply with respect to the administration and use of such \ndesignated area.\n\nSEC. 5. MANAGEMENT OF WILDERNESS AREAS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided in this Act, each \nagency administering any area designated as wilderness under this Act \nshall be responsible for preserving the wilderness character of the \narea and shall so administer such area for such other purposes for \nwhich it may have been established as also to preserve its wilderness \ncharacter. Except as otherwise provided in this Act, wilderness areas \nshall be devoted to the public purposes of recreational, scenic, \nscientific, educational, conservation, and historical use.\n    (b) Commercial Enterprises, Roads, Structures, Etc.--Except as \nspecifically provided for in this Act, and subject to existing private \nrights, there shall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road \nwithin any wilderness area designated by this Act and, except as \nnecessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the \narea for the purpose of this Act (including measures required in \nemergencies involving the health and safety of persons within the \narea), there shall be no temporary road, no use of motor vehicles, \nmotorized equipment or motorboats, no landing of aircraft, no other \nform of mechanical transport, and no structure or installation within \nsuch area.\n    (c) Special Provisions.--The following special provisions are \nhereby made:\n            (1) Within wilderness areas designated by this Act, the use \n        of aircraft or motorboats, where these uses have already become \n        established, may be permitted to continue subject to such \nrestrictions as the appropriate Secretary deems desirable.
