    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Immigration Services and \nInfrastructure Improvements Act of 2000''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Applications for naturalization have increased \n        dramatically in recent years, outpacing the Immigration and \n        Naturalization Service's ability to process them.\n            (2) The dramatic increase in applications for \n        naturalization and the inability of the Immigration and \n        Naturalization Service to deal with them adequately has \n        resulted in an unacceptably large backlog in naturalization \n        adjudications.\n            (3) The processing times in the Immigration and \n        Naturalization Service's other immigration benefits have been \n        unacceptably long. Applicants for family- and employment-based \n        visas are waiting as long as 3 to 4 years to obtain a visa or \n        an adjustment to lawful permanent resident status.\n            (4) In California, the delays in processing adjustment of \n        status applications have averaged 52 months. In Texas, the \n        delays have averaged 69 months. Residents of New York have had \n        to wait up to 28 months; in Florida, 26 months; in Illinois, 37 \n        months; in Oregon, 31 months; and in Arizona, 49 months. Most \n        other States have experienced unacceptably long processing and \n        adjudication delays.\n            (5) Applicants pay fees to have their applications \n        adjudicated in a timely manner. These fees have increased \n        dramatically in recent years without a commensurate increase in \n        the capability of that Immigration and Naturalization Service \n        to process and adjudicate these cases in an efficient manner.\n            (6) Processing these applications in a timely fashion is \n        critical. Each 12-month delay in adjudicating an adjustment of \n        status application requires the alien to file applications to \n        extend employment authorization to work and advance parole \n        documents to travel.\n            (7) The enormous delays in processing applications for \n        families and businesses have had a negative impact on the \n        reunification of spouses and minor children and the ability of \n        law-abiding and contributing members of our communities to \n        participate fully in the civic life of the United States.\n            (8) United States employers have also experienced \n        debilitating delays in hiring employees who contribute to the \n        economic growth of the United States. These delays have forced \n        employers to send highly skilled and valued employees out of \n        the United States because their immigrant petitions were not \n        approved in a timely fashion. Such disruptions seriously \n        threaten the competitive edge of the United States in the \n        global marketplace.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to--\n            (1) provide the Immigration and Naturalization Service with \n        the mechanisms it needs to eliminate the current backlog in the \n        processing of immigration benefit applications within 1 year \n        after enactment of this Act and to maintain the elimination of \n        the backlog in future years; and\n            (2) provide for regular congressional oversight of the \n        performance of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in \n        eliminating the backlog and processing delays in immigration \n        benefits adjudications.\n    (c) Policy.--It is the sense of Congress that the processing of an \nimmigration benefit application should be completed not later than 180 \ndays after the initial filing of the application, except that a \npetition for a nonimmigrant visa under section 214(c) of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act should be processed not later than 30 \ndays after the filing of the petition.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Backlog.--The term ``backlog'' means, with respect to \n        an immigration benefit application, the period of time in \n        excess of 180 days that such application has been pending \n        before the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n            (2) Immigration benefit application.--The term \n        ``immigration benefit application'' means any application or \n        petition to confer, certify, change, adjust, or extend any \n        status granted under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nSEC. 4. IMMIGRATION SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT ACCOUNT.\n\n    (a) Authority of the Attorney General.--The Attorney General shall \ntake such measures as may be necessary to--\n            (1) reduce the backlog in the processing of immigration \n        benefit applications, with the objective of the total \n        elimination of the backlog not later than one year after the \n        date of enactment of this Act;\n            (2) make such other improvements in the processing of \n        immigration benefit applications as may be necessary to ensure \n        that a backlog does not develop after such date; and\n            (3) make such improvements in infrastructure as may be \n        necessary to effectively provide immigration services.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n            (1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated to \n        the Department of Justice from time to time such sums as may be \n        necessary for the Attorney General to carry out subsection (a).\n            (2) Designation of account in treasury.--Amounts \n        appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1) may be referred to as \n        the ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvements \n        Account''.\n            (3) Availability of funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n        to paragraph (1) are authorized to remain available until \n        expended.\n            (4) Limitation on expenditures.--None of the funds \n        appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1) may be expended until \n        the report described in section 5(a) has been submitted to \n        Congress.\n\nSEC. 5.
