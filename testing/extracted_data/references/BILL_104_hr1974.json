This subclause ceases \n        to apply to the individual upon the individual attaining 65 \n        years of age. This subclause does not apply to the individual \n        if the individual has an impairment that is not expected to \n        improve (or a combination of impairments that are not expected \n        to improve).\n            ``(II) With respect to a determination under subclause (I) \n        of whether the individual continues to be eligible for the \n        benefit (in this clause referred to as a `redetermination'), \n        the Commissioner may not make the redetermination unless the \n        individual submits to the Commissioner an application \n        requesting the redetermination. If such an application is \n        submitted, the Commissioner shall make the redetermination. \n        This subclause is subject to subclause (V).\n            ``(III) If as of the date on which this clause takes effect \n        the individual has been receiving the benefit for three years \n        or less, the first period under subclause (I) for the \n        individual is deemed to end on the expiration of the period \n        beginning on the date on which this clause takes effect and \n        continuing through a number of months equal to 12 plus a number \n        equal to 36 minus the number of months the individual has been \n        receiving the benefit.\n            ``(IV) If as of the date on which this clause takes effect \n        the individual has been receiving the benefit for five years or \n        less, but for more than three years, the first period under \n        subclause (I) for the individual is deemed to end on the \n        expiration of the\n         1-year period beginning on the date on which this clause takes \neffect.\n            ``(V) If as of the date on which this clause takes effect \n        the individual has been receiving the benefit for more than \n        five years, the Commissioner shall make redeterminations under \n        subclause (I) and may not require the individual to submit \n        applications for the redeterminations. The first 3-year period \n        under subclause (I) for the individual is deemed to begin upon \n        the expiration of the period beginning on the date on which \n        this clause takes effect and ending upon the termination of a \n        number of years equal to the lowest number (greater than zero) \n        that can be obtained by subtracting the number of years that \n        the individual has been receiving the benefit from a number \n        that is a multiple of three.\n            ``(VI) If the individual first attains 18 years of age on \n        or after the date on which this clause takes effect, the first \n        3-year period under subclause (I) for the individual is deemed \n        to end on the date on which the individual attains such age.\n            ``(VII) Not later than one year prior to the date on which \n        a determination under subclause (I) expires, the Commissioner \n        shall (except in the case of an individual to whom subclause \n        (V) applies) provide to the individual a written notice \n        explaining the applicability of this clause to the individual, \n        including an explanation of the effect of failing to submit the \n        application. If the individual submits the application not \n        later than 180 days prior to such date and the Commissioner \n        does not make the redetermination before such date, the \n        Commissioner shall continue to provide the benefit pending the \n        redetermination and shall publish in the Federal Register a \n        notice that the Commissioner was unable to make the \n        redetermination by such date.\n            ``(VIII) If the individual fails to submit the application \n        under subclause (II) by the end of the applicable period under \n        subclause (I), the individual may apply for a redetermination. \n        The Commissioner shall make the redetermination for the \n        individual only after making redeterminations for individuals \n        for whom eligibility has not lapsed pursuant to subclause \n        (I).''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) takes \neffect upon the expiration of the 9-month period beginning on the date \nof the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Conforming Repeal.--Section 207 of the Social Security \nIndependence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 1382 note; \n108 Stat. 1516) is hereby repealed.\n\nSEC. 3.

The final rule issued \npursuant to the preceding sentence applies to individuals without \nregard to whether the individuals were receiving benefits under this \ntitle prior to the effective date of such rule.''.\n    (b) Final Regulations.--The final rule for the regulations required \nin subsection (a) shall be issued before the expiration of the 9-month \nperiod beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall \ntake effect upon the expiration of such period."
