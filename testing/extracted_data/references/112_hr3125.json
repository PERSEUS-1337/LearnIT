FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Major earthquakes are likely in the United States. For \n        example, the United States Geological Survey predicts that \n        there is a 99.7 percent chance that a magnitude 6.7 earthquake \n        will strike in California in the next 30 years and that there \n        is a 46 percent chance that a magnitude 7.5 earthquake will \n        strike in California in the next 30 years. Earthquakes can be \n        caused by volcanic or tectonic events and result in destructive \n        shaking of the earth, fires, landslides, volcanic eruptions, \n        and tsunamis.\n            (2) Despite the known risk of earthquakes, relatively few \n        homeowners have earthquake insurance. For example, in \n        California, 88 percent of homes insured for fire do not have \n        earthquake insurance. In the event of a catastrophic \n        earthquake, the lack of homeowner earthquake-insurance coverage \n        will slow recovery, create economic hardship, and increase the \n        risk of mortgage and other credit defaults and adversely affect \n        the Nation's banking system.\n            (3) It is important that States improve the affordability, \n        availability, and quality of earthquake insurance so that more \n        homeowners will purchase coverage. For example, California has \n        created the California Earthquake Authority to provide \n        earthquake insurance to homeowners through private-sector \n        insurers.\n            (4) It is a proper role of the Federal Government to help \n        prepare and protect its citizens from catastrophes such as \n        earthquakes and to facilitate consumer protection, victim \n        assistance, and individual and community recovery, including \n        financial recovery.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to establish a \nprogram--\n            (1) to promote the availability of private capital to \n        provide liquidity and capacity to State earthquake insurance \n        programs; and\n            (2) to expedite the payment of claims under State \n        earthquake insurance programs and better assist the financial \n        recovery from significant earthquakes by authorizing the \n        Secretary of the Treasury to guarantee debt for such purposes.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n            (1) Commitment to guarantee.--The term ``commitment to \n        guarantee'' means a commitment to make debt guarantees to an \n        eligible State program pursuant to section 5.\n            (2) Eligible state program.--The term ``eligible State \n        program'' means a State program that, pursuant to section 4, is \n        eligible to receive a debt guarantee under this Act.\n            (3) Insured loss.--The term ``insured loss'' means any loss \n        resulting from an earthquake, an earthquake-related event, or \n        fire following an earthquake that is determined by an eligible \n        State program as being covered by insurance made available \n        under that eligible State program.\n            (4) Qualifying assets.--The term ``qualifying assets'' \n        means the policyholder surplus of the eligible State program as \n        stated in the most recent quarterly financial statement filed \n        by the program with the domiciliary regulator of the program in \n        the last quarter ending prior to an insured-loss triggering \n        event or events.\n            (5) Residential property insurance.--The term ``residential \n        property insurance'' means insurance coverage for--\n                    (A) individually owned residential structures of \n                not more than 4 dwelling units, individually owned \n                condominium units, or individually owned mobile homes, \n                and their contents, located in a State and used \n                exclusively for residential purposes or a tenant's \n                policy written to include personal contents of a \n                residential unit located in the State, but shall not \n                include--\n                            (i) insurance for real property or its \n                        contents used for any commercial, industrial, \n                        or business purpose, except a structure of not \n                        more than 4 dwelling units rented for \n                        individual residential purposes; or\n                            (ii) a policy that does not include any of \n                        the perils insured against in a standard fire \n                        policy or any earthquake policy; or\n                    (B) commercial residential property, which includes \n                property owned by a condominium association or its \n                members, property owned by a cooperative association, \n                or an apartment building.\n            (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Treasury.\n            (7) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n        States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n        Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern \n        Mariana Islands, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, \n        American Samoa, and any other territory or possession of the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 4.

Such amounts shall not be used for any \n        other purpose.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECT OF GUARANTEE.\n\n    The issuance of any guarantee by the Secretary under this Act shall \nbe conclusive evidence that--\n            (1) the guarantee has been properly obtained;\n            (2) the underlying debt qualified for such guarantee; and\n            (3) the guarantee is valid, legal, and enforceable.\n\nSEC. 7.

BUDGETARY IMPACT; COSTS.\n\n    For purposes of section 502(5) of the Federal Credit Reform Act of \n1990, the cost of guarantees to be issued under this Act shall be \ncalculated by adjusting the discount rate in section 502(5)(E) of such \nAct for market risk.\n\nSEC. 11. REGULATIONS.\n\n    The Secretary shall issue any regulations necessary to carry out \nthe debt-guarantee program established under this Act."
