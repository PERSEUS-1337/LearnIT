FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 21-year civil war between the North and the South \n        in Sudan, which ended with the signing of the Comprehensive \n        Peace Agreement on January 9, 2005, caused many Sudanese people \n        to flee their homes and seek refuge elsewhere in Sudan, in \n        neighboring countries, and even in the United States.\n            (2) Over 10,000 Sudanese boys and girls were separated from \n        their parents during this war and fled on foot to Ethiopia, \n        walking more than 1,000 kilometers on their four-month journey, \n        and then fled again to Kenya to avoid forcible repatriation to \n        Sudan.\n            (3) These Sudanese refugees suffered tremendous hardships \n        during their journey, and hundreds drowned, were eaten by wild \n        animals, killed by military forces, or overcome with \n        dehydration or starvation along the way.\n            (4) Approximately 3,800 of these Sudanese refugees were \n        granted priority resettlement status in the United States. \n        These Sudanese boys and girls are commonly known as the ``Lost \n        Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan''.\n            (5) As is common for refugees, the Lost Boys and Lost Girls \n        of Sudan, upon their arrival in the United States, struggled to \n        adjust to the dramatic change in their surroundings.\n            (6) The story of the Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan has \n        been documented in a number of books and films in the United \n        States.\n            (7) The Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan have acquired a \n        reputation for being a resilient and highly motivated group of \n        individuals, with many of them gaining employment and pursuing \n        higher education simultaneously.\n            (8) Many Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan have publicly \n        expressed their interest in eventually returning to their \n        homeland to contribute to reconstruction efforts following the \n        end of the 21-year civil war in Sudan.\n\nSEC. 3. PROGRAM TO ASSIST SUDANESE REFUGEES IN THE UNITED STATES KNOWN \n              AS THE ``LOST BOYS AND LOST GIRLS OF SUDAN'' TO \n              VOLUNTARILY RETURN TO SOUTHERN SUDAN TO ASSIST IN \n              RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS IN SOUTHERN SUDAN.\n\n    (a) Statement of Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \nestablish a program to assist Sudanese refugees in the United States \nknown as the ``Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan'' to voluntarily \nreturn to southern Sudan to assist in reconstruction efforts in \nsouthern Sudan.\n    (b) Program Required.--From the amount appropriated under \nsubsection (g) for any fiscal year, the Director of Foreign Assistance \nshall, in accordance with subsection (c), establish and carry out a \nprogram to assist Sudanese refugees in the United States known as the \n``Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan'' to voluntarily return to southern \nSudan to assist in reconstruction efforts in southern Sudan.\n    (c) Eligibility Requirements.--An individual shall be eligible to \nparticipate in the program under this section if the individual--\n            (1) is an alien who--\n                    (A) is a national of Sudan;\n                    (B) was admitted to the United States as a refugee \n                under section 207 of the Immigration Nationality Act (8 \n                U.S.C. 1157) from Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, and \n                identified by the Secretary of State under the \n                worldwide refugee application processing priority \n                system as `Priority-2' (P-2), a group of special \n                concern to the United States;
