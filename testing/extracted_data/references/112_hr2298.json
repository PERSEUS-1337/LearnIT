    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Border Health Security Act of \n2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States-Mexico border is an interdependent \n        and dynamic region of 14,538,209 people with significant and \n        unique public health challenges.\n            (2) These challenges include low rates of health insurance \n        coverage, poor access to health care services, and high rates \n        of dangerous diseases, such as tuberculosis, diabetes, and \n        obesity.\n            (3) As the 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1) outbreak \n        illustrates, diseases do not respect international boundaries, \n        therefore, a strong public health effort at and along the \n        United States-Mexico border is crucial to not only protect and \n        improve the health of Americans but also to help secure the \n        United States against biosecurity threats.\n            (4) For 11 years, the United States-Mexico Border Health \n        Commission has served as a crucial bi-national institution to \n        address these unique and truly cross-border health issues.\n            (5) Two initiatives resulting from the United States-Mexico \n        Border Health Commission's work speak to the importance of an \n        infrastructure that facilitates cross border communication at \n        the ground level. First, the Early Warning Infectious Disease \n        Surveillance (EWIDS), started in 2004, surveys infectious \n        diseases passing among border States allowing for early \n        detection and intervention. Second, the Ventanillas de Salud \n        program, allows Mexican consulates, in collaboration with \n        United States nonprofit health organizations, to provide \n        information and education to Mexican citizens living and \n        working in the United States through a combination of Mexican \n        state funds and private grants. This program reaches an \n        estimated 1,500,000 people in the United States.\n            (6) As the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission \n        enters its second decade, and as these issues grow in number \n        and complexity, the Commission requires additional resources \n        and modifications which will allow it to provide stronger \n        leadership to optimize health and quality of life along the \n        United States-Mexico border.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES-MEXICO BORDER HEALTH COMMISSION ACT AMENDMENTS.\n\n    The United States-Mexico Border Health Commission Act (22 U.S.C. \n290n et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) in section 3--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the \n                end;\n                    (B) in paragraph (2), by striking the period and \n                inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(3) to serve as an independent and objective body to both \n        recommend and implement initiatives that solve border health \n        issues'';\n            (2) in section 5--\n                    (A) in subsection (b), by striking ``should be the \n                leader'' and inserting ``shall be the Chair''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Providing Advice and Recommendations to Congress.--A member \nof the Commission may at any time provide advice or recommendations to \nCongress concerning issues that are considered by the Commission. Such \nadvice or recommendations may be provided whether or not a request for \nsuch is made by a member of Congress and regardless of whether the \nmember or individual is authorized to provide such advice or \nrecommendations by the Commission or any other Federal official.'';\n            (3) by redesignating section 8 as section 13;\n            (4) by striking section 7 and inserting the following:\n\n``SEC. 7.
