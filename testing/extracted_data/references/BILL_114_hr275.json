SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) properly conducted intercollegiate athletic programs \n        contribute to the beneficial development of student athletes \n        and the vibrancy of campus life at institutions of higher \n        education;\n            (2) recent events pose grave threats to the financial \n        stability of athletic programs at institutions of higher \n        education and create pressure on institutions of higher \n        education to consider eliminating non-revenue Olympic sports or \n        increasing general fund, student fee, and donor subsidies to \n        athletics at a time when such resources are needed for priority \n        academic programs;\n            (3) there are concerns about the health and safety needs of \n        student athletes with regard to adequacy of injury protections \n        and other medical protocols;\n            (4) academic integrity at institutions of higher education \n        is threatened by increased incidences of academic fraud \n        involving student athletes, failure to provide adequate \n        remedial programs for academically unprepared admitted \n        athletes, and excessive athletics time demands;\n            (5) student athletes faced with loss of financial aid and \n        other benefits and National Collegiate Athletic Association \n        (NCAA) member institutions in danger of financial penalties, \n        loss of media rights, and public embarrassment due to alleged \n        rules violations are not being afforded adequate due process;\n            (6) the NCAA, member institutions of the NCAA, and college \n        presidents have not adequately addressed these issues; and\n            (7) reform is so complex and important to higher education \n        that a blue ribbon commission of sport experts and members of \n        Congress should be convened to objectively study these issues \n        and propose solutions.\n\nSEC. 2.
