FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) according to the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service, in 2001, 82,000,000 individuals in the United States \n        aged 16 years and older participated in wildlife-related \n        recreation, including 48,000,000 individuals who hunted, and \n        more than 66,000,000 who engaged in wildlife-related recreation \n        such as observing, feeding, or photographing wildlife, in the \n        United States;\n            (2) individuals who participated in wildlife-related \n        activities in 2001 spent--\n                    (A) an estimated $56,000,000,000 on hunting and \n                fishing equipment and supplies; and\n                    (B) more than $28,000,000,000 on food, lodging, and \n                transportation;\n            (3) purchases of hunting and fishing licenses, permits, and \n        stamps and excise taxes on goods used by hunters and fishers \n        have generated billions of dollars for wildlife conservation, \n        research, and management;\n            (4) the growing public demand for hunting and fishing \n        opportunities accessible to the public is increasingly \n        constrained by the limits on both public and private land \n        resources;\n            (5) recreational hunting and fishing--\n                    (A) provide essential funding sources for--\n                            (i) wildlife habitat development;\n                            (ii) the conservation of wildlife;\n                            (iii) the preservation of ecosystems; and\n                            (iv) effective wildlife management; and\n                    (B) contribute to the reduction of conflicts \n                between people and wildlife;\n            (6) limited public access on private land has often \n        frustrated and disappointed hunters, fishers, and other \n        naturalists and undermined the relationship between land owners \n        and the general public;\n            (7) 21 States and several tribal governments have \n        established successful but modest walk-in programs to encourage \n        public hunting on private farm, ranch, and forest land, yet the \n        demand for such voluntary access programs remains largely \n        unfulfilled;\n            (8) traditional agricultural production methods and markets \n        have in recent years offered limited income opportunities for \n        farm, ranch and forest land owners and operators; and\n            (9) current proposals to reform world agricultural trade \n        favor the development of new methods to support the income of \n        agricultural producers that have minimal impact on agricultural \n        production and prices.\n\nSEC. 3.
