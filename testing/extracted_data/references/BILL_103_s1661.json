REFERENCE.\n\n    Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms \nof an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provisions, the \nreference shall be considered to be made to a section or other \nprovision of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. \n651 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the absence of uniform warnings for personal protective \n        equipment for occupational use risks causes confusion among \n        employers and their employees concerning the proper use and \n        limitations of such equipment and increases worker exposure to \n        workplace injuries and illnesses from lack of proper worker \n        training and consequent misuse of such equipment; and\n            (2) the absence of Federal standards specifying warnings \n        for personal protective equipment for occupational uses leaves \n        questions as to the adequacy of such warnings to be determined \n        by different and frequently inconsistent State requirements, \n        prohibitions, and court decisions, placing an undue burden on \n        interstate commerce in such equipment.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) increase workplace safety by enhancing employer and \n        employee understanding of the proper use and limits of personal \n        protective equipment for occupational use through occupational \n        safety and health standards that establish specific coherent \n        and effective uniform warnings for such equipment; and\n            (2) expressly preempt the application of any State \n        standards, requirements, or prohibitions, whether established \n        by statute, regulation, court decisions or otherwise, in any \n        determination of the adequacy of such uniform warnings.\n\nSEC. 5. UNIFORM WARNINGS FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR \n              OCCUPATIONAL USE.\n\n    Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new subsection:\n    ``(h)(1) Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of \nthis subsection, the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of \nthe National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, shall issue a \nfinal regulation establishing, as occupational safety and health \nstandards, uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for \noccupational use.\n    ``(2) For purposes of this Act--\n            ``(A) the term `personal protective equipment' means \n        equipment intended for use by workers in a workplace subject to \n        this Act to protect the eyes, face, head, hearing, extremities, \n        or respiratory tract from workplace hazards or to function as \n        protective clothing, as a protective shield or barrier, as \n        personal fall arrest or ladder safety devices, or as safety and \n        health monitoring and instrumentation devices; and\n            ``(B) the term `warning' means any statement that--\n                    ``(i) directs or describes one or more actions, \n                procedures, or prohibitions relating to the use of \n                personal protective equipment; and\n                    ``(ii) if not complied with, may result in personal \n                injury or death to the user of the equipment.\n    ``(3) Each standard promulgated under paragraph (1) shall prescribe \nthe full text of each warning described in such paragraph and the means \nby which the manufacturer or other seller of the personal protective \nequipment shall communicate each such warning to the employer using \nsuch equipment.\n    ``(4) Each standard issued under paragraph (1) for personal \nprotective equipment shall--\n            ``(A) require the employer to communicate each prescribed \n        warning to each employee using the personal protective \n        equipment, and to train, educate and instruct each such \n        employee in--\n                    ``(i) the proper use of such personal protective \n                equipment;\n                    ``(ii) how each such warning applies in such \n                employer's workplace and such employee's work \n                environment; and\n                    ``(iii) the consequences of failing to observe each \n                such warning;\n            ``(B) become effective 6 months after the date on which \n        such standards is published in the Federal Register; and\n            ``(C) exempt from coverage under such standard warnings for \n        personal protective equipment placed in interstate commerce by \n        its manufacturer before the date such standard becomes \n        effective unless such manufacturer or other seller of such \n        equipment communicates the prescribed warnings to the employer \n        using the equipment as required in such standard.\n    ``(5) The Secretary, in promulgating standards pursuant to \nparagraph (1), shall consider such factors as the experience of \nmanufacturers using particular warnings and the means of communication \nof such warnings, as well as the opinions of workers, human factors \nexperts, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and \nother experts as to the effectiveness of such warnings and respective \nmeans of communication.
