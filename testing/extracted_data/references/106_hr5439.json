PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to end support by the taxpayers of the \nUnited States of Federal Government contractors that violate the trust \nof such taxpayers through repeated civil judgments or criminal \nconvictions for certain offenses.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Taxpayer dollars should not be used to support \n        individuals or entities who repeatedly violate laws regarding \n        Federal contracting and the trust of taxpayers, thus putting \n        the integrity of future contracts at risk.\n            (2) The Federal Acquisition Regulation already requires \n        bidders on Federal contracts to disclose honestly the existence \n        of indictments, charges, convictions, or civil judgments \n        against such bidders.\n            (3) The Federal Acquisition Regulation also requires \n        contracting officers to make a determination regarding the \n        responsibility of a potential contractor prior to awarding a \n        contract to ensure that the potential contractor has a \n        satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics and a \n        satisfactory performance record.\n            (4) Regardless of the number or seriousness of convictions \n        or civil judgments against a potential contractor, however, the \n        Federal Acquisition Regulation provides Federal agencies wide \n        discretion in determining whether to initiate suspension or \n        debarment procedures. There is currently no maximum number of \n        convictions above which an entity or individual becomes \n        ineligible for future contract awards.\n\nSEC. 4. EXPANDED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR BIDDERS ON FEDERAL \n              CONTRACTS.\n\n    A contracting officer for a Federal contract shall require any \npotential contractor who has disclosed the existence of an indictment, \ncharge, conviction, or civil judgment under section 94.409(a) of the \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (or any successor provision) to submit \ninformation regarding the number of convictions or civil judgments \nentered against the potential contractor, the nature of the offenses, \nand whether any fines, penalties, or damages were assessed.\n\nSEC. 5. LIMITATION ON AWARD OF FUTURE CONTRACTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--No Federal contract for the procurement of \nproperty or services may be awarded to any individual or entity against \nwhom a total of three or more convictions or civil judgments have been \nentered after the date of the enactment of this Act for any of the \nfollowing:\n            (1) Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection \n        with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, \n        State, or local government contract or subcontract.---\n            (2) Violation of a Federal or State antitrust statute \n        relating to the submission of offers for Federal contracts.\n            (3) Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, \n        falsification or destruction of records, making false \n        statements, or receiving stolen property in connection with \n        obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, State \n        or local government contract or subcontract.\n    (b) Applicability.--This section shall apply with respect to a \ncontract awarded on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Length of Prohibition; Report.--The prohibition on the award of \na contract under this section shall terminate after a period of three \nyears beginning on the date that the most recent conviction or civil \njudgment has been entered against the potential contractor if--\n            (1) during such three-year period, the potential contractor \n        demonstrates a satisfactory record of ethics and integrity by \n        avoiding additional criminal convictions or civil judgments \n        regarding the offenses described in subsection (a);\n            (2) the potential contractor submits to the Director of the \n        Office of Management and Budget a report on the steps that have \n        been taken by the potential contractor (such as changes in \n        company policy, personnel, or procedures) to prevent future \n        violations; and\n            (3) the Director certifies that the steps taken are \n        satisfactory.\n    (d) Additional Offenses.--If an individual or entity who has been \nprohibited from being awarded a Federal contract under subsection (a) \nhas a conviction or civil judgment for an offense described in \nsubsection (a) entered against the individual or entity after the \ntermination of the three-year period described in subsection (c), such \nindividual or entity shall be prohibited from being awarded a Federal \ncontract for an additional three years.\n\nSEC. 6. PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER.\n\n    (a) Authority.--The President may waive the application of section \n5 if the President determines that--\n            (1) such a waiver is in the interests of national security; \n        or\n            (2) the need for the property or services to be acquired \n        under the contract is of such an unusual and compelling urgency \n        that the Federal Government would be seriously injured if the \n        application of such section is not waived.\n    (b) Waiting Period.--The President may not exercise the waiver \nauthority of this section until 45 days after the date that the \nPresident submits to Congress in writing a justification for such \nwaiver.\n\nSEC. 7.
