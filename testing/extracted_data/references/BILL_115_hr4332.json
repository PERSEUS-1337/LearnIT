FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Grand juries are typically used as the process by which \n        allegations of police misconduct are prosecuted.\n            (2) There exists a symbiotic relationship between local \n        prosecutors and the law enforcement officers who regularly \n        testify in routine grand jury investigations.\n            (3) The closeness of this relationship creates public \n        suspicion that accused police officers receive preferential \n        consideration from grand juries when they are subject to grand \n        jury investigations.\n            (4) Police officers have the right to appear before the \n        grand jury investigating allegations of wrongdoing by said \n        officer, and give testimony not subject to a thorough cross \n        examination.\n            (5) Grand jury proceedings are by law secret proceedings.\n            (6) The secret grand jury process has historically resulted \n        in a refusal to indict when the subject of their investigation \n        is a local law enforcement officer.\n            (7) The recent grand jury proceedings following the deaths \n        of Michael Brown and Eric Garner have followed historical \n        tradition, ending with a refusal to indict the law enforcement \n        officers involved in their deaths.\n            (8) The American people have lost confidence in the \n        secretive grand jury process when it is used to evaluate \n        allegations of police misconduct.\n            (9) The loss of confidence in our system of justice leads \n        to the undermining of the principles of equality and justice \n        upon which this country was founded.\n            (10) Preliminary hearings are often replaced with direct \n        presentments, whereby the prosecutor may send a case directly \n        to the grand jury without a public preliminary hearing.\n\nSEC. 3. HEARING BEFORE A JUDGE REQUIRED.\n\n    (a) Receipt of Grant Funds.--In order for a State or unit of local \ngovernment in a State to be eligible to receive Federal funding under \nsubpart 1 of part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.), the State shall comply \nwith the requirements of this section.\n    (b) Notification Requirements.--\n            (1) Notification to prosecutor.--In the case of a law \n        enforcement officer of a local law enforcement agency who uses \n        deadly force against a person in the course of the officer's \n        employment, and thereby causes the death of that person, not \n        later than 24 hours after the death occurs, the chief officer \n        of the law enforcement agency of the locality in which the \n        death occurred shall report the death to the elected prosecutor \n        of that locality.\n            (2) Notification to governor.--Not later than 24 hours \n        after receiving notice under paragraph (1), the elected \n        prosecutor of the locality in which the death occurred shall \n        report the death to the Governor of that State.\n    (c) Hearing Requirement; Appointment of Special Prosecutor.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 3 days after receiving \n        notice under subsection (b)(2), the Governor of the State in \n        which the death occurred shall appoint a special prosecutor to \n        present evidence on behalf of the State at a hearing before a \n        judge in the appropriate court, in order to determine whether \n        probable cause exists for the State to bring criminal charges \n        against the law enforcement officer relating to the death of \n        the person, which determination shall be made by the judge. The \n        Governor shall use a random process to select the special \n        prosecutor from among all of the elected prosecutors in the \n        State, excluding the elected prosecutor of the locality in \n        which the death occurred.\n            (2) Timing.--The hearing described in paragraph (1) shall \n        be held not later than 90 days after the appointment of the \n        special prosecutor, unless the judge determines that good cause \n        exists to delay the hearing.\n            (3) Court to remain open to the public.--Except as \n        determined appropriate by the presiding judge, in a hearing \n        described in paragraph (1), the court shall remain open to the \n        public, and upon scheduling the hearing the judge shall provide \n        notice to the public of the date, time, and location of the \n        hearing.\n    (d) State Law Enforcement Agency To Have Exclusive Authority Over \nInvestigation.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 24 hours after receiving \n        notice under subsection (b)(2), the Governor shall report the \n        death to the chief officer of the State law enforcement agency \n        of the State in which the death occurred, and the State law \n        enforcement agency shall assume exclusive control of the \n        investigation of the death during the pendency of the probable \n        cause hearing.\n            (2) Cooperation of local law enforcement agency.--The chief \n        officer of the law enforcement agency of the locality in which \n        the death occurred shall cooperate with the special prosecutor \n        and the chief officer of the State law enforcement agency by \n        responding promptly to requests for information related to the \n        death.\n    (e) Written Determination of Probable Cause.--Not later than 5 days \nafter the conclusion of a hearing described in subsection (c), the \njudge presiding over the hearing shall issue the determination \ndescribed in subsection (c) in writing, and shall submit such \ndetermination to the elected prosecutor of the locality in which the \ndeath occurred.
