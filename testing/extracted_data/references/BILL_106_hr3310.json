FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Congress finds that it is necessary to take \nappropriate actions to address the comprehensive treatment of sewage \nemanating from the Tijuana River in order to substantially reduce river \nand ocean pollution in the San Diego border region.\n    (b) Factors.--Congress bases the finding under subsection (a) on \nthe following factors:\n            (1) The San Diego border region is adversely impacted from \n        cross border raw sewage flows that affect the environment and \n        the health and safety of citizens in the United States and \n        Mexico.\n            (2) The United States and Mexico have agreed, pursuant to \n        the Treaty for the Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and \n        Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande, dated February 3, 1944, \n        ``to give preferential attention to the solution of all border \n        sanitation problems''.\n            (3) The United States and Mexico recognize the need for \n        utilization of reclaimed water to supply the growing needs of \n        the City of Tijuana, Mexico, and the entire border region.\n            (4) Current legislative authority regarding funding of the \n        IWTP limits the geographic scope of proposed options for \n        treatment of effluent from the IWTP.\n            (5) This Act provides authority to take action to address \n        the comprehensive treatment of sewage emanating from the \n        Tijuana River in order to substantially reduce river and ocean \n        pollution in the San Diego border region and to exploit \n        effective reclamation opportunities.\n\nSEC. 3.
