FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) certain scattered parcels of Federal land located \n        within Gilpin County, Colorado, are currently administered by \n        the Secretary of the Interior as part of the Royal Gorge \n        Resource Area, Canon City District, United States Bureau of \n        Land Management;\n            (2) these land parcels, comprised of approximately 130 \n        separate tracts of land ranging in size from approximately 38 \n        acres to much less than an acre, have been identified as \n        suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management through \n        its resource management planning process and are appropriate \n        for disposal; and\n            (3) even though these land parcels are scattered and small \n        in size, they nevertheless appear to have a fair market value \n        which may be used by the Federal Government to exchange for \n        lands which will better lend themselves to Federal management \n        and have higher values for future public access, use and \n        enjoyment, recreation, the protection and enhancement of fish \n        and wildlife and fish and wildlife habitat, and the protection \n        of riparian lands, wetlands, scenic beauty and other public \n        values.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to authorize, direct, \nfacilitate and expedite the land exchange set forth herein in order to \nfurther the public interest by disposing of Federal lands with limited \npublic utility and acquire in exchange therefor lands with important \nvalues for permanent public management and protection.\n\nSEC. 2. LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The exchange directed by this Act shall be \nconsummated if within 90 days after enactment of this Act, Lake Gulch, \nInc., a Colorado corporation (as defined in section 4 of this Act), \noffers to transfer to the United States pursuant to the provisions of \nthis Act the offered lands or interests in land described herein.\n    (b) Conveyance by Lake Gulch.--Subject to the provisions of section \n3 of this Act, Lake Gulch shall convey to the Secretary of the Interior \nall right, title, and interest in and to the following offered lands:\n            (1) Certain lands comprising approximately 40 acres with \n        improvements thereon located in Larimer County, Colorado, and \n        lying within the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National Park as \n        generally depicted on a map entitled ``Circle C Church Camp'', \n        dated August 1994, which shall upon their acquisition by the \n        United States and without further action by the Secretary of \n        the Interior be incorporated into Rocky Mountain National Park \n        and thereafter be administered in accordance with the laws, \n        rules and regulations generally applicable to the National Park \n        System and Rocky Mountain National Park.\n            (2) Certain lands located along the Arkansas River in Lake \n        County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 517 acres, as \n        generally depicted on a map entitled ``Arkansas River \n        Headwaters Frontage'', dated August 1994.\n            (3) Certain lands located within and adjacent to the United \n        States Bureau of Land Management San Luis Resource Area in \n        Conejos County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 3,993 \n        acres and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Quinlan \n        Ranches Tract'', dated August 1994.\n    (c) Substitution of Lands.--If one or more of the precise offered \nland parcels identified above is unable to be conveyed to the United \nStates due to appraisal or other problems, Lake Gulch and the Secretary \nmay mutually agree to substitute therefor alternative offered lands \nacceptable to the Secretary.\n    (d) Conveyance by the United States.--(1) Upon receipt of title to \nthe lands identified in subsection (a) the Secretary shall \nsimultaneously convey to Lake Gulch all right, title, and interest of \nthe United States, subject to valid existing rights, in and to the \nfollowing selected lands:\n            (A) Certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n        Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n        Meridian, Section 18, Lots 118-220, which comprise \n        approximately 195 acres and are intended to include all \n        federally owned lands in section 18, as generally depicted on a \n        map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July 1994.\n            (B) Certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n        Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n        Meridian, Section 17, Lots 37, 38, 39, 40, 52, 53, and 54, \n        which comprise approximately 96 acres, as generally depicted on \n        a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July 1994.\n            (C) Certain unsurveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n        Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 73 West, Sixth Principal \n        Meridian, Section 13, which comprise approximately 10 acres, \n        and are generally depicted as parcels 307-326 on a map entitled \n        ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July 1994: Provided, \n        however, That a parcel or parcels of land in section 13 shall \n        not be transferred to Lake Gulch if at the time of the proposed \n        transfer the parcel or parcels are under formal application for \n        transfer to a qualified unit of local government. Due to the \n        small and unsurveyed nature of such parcels proposed for \n        transfer to Lake Gulch in section 13, and the high cost of \n        surveying such small parcels, the Secretary is authorized to \n        transfer such section 13 lands to Lake Gulch without survey \n        based on such legal or other description as he determines \n        appropriate to carry out the basic intent of the map cited in \n        this subparagraph.\n    (2) If the Secretary and Lake Gulch mutually agree, and the \nSecretary determines it is in the public interest, the Secretary may \nutilize the authority and direction of this Act to transfer to Lake \nGulch lands in sections 17 and 13 that are in addition to those precise \nselected lands shown on the maps cited in paragraphs (d)(1)(B) and \n(d)(1)(C), and which are not under formal application for transfer to a \nqualified unit of local government, upon transfer to the Secretary of \nadditional offered lands acceptable to the Secretary or upon payment to \nthe Secretary by Lake Gulch of cash equalization money amounting to the \nfull appraised fair market value of any such additional lands. If any \nsuch additional lands are located in section 13 they may be transferred \nto Lake Gulch without survey based on such legal or other description \nas the Secretary determines appropriate as long as the Secretary \ndetermines that the boundaries of any adjacent lands now owned by Lake \nGulch can be properly identified so as to avoid possible future \nboundary conflicts or disputes. If the Secretary determines surveys are \nnecessary to convey any such additional lands to Lake Gulch, the costs \nof such surveys shall be paid by Lake Gulch but shall not be eligible \nfor any adjustment in the value of such additional lands pursuant to \nsection 206(f)(2) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 \n(as amended by the Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 1988) (43 \nU.S.C. 1716(f)(2)).\n    (3) Prior to transferring out of public ownership pursuant to this \nAct or other authority of law any lands which are contiguous to North \nClear Creek southeast of the City of Black Hawk, Colorado, in the \nCounty of Gilpin, Colorado, the Secretary shall notify and consult with \nthe governments of the County and the City and afford such units of \nlocal government an opportunity to acquire or reserve pursuant to the \nFederal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 or other applicable law \nsuch easements or rights-of-way parallel to North Clear Creek as may be \nnecessary to serve public utility line or recreation path needs: \nProvided, however, That any survey or other costs associated with the \nacquisition or reservation of such easements or rights-of-way shall be \npaid for by the unit or units of local government concerned.\n\nSEC. 3.
