CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) while there is a pressing need to serve homeless \n        families and individuals, the program of the Department of \n        Housing and Urban Development for disposition of single family \n        properties for use by the homeless is ineffective;\n            (2) Federal housing programs for the homeless must serve \n        homeless families and individuals at a reasonable cost to \n        taxpayers; and\n            (3) the single family property disposition program for the \n        homeless is poorly designed and administered, drains critical \n        human and financial resources from the Department of Housing \n        and Urban Development, is fraught with abuse and fraud, and, \n        therefore, is a poor use of taxpayer assets.\n\nSEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF LEASE OPTIONS.\n\n    In carrying out the disposition program (as such term is defined in \nsection 6), the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may not \ndispose of eligible properties--\n            (1) by lease with an option to purchase; or\n            (2) to any applicant for an acquisition grant under the \n        supportive housing program under any agreement that provides \n        for the lease of the property (including any lease-option to \n        purchase agreement).\n\nSEC. 4. DISCOUNTS FOR PURCHASE OF PROPERTIES.\n\n    In selling any property under the disposition program, the purchase \nprice shall be the fair market value of the property, less a discount, \nas follows:\n            (1) Insured sales and sales under supportive housing lease-\n        option to purchase agreements.--In the case of any property \n        made available for purchase with mortgage insurance available \n        under the National Housing Act or any property purchased \n        pursuant to a lease-option to purchase agreement entered into \n        before the date of the enactment of this Act by an applicant \n        for an acquisition grant under the supportive housing program, \n        the discount shall be--\n                    (A) 10 percent, for any property sold in a single \n                transaction involving not more than 4 properties;\n                    (B) 15 percent, for any property sold in a single \n                transaction involving 5 or more properties; or\n                    (C) notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), 30 \n                percent, for any property located in a revitalization \n                area.\n            (2) Uninsured sales.--\n                    (A) In general.--In the case of any uninsurable \n                property, the discount shall be--\n                            (i) 20 percent, for any property sold in a \n                        single transaction involving not more than 4 \n                        properties;\n                            (ii) 25 percent, for any property sold in a \n                        single transaction involving 5 or more \n                        properties; or\n                            (iii) notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and \n                        (B), 40 percent, for any property located in a \n                        revitalization area.\n                    (B) Uninsurable properties.--For purposes of \n                subparagraph (A), the term ``uninsurable property'' \n                means an eligible property that--\n                            (i) is made available for purchase without \n                        any mortgage insurance under the National \n                        Housing Act;\n                            (ii) is not a property purchased pursuant \n                        to a lease-option to purchase agreement entered \n                        into before the date of the enactment of this \n                        Act by an applicant for an acquisition grant \n                        under the supportive housing program; and\n                            (iii) if purchased by a private nonprofit \n                        organization, is purchased subject to such \n                        binding agreements as the Secretary shall \nrequire to ensure that the property is used to provide housing for \nhomeless persons for a period of not less than 5 years.\n\nSEC. 5.
