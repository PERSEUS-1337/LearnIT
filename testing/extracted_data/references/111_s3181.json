FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Motor vehicle owners are entitled to choose which \n        service provider will diagnose, service, maintain, or repair \n        their motor vehicles.\n            (2) Promoting competition in price and quality for the \n        diagnosis of problems, service, maintenance, and repair of \n        motor vehicles will benefit consumers.\n            (3) Regular diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair of \n        motor vehicles, motor vehicle equipment, and motor vehicle \n        systems, such as pollution control, transmission, antilock \n        brakes, electronic and mechanical systems, heating, air-\n        conditioning, and steering are essential to facilitating United \n        States mobility, minimizing fuel consumption, protecting the \n        environment, and enabling the highest possible levels of safety \n        in modern motor vehicles.\n            (4) Various kinds of computers have been integrated by \n        manufacturers into motor vehicle equipment and motor vehicle \n        systems. On-board computer technology controls virtually all of \n        the motor vehicle's systems, and only service technicians with \n        the necessary tools and information can access the computers to \n        perform diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair of the \n        motor vehicle.\n            (5) Manufacturers have provided their authorized dealers \n        and service providers with the information, tools, codes, and \n        replacement equipment necessary to diagnose problems and to \n        service, maintain, and repair motor vehicles that incorporate \n        computers in their motor vehicle systems.\n            (6) Consumers in the United States have benefitted from the \n        availability of a wide choice of service providers for their \n        motor vehicles. The United States economy has also benefitted \n        from the availability of a tools and parts supply aftermarket \n        that provides jobs to more than 5,000,000 workers in \n        approximately 495,000 businesses, and generates approximately \n        $200,000,000,000 in annual sales.\n            (7) New motor vehicles are being equipped with systems that \n        permit such vehicles to transmit repair and diagnostic \n        information wirelessly to the vehicle manufacturer and repair \n        facilities. Car owners have the right to choose where and to \n        whom information generated by their vehicle and vehicle \n        computers is sent.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect the rights of motor vehicle owners to choose \n        a service provider for the diagnosis, service, maintenance, and \n        repair of their motor vehicles;\n            (2) to promote competition in price and quality among \n        service providers; and\n            (3) to promote safety and fuel efficiency by allowing \n        consumers to choose among competing service providers.\n\nSEC. 3.
