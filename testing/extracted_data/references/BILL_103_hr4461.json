FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the workplace in the United States is becoming the most \n        diverse workplace in the world at a time of growing economic \n        dissatisfaction and intense global competition;\n            (2) people of color, caucasian women, and immigrants will \n        account for 85 percent of the net growth in our Nation's labor \n        force during the 1990s;\n            (3) the expectations, characteristics, demands, beliefs, \n        work values, motivating factors, and educational backgrounds of \n        individuals in the workforce are becoming increasingly diverse;\n            (4) employees, managers, administrators, and government \n        officials are inadequately prepared to deal effectively with \n        increased diversity in the workforce;\n            (5) increased domestic and international competition \n        requires that business, industry, and government leaders \n        effectively motivate and manage this diverse workforce;\n            (6) as more parents join the workforce, it has become \n        increasingly difficult for employees to balance the demands of \n        the workplace with the needs of families; and\n            (7) by understanding and valuing diversity which respects \n        differences, employers emphasize creativity, self initiative, \n        leadership, innovation, and team-work, and thereby improve the \n        working conditions of all individuals in the United States and \n        the chances for economic success.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a grant \nprogram within the Department of Labor to--\n            (1) study and address issues relating to workforce and \n        cultural diversity and their impact on economic \n        competitiveness, employment opportunities, advancement and \n        retention; and\n            (2) develop collaborative public and private sector \n        education and training materials that address the issues of \n        workforce and cultural diversity.\n\nSEC. 3.
