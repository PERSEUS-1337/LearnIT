FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) North Korea continues to develop a ballistic missile \n        and nuclear weapons program, despite numerous United States and \n        international sanctions, including United Nations Security \n        Council Resolutions 1695, 1718, 1874, 2087, 2094, and 2270, \n        among others.\n            (2) North Korea tested its fifth and largest nuclear device \n        on September 9, 2016.\n            (3) North Korea has increased the pace of its missile \n        testing, including the test of a submarine-launched ballistic \n        missile, potentially furthering the development of a second-\n        strike capability.\n            (4) North Korea has persistently demonstrated an \n        unwillingness to meaningfully negotiate with the United States \n        regarding denuclearization.\n            (5) By its actions and continued investments in its nuclear \n        program, it is clear that the Government of North Korea has no \n        intention to reduce or eliminate its nuclear weapons program.\n            (6) Specialized financial messaging services allow for \n        messaging and contact, including the transfer of funds, between \n        financial institutions.\n            (7) The Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of \n        Korea and certain other financial institutions are currently \n        able to avail themselves to financial messaging systems which \n        could be used in funding the North Korean nuclear program.\n            (8) Experts link North Korea to the hacking of specialized \n        financial messaging institutions, resulting in the theft of \n        $81,000,000 from the central bank of Bangledesh.\n            (9) North Korean provocations continue to endanger its \n        citizens, those of United States allies, and those of \n        Americans.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) providers of specialized financial messaging services \n        are a critical link to the international financial system;\n            (2) directly providing specialized financial messaging \n        services to, or enabling or facilitating direct or indirect \n        access to such messaging services for, any financial \n        institution is inconsistent with paragraph 11 of the United \n        Nations Security Council Resolution 2094; and\n            (3) the United States reaffirms its commitment to its \n        allies in the region, including the Republic of Korea and \n        Japan, which are directly threatened by North Korea.\n\nSEC. 4.
