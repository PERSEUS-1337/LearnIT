FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The American people abhor torture and the use of \n        atrocities by repressive governments. The existence of torture \n        creates a climate of fear and international insecurity that \n        affects all people.\n            (2) Torture is the strategic use of pain to destroy both \n        individuals and society. The effects of torture are long term. \n        Those effects can last a lifetime for the survivors and affect \n        future generations.\n            (3) By eliminating leadership of their opposition and \n        frightening the general public, repressive governments use \n        torture as a weapon against democracy.\n            (4) Torture victims remain under physical and psychological \n        threats, especially in communities where the perpetrators are \n        not brought to justice. In many nations, even those who treat \n        torture victims are threatened with reprisals, including \n        torture, for carrying out their ethical duties to provide care. \n        Both the survivors of torture and their treatment providers \n        deserve, and often require, protection from further repression.\n            (5) A significant number of refugees and asylees entering \n        the United States have been victims of governmental torture. \n        Those claiming asylum deserve prompt consideration of the \n        applications for political asylum to minimize their insecurity \n        and sense of danger. Many torture survivors now live in the \n        United States. They should be provided with the rehabilitation \n        services which would enable them to become productive members \n        of our communities.\n            (6) Building democratic cultures requires not only legal \n        and political institution-building, but also addressing the \n        physical, psychological, and spiritual damage of repression, in \n        order to foster a climate and opportunity of healing for the \n        victims and for society.\n            (7) The development of a treatment movement for torture \n        survivors has created new opportunities for action by the \n        United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored acts \n        of torture.\n            (8) There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect \n        and support torture victims and their treatment providers as \n        part of the overall objective of eliminating torture.\n            (9) By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect \n        their families, the United States can move to defeat the \n        actions of torturers.\n            (10) The United States has ratified the Convention Against \n        Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or \n        Punishment, but has not implemented all provisions of the \n        convention.\n\nSEC. 3.

It does not include pain or \nsuffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to lawful \nsanctions.\n    (c) Substantial Grounds for Believing.--As used in this Act, the \nterm ``substantial grounds for believing'' means substantial evidence.\n    (d) In Danger of Being Subjected to Torture.--As used in this Act, \nthe term ``in danger of being subjected to torture'' means \ncircumstances in which a reasonable person would fear subjection to \ntorture.\n    (e) Involuntary Return.--As used in this Act, the term \n``involuntary return'' means to take action by which it is reasonably \nforeseeable that a person will be required to return to a country \nwithout the person's consent, regardless of whether such return is \ninduced by physical force and regardless of whether the person is \nphysically present in the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. UNITED STATES POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THE INVOLUNTARY RETURN OF \n              PERSONS SUBJECTED TO TORTURE.\n\n    The United States shall not expel, extradite, or otherwise \ninvoluntarily return a person to a country in which there are \nsubstantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of \nbeing subjected to torture.\n\nSEC. 5.
