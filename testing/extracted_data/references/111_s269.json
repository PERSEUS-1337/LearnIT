    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Retooling America's Workers for a \nGreen Economy Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In October 2008, the numbers of mass layoffs (involving \n        over 50 workers at one time) and initial unemployment claims \n        reached their highest levels since 2001. According to the \n        National Renewable Energy Laboratory, however, a major barrier \n        to more rapid adoption of clean and renewable energy and energy \n        efficiency measures is the lack of sufficient workers skilled \n        in green technology.\n            (2) In December 2008, unemployment figures showed a sharp \n        deterioration in the economy. The unemployment rate rose from \n        6.8 percent in November, to 7.2 percent in December, of 2008. \n        Employers shed 524,000 jobs in December 2008, and 1,900,000 \n        jobs were lost over just the last 4 months of 2008. These job \n        losses were widespread across most major industry sectors.\n            (3) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 11,100,000 \n        people were unemployed in December 2008, an increase of \n        3,600,000 people since the recession started in December 2007. \n        In December 2008, the number of workers who wanted to work \n        full-time but worked part-time because their hours were cut or \n        they could not find full-time jobs reached 8,000,000, up \n        3,400,000 since December 2007.\n            (4) Analysts say that the Nation has yet to see the worst \n        of the economic fallout. The latest prediction from HIS Global \n        Insight forecasts that unemployment will be an estimated 8.6 \n        percent by the end of 2009.\n            (5) The reality of climate change and a shared desire to \n        protect the environment for future generations have the \n        potential to spur economic growth in green-collar jobs across \n        the industrial spectrum. In order to prepare United States \n        workers to build greener communities in both urban and rural \n        settings, the Nation will need to make an investment in skills \n        development for jobs in the current and future economies.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to retool America's workers--including \ndislocated workers, those who are long-term unemployed individuals, and \nthose who are low-skilled individuals, limited English proficient \nindividuals, individuals with disabilities, or older workers--for \ngreen-collar industries, for existing viable industries, and for new \nand emerging industries so that the workers described in this section \ncan contribute to the long-term competitiveness of the United States \nand its quality of life.\n\nSEC. 4.
