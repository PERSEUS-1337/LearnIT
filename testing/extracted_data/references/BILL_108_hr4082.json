FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Cesar E. Chavez was born March 31, 1927, on a small \n        farm near Yuma, Arizona, and died on April 23, 1993.\n            (2) Numerous holidays, schools, parks, libraries, and other \n        structures and events have been named after Cesar E. Chavez, in \n        the United States and internationally, with many more planned.\n            (3) Cesar E. Chavez was a recipient of the Martin Luther \n        King Jr. Peace Prize during his lifetime and was awarded the \n        Presidential Medal of Freedom on August 8, 1994.\n            (4) Cesar E. Chavez was the grandson of a Mexican immigrant \n        and settler and grew up working with migrant farm workers, \n        picking grapes, melons, beans, and other crops at low wages and \n        for long hours, during which time he developed a strong work \n        ethic and respect for the farm workers his father called ``the \n        children of God''.\n            (5) At the age of 18, Cesar E. Chavez entered the United \n        States Navy and served his country with distinction for 2 \n        years.\n            (6) As early as 1949, Cesar E. Chavez committed himself to \n        organizing farm workers to campaign for safe and fair working \n        conditions, reasonable wages, decent housing, and the outlawing \n        of child labor.\n            (7) In 1962, Cesar E. Chavez founded the National Farm \n        Workers Association, predecessor of the United Farm Workers of \n        America, which brought hope to farm workers that they might one \n        day realize the basic protections and workers' rights to which \n        all Americans aspire.\n            (8) Through his commitment to nonviolence, Cesar E. Chavez \n        brought dignity and respect to the farm workers who organized \n        themselves, and became an inspiration and a resource to other \n        Americans and people engaged in human rights struggles \n        throughout the world.\n            (9) Cesar E. Chavez's fasts and strikes gained national \n        attention and made people aware of the struggle of farm workers \n        for better pay and safer working conditions.\n            (10) Cesar E. Chavez was an advocate for nonviolence at a \n        time when violence penetrated every level of our society; he \n        used boycotts, pickets, strikes, and fasts to achieve his goals \n        and went to jail for refusing to stop his boycott against \n        lettuce growers.\n            (11) Despite the killings and beatings of many workers, \n        Chavez never wavered in his commitment to nonviolence.\n            (12) Cesar E. Chavez and his family also dedicated \n        themselves to the education of farm workers' children through \n        migrant schools, and many of these children graduated and \n        worked as teachers, doctors, or nurses or in other professional \n        occupations.\n            (13) The legacy of Cesar E. Chavez includes healthy working \n        conditions that yield uncontaminated food for America's tables.\n            (14) Cesar E. Chavez's influence extends far beyond \n        agriculture and provides inspiration for those working to \n        better human rights through his example of organizing voter \n        registration drives in urban and farm areas, initiating \n        complaints against mistreatment by police and welfare \n        officials, and empowering workers to seek advancement in \n        education and politics.\n            (15) Cesar E. Chavez lived alongside his campesino brothers \n        and sisters in humble surroundings.\n            (16) Upon his death in 1993, Cesar E. Chavez was laid to \n        rest where he lived and worked for 23 years on the grounds of \n        the headquarters of the United Farm Workers of America, known \n        as Nuestra Senora de La Paz (Our Lady of Peace), located in the \n        Tehachapi Mountains at Keene, California.\n            (17) With faith, discipline, soft-spoken humility, and \n        amazing inner strength, Cesar E. Chavez led a very courageous \n        life.\n            (18) Cesar E. Chavez' words will always ring true in our \n        country: Si se puede! Yes, we can!\n\nSEC. 3.
