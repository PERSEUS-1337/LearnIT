FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The last national resource assessment of geothermal \n        energy resource sites in the United States was completed in \n        1978. There have been substantial changes in technology and \n        advances in geological science in the intervening 26 years.\n            (2) Many Federal land management agencies, including the \n        Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, are not aware \n        of geothermal energy resources and fail to recognize geothermal \n        energy resources in their land use planning process. Failure to \n        recognize geothermal energy resources during the land use \n        planning process poses significant delays in geothermal \n        resource development.\n            (3) The Bureau of Land Management has a backlog of 230 \n        lease applications for prospecting for geothermal energy. The \n        average age of these lease applications is 9 years. The oldest \n        non-competitive application was received in 1974.\n            (4) There appears to be a lack of focus and priority in the \n        Bureau of Land Management concerning geothermal energy efforts.\n            (5) Development of geothermal energy resources is \n        environmentally safe and clean.\n\nSEC. 3. ASSESSMENT OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY RESOURCES.\n\n    (a) Resource Assessment.--Not later than 3 months after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter, the Secretary of \nEnergy shall review the available assessments of geothermal energy \nresources available within the United States and undertake new \nassessments as necessary, taking into account changes in market \nconditions, available technologies, and other relevant factors.\n    (b) Contents of Reports.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter, the Secretary \nshall publish a report based on the assessment under subsection (a). \nThe report shall contain a detailed inventory describing the available \namount and characteristics of the geothermal energy resources, \nincluding--\n            (1) descriptions of surrounding terrain, population and \n        load centers, nearby energy infrastructure, location of energy \n        and water resources, and available estimates of the costs \n        needed to develop each resource;\n            (2) an identification of any barriers to providing adequate \n        transmission for remote sources of geothermal energy resources \n        to current and emerging markets;\n            (3) recommendations for removing or addressing such \n        barriers; and\n            (4) ways to provide access to the grid that do not unfairly \n        disadvantage renewable or other energy producers.\n    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this section \nthere is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior \n$5,000,000 for fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008.\n\nSEC. 4. ENHANCED ACCESS TO FEDERAL LANDS FOR GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE \n              DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    (a) Revision of Land Use Plans.--\n            (1) Public lands.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n        expedite development of geothermal energy in making revisions \n        to land use plans under section 202 of the Federal Land Policy \n        and Management Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 1712) while protecting \n        other resources.\n            (2) National forest system lands.--The Secretary of \n        Agriculture shall expedite development of geothermal energy in \n        making revisions of land and resource management plans under \n        section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources \n        Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604) while protecting other \n        resources.\n            (3) Issuance of rights-of-way not affected.--Nothing in \n        this subsection shall preclude the issuance of a right-of-way \n        for the development of a geothermal energy project prior to the \n        revision of a land use plan by the appropriate land management \n        agency.\n    (b) Report to Congress.--Within 24 months after the date of the \nenactment of this section, the Secretary of the Interior shall develop \nand report to the Congress recommendations on any statutory or \nregulatory changes the Secretary believes would assist in the \ndevelopment of geothermal energy on Federal land. The report shall \ninclude--\n            (1) a 5-year plan developed by the Secretary of the \n        Interior, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, for \n        encouraging the development of geothermal energy on Federal \n        land in an environmentally sound manner;\n            (2) an analysis of--\n                    (A) whether the use of rights-of-ways is the best \n                means of authorizing use of Federal land for the \n                development of geothermal energy, or whether such \n                resources could be better developed through a leasing \n                system or other method;\n                    (B) the desirability of grants, loans, tax credits, \n                or other provisions to promote geothermal energy \n                development on Federal land; and\n                    (C) any problems, including environmental concerns, \n                that the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of \n                Agriculture has encountered in managing geothermal \n                energy projects on Federal land, or believe are likely \n                to arise in relation to the development of geothermal \n                energy on Federal land; and\n            (3) a list, developed in consultation with the Secretaries \n        of Energy and Defense, of lands under the jurisdiction of the \n        Departments of Energy and Defense, respectively, that would be \n        suitable for development for geothermal energy, and recommended \n        statutory and regulatory mechanisms for such development.\n\nSEC. 5.
