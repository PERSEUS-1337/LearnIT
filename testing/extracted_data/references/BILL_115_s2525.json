FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Leading legal scholars concur that conflicts between \n        same-sex marriage and religious liberty are real and should be \n        addressed through legislation.\n            (2) As President Obama stated in response to the decision \n        of the Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. \n        2675 (2013), ``Americans hold a wide range of views'' on the \n        issue of same-sex marriage, and ``maintaining our Nation's \n        commitment to religious freedom'' is ``vital''.\n            (3) Nevertheless, in 2015, when asked whether a religious \n        school could lose its tax-exempt status for opposing same-sex \n        marriage, the Solicitor General of the United States Donald \n        Verrilli represented to the United States Supreme Court that \n        ``[i]t's certainly going to be an issue''.\n            (4) Protecting religious freedom from government intrusion \n        is a government interest of the highest order. Legislation \n        advances this interest by remedying, deterring, and preventing \n        government interference with religious exercise in a way that \n        complements the protections mandated by the First Amendment to \n        the Constitution of the United States.\n            (5) Laws that protect the free exercise of religious \n        beliefs and moral convictions about marriage will encourage \n        private citizens and institutions to demonstrate tolerance for \n        those beliefs and convictions and therefore contribute to a \n        more respectful, diverse, and peaceful society.\n            (6) In a pluralistic society, in which people of good faith \n        hold more than one view of marriage, it is possible for the \n        government to recognize same-sex marriage as required by the \n        United States Supreme Court without forcing persons with \n        sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions to the \n        contrary to conform.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND MORAL \n              CONVICTIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nFederal Government shall not take any discriminatory action against a \nperson, wholly or partially on the basis that such person speaks, or \nacts, in accordance with a sincerely held religious belief, or moral \nconviction, that--\n            (1) marriage is or should be recognized as a union of--\n                    (A) one man and one woman; or\n                    (B) two individuals as recognized under Federal \n                law; or\n            (2) sexual relations outside marriage are improper.\n    (b) Discriminatory Action Defined.--As used in subsection (a), a \ndiscriminatory action means any action taken by the Federal Government \nto--\n            (1) alter in any way the Federal tax treatment of, or cause \n        any tax, penalty, or payment to be assessed against, or deny, \n        delay, or revoke an exemption from taxation under section \n        501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of, any person \n        referred to in subsection (a);\n            (2) disallow a deduction for Federal tax purposes of any \n        charitable contribution made to or by such person;\n            (3) withhold, reduce the amount or funding for, exclude, \n        terminate, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, any Federal \n        grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, guarantee, \n        loan, scholarship, license, certification, accreditation, \n        employment, or other similar position or status from or to such \n        person;\n            (4) withhold, reduce, exclude, terminate, or otherwise make \n        unavailable or deny, any entitlement or benefit under a Federal \n        benefit program, including admission to, equal treatment in, or \n        eligibility for a degree from an educational program, from or \n        to such person; or\n            (5) withhold, reduce, exclude, terminate, or otherwise make \n        unavailable or deny, access or an entitlement to Federal \n        property, facilities, educational institutions, speech fora \n        (including traditional, limited, and nonpublic fora), or \n        charitable fundraising campaigns from or to such person.\n    (c) Accreditation; Licensure; Certification.--The Federal \nGovernment shall consider accredited, licensed, or certified for \npurposes of Federal law any person that would be accredited, licensed, \nor certified, respectively, for such purposes but for a determination \nagainst such person wholly or partially on the basis that the person \nspeaks, or acts, in accordance with a sincerely held religious belief \nor moral conviction described in subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4.
