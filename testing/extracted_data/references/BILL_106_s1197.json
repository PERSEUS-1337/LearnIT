FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) An estimated 2,000,000 dogs and cats are slaughtered \n        and sold annually as part of the international fur trade. \n        Internationally, dog and cat fur is used in a wide variety of \n        products, including fur coats and jackets, fur-trimmed \n        garments, hats, gloves, decorative accessories, stuffed \n        animals, and other toys.\n            (2) As demonstrated by forensic tests, dog and cat fur \n        products are being imported into the United States, in some \n        cases with deceptive labeling to conceal the use of dog or cat \n        fur.\n            (3) Dog and cat fur, when dyed, is not easily \n        distinguishable to persons who are not experts from other furs \n        such as fox, rabbit, coyote, wolf, and mink. Dog and cat fur is \n        generally less expensive than other types of fur and may be \n        used as a substitute for more expensive types of furs.\n            (4) Foreign fur producers use dogs and cats bred for their \n        fur, and also use strays and stolen pets.\n            (5) The methods of housing, transporting, and slaughtering \n        dogs and cats for fur production are generally unregulated and \n        inhumane.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to prohibit the sale, manufacture, offer for sale, \n        transportation, and distribution in the United States of dog \n        and cat fur products;\n            (2) to require accurate labeling of fur species so that \n        consumers in the United States can make informed choices; and\n            (3) to prohibit the trade in, both imports and exports of, \n        dog and cat fur products, to ensure that the United States \n        market does not encourage the slaughter of dogs or cats for \n        their fur, and to ensure that the purposes of this Act are not \n        undermined.\n\nSEC. 3.
