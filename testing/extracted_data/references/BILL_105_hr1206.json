FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds:\n            (1) Nationwide, older abandoned or under-used commercial \n        and industrial sites known as brownfields are often overlooked \n        for redevelopment because of real or perceived contamination \n        from past commercial or industrial activities.\n            (2) Reuse of these sites often requires site assessment and \n        cleanup, adding costs and uncertainties to the redevelopment \n        process, and prompting many developers to pursue cheaper, less \n        complicated development options on undeveloped sites.\n            (3) Industrialized metropolitan areas and small towns alike \n        are affected adversely by these competing pressures, as loss of \n        tax revenues and job opportunities for community residents lead \n        to a deterioration of the urban environment, including the \n        presence of unremediated environmental contamination.\n            (4) States have created remedial action programs to allow a \n        person to respond voluntarily to a release or suspected release \n        of hazardous substances at low and medium priority facilities. \n        Such programs have flourished due to the States' ability to \n        streamline duplicative State and Federal regulatory \n        requirements and affect a timely, cost-effective, and \n        environmentally protective cleanup of sites.\n            (5) The benefits of State voluntary cleanup programs would \n        be significantly enhanced in the context of a Federal system \n        that encourages Federal-State partnerships, provides legal \n        finality to the cleanup process, and removes Federal \n        requirements for certain procedural permits for cleanups \n        conducted under certified State voluntary cleanup programs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure the quality of \nState brownfield cleanup and redevelopment efforts by establishing \nFederal criteria for State voluntary cleanup programs and to provide \ncertainty by removing the cleanup of eligible brownfield facilities and \nproperties remediated through certified State voluntary cleanup \nprograms from coverage under certain other Federal laws.\n\nSEC. 3. CERTIFICATION OF STATE VOLUNTARY CLEANUP PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the \n``Administrator'') shall establish, and publish in the Federal \nRegister, certification criteria under subsection (d) for State \nprograms for the voluntary cleanup of eligible facilities. If a State \nmeets the criteria for certification, the Administrator shall certify \nthe State to carry out the cleanup program in such State at \neligible Facilities in lieu of any Federal program that addresses the \ncleanup of such facilities under the Comprehensive Environmental \nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act.\n    (b) Certification of State Programs.--The Administrator shall \ncertify a State program for the voluntary cleanup of eligible \nfacilities within 120 days after the Administrator receives adequate \ndocumentation from the State indicating that the State program meets \nthe certification criteria established under subsection (d).\n    (c) Federal-State Cooperation and State Certification.--The \nAdministrator shall cooperate with the State to ensure that State \nprograms continue to meet the terms of the certification issued \npursuant to subsection (b). The Administrator shall convene annual \nmeetings to discuss the status of the State program and to encourage \ncontinuing dialogue. The Administrator shall notify the State of any \nfailure of the State program to continue to meet the certification \ncriteria established under subsection (d) and shall assist the State in \nremedying such deficiency. If any such deficiency is substantial and is \nnot remedied in a timely manner, the Administrator may withdraw the \ncertification. Withdrawal of certification shall not affect any cleanup \ncompleted and approved by the State as of the date of such withdrawal.\n    (d) Certification Criteria.--In order for a State voluntary cleanup \nprogram to be certified under this section, the program shall meet each \nof the following criteria:\n            (1) The program shall provide that only eligible \n        facilities, as described in subsection (d), may participate in \n        the program.\n            (2) The program shall provide adequate opportunities for \n        meaningful public participation in the development and \n        implementation of cleanup plans for eligible facilities. Public \n        participation requirements shall include, but not be limited \n        to, providing opportunity for affected parties to review and \n        comment on cleanup documents and plans, and providing \n        opportunity for public input to the remedy selection process. \n        Affected parties shall include, but not be limited to, local \n        work force representatives, adjacent community residents, and \n        local environmental and health officials and other public \n        interest organizations.\n            (3) The program shall ensure that technical assistance is \n        available throughout each voluntary cleanup.\n            (4) The program shall ensure that adequate resources are \n        available to carry out cleanup under the program and to \n        administer the program.\n            (5) The program shall ensure adequate oversight and \n        enforcement authority.\n            (6) The program shall provide for a certification from the \n        State to the owner or prospective purchaser of an eligible \n        facility that the cleanup is complete.\n    (e) Eligible Facilities.--For purposes of this Act, the term \n``eligible facility'' means a facility or property that is a low- or \nmedium-priority environmental hazard for the State, but whose \nenvironmental contamination is thought to be preventing the timely use, \nredevelopment, or reuse of the facility or property, and is thought to \nbe limited in scope and readily assessable, except that such term shall \nnot include any of the following:\n            (1) A facility for which an abatement action has been taken \n        or is scheduled to be taken under section 106 of the \n        Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n        Liability Act of 1980 or for which an action has been taken or \n        is scheduled to be taken under section 7003 of the Solid Waste \n        Disposal Act.\n            (2) A facility that is the subject of a Federal response \n        action under section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental \n        Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. \n        9601 et seq.).\n            (3) A facility included on the National Priorities List or \n        proposed for inclusion and for which documentation for listing \n        has been prepared by the State or the Administrator.\n            (4) A facility required to have a permit under section 3005 \n        of the Solid Waste Disposal Act that does not have a permit \n        under that section and does not qualify for authorization to \n        operate in interim status under subsection (e) of that section.\n            (5) A land disposal unit with respect to which a closure \n        requirement under subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.) is submitted and closure requirements \n        are specified in a closure plan or permit.\n            (6) A facility that is the subject of a corrective action \n        under section 3004(u) or 3008(h) of the Solid Waste Disposal \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 5924(u) or 6928(h)) that has been evaluated as \n        high priority under the Environmental Protection Agency's \n        National Corrective Action Priority System as set forth in \n        regulations under subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n            (7) A facility at which assistance for response activities \n        may be obtained pursuant to subtitle I of the Solid Waste \n        Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq.) from the Leaking \n        Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund established under section \n        9508 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n            (8) A facility owned or operated by a department, agency, \n        or instrumentality of the United States.\n    (f) Relationship to Permit Requirements.--For any cleanup conducted \nunder a State voluntary cleanup program certified under this section, \nif the cleanup is carried out in compliance with the certified program \nthe State may modify any procedural permit requirement in order to \nexpedite the cleanup.\n\nSEC. 4.
