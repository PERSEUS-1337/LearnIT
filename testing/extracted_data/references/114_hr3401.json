    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Stopping Over-Criminalization Act of \n2015''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to reduce the size, scope and complexity \nof the Federal criminal code. In order to ensure that honest mistakes \nby individuals who are not morally blameworthy do not result in \ncriminal charges, the Act establishes a default criminal state of mind \nrequirement for all Federal criminal offenses, and allows a mistake of \nlaw defense for situations in which the defendant did not know, and a \nreasonable person would not have known, that the action was a crime. \nCurrently, Federal crimes, including executive rules that carry \ncriminal penalties are scattered throughout the Federal code and \nregister. To enable all Americans to access and view Federal crimes, \nthe Act requires the creation of a Federal inventory that lists all \nFederal criminal offenses, including agency rules that define criminal \noffenses. To uphold the role of Congress in defining what constitutes a \nFederal crime, the Act holds that no rule of the executive branch \ndefining or establishing a criminal offense shall have force or effect \nunless approved by both branches of Congress.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF DEFAULT MENS REA FOR FEDERAL OFFENSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 1 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 28. Default mens rea requirement\n    ``(a) Knowing State of Mind Generally Required.--For the purposes \nof a Federal offense, unless otherwise specifically provided in the \nprovision of law defining the offense, the state of mind required for a \nconviction is knowing as to each element of the offense.\n    ``(b) Special Rule for Regulatory and Similar Offenses.--In \naddition, in the case of an offense, such as a regulatory offense, \nwhere a defendant might reasonably be unaware the conduct could be \ncriminally punished, the Government must prove the defendant had reason \nto know the defendant's conduct was unlawful.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of \nchapter 1 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the \nend the following new item:\n\n``28.
