FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in order to lessen United States dependence on foreign \n        sources of petroleum, and decrease demand for petroleum in the \n        transportation sector, the Nation must diversify its fuel \n        supply to include domestically produced biofuels including \n        hydrogen;\n            (2) while ethanol has been successful in the market place \n        as a fuel additive, newer biofuels may present unique \n        challenges that may render the fuels incompatible with the \n        current fuel transportation and delivery infrastructure, \n        placing the burden of costly refurbishment and construction on \n        fuel distributors and retailers;\n            (3) chemical additives to the fuels may mitigate the \n        negative impacts of some biofuels on existing infrastructure \n        and preclude costly retrofitting or installation of new biofuel \n        compatible infrastructure and transportation systems;\n            (4) in order to mitigate air pollution and comply with \n        Federal mandates, Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel fuel was introduced \n        into the marketplace in 2006;\n            (5) fuel labeled Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel may accumulate \n        more than the statutory limit of 15 parts per million of sulfur \n        when transported through multiple pipelines, tanks, and trucks \n        to the final point of sale;\n            (6) fuel distributors and retailers may inadvertently take \n        delivery of fuel labeled Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel with more than \n        15 parts per million of sulfur without a practical means of \n        verifying sulfur content; and\n            (7) fuel distributors and retailers may transform their \n        business by dispensing hydrogen, reformed on site from various \n        feedstocks, or delivered by pipeline or tube trucks, resulting \n        in new storage, handling, and equipment challenges.\n\nSEC. 3. BIOFUEL INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADDITIVES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    The Assistant Administrator of the Office of Research and \nDevelopment of the Environmental Protection Agency (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Assistant Administrator''), in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, shall carry out a program of research and development of \nmaterials to be added to biofuels to make them more compatible with \nexisting infrastructure used to store and deliver petroleum-based fuels \nto the point of final sale. The Assistant Administrator is encouraged \nto utilize Land Grant Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and other minority-serving \ninstitutions among other resources to undertake research for this \nprogram. The program shall address--\n            (1) materials to prevent or mitigate--\n                    (A) corrosion of metal, plastic, rubber, cork, \n                fiberglass, glues, or any other material used in pipes \n                and storage tanks;\n                    (B) dissolving of storage tank sediments;\n                    (C) clogging of filters;\n                    (D) contamination from water or other adulterants \n                or pollutants;\n                    (E) poor flow properties related to low \n                temperatures;\n                    (F) oxidative and thermal instability in long-term \n                storage and use;\n                    (G) microbial contamination; and\n                    (H) problems associated with electrical \n                conductivity;\n            (2) alternatives to conventional methods for refurbishment \n        and cleaning of gasoline and diesel tanks, including tank \n        lining applications;\n            (3) strategies to minimize emissions from infrastructure;\n            (4) issues with respect to certification by a nationally \n        recognized testing laboratory of components for fuel dispensing \n        devises that specifically reference compatibility with alcohol \n        blended and other biofuels that contain greater than 15 percent \n        alcohol;\n            (5) challenges for design, reforming, storage, handling, \n        and dispensing hydrogen fuel from various feedstocks, including \n        biomass, from neighborhood fueling stations, including codes \n        and standards development necessary beyond that carried out \n        under section 809 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. \n        16158);\n            (6) issues with respect to where in the fuel supply chain \n        additives optimally should be added to fuels; and\n            (7) other problems as identified by the Assistant \n        Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and \n        the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nSEC. 4. SULFUR TESTING FOR DIESEL FUELS.\n\n    (a) Program.--The Assistant Administrator, in consultation with the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, shall carry out a \nresearch, development, and demonstration program on portable, low-cost, \nand accurate methods and technologies for testing of sulfur content in \nfuel, including Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel and Low Sulfur Diesel.\n    (b) Schedule of Demonstrations.--Not later than 1 year after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, the Assistant Administrator shall begin \ndemonstrations of technologies under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 5. STANDARD REFERENCE MATERIALS AND DATA BASE DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology shall develop a \nphysical properties data base and standard reference materials for \nbiofuels. Such data base and standard reference materials shall be \nmaintained and updated as appropriate as additional biofuels become \navailable.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS SUBJECT TO PAY AS YOU GO.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Environmental \nProtection Agency $10,000,000 for carrying out this Act, to be derived \nfrom amounts otherwise appropriated to the Environmental Protection \nAgency for energy research, development, and demonstration activities \nrelated to fuels or environmental research and development activities \nrelated to fuels.\n\nSEC. 7. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    Not later than 1 year after the establishment of the program under \nthis Act, the Secretary of Energy shall transmit a report to Congress \ncontaining suggestions for any Federal incentives that could help such \nprogram be more successful.\n\nSEC. 8. ADDITIONAL FINDING.\n\n    The Congress also finds that in order to lessen United States \ndependence on foreign sources of petroleum, and decrease demand for \npetroleum in aircraft, such as passenger planes with 42 business class \nseats capable of transcontinental flights, the Nation must diversify \nits fuel supply for aircraft to include domestically produced \nalternative fuels.\n\nSEC. 9. ADDITIONAL ISSUES.\n\n    Research and development under this Act shall address issues with \nrespect to increased volatile emissions or increased nitrogen oxide \nemissions.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives February 8, 2007.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
