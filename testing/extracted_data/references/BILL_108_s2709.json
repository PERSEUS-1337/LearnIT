FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the forest land derived from the public domain should \n        be maintained in appropriate forest cover with species of \n        trees, degree of stocking, rate of growth, and conditions of \n        stand designed to secure the maximum benefits of multiple use \n        sustained yield management;\n            (2) recent intense or stand replacing wildfires and other \n        natural disasters, including drought and insect infestations, \n        have destroyed forest ecosystems and eliminated sources of tree \n        seed for desired species, which has delayed or precluded the \n        reestablishment of appropriate forest cover on millions of \n        acres of forest land derived from the public domain;\n            (3) reforestation treatments on forest land derived from \n        the public domain after a wildfire or nonfire natural \n        disturbance event restore appropriate forest cover, which \n        provides multiple renewable resource benefits, including--\n                    (A) protecting soil and water resources;\n                    (B) providing habitat for wildlife and fish \n                populations;\n                    (C) contributing to aesthetics;\n                    (D) enhancing the recreational experience;\n                    (E) providing a source of wood fiber for domestic \n                use; and\n                    (F) ensuring the health and resiliency of affected \n                ecosystems for present and future generations;\n            (4) post-fire and natural disaster reforestation needs \n        should be accomplished quickly and in accordance with \n        applicable forest land management plans to achieve desired \n        forest conditions at the least cost to other renewable \n        resources values, such as--\n                    (A) the loss of wildlife habitat;\n                    (B) soil erosion; and\n                    (C) water quality degradation;\n            (5) greater resources are needed to meet reforestation \n        needs on forest land derived from the public domain because \n        of--\n                    (A) damage from wildfire, disease, and insect \n                infestation; and\n                    (B) declining revenues; and\n            (6) reforestation needs represent over 5 years of \n        reforestation work at current levels of reforestation, with a \n        backlog of needs accumulating each year.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) provide increased funding for the reforestation of \n        appropriate forest cover on forest land derived from the public \n        domain; and\n            (2) promote timely reforestation treatment.\n\nSEC. 3. TRANSFERS TO TRUST FUND.\n\n     Section 303(b)(2) of Public Law 96-451 (16 U.S.C. 1606a(b)(2)) is \namended by striking ``$30,000,000'' and inserting ``$90,000,000''.\n\nSEC. 4.
