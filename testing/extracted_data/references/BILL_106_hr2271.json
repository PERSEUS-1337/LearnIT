FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro (the Royal Road of the \n        Interior), served as the primary route between the colonial \n        Spanish capital of Mexico City and the Spanish provincial \n        capitals at San Juan de Los Caballeros (1598-1600), San Gabriel \n        (1600-1609) and then Santa Fe (1610-1821).\n            (2) The portion of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro that \n        resided in what is now the United States extended between El \n        Paso, Texas and present San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico, a distance \n        of 404 miles;\n            (3) El Camino Real is a symbol of the cultural interaction \n        between nations and ethnic groups and of the commercial \n        exchange that made possible the development and growth of the \n        borderland;\n            (4) American Indian groups, especially the Pueblo Indians \n        of the Rio Grande, developed trails for trade long before \n        Europeans arrived;\n            (5) In 1598, Juan de Onate led a Spanish military \n        expedition along those trails to establish the northern portion \n        of El Camino Real;\n            (6) During the Mexican National Period and part of the U.S. \n        Territorial Period, El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro \n        facilitated the emigration of people to New Mexico and other \n        areas that would become the United States;\n            (7) The exploration, conquest, colonization, settlement, \n        religious conversion, and military occupation of a large area \n        of the borderlands was made possible by this route, whose \n        historical period extended from 1598 to 1882;\n            (8) American Indians, European emigrants, miners, ranchers, \n        soldiers, and missionaries used El Camino Real during the \n        historic development of the borderlands. These travelers \n        promoted cultural interaction among Spaniards, other Europeans, \n        American Indians, Mexicans, and Americans;\n            (9) El Camino Real fostered the spread of Catholicism, \n        mining, an extensive network of commerce, and ethnic and \n        cultural traditions including music, folklore, medicine, foods, \n        architecture, language, place names, irrigation systems, and \n        Spanish law.\n\nSEC. 3.
