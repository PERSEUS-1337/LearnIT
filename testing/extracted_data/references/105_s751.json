FINDINGS; POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) fishing is an important and traditional recreational \n        activity in which 36,000,000 Americans 16 years old and older \n        participate;\n            (2) hunting is an important and traditional recreational \n        activity in which 14,000,000 Americans 16 years old and older \n        participate;\n            (3) survey data from a recent comprehensive 3-year study \n        entitled ``Factors Related to Hunting and Fishing Participation \n        in the United States'' suggest that 95 percent of Americans \n        approve of fishing and 81 percent of Americans approve of \n        hunting;\n            (4) anglers and hunters have been and continue to be among \n        the foremost supporters of sound wildlife management and \n        conservation practices in the United States;\n            (5) persons who hunt or fish and organizations related to \n        those activities provide direct assistance and support to \n        wildlife managers and enforcement officers of Federal, State, \n        and local governments;\n            (6) funds raised through license, permit, and stamp \n        purchases as well as through excise taxes on goods used by \n        anglers and hunters have generated more than $6,000,000,000 for \n        wildlife research and management;\n            (7) fishing and hunting are essential components of \n        effective wildlife management in that they tend to reduce \n        conflicts between people and wildlife and provide incentives \n        for the conservation of wildlife and the habitats and \n        ecosystems on which wildlife depends; and\n            (8) each State--\n                    (A) has established 1 or more agencies staffed by \n                professionally trained fish and wildlife management \n                personnel;\n                    (B) has legal authority to manage the fish and \n                wildlife found within the State; and\n                    (C) carries out sound programs of fish and wildlife \n                management.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that, in \nperforming duties under Federal law, each Federal agency that has \nauthority to manage a natural resource, or the land and water on which \na natural resource depends, shall exercise the authority in a manner so \nas to support, promote, and enhance fishing and hunting and \nopportunities for fishing and hunting.\n\nSEC. 3.
