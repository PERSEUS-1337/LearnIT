CONDITIONS FOR COMPELLED DISCLOSURE.\n\n    (a) Conditions for Compelled Disclosure.--A Federal entity may not \ncompel a covered person to testify or produce any document in any \nproceeding or in connection with any issue arising under Federal law \nunless a court determines by clear and convincing evidence, after \nproviding notice and an opportunity to be heard to the covered person--\n            (1) that the party seeking to compel production of such \n        testimony or document has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain \n        such testimony or document from all persons from which such \n        testimony or document could reasonably be obtained other than a \n        covered person;\n            (2) that--\n                    (A) in a criminal investigation or prosecution, \n                based on information obtained from a person other than \n                a covered person--\n                            (i) there are reasonable grounds to believe \n                        that a crime has occurred; and\n                            (ii) the testimony or document sought is \n                        essential to the investigation, prosecution, or \n                        defense; or\n                    (B) in a matter other than a criminal investigation \n                or prosecution, based on information obtained from a \n                person other than a covered person, the testimony or \n                document sought is essential to a dispositive issue of \n                substantial importance to that matter; and\n            (3) in any matter in which the testimony or document sought \n        could reveal the identity of a source of information or include \n        any information that could reasonably be expected to lead to \n        the discovery of the identity of such a source, that--\n                    (A) disclosure of the identity of such a source is \n                necessary to prevent imminent and actual harm to \n                national security;\n                    (B) compelled disclosure of the identity of such a \n                source would prevent such harm; and\n                    (C) the harm sought to be redressed by requiring \n                disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in \n                protecting the free flow of information.\n    (b) Limitations on Content of Information.--The content of any \ntestimony or document that is compelled under subsection (a) shall, to \nthe extent possible--\n            (1) be limited to the purpose of verifying published \n        information or describing any surrounding circumstances \n        relevant to the accuracy of such published information; and\n            (2) be narrowly tailored in subject matter and period of \n        time covered.\n\nSEC. 3. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE PERMITTED.\n\n    Notwithstanding any provision of section 2, in any proceeding or in \nconnection with any issue arising under Federal law, a Federal entity \nmay compel a covered person to produce any testimony or document that \nconsists only of commercial or financial information that is not \nrelated to news gathering or the dissemination of news and information \nby the covered person.\n\nSEC. 4. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM THIRD PARTIES.\n\n    (a) Conditions for Compelled Disclosure.--Section 2 shall apply to \nany testimony or document that a third party or a Federal entity seeks \nfrom a communications service provider if such testimony or document \nconsists of any record, information, or other communication that \nrelates to a business transaction between a communications service \nprovider and a covered person.\n    (b) Notice and Opportunity Provided to Covered Persons.--A court \nmay compel the testimony or disclosure of a document under this section \nonly after the party seeking such a document provides the covered \nperson who is a party to the business transaction described in \nsubsection (a)--\n            (1) notice of the subpoena or other compulsory request for \n        such testimony or disclosure from the communications service \n        provider not later than the time at which such subpoena or \n        request is issued to the communications service provider; and\n            (2) an opportunity to be heard before the court before the \n        time at which the testimony or disclosure is compelled.\n    (c) Exception to Notice Requirement.--Notice under subsection \n(b)(1) may be delayed only if the court determines by clear and \nconvincing evidence that such notice would pose a substantial threat to \nthe integrity of a criminal investigation.\n\nSEC. 5.
